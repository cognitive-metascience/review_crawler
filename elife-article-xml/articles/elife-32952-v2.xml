Enzymatic activity of GSK3 is inhibited by N-terminal serine phosphorylation. However, alternate post-translational mechanism(s) responsible for GSK3 inactivation are not characterized. Here, we report that GSK3α and GSK3β are acetylated at Lys246 and Lys183, respectively. Molecular modeling and/or molecular dynamics simulations indicate that acetylation of GSK3 isoforms would hinder both the adenosine binding and prevent stable interactions of the negatively charged phosphates. We found that SIRT2 deacetylates GSK3β, and thus enhances its binding to ATP. Interestingly, the reduced activity of GSK3β is associated with lysine acetylation, but not with phosphorylation at Ser9 in hearts of SIRT2-deficient mice. Moreover, GSK3 is required for the anti-hypertrophic function of SIRT2 in cardiomyocytes. Overall, our study identified lysine acetylation as a novel post-translational modification regulating GSK3 activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Lysine acetylation</kwd><kwd>Sirtuins</kwd><kwd>SIRT2</kwd><kwd>p300</kwd><kwd>GSK3α</kwd><kwd>GSK3β</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BRB/10/1294/2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sundaresan</surname><given-names>Nagalingam R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MED/30/1454/2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sundaresan</surname><given-names>Nagalingam R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IYBA Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sundaresan</surname><given-names>Nagalingam R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ramalingaswami fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sundaresan</surname><given-names>Nagalingam R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001409</institution-id><institution>Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EMR/2014/000065</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sundaresan</surname><given-names>Nagalingam R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001412</institution-id><institution>Council of Scientific and Industrial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>37(1646)/15/EMR-II</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sundaresan</surname><given-names>Nagalingam R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001409</institution-id><institution>Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N-PDF</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maity</surname><given-names>Sangeeta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mass spectroscopy, molecular modeling and/or molecular dynamics simulations reveal how acetylation regulates the activity of GSK3 isoforms independent of inhibitory phosphorylation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a highly conserved, ubiquitously expressing kinase having two isoforms, α and β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Woodgett, 1990</xref>). Both these GSK3 isoforms are encoded by distinct genes, which share 97% amino acid sequence identity within their catalytic domains and differ significantly outside the catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaidanovich-Beilin and Woodgett, 2011</xref>). In cardiomyocytes, GSK3α preferentially localizes inside the nucleus, while GSK3β is present mostly in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matsuda et al., 2008</xref>). Increasing lines of evidence suggest that GSK3α and GSK3β have both common and non-overlapping functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rayasam et al., 2009</xref>). Unlike other kinases, GSK3 requires a primed substrate for its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen and Frame, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doble and Woodgett, 2003</xref>). Activity of GSK3 is carefully regulated by the combination of (a) Tyrosine phosphorylation at catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dajani et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hughes et al., 1993</xref>), (b) N-terminal serine phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cross et al., 1995</xref>) and (c) sub-cellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beurel et al., 2015</xref>). Studies indicate that GSK3 is constitutively phosphorylated (Tyr279-GSK3α and Tyr216-GSK3β) and that tyrosine phosphorylation is necessary for its catalytic activity. Phosphorylation of Tyr279 in GSK3α and Tyr216 in GSK3β has been reported to facilitate GSK3 activity by promoting substrate accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dajani et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hughes et al., 1993</xref>). Interestingly, phosphorylation of GSK3β at Tyr216 occurs through intramolecular autophosphorylation during protein folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cole et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, N-terminal serine phosphorylation of GSK3 that is Ser21- GSK3α and Ser9-GSK3β by several kinases including Akt, protein kinase A, protein kinase C and p90Rsk has been shown to decrease its catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beurel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cross et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Song et al., 2015</xref>). GSK3β is inhibited by N-terminal Ser9 phosphorylation, in which the phosphorylated N terminus binds as a competitive pseudo-substrate with p-Ser9 occupying the p+4 site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dajani et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stamos et al., 2014</xref>). Previous studies have shown that GSK3β-S9A mutation, which prevents the N-terminal Ser9 phosphorylation, causes GSK3β to be constitutively active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">MacAulay et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stambolic and Woodgett, 1994</xref>). GSK3β was also observed to be inhibited by phosphorylation at Ser389 by p38 MAPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thornton et al., 2008</xref>). However, alternate post-translational mechanism(s) responsible for the GSK3 inactivation are not yet characterized.</p><p>Reversible lysine acetylation is known to regulate nuclear and non-nuclear proteins in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Verdin and Ott, 2015</xref>). The acetylation reaction is catalyzed by a group of enzymes called histone acetyltransferases and is reversible by histone deacetylases (HDACs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haberland et al., 2009</xref>). Reversible acetylation has been shown to be responsible for activation/inactivation, sub-cellular localization, DNA binding, protein-protein interaction, membrane trafficking, stability and degradation of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choudhary et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jeffers and Sullivan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang and Seto, 2008</xref>). Acetylation of a protein may enhance or repress its activity, and it has been shown that acetylation competes with phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kouzarides, 2000</xref>), and interferes with other lysine modifications, ubiquitination or sumoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang and Seto, 2008</xref>). HDACs are classified into three distinct groups based on their structure and function (Class I to III) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haigis and Guarente, 2006</xref>). The sirtuins, which are class III HDACs, are catalytically distinct, as they require NAD<sup>+</sup> for their deacetylase activity. In mammals, seven different sirtuin isoforms (SIRT1 to 7), have been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guarente, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Longo and Kennedy, 2006</xref>). SIRT2 is the cytoplasmic deacetylase that affects the microtubule network by deacetylating α-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">North et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, SIRT2 regulates nuclear envelope dynamics, cardiac hypertrophy, metabolism and stress-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Oliveira et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaufmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sarikhani et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sarikhani et al., 2018b</xref>). In neurons, inhibition of SIRT2 salvage α-synuclein toxicity in Parkinson’s disease and reduce sterol-mediated toxicity in Huntington’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Donmez and Outeiro, 2013</xref>). In contrast, SIRT2-deficient mice show increased mammary tumors, hepatocellular carcinoma and heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tang et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, SIRT2 deficiency increases susceptibility to colitis and iron-deficiency-induced hepatocyte cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lo Sasso et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In the present work, we demonstrate that SIRT2 binds to and deacetylates GSK3 isoforms to promote ATP binding. Interestingly, reversible acetylation regulates the activity of GSK3 isoforms independent of its inhibitory phosphorylation. We also demonstrate that activity of GSK3 isoforms are essential for inhibition of cardiac hypertrophy by SIRT2 deacetylase.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Acetyltransferase p300 regulates the GSK3β acetylation</title><p>To test whether GSK3β acetylation plays a role in the development of heart failure, we first created a mice model of cardiac hypertrophy. The cardiac hypertrophic agonist, isoproterenol (ISO) was infused chronically into mice by implanting osmotic mini-pumps in the peritoneal cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sundaresan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sundaresan et al., 2012</xref>). Chronic ISO infusion significantly increased heart weight/tibia length (HW/TL) ratio as well as left ventricular wall thickness, which is an indicator of cardiac hypertrophy, while reducing the ejection fraction of heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>), suggesting that ISO-infusion causes adverse cardiac remodeling and contractile dysfunction in mice. Previous studies indicate that GSK3β activity is reduced in hypertrophic hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sugden et al., 2008</xref>). To test whether GSK3β activity is reduced in our cardiac hypertrophy model, we immunoprecipitated GSK3β from the heart lysates and assessed in vitro activity of GSK3β against the peptide of glycogen synthase (GS). Our results revealed that activity of GSK3β was significantly low in ISO-infused heart samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Moreover, the levels of β-catenin, a GSK3 target transcription factor, which degrade after phosphorylation by GSK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2002</xref>), was high in ISO-infused hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These findings further confirm reduced activity of GSK3β in ISO-infused heart samples. Next, we immunoprecipitated GSK3β from heart lysates and assessed the status of its acetylation and levels of phosphorylation by western blotting. Interestingly, we found markedly increased acetylation of GSK3β in the heart samples of ISO-infused mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). However, we did not see marked changes in Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK3β in the chronic ISO-infused heart samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Our results were consistent with previous observations, where the total protein levels and Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK3β were not changed in the heart after pressure overload or myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhai et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, the GSK3β Ser9 phosphorylation was unchanged in the heart of mice-treated with ISO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). These findings indicate that the reduced activity of GSK3β found in chronic ISO-infused hearts is correlated with increased lysine acetylation, but not with inhibitory Ser nine phosphorylation. Furthermore, we observed reduced levels of Tyr216 phosphorylation of GSK3β in ISO-infused heart samples. The expression levels of SIRT2 also reduced in the ISO-treated heart samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), suggesting that acetylation of GSK3β may be linked to reduced levels of SIRT2 deacetylase.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32952.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Acetylation of GSK3β increased in pathological cardiac hypertrophy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scatter plot showing cardiac hypertrophy, as measured by Heart weight/Tibia Length (HW/TL) ratio of 8 weeks old 129/Sv mice treated with either vehicle or isoproterenol (ISO) at the dose of 10 mg/kg/day.

Our immunoprecipitation experiments showed that p300 binds to GSK3β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Further confocal microscopy analysis indicated that p300 co-localizes with GSK3β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Next, we assessed direct binding of p300 with GSK3β using recombinant purified proteins. Our results indicate that p300 binds to GSK3β directly in an in vitro reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). In the next set of experiments, GSK3β was immunoprecipitated from p300-depleted cells and its acetylation status and activity were analyzed. We found that the depletion of p300 resulted in reduced levels of acetylation, although the effect is not robust, it increased the activity of GSK3β, as suggested by increase in GS phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J–1L</xref>). We believe that GSK3β acetylation may be regulated by multiple acetyltransferases including p300. Interestingly, depletion of p300 markedly increased the phosphorylation of Tyr216, but not Ser9 in GSK3β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). To validate our findings, we performed p300 overexpression experiments in cardiomyocytes. We found significantly increased acetylation of GSK3β, which is associated with reduced activity of GSK3β in p300 overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M, N and O</xref>). Moreover, overexpression of p300 markedly reduced the Tyr216, but not Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK3β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). Next, we tested the enzymatic activity of acetylated GSK3β in vitro and found that p300-mediated acetylation significantly impairs kinase activity of GSK3β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P</xref>). These findings suggest that p300-mediated acetylation might influence the phosphorylation of GSK3β at Tyr216 residue, but not Ser9, to inhibit the enzymatic activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Acetylation of GSK3β influences ATP binding: Insights from molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulation of GSK3β WT and acetylated K183 mutant</title><p>In our previous work, we found that acetylation of GSK3β at K15 promotes mitochondrial localization and is regulated inside the mitochondria by SIRT3 deacetylase. SIRT3-mediated deacetylation of GSK3β regulates the development of organ fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sundaresan et al., 2016</xref>). Since SIRT2 is a cytoplasmic protein, we suspected that SIRT2 might not be regulting K15 acetylation of GSK3β. Therefore, we performed tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis of GSK3β and identified two lysine residues, K150 and K183, as acetylation sites in GSK3β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). While K183 is located in the vicinity of nucleotide-binding pocket of GSK3β, K150 is located on the surface away from both nucleotide-binding pocket as well as substrate-binding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> I-III). Magnesium is an important cofactor that helps in neutralizing the negative charges of the phosphate residues of nucleotide. Interestingly, the side-chain of K183 residue is proximal to the magnesium ion of the adenosine di-phosphate nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). The addition of the acetylated group to the NZ atom of K183 side-chain may result in destabilization of Mg<sup>2+</sup> from ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> II-IV). Overall, in-silico analysis suggests that the acetylation of K183 side-chain may reduce the affinity of adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) nucleotide to the binding pocket by interfering with its magnesium cofactor.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32952.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations of GSK3β wild-type and K183 acetylated mutant.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Annotation of representative tandem mass spectra of trypsin-digested GSK3β, depicting K150 and K183 acetylation.

Initial model for the wild type was generated from the crystal structure of GSK3β (PDB ID 4NMO). For the acK183 mutant, the wild-type model was used as a template to generate in silico acetylation on the K183 residue (further details in Materials and methods). We ran five independent trajectories of 20 ns each totaling to 100 ns for each system. Multiple production runs would provide greater sampling of conformations for each system and further present an opportunity to capture the stochastic events, which otherwise might not be captured in a single long trajectory. Visual analyses of the molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories show drastic fluctuations in the ADP nucleotide with adenosine base completely destabilized in the acK183 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). To quantify these effects, we first performed the root mean square deviation (RMSD) measurements for the Cα backbone atoms of the protein and ADP nucleotide, in both the systems. RMSD plots of the Cα backbone atoms for the five individual trajectories of 20 ns were plotted separately for the wild type and acK183 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and H</xref>). The RMSD deviations were similar for both the plots ranging between 0.1 and 0.35 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and I</xref>). In agreement, we found only moderate changes in the global root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) of all the backbone Cα atoms of the acK183 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, we observed significant variations in the RMSD plots of the ADP nucleotide in the acK183 mutant compared to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and I</xref>). The drastic deviations observed in the RMSD plots of ADP nucleotide in acK183 mutant concurs with the fluctuations seen in the snap-shots of structures during MD simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). For further analysis, we considered two trajectories with stable Cα backbone RMSD’s for each of the wild type (yellow, blue) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and acK183 mutant (red, green) of GSK3β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We plotted time-dependent distance measurements between protein-nucleotide interactions in the binding pocket of GSK3β. We found that acetylation causes increase in distance between the side-chain amine of K85 and the phosphates of ADP nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and J</xref>). Positively charged K85 residue is essential for neutralizing the negative charge of phosphates of nucleotides. The escalation in distances between ADP and K85 suggest reduced stability for negatively charged phosphates in the acetylated mutant. Our results suggest that the acetylation would hinder both the adenosine binding as well as prevent stable interactions of the negatively charged phosphates with the protein. Collectively, we propose that the acetylation of K183 would destabilize the binding of the adenine nucleotide to the pocket of GSK3β.</p><p>To test this possibility further, we performed ATP binding assay with wild type and mutant versions of GSK3β, where K183 was mutated either to glutamine (Q, acetylation mimetic) or to arginine (R, deacetylation mimetic). GSK3β-K183 mutations significantly reduced binding of ATP to GSK3β, when compared to wild type GSK3β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). These findings provided strong evidence that K183 is critically important for ATP binding to GSK3β and any modifications, including acetylation might affect its ATP-binding ability. To test whether K183 acetylation affects the catalytic activity, we performed in vitro kinase assay with mutants of GSK3β. In this assay, kinase-dead GSK3β-K85A was used as a negative control and GSK3β-S9A was used as the catalytically active mutant. Our results indicate that mutation of K183 to either arginine or glutamine drastically reduced the catalytic activity toward a glycogen synthase peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). Mutation of K150, which is less conserved among species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) and exhibited low stoichiometry of acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), had no effect on GSK3β activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). It is interesting to note that mutation of K183 to either K183R or K183Q, reduced the catalytic activity more than four folds, indicating that K183 is critical for the functionality of GSK3β. Collectively, these findings suggest that K183 is an important residue for ATP binding and the catalytic activity of GSK3β.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>SIRT2 modulates the kinase activity of GSK3β by reversible acetylation</title><p>In our work, we found reduced levels of SIRT2 deacetylase in the ISO-treated mice hearts. Since SIRT2 and GSK3β share cytoplasmic localization, we suspected that SIRT2 may be the GSK3β deacetylase. To test our hypothesis, we overexpressed all the sirtuin isoforms and assessed the acetylation, phosphorylation and activity of GSK3β. Our results suggest that SIRT2 overexpression markedly reduced the acetylation of GSK3β, while increasing its activity against glycogen synthase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, we do not observe any changes in the phosphorylation of Ser9 residue of GSK3β. However, we found increased phosphorylation of GSK3β at Tyr216. Consistent with our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sundaresan et al., 2016</xref>), we found SIRT3 to be capable of deacetylating GSK3β and enhancing its catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). To further verify our findings, we immunoprecipitated GSK3β from SIRT2-deficient heart lysates and tested the levels of acetylation. As expected, we found markedly increased acetylation of GSK3β in SIRT2-KO hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). To test whether SIRT2 interacts with GSK3β, we immunoprecipitated GSK3β from heart samples and tested its binding with SIRT2 by western blotting. We found that SIRT2 interacts with GSK3β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We also found that recombinant purified GSK3β is capable of binding to SIRT2 in vitro, suggesting direct interaction between both proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). To test whether SIRT2 deacetylates GSK3β, we performed an in vitro deacetylation assay, where the acetylated GSK3β was incubated with either WT or SIRT2-H187Y, catalytic mutant of SIRT2 with and without NAD<sup>+</sup>. Western blotting analysis indicated WT, but not catalytic mutant-SIRT2 markedly reduced the acetylation status of GSK3β in an NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

SIRT2 depletion increases the cellular global lysine acetylation and the acetylation of GSK3β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Moreover, GSK3β-specific phosphorylation of glycogen synthase and β-catenin was reduced in SIRT2-depleted cardiomyocytes, which is associated with reduced Tyr216, but not Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK3β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). To further validate the results in vivo, we tested the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase in SIRT2-deficient heart samples, and observed reduced phosphorylation of glycogen synthase, which is associated with reduced Tyr216, but not Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK3β in SIRT2-KO hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). To further confirm the reduced activity of GSK3β in SIRT2-deficient hearts, we performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay. Consistent with our findings, we observed significantly reduced activity of GSK3β toward a peptide of glycogen synthase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Next, we measured the total and phosphorylated protein levels of β-catenin, a GSK3 target transcription factor, which is degraded, after phosphorylation by GSK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2002</xref>), in the heart samples of SIRT2-deficient mice. Our results suggest that the protein levels of β-catenin are high in SIRT2-KO heart lysates, while the GSK3 target phosphorylation of β-catenin was decreased drastically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), indicating that SIRT2-mediated deacetylation might control the kinase activity of GSK3β.</p><p>To further understand the mechanism involved in acetylation-mediated regulation of GSK3β activity, we examined the subcellular localization of GSK3β. Treatment of cells with a SIRT2 inhibitor (AGK2) enhanced the acetylation of tubulin, a well-accepted target of SIRT2, and the acetylation of GSK3β, while decreasing its activity against glycogen synthase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Consistent with previous results, we did not observe any changes in the phosphorylation of Ser9 residue of GSK3β following AGK2 treatment. However, we found decreased phosphorylation of GSK3β at Tyr216 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, AGK2 treatment had no effect on subcellular distribution of the GSK3β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Next, we tested the localization of K183 mutants of GSK3β. As expected, the results suggest that the WT and K183 mutants of GSK3β exhibited cytoplasmic localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). These results indicate that change in the activity of GSK3β is not associated with its localization. To test whether SIRT2 deficiency is compensated by other sirtuin isoforms, we checked for the levels of all the sirtuins in SIRT2-deficient mice hearts. However, we found no difference in expression levels of any other sirtuin isoforms in SIRT2-deficient mice heart samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>Our MS/MS analysis indicated that GSK3β K150 and K183 residues are acetylated and GSK3β K183 is involved in the regulation of its kinase activity. To test whether SIRT2 deacetylates K183, we performed an in vitro assay, where wild type and GSK3β K183R mutants were incubated with SIRT2. Our results revealed that GSK3β-K183R showed basal level acetylation, which is appreciably lower than the acetylation of wild type GSK3β. These findings confirm our observations that GSK3β is acetylated at multiple residues endogenously, and K183 residue is one among them. SIRT2 deacetylates the wild type GSK3β, but not GSK3β-K183R in the presence of NAD<sup>+</sup>, indicating that K183R may be the key target residue for SIRT2 deacetylase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J and K</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that catalytic activity of GSK3β is governed by acetylation at GSK3β K183 residue. To test whether SIRT2-mediated deacetylation enhances the ATP binding to GSK3β, we analyzed the ATP-binding ability of acetylated and deacetylated GSK3β. As expected, we found that acetylation inhibits the ATP binding, whereas SIRT2-mediated deacetylation restores the ATP-binding ability of GSK3β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>).</p><p>GSK3β kinase activity is known to be inhibited by N-terminal Ser9 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Song et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we tested the phosphorylation of GSK3β in SIRT2-deficient heart samples with an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylation at Ser9. Surprisingly, we did not observe any differences in the phosphorylation at Ser9 of GSK3β in control and SIRT2-deficient cardiomyocytes or hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>), suggesting that the reduced activity of GSK3β is associated with acetylation, but not the phosphorylation at Ser9 residue. We next tested whether the activity of constitutively active GSK3β S9A mutant is inhibited by acetylation mimetic mutation (GSK3β-S9A/K183Q). Our results suggest that the activity of GSK3β-S9A mutant, which is not inhibited by the Ser9 phosphorylation, was reduced almost three-folds when K183 was mutated to K183Q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>). These findings suggest that K183 residue is critical for ATP binding in constitutively active GSK3β S9A mutant. We presume that acetylation might inhibit the activity of constitutively active GSK3β S9A mutant independent of inhibitory phosphorylation, but further experiments are required to prove this assumption.</p><p>Next, we tested the phosphorylation of GSK3β at Tyr216 residue, which is known to enhance GSK3 activity by promoting substrate accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dajani et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hughes et al., 1993</xref>). Surprisingly, we found markedly reduced phosphorylation of GSK3β at Tyr216 residue in the cardiomyocytes or heart lysates of SIRT2-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>). These results suggest that acetylation might have negative impact on the activating tyrosine phosphorylation of GSK3β.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Molecular modeling of GSK3α suggests that the acetylation of residue K246 would have similar consequences as K183 of GSK3β</title><p>GSK3 has two isoforms, α and β, which have overlapping cellular substrates and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rayasam et al., 2009</xref>). In the heart, both α and β isoforms of GSK3 are expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sugden et al., 2008</xref>). To test whether both isoforms of GSK3 are acetylated in SIRT2-depleted cells, we immunoprecipitated GSK3 isoforms and acetylation status was tested by western blotting. We found both GSK3α and GSK3β to be significantly acetylated in SIRT2-depleted cells as compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Next, we tested whether SIRT2-mediated deacetylation increases the catalytic activity of GSK3α. The acetylated and deacetylated GSK3α was incubated with GS peptide and the GSK3α activity was measured. Results suggest that acetylation significantly reduced the activity of GSK3α and incubation of acetylated-GSK3α with wild type SIRT2 restored its activity in an NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that SIRT2-mediated deacetylation enhances the activity of GSK3α. Further, our MS/MS analysis indicate that K99 and K246 are the acetylation sites in GSK3α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The protein sequence alignment of GSK3β and GSK3α showed that K246 of GSK3α is analogous to residue K183 of GSK3β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). To further strengthen our assumption, we generated the homology model of GSK3α using the online Swiss-Modeler tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biasini et al., 2014</xref>). The modeled GSK3α further confirmed that the residue K246 would occupy the same position proximal to the adenine nucleotide as K183 of GSK3β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). We therefore assume that acetylation of residue K246 would play a similar role in de-stabilizing adenine nucleotide in the pocket of GSK3α.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32952.013</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Molecular modeling of acetylated GSK3α.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot analysis showing acetylation status of both isoforms of GSK3 in control or SIRT2 depleted (SIRT2-KD) cardiomyocytes.

To understand the contribution of GSK3 as a key molecule in the anti-hypertrophic signaling regulated by SIRT2, we treated SIRT2 overexpressing cardiomyocytes with GSK3 inhibitors, LiCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertsch et al., 2011</xref>) and GSK3 inhibitor X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meijer et al., 2003</xref>) and studied the ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy.

The phosphorylated serine tail hinders the binding of primed substrates by self-associating with the primed-substrate binding pocket of GSK3, and thus reduce the kinase activity of GSK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dajani et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stamos et al., 2014</xref>). It is worth mentioning that acetylation might even inhibit the activity of non-phosphorylated GSK3, which is capable of binding to the primed-substrates. On the other hand, deacetylated GSK3 can also be inhibited by Ser9 phosphorylation, since both acetylation and phosphorylation are two independent events regulating the activity of GSK3 isoforms. In contrast to our findings, it has previously been demonstrated that treatment of AGK2 in platelets decreases Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK3β, due to enhanced acetylation and reduced activity of the Akt, an upstream kinase capable of phosphorylating GSK3β at Ser9 residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moscardó et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that the relationship between SIRT2 and Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK3β is context-dependent. In our previous work, we found that deacetylation of Akt by SIRT1 enhances its kinase activity and thus SIRT1 indirectly inhibits GSK3 activity by increasing Ser9 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sundaresan et al., 2011</xref>). Our current work demonstrates that deacetylation of GSK3 by SIRT2 promotes its activity. Consequently, acetylation is not only involved with direct regulation of GSK3, but also by an indirect mechanism via PDK1/AKT signaling.</p><p>In our previous work, we identified acetylation of GSK3β at Lys15, which influences its mitochondrial localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sundaresan et al., 2016</xref>). Since Lys15 is away from the ATP-binding pocket of GSK3β, we assume that Lys15 will not regulate the ATP binding. Similarly, it has previously been shown that K189 in the Arabidopsis GSK3 orthologue BIN2 (equivalent to K205 in human GSK3β) is targeted by the deacetylase HDAC6 and the deacetylation of K189 in BIN2 was shown to decrease its kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hao et al., 2016</xref>). Our study suggests that the acetylation of K183 decreases GSK3β kinase activity by directly interfering with its adenine nucleotide binding. Since, K189 in the Arabidopsis GSK3 orthologue BIN2 in activation loop located away from the nucleotide-binding site (data not shown), it would certainly follow a distinct mechanism in influencing the kinase activity of BIN2. Therefore, we believe that distinct acetylation events within the kinase domain of GSK3 might have opposing effects on its kinase activity.</p><p>Previous studies indicate that Tyr216 phosphorylation of GSK3β is dynamic and mirrors its catalytic activity. Tyr216 phosphorylation of GSK3β has been shown to decrease immediately after reoxygenation in cultured cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, the phosphorylation of GSK3β at Tyr216 residue increases during ischemic injury of heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdillahi et al., 2012</xref>) and after IFN-γ treatment in RAW264.7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tsai et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, phosphorylation of GSK3β at Tyr216 was frequently increased and was predictive of better prognosis in early-stage gastric carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2010</xref>). Studies indicate that Tyr216 phosphorylation of GSK3β is required for its maximal activity and is considered as an autophosphorylation event that occurs during protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dajani et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hughes et al., 1993</xref>). Moreover, the phosphorylation of the endogenous GSK3β at Tyr216 residue was suppressed by small molecule inhibitors of GSK3, which are known to block autophosphorylation at Tyr216 residue and catalytic activity of GSK3β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cole et al., 2004</xref>). Our work demonstrates that the phosphorylation of GSK3β at Tyr216 residue was reduced in SIRT2-deficient mice. Since acetylation hinders the binding of ATP to GSK3β, it is possible that autophosphorylation of GSK3β might also be reduced in SIRT2-deficient conditions, when GSK3β is mostly acetylated. Conventionally, GSK3β is considered to be a cytoplasmic protein, although it is found inside nucleus and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sundaresan et al., 2016</xref>). However, the p300 is mostly nuclear protein and SIRT2 is majorly a cytoplasmic protein. Since, GSK3 shuttles between cytoplasm and nucleus, it is possible that p300 and SIRT2 may function as acetyl transferase and deacetylase respectively, although they are localized in different subcellular compartments. During cellular stress, GSK3β localizes to mitochondria and this localization is required for cellular apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maurer et al., 2006</xref>). In our previous work, we identified SIRT3-deacetylase-mediated regulation of Lys15 to be critical for its mitochondrial localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sundaresan et al., 2016</xref>). However, the current work suggests that SIRT2-dependent regulation of GSK3β Lys183 acetylation do not influence its cytoplasmic localization. Since Sirtuins are localized to sub-cellular compartments, SIRT2 might regulate the GSK3β activity in the cytoplasm, while SIRT3 is controlling the GSK3β activity inside mitochondria.</p><p>GSK3 plays key physiological roles in cellular protein synthesis, cell survival, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cellular metabolism, microtubule dynamics and cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beurel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen and Frame, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doble and Woodgett, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rayasam et al., 2009</xref>). Impaired GSK3 activity is involved in the development of diverse pathological conditions like cardiovascular disease, obesity, inflammation, diabetes, Alzheimer disease and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen and Frame, 2001</xref>). GSK3 is one of the few signaling mediators that organize diverse signaling pathways, including those activated by Wnts, growth factors, cytokines, G protein-coupled, and α and β adrenoceptor ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sugden et al., 2008</xref>). GSK3 isoforms play a key role in antagonizing the development of cardiac hypertrophy. GSK3 also blocks cellular protein synthesis necessary for the development of cardiac hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sugden et al., 2008</xref>). In particular, active GSK3 prevents cardiac hypertrophic growth and fibrosis through inhibition of transcription factors such as NFAT, GATA4, β-Catenin, myocardin, c-Myc, and c-Jun, and the translational regulator, eIF2Bє (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sugden et al., 2008</xref>). There are reports suggesting that endothelin-1, GPCR, and β-adrenoceptor ligands induce N-terminal serine phosphorylation of GSK3 in cardiomyocytes, that might be one of the possible mechanism of GSK3 inhibition in the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matsuda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sugden et al., 2008</xref>). On the other hand, studies conducted on mice models suggest that N-terminal Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK-3β was neither changed, nor is associated with the reduced activity in the heart after pressure overload or myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhai et al., 2007</xref>). On similar lines, GSK3 S21A/S9A knock-in mice, which is resistant to inhibitory N-terminal phosphorylation is not protected from cardiac hypertrophy, suggesting that inhibitory N-terminal phosphorylation is not the only mechanism that regulates the activity of GSK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matsuda et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Our work suggests that GSK3 activity is critically regulated by phosphorylation-independent mechanisms such as acetylation during the heart failure. Interestingly, inhibition of the acetyl transferase p300 reduced the acetylation and partially restored the activity of GSK3β in SIRT2-deficient cells. Furthermore, treatment of GSK3 inhibitors attenuate the beneficial effects of SIRT2 overexpression, indicating the importance of GSK3 in SIRT2-mediated regulation of cardiac hypertrophy. A recent work suggests that SIRT2 deacetylates LKB1 to promote AMPK activity and regulates the development of cardiac hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tang et al., 2017</xref>). In our recent work, we also found that SIRT2 deficiency induces spontaneous cardiac hypertrophy in mice through hyperactivation of NFAT transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sarikhani et al., 2018a</xref>). In the current work, we found that GSK3β activity is required for the protective functions of SIRT2 in cardiomyocytes. Previous studies indicate that GSK3β is a master regulator of divergent signaling pathways. Notably, GSK3β phosphorylates and represses NFAT transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Neal and Clipstone, 2001</xref>). Similarly, GSK3β and AMPK are known to regulate each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Horike et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Suzuki et al., 2013</xref>). It is possible that SIRT2 might have multiple and redundant targets to regulate cardiac hypertrophy, as observed in members of sirtuin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martínez-Redondo and Vaquero, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Overall, our work identified GSK3 isoforms as a novel target of SIRT2 deacetylase. SIRT2-dependent regulation critically modulates the activity of GSK3β independent of Ser9 inhibitory phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

id="s4-1"><title>Animal experiments</title><p>All animal experiments were performed with the approval of Institutional animal ethics committee of Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India. All the animal experiments were carried out as per the strict accordance with the recommendations of the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA), Government of India. The protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee of the Indian Institute of Science (Permit Numbers: 559/2017, 568/2017, 376/2014). Mice were sacrificed using CO<sub>2</sub> before harvesting and every effort was made to minimize suffering. 129/SvJ mice (renamed as 129 × 1/SvJ, JAX stock # 000691) and Sirt2 knockout mice (JAX stock #012772 - B6.129-Sirt2 &lt; tm1.1Fwa&gt;/J) were procured from the Jackson Laboratories, USA. Mice were housed in individually ventilated cages (IVC) under 12 hr light/dark cycle in the clean air facility of Central Animal Facility, Indian Institute of Science. Chow diet and water were given ad libitum to animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Induction of cardiac hypertrophy in mice</title><p>Cardiac hypertrophy was induced in 8 weeks old 129/Sv mice by surgically implanting Isoproterenol (ISO)-filled osmotic minipumps (models 2002, 2001; ALZET), into the peritoneal cavity of the mice. ISO (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in buffer containing 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM acetic acid and delivered chronically at the dose of 10 mg/kg/day for 7 days. Control mice underwent similar procedure, except that the pumps were filled with vehicle solution containing 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM acetic acid. The induction of hypertrophy was noninvasively assessed by use of echocardiography. Mice were sacrificed, the heart was quickly collected and soaked in ice cold PBS. Heart was squeezed to remove excess blood and PBS, and heart weight was measured by a weighing balance. Tibia length of mice was measured by a Vernier caliper. The heart was sectioned into smaller pieces, immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80° till further processed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Echocardiography of mice</title><p>Mice were anaesthetized by continuously infusing ~1% Isoflurane via nasal cone. A commercial topical depilatory was used to remove chest hair of mice. Body temperature of the mice was maintained by a heated imaging platform. Electrocardiogram leads were attached to limb of mice for gating. FUJIFILM VisualSonic Vevo 1100 high-frequency ultrasound equipped with 30 MHz high-frequency transducer was used to image the animals in the left lateral decubitus position. Two-dimensional echocardiographic images were recorded in parasternal long- and short-axis projections, with guided M-mode recordings at the midventricular level in both views. Left ventricular cavity size and left ventricular wall thickness were measured in at least three beats from each projection and averaged for data analysis. Left ventricular fractional shortening was calculated from the M-mode measurements by an in-built software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Cell lines, plasmids and transfection</title><p>HeLa and HEK 293 cell lines were purchased from ATCC. The identity of the cell lines has been authenticated by short tandem repeat (STR) analysis by the supplier. These cells were tested mycoplasma free by PCR-based screening in the laboratory. GSK3β-Knock-out (GSK3β-KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts were kindly provided by James Woodgett, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada. HeLa, HEK 293 and GSK3β-KO embryonic fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Refer Key resources table for source and description of plasmids used. Site directed mutagenesis was carried out as per previously described protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zheng et al., 2004</xref>). QuickChange Primer Design tool was used to design primers for site-directed mutagenesis of Sirt2 and Gsk3b. The site-directed mutation was verified by sequencing (SciGenom). Cells were transfected with plasmids harboring gene of interest using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent as per manufacturer’s protocols. Briefly, plasmid encoding control, or the desired construct were diluted in serum-free media and incubated for 5 min. Similarly, Lipofectamine was diluted in serum-free media, and incubated for 5 min. Mixtures were vortexed and centrifuged. Post-incubation, diluted plasmid and lipofectamine were pooled together, vortexed, centrifuged, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Equal volume of the mixture was added to the cells in serum-free media for 6 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Culture of cardiomyocytes</title><p>Primary rat neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated from 1- or 2-day-old Wistar rats as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jain et al., 2017</xref>). Rat pups were anaesthetized using 1–2% isoflurane and were sacrificed by decapitation.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Bradley Doble (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting study that describes the regulation of GSK3 by acetylation. The authors report that acetylation on Lys183 reduces ATP binding and that the acetylation is mediated by p300 and that de-acteylation is mediated by SIRT2. The regulation by acetylation is stated to be independent of inhibitory phosphorylation. This is potentially important because GSK3 is a key signaling enzyme and the description of a new regulatory mechanism would be of wide interest. Several lines of evidence support the authors conclusions, but several points require clarification.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major concern with this study is that the methods are very poorly described. Many experiments are not described at all (e.g. shRNA studies and antibodies used for immunofluorescence etc.) and some studies are described by citation to previous studies reported by the authors, but the citations are not helpful; for example, the methods states that rat cardiomyocytes were studied, but the citation is to the preparation of murine cardiomyocytes; the method used for ATP binding cites the use of His-tagged kinase and a kinase inhibitor – is this how the ATP binding was done? Moreover, the materials used for many of the experiments is not described – for example, the purified p300 used for binding assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) is not described, what was the source of acetylated GSK3 used for the de-acetylation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), what was the source of the WT and mutant SIRT2 used for de-acetylation assays, etc. This is a major problem throughout the study and must be fixed for every experiment presented.</p><p>2) It has previously been shown that K189 in the Arabidopsis GSK3 orthologue BIN2 (equivalent to K205 in human GSK3β) is targeted by the deacetylase HDAC6 (Hao et al., 2016). In contrast to the regulation of K183 by SIRT2, deacetylation of K189 in BIN2 leads to a reduction in kinase activity. The authors should expand their discussion to indicate that distinct acetylation events within the kinase domain of GSK3 can have opposing effects on its kinase activity.</p><p>3) The relative role of SIRT2 is unclear. For example, do other SIRT enzymes play a role in GSK3 de-acetylation? Is the de-acetylation specific to SIRT2?</p><p>4) The relative role of p300 in acetylation of GSK3 is unclear. There is reduced acetylation in the p300 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>), but the effect is not robust. Is this because the knock-down was insufficient or because the potential role of p300 is redundant?</p><p>5) Both the mimetic and non-acetylatable mutants of K183 display reduced ATP binding and catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K and 2L</xref>). This provides evidence that K183 is an important residue for ATP binding and GSKβ activity but is not a direct test of the effect of acetylation on ATP binding (as stated in subsection “Acetylation of GSK3β Influences ATP binding: Insights from Molecular Modeling and Molecular Dynamics Simulation of GSK3β WT and Acetylated K183 Mutant”). Similarly, the fact that the K183Q mutant decreases the activity of the S9A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>) may simply reflect that this residue is critical for ATP binding, rather than proving that acetylation inhibits GSK3β activity independently of Ser9 phosphorylation (subsection “SIRT2 Modulates the Kinase Activity of GSK3β by Reversible Acetylation”). The discussion of these experiments should be more circumspect about the evidence for acetylation of K183 regulating ATP binding and the caveats should be clearly stated.</p><p>6) The ATP binding assay is unclear. The cited reference makes no mention of magnesium. Was the binding performed in the absence of magnesium?</p><p>7) The K183R mutant displays increased acetylation compared to wild-type GSK3β in the presence of active SIRT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). What is the reason for this? Is there an increase of acetylation on other sites when K183 is mutated? This could have implications for the interpretation of the experiments where K183 mutants have been used. Quantification from multiple blots would also be helpful here.</p><p>8) The data from SIRT2-KO mice could be supported by the use of the SIRT2 inhibitor AGK2 on cardiomyocyte cultures. There also needs to be a control experiment included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref> that demonstrates that AGK2 is inhibiting SIRT2 under the conditions used. It has previously been reported that AGK2 decreases Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK3β in platelets (Moscardo et al., 2015) suggesting that the relationship between SIRT2 and Ser9 phosphorylation is context-dependent. This should be discussed.</p><p>9) The authors have previously reported the regulation of the PDK1/AKT pathway by acetylation. The authors should include discussion of this in the paper because the impression provided to the reader is that acetylation is only involved with direct regulation of GSK3 rather than also by an indirect mechanism via PDK1/AKT.</p><p>10) Presumably the sub-cellular localization of the sites of acetylation and de-acetylation of GSK3 are different (nuclear p300 and cytoplasmic SIRT2). The authors should comment on this.</p><p>11) The data directly linking GSK3 to the anti-hypertrophic effect of SIRT2 is mainly based on the use of LiCl as a GSK3 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-D</xref>). As LiCl is not specific for GSK3 but has other effects on cells, this data should be supported by the use of an additional GSK3 inhibitor or the GSK3β K183 mutants.</p><p>12) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, the level of GSK3β acetylation does not correlate with GSK3β activity. In the presence of the p300 inhibitor, SIRT2-KO does not affect GSK3β acetylation but its activity is still significantly decreased. This should be commented on.</p><p>13) The Title and Abstract of the paper implies that the acetylation mechanism is specific to GSK3β, but GSK3α appears to share this regulatory mechanism. This conclusion should be confirmed by showing that GSK3α is inhibited by acetylation and reflected in the wording of a revised title.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;SIRT2 deacetylase regulates the activity of GSK3 isoforms independent of inhibitory phosphorylation&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

In contrast to the regulation of K183 by SIRT2, deacetylation of K189 in BIN2 leads to a reduction in kinase activity.

We have generated a homology model of BIN2 using GSK3β as a template (Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). It is clear that K183 (in GSK3β) is not equivalent to K189b (in BIN2). In a previous study, the acetylation of K189b in BIN2 was shown to increases its kinase activity (Hao et al., 2016). Our current study suggests that the acetylation of K183 decreases the GSK3β kinase activity by directly interfering with its adenine nucleotide binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Since, the K189b resides in activation loop, away from the nucleotide-binding site, it would certainly follow a distinct mechanism in influencing the kinase activity of BIN2, when compared to K183 of GSK3β, which is situated in the nucleotide binding pocket. Therefore, distinct acetylation events within the kinase domain of GSK3 might have opposing effects on its kinase activity. We have included this point in the Discussion section.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32952.018</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Models of GSK3B and BIN2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Surface representation of the crystal structure of GSK3B (PDB ID 4NM0, blue) and the homology model of BIN2 (salmon), highlighted are the analogous acetylation sites.

Our previous study suggests that SIRT3 deacetylates GSK3β at K15 and activates GSK3β and thereby blocks TGF-β1 signalling and tissue fibrosis (Sundaresan et al., 2016). To further identify the sirtuins responsible for regulation of GSK3 activity, we overexpressed all the sirtuin isoforms and assessed the acetylation, phosphorylation and activity of GSK3β. Our results suggest that SIRT2 overexpression markedly reduced the acetylation of GSK3β, while increasing its activity against glycogen synthase. Interestingly, we do not observe any changes in the phosphorylation of Ser9 residue of GSK3β. However, we found increased phosphorylation of GSK3β at Tyr216. Consistent with our previous work (Sundaresan et al., 2016), we found SIRT3 is capable of deacetylating GSK3β and enhancing its catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Please see subsection &quot;SIRT2 modulates the kinase activity of GSK3β by reversible acetylation&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The relative role of p300 in acetylation of GSK3 is unclear. There is reduced acetylation in the p300 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>), but the effect is not robust. Is this because the knock-down was insufficient or because the potential role of p300 is redundant?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that reduced acetylation of GSK3 in the p300 depleted cells is not robust. However, inhibition of SIRT2 by AGK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) or depletion of SIRT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), markedly enhances the acetylation of GSK3β. We believe that GSK3β acetylation might be regulated by multiple acetyltransferases including p300. Further studies are needed to identify potential acetyltransferases for GSK3β. We have discussed this point in the Results section (subsection “Acetyltransferase p300 Regulates the GSK3β Acetylation”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Both the mimetic and non-acetylatable mutants of K183 display reduced ATP binding and catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K and 2L</xref>).

We have quantified our results from multiple experiments, and the results were included in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3J and 3K</xref>. We believe that GSK3β-K183R mutant may not be an effective deacetylation target for SIRT2, though we do not have evidence to substantiate this claim.

As reviewers pointed that the p300 is mostly nuclear protein and SIRT2 is majorly cytoplasmic protein.

This should be commented on.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree to reviewers that the change in acetylation status of GSK3β after p300 inhibitor treatment is not correlated well with the GSK3β activity on Glycogen synthase. It could be due to modifications of glycogen synthase in SIRT2-KO hearts. We also believe that glycogen synthase might have also been post-translationally modified in SIRT2-KO hearts. Another reason could be SIRT2-KO hearts might have increased expression of phosphatases that might regulate glycogen synthase phosphorylation.
