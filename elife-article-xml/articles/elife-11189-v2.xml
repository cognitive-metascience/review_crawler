Crystal structures have suggested that the conformational change from occluded to outward-facing states is unusually simple, involving only the rotation of a conserved glutamate (Glu<sub>ex</sub>) upon its protonation. Using <sup>19</sup>F NMR, we show that as [H<sup>+</sup>] is increased to protonate Glu<sub>ex</sub> and enrich the outward-facing state, a residue ~20 Å away from Glu<sub>ex</sub>, near the subunit interface, moves from buried to solvent-exposed. Consistent with functional relevance of this motion, constriction via inter-subunit cross-linking reduces transport. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the cross-link dampens extracellular gate-opening motions. In support of this model, mutations that decrease steric contact between Helix N (part of the extracellular gate) and Helix P (at the subunit interface) remove the inhibitory effect of the cross-link. Together, these results demonstrate the formation of a previously uncharacterized 'outward-facing open' state, and highlight the relevance of global structural changes in CLC function.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11189.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11189.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11189.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells have transporter proteins on their surface to carry molecules in and out of the cell. For example, the CLC family of transporters move two chloride ions in one direction at the same time as moving one hydrogen ion in the opposite direction.</p><p>To be able to move these ions in opposite directions, transporters have to cycle through a series of shapes in which the ions can only access alternate sides of the membrane. First, the transporter adopts an 'outward-facing' shape when the ions first bind to the transporter, then it switches into the 'occluded' shape to move the ions through the membrane. Finally, the transporter takes on the 'inward-facing' shape to release the ions on the other side of the membrane. However, structural studies of CLCs suggest that the structures of these proteins do not change much while they are moving ions, which suggests that they might work in a different way.</p><p>Khantwal, Abraham et al. have now used techniques called “nuclear magnetic resonance” and &quot;double electron-electron resonance&quot; to investigate how a CLC from a bacterium moves ions. The experiments suggest that when the transporter adopts the outward-facing shape, points on the protein known as Y419 and D417 shift their positions. Chemically linking two regions of the CLC prevented this movement and inhibited the transport of chloride ions across the membrane.</p><p>Khantwal, Abraham et al. then used a computer simulation to model how the protein changes shape in more detail. This model predicts that two regions of the transporter undergo major rearrangements resulting in a gate-opening motion that widens a passage to allow the chloride ions to bind to the protein. Khantwal, Abraham et al.’s findings will prompt future studies to reveal the other shapes and how CLCs transition between them.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11189.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11189.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>antiporter</kwd><kwd>membrane exchanger</kwd><kwd>crystallization</kwd><kwd>principal component analysis</kwd><kwd>double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy</kwd><kwd>membrane protein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1021472</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maduke</surname><given-names>Merritt</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54-GM087519</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mchaourab</surname><given-names>Hassane S</given-names></name><name><surname>Tajkhorshid</surname><given-names>Emad</given-names></name><name><surname>Maduke</surname><given-names>Merritt</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005492</institution-id><institution>Stanford University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Chemical Biology Institute Birdseed Funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maduke</surname><given-names>Merritt</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001229</institution-id><institution>G Harold and Leila Y.

To achieve this stoichiometric exchange, CLCs must follow an alternating access mechanism, in which bound substrate ions access either side of the membrane alternately, i.e., they cannot access both sides simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Patlak, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jardetzky, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Shilton, 2015</xref>). The alternating access mechanism can only be realized by coupling of ion binding, translocation, and unbinding events to conformational changes in the transporter protein. Specifically, movement of ions between solution and the ion-binding sites of the transporter, as well as ion movement between binding sites, needs to be coupled to conformational changes between “outward-facing” (in which the external, but not internal, solution is accessible to ions), “occluded” (in which neither solution is accessible), and “inward-facing” (in which the internal, but not external, solution is accessible) states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Forrest et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rudnick, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In all other active transporters that have been structurally (or biophysically) characterized, the conformational changes governing the interconversion between these major functional states involve significant protein motions, including reorientation of helices or even entire domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Shi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Paulino et al., 2014</xref>). For the CLC transporters, in contrast, it has been proposed that the transport mechanism may be fundamentally different and involve only localized side chain motions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Feng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2012</xref>). However, this proposed mechanism is based largely upon the observation that no large-scale CLC conformational change could be detected crystallographically. Given the strong constraining forces in a crystal environment, which often prevent the protein from populating all naturally accessible, functionally relevant conformational states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Elvington and Maduke, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gonzalez-Gutierrez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>), alternative approaches for detecting CLC conformational change during its function are strongly motivated.</p><p>CLC transporters are homodimers in which each subunit independently catalyzes Cl<sup>-</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiport (exchange) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Robertson et al., 2010</xref>). There are two key Cl<sup>-</sup>-binding sites within the protein lumen, known as S<sub>cen</sub> and S<sub>ext</sub>. The central anion-binding site (S<sub>cen</sub>) is stabilized by a positive electrostatic potential created by the N-termini of Helices F and N as well as by interactions with conserved Ser and Tyr residues, which physically occlude the anion from the intracellular side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Using cross-linking as an alternative approach to crystallography, Basilio <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that the conserved Tyr contributes to an intracellular “gate” that opens to generate an inward-facing state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Basilio et al., 2014</xref>). While this inward-facing state has not yet been structurally characterized in detail, the elegantly designed cross-linking studies demonstrated that movement of neighboring Helix O (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) is required in conjunction with movement of the Tyr-gate residue.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11189.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure of CLC transporters.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of ClC-ec1 (pdb: 1OTS).

For this experiment, we exploited the sensitivity of <sup>19</sup>F relaxation rates (and hence spectral line widths) to the water-soluble paramagnetic probe TEMPOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bernini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Venditti et al., 2008</xref>). In this experimental setup, movement of a <sup>19</sup>F-labeled residue from a buried to a solvent accessible location would be detected by line-broadening and peak attenuation. We first examined whether any of the five buried tyrosine residues in ClC-ec1 exhibits sensitivity to TEMPOL. In “BuriedOnly” ClC-ec1, a mutant in which all five buried Tyr residues have been labeled with <sup>19</sup>F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) effects of TEMPOL were observed at both low and high [H<sup>+</sup>], with apparently greater sensitivity at high [H<sup>+</sup>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>); however, because the <sup>19</sup>F resonances are overlapping, we were unable to unambiguously assign the observed changes specifically to effects on chemical shift or line-broadening of a particular resonance. Therefore, to clearly identify the residue(s) sensitive to TEMPOL, we generated ClC-ec1 constructs containing only one <sup>19</sup>F-Tyr label per subunit (either Y445 or Y419, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), replacing all other Tyr residues with Phe.

The <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectrum of Y419 only at pH 7.5 shows a single <sup>19</sup>F peak centered at 60 ppm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This peak shifts upfield and splits into two peaks when [H<sup>+</sup>] is increased, indicating that the <sup>19</sup>F nucleus has experienced a change in chemical environment. This result is consistent with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elvington et al., 2009</xref>) further supporting the notion that conformational changes occur in the vicinity of Y419 as increasing [H<sup>+</sup>] promotes occupancy of the OF state in which Glu<sub>ex</sub> is protonated. The appearance of two peaks, at -61 and -63 ppm, indicates that the <sup>19</sup>F label on Y419 is experiencing two different environments. This could arise from two conformational states of ClC-ec1 or from a tyrosine ring flip that occurs slowly on the NMR timescale (&lt;&lt;1000 s<sup>-1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Weininger et al., 2014</xref>). While this information is useful in identifying Y419 as being in a region involved in H<sup>+</sup>-dependent conformational change, the lack of comprehensive theory for interpreting <sup>19</sup>F chemical shifts in terms of structure motivates additional studies to provide more details on the nature of the conformational change. To evaluate whether there might be a change in solvent accessibility of Y419, we examined the effect of TEMPOL on the <sup>19</sup>F spectra of Y419only. Because of the steep distance dependence of nuclear relaxation enhancements mediated by paramagnets like TEMPOL, significant line-broadening requires the paramagnetic center to approach the target nucleus within less than ~10 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Teng and Bryant, 2006</xref>). At pH 7.5, there is little sensitivity of the <sup>19</sup>F-Y419 signal to 100 mM TEMPOL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) which is consistent with the largely buried position of Y419 in the crystallographically captured state of ClC-ec1, i.e., 12–13 Å from the protein surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, at pH 4.5, significant line-broadening is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating exposure of Y419 to the bulk solution allowing a close approach, or direct contact, of the TEMPOL probe with the fluorine atom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Esposito et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Niccolai et al., 2001</xref>). This H<sup>+</sup>-dependent change in accessibility is reversible, as demonstrated by the reappearance of the Y419 signal when pH is returned to 7.5 from 4.5 in the presence of 100 mM TEMPOL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The reproducibility of these experiments is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>H<sup>+</sup>-independent accessibility of Y419 in channel-like ClC-ec1</title><p>The outer- and inner-gate residues of ClC-ec1 (Glu<sub>ex</sub> and Y445 respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) can be replaced by smaller residues Ala, Ser, or Gly, to yield “channel-like” ClC-ec1 variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jayaram et al., 2008</xref>). This excavation of the gates yields a narrow water-filled conduit through the transmembrane domain, which allows rapid Cl<sup>-</sup> throughput and abolishes H<sup>+</sup> coupling. Thus, it appears that the mechanism of Cl<sup>-</sup> flux through these variants involves channel-like diffusion that is independent of substrate-dependent conformational change. Consistent with this picture, our previous <sup>19</sup>F NMR data showed that E148A/Y445S ClC-ec1 (exhibiting the highest Cl<sup>-</sup> permeability among the channel-like variants) does not undergo the substrate-dependent spectral changes observed in the coupled ClC-ec1 transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elvington et al., 2009</xref>). In this channel-like background, Y419only exhibits a single NMR peak at ~-61 ppm, and this signal is sensitive to line-broadening by TEMPOL at both pH 4.5 and 7.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The accessibility at pH 7.5 is surprising given that the crystal structure of channel-like ClC-ec1 variant E148A/Y445A superposes closely with WT (RMSD 0.52 Å) and indicates a buried position for Y419 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jayaram et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

In channel-like E148A/Y445S, the accessibility of Y419 to TEMPOL indicates that the channel-like ClC-ec1 variant adopts a conformation in solution different from that observed in the crystal structure and similar to the conformation adopted by WT at low pH.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Cross-linking at Helix P slows transport</title><p>We investigated the functional relevance of the conformational change detected at Y419 by introducing cysteines into this region and examining the effects of inter-subunit cross-linking. We reasoned that this cross-linking would restrict the conformational changes responsible for the increased solvent accessibility of Y419 at low pH, and, if these conformational changes are functionally important, cross-linking should also reduce the efficiency of Cl<sup>-</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> transport. In the X-ray crystal structure, the Cα-Cα distance between the two Y419 residues (one in each subunit) is 8.8 Å, within striking range for potential disulfide bond formation. We found that Y419C forms spontaneous inter-subunit cross-links and, to our surprise, that these cross-links have no detectable effect on function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since Y419 lies in the middle of a loop (the P/Q linker), we reasoned that loop flexibility may thwart the intended restriction of motion by the disulfide cross-link. To test this possibility, we examined cross-linking at D417, the residue immediately following Helix P, which also has an inter-subunit Cα-Cα distance of 8.8 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Like Y419C, D417C forms spontaneous inter-subunit disulfide cross-links, with ~50% of the protein migrating as a dimer on non-reducing SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, top panel). To determine the effect of the cross-link on function, we purified D417C transporters under reducing conditions, thereby obtaining a sample in which the majority (&gt;90%) of the protein was not cross-linked, and then induced varying amounts of cross-link by titrating with copper-phenanthroline (CuP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, bottom panel).

To test this hypothesis, we generated the D417C mutant in the channel-like background and evaluated its sensitivity to cross-linking. Consistent with our hypothesis, D417C in channel-like background does not form spontaneous cross-links and is only minimally cross-linked even when treated with up to 100 µM CuP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, top panel). Because this limited cross-linking of D417C/channel-like ClC-ec1 could be due to non-availability of the cysteines (due to oxidation) rather than lack of structural proximity of the two cysteine residues, we used a spectrophotometric assay to quantify the free thiols. Immediately after purification and before CuP treatment, essentially all of the 417C residues are available as free thiols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, bottom panel). Therefore, the deficiency in cross-linking of 417C in the channel-like background compared to 417C in the WT background is not due to unavailability of the free thiols but rather because of a change in proximity of the two cysteines. After treatment with 100 µM CuP, 40% of the cysteines are available as free thiols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Since only ~25% had been cross-linked, this result indicates that ~35% became oxidized to other (non-disulfide) species. Thus, oxidation to non-disulfide species competes with disulfide bond formation and therefore thwarts any attempt to increase the extent of cross-linking beyond ~25% with longer CuP treatments. To rule out the possibility that the crosslinking might be due to inter-dimer (rather than inter-subunit) disulfide bond formation, we examined D417C proteins on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column both before and after treatment with CuP and found that they ran as dimers (and not tetramers, as would occur in the case of inter-dimer cross-linking) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). To the degree it can be cross-linked, D417C in channel-like ClC-ec1 is inhibited similarly to D417C in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Thus, movement of Helix P away from the position observed in the crystal structures is necessary for maximal activity in both transporter and channel-like ClC-ec1.</p><p>To evaluate whether this movement of D417C/Helix P is H<sup>+</sup>-dependent (as is the movement detected by <sup>19</sup>F NMR, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we labeled D417C ClC-ec1 with the nitroxide spin label MTSSL (1-Oxyl-2,2,5,5,-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl methanethio-sulfonate) and used double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jeschke, 2012</xref>) to deduce distance changes as a function of pH. At pH 7.5, the distribution is dominated by a single peak at a distance shorter than 20 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Lowering the pH to 4.5 induces a shift to a peak at 20 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). The channel-like D417C-MTSSL exhibits an altered distance distribution profile compared to the WT background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), suggesting that the protein adopts a different conformation. Notably, the D417C-D417C distance in channel-like is increased relative to that observed in the WT background at pH 7.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>), consistent with the resistance of the channel-like protein to cross-linking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). A decrease in pH does not shift the distance distribution as observed in the WT background, consistent with the loss of pH dependence in <sup>19</sup>F NMR experiments on channel-like ClC-ec1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elvington et al., 2009</xref>)). Together, these results link the conformational changes observed via NMR to those prevented by the cross-link.</p><p>Crystallization of cross-linked D417C (WT background) confirms that the cross-link has trapped the conformation seen in the crystal structures and not some other (non-native) conformation. Our crystal structure, determined at 3.15 Å resolution, reveals a backbone that superimposes on WT ClC-ec1 with a Cα RMSD of 0.57 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).

But since this conclusion is based on experiments with the atypical channel-like ClC-ec1 – with high transport rate and a continuous water passageway connecting the two sides of the membrane – we sought to strengthen the conclusion by examining uncoupled transporters that display typical transport rates and lack a continuous passageway: (1) E148A, which lacks the critical Glu<sub>ex</sub> residue that acts both as an extracellular gate for Cl<sup>-</sup> and as a transfer-point for H<sup>+</sup> permeation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and (2) Y445S, which is mutated at the intracellular gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Basilio et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). The E148A (Glu<sub>ex</sub>) mutant is similar to channel-like ClC-ec1 in that it transports only Cl<sup>-</sup>; however, it has a much lower turnover rate, comparable to WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Accardi and Miller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jayaram et al., 2008</xref>). This slow turnover suggests that despite being uncoupled E148A still depends on conformational changes to catalyze transport, a view supported by both <sup>19</sup>F NMR and fluorescence-based experiments, which detect H<sup>+</sup>-dependent conformational change in this mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elvington et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast to D417C/channel-like ClC-ec1, we found that D417C in the E148A mutant background is readily cross-linked by CuP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Therefore, uncoupling through E148A alone does not alter the protein conformations sampled in solution as substantially as observed with channel-like (E148A/Y445S). The turnover rate of un-crosslinked D417C/E148A is quite low – as low, in fact, as the extrapolated value for the turnover of fully cross-linked D417C (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Nevertheless, cross-linking of D417C/E148A is associated with significant inhibition of activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

The double mutant D417C/Y445S transports Cl<sup>-</sup> at ~850 s<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and H<sup>+</sup> at ~20 s<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) yielding a Cl<sup>-</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> stoichiometry of ~43, similar to that of the Y445S single mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Walden et al., 2007</xref>). Cross-linking of D417C/Y445S proceeds to ~70% and inhibits Cl<sup>-</sup> transport by ~60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), with extrapolation to 100% cross-linking yielding a turnover of ~0 (± 100 s<sup>-1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). For H<sup>+</sup> turnover, it is difficult to judge whether there is a significant effect of the cross-link (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Given the uncertainty in measuring such low H<sup>+</sup> fluxes (~20 s<sup>-1</sup>), it may be that H<sup>+</sup> is inhibited to the same extent as Cl<sup>-</sup>, to a lesser degree, or not at all. In the latter cases, the cross-link would in effect “rescue” ClC-ec1 coupling; such rescue could arise from an increase in Cl<sup>-</sup> occupancy at S<sub>cen</sub>, which is known to facilitate H<sup>+</sup> coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Accardi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nguitragool and Miller, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Han et al., 2014</xref>).

As an approach to examine the effect of the cross-link on H<sup>+</sup> transport, we used MD simulations to examine water entry into the hydrophobic region between Glu<sub>in</sub> and Glu<sub>ex</sub>, which is essential to connect these two major H<sup>+</sup>-binding sites and thus support H<sup>+</sup> transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kuang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wang and Voth, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheng and Coalson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Han et al., 2014</xref>). Water entry occurs via a narrow portal on the cytoplasmic side of the protein, lined by Glu<sub>in</sub> together with E202 and A404 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Han et al., 2014</xref>). Previously, we showed that constricting this portal by introducing large side chains at position 404 inhibits water entry detected computationally and H<sup>+</sup> transport detected experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Han et al., 2014</xref>). Since A404 is on the intracellular end of Helix P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), restricting movement of this helix via the D417C cross-link might restrict water entry. To determine whether the D417C cross-link affects water entry, we compared the number of water molecules entering the central hydrophobic region during the simulation of cross-linked D417C compared to WT. In contrast to the A404L mutation, which greatly reduces water permeation through the portal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Han et al., 2014</xref>), the D417C cross-link has no effect on water entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

To investigate the molecular basis of such motions, extensive MD simulations were conducted either in the absence or in the presence of the D417C cross-link. Note that even the hundreds of nanoseconds of simulations performed here can probe mainly conformational fluctuations of ClC-ec1 near its reference conformation (in this case, the crystal structure), which did not permit direct observation of the opening of the gates. Nevertheless, the sampled dynamics and fluctuations can provide information that can be used to derive collective motions, which are often functionally relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bahar et al., 2010</xref>). Collective motions are defined as those involving concerted movements of a large number of atoms distributed throughout the protein, and are therefore distinguished from localized conformational changes. A series of collective motions of a protein can be obtained in general by decomposing the fluctuations of a protein sampled through MD simulations, e.g., through principal component analysis, or by analyzing normal modes of the protein that underlie protein motions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bahar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gur et al., 2013</xref>). Collective motions can further be used to probe how larger-magnitude conformational change along the identified displacement vectors (modes) might involve crucial, functionally-relevant protein motions, such as opening-closing movements of enzymatic active sites, ligand-binding sites on receptors and channel pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lou and Cukier, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shrivastava and Bahar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jiang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Isin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Peters and de Groot, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yao et al., 2013</xref>).

We then examined whether increasing the amplitude of these collective motions (which overcomes timescale limitations of the simulation) confer conformational change to the Cl<sup>-</sup>-transport pathway. We specifically examined regions around the extracellular and intracellular gates to the Cl<sup>-</sup>-transport pathway, where motions may lead to opening of either gate (which are both closed in the reference protein structure).</p><p>The extracellular gate is formed by the juxtaposition of Helix F (which contains Glu<sub>ex</sub>) and Helix N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

An identical analysis performed on the MD simulation trajectory obtained from the cross-linked D417C mutant revealed that the motions that open the extracellular gate are dampened due to the cross-linking (P=0.002 – 0.008) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, orange bars).

However, along this line of reasoning, one must reconcile why the E148A mutants, in which the extracellular gate has ostensibly been removed, are inhibited when the cross-link is introduced. To address this question, we first investigated the bottleneck for Cl<sup>-</sup> transport in ClC-ec1 based on the crystal structures. The radius profile of the ClC-ec1 Cl<sup>-</sup> transport tunnel, calculated using the program HOLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Smart et al., 1996</xref>), shows an extracellular bottleneck with a minimum radius of ~0.2 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Interestingly, the calculated radius profile for both the E148A mutant (lacking Glu<sub>ex</sub>) and the channel-like variant E148A/Y445A also reveal extracellular bottlenecks. (E148A/Y445A was evaluated rather than the E148A/Y445S construct used here because this is the only channel-like variant for which there is a crystal structure.)

Visual inspection reveals an obvious potential transduction pathway: Helix N, which forms part of the extracellular gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), makes direct contacts to Helix P through side-chain packing of conserved residues in each Helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A,B</xref>). We hypothesized that disrupting these contacts would disrupt transduction of Helix-P motions to the extracellular gate, thereby abolishing the inhibitory effect of the Helix-P cross-link. To test this hypothesis, we generated Helix-N mutants F357A and L361A, in which the inter-helical coupling of motion is expected to be weakened by removing bulky side chains contributing to the contact area. The mutant transporters are slow compared to WT but retain the ability to couple Cl<sup>-</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Strikingly, the D417C cross-link only weakly inhibits L361A activity and completely fails to inhibit F357A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C,D</xref>). The sluggish turnover of the F357A mutant suggests that it might be insensitive to the D417C cross-link because it is already maximally inhibited. To evaluate this possibility, we examined another slow mutant, A404L. A404 lines an intracellular “portal” for water (and hence H<sup>+</sup>) entry into the transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Han et al., 2014</xref>). This residue is located at the N-terminal end of Helix P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11A</xref>), which does not contact Helix N. We found that the activity of the A404L mutant, despite being similarly sluggish to F357A, is reduced further yet by the D417C cross-link (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11E,F</xref>). Thus, the lack of sensitivity of F357A to the D417C cross-link appears due to the weakened interaction with Helix P and not to its already-low turnover. These results provide strong support for the hypothesis that Helix-P motions are transmitted to the extracellular gate via side-chain contacts to Helix N.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11189.026</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Helix P is coupled to the extracellular gate via Helix N.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Side view of ClC-ec1, in stereo.

First, the structure of the E148Q mutant, with the side chain rotated away from S<sub>ext</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) represents an “outward-facing occluded” (OF<sub>occluded</sub>) state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Stein and Litman, 2014</xref>), in which bound Cl<sup>-</sup> does not have full access to the extracellular solution. Second, H<sup>+</sup> binding promotes an “outward-facing open” (OF<sub>open</sub>) state, involving conformational rearrangement of Helices N and P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>), that widens the extracellular ion-permeation pathway in comparison to the known crystal structures.</p><p>The first clue to conformational change at Helix P came from our NMR studies of Y419, on the short P/Q linker, where unambiguous changes in both chemical shift and solvent accessibility of <sup>19</sup>F-labeled Y419 are observed when the pH is lowered from 7.5 to 4.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). At pH 7.5, the lack of accessibility is consistent with the crystal structure of the occluded conformational state, which depicts Y419 in a buried position. At pH 4.5, the increased accessibility of Y419 indicates a conformational state different from that captured in crystal structures. This state (with Y419 exposed to solution) is observed in channel-like ClC-ec1 at both pH 7.5 and 4.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This shift in equilibrium distribution of conformational states for channel-like ClC-ec1 is useful because it enables comparison of the disulfide cross-linking of the two states, which must be done at a pH that is amenable to disulfide bond formation (7.5 rather than 4.5). In the WT background, cross-links near Y419, at D417C, form readily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), as expected based on the crystal structure of the occluded conformational state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). In contrast, in the channel-like E148A/Y445S background, D417C is resistant to cross-linking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). These results suggest that the pH-dependent conformational change detected by NMR involves a change in inter-subunit proximity of D417 residues in addition to the change in solvent accessibility of Y419. DEER experiments confirm such pH-dependent change at D417 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p><p>Inter-subunit cross-linking of D417C restricts the conformational transition to the OF<sub>open</sub> state and inhibits activity. The inhibition occurs not only in the WT background but also in uncoupled E148A, Y445S, and E148A/Y445S (channel-like) backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Therefore, the conformational change being restricted is something other than the localized movements of side-chain gates, as these gates (E148 and Y445) are missing altogether in the uncoupled transporters. To gain insight into how conformational change near the subunit interface affects activity, we performed MD simulations on WT and channel-like ClC-ec1, with and without the D417C crosslink. We found that the major motions of both WT and channel-like involve opening of the extracellular vestibule and that these opening motions are dampened by the cross-link at D417 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). Further, our mutagenesis experiments show that removing side-chain interactions between Helices N and P eliminates the effect of the cross-link on Cl<sup>-</sup> transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that rearrangement of these helices facilitates a widening of the extracellular ion-permeation pathway.</p><p>The residual activity remaining with maximal cross-linking at D417 (ranging from 0–300 s<sup>-1</sup>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) suggests that the OF<sub>occluded</sub> state may allow some minimal level of Cl<sup>-</sup> flux. However, an alternative interpretation is that the OF<sub>occluded</sub> is completely impermeant to Cl<sup>-</sup> and that the residual transport observed with the cross-link is either (1) not distinguishable from zero (due to compounding uncertainties in the various steps involved in the experimental measurement, including quantification of the fraction cross-linked) or (2) occurs because the cross-link does not completely prevent movement of Helix N and opening of the extracellular vestibule to the OF state. We favor the alternative interpretation as it is in keeping with the general principles of transporter function, in which protein conformational change plays a key role in sustaining coupling stoichiometry. In support of this idea, we note that Helix N motions have been strongly implicated not only in ClC-ec1 (the results presented here) but also in the mammalian antiporter CLC-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Osteen and Mindell, 2008</xref>). Experiments on this homolog identified an inhibitory Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding site at the top of Helix N that appears to transmit conformational change to the Cl<sup>-</sup>-permeation pathway at the other end of Helix N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Osteen and Mindell, 2008</xref>).</p><p>While it is clear that rearrangement of Helices N and P is required for opening the extracellular vestibule, the precise molecular details of this rearrangement remain to be determined. Nevertheless, several pieces of information suggest that the overall motions, though long-range in effect, may involve rearrangements/reorientations of only a few Angstroms in magnitude. First, the cross-linking of Y419C, just 5 Å away from D417C, does not inhibit function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Second, any large movement of Helix P would likely have a major effect on water entry via the narrow portal that is the rate-limiting barrier for formation of water wires and H<sup>+</sup> transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Han et al., 2014</xref>). Since our computational analysis indicates that cross-linking does not significantly affect water entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), Helix-P motion may involve only a small tilt or rotation that exerts a “lever-arm” effect on Helix N and the Cl<sup>-</sup>-entryway. Third, previous inter-subunit cross-linking studies targeting Helices I and Q, and the H-I and I-J loops showed that simultaneously cross-linking these regions had no significant effect on function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nguitragool and Miller, 2007</xref>) and therefore argue against a major restructuring of the inter-subunit interface. Together, these results suggest that the rearrangements at Helices N and P are likely small in magnitude and do not involve the entire inter-subunit interface. This conclusion is in line with computational studies using normal-mode and functional-mode analysis, which showed the subunit interface remaining largely intact even as other regions of ClC-ec1 underwent global conformational changes to alternately expose Cl<sup>-</sup>- and H<sup>+</sup>-binding sites during the exchange process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miloshevsky et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Krivobokova et al., 2012</xref>). One of the mobile helices identified in these computational studies was Helix R, which has also been pinpointed in experimental studies of H<sup>+</sup>-dependent conformational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2015</xref>). Since Helix R extends from the center of the protein (where Y445 coordinates Cl<sup>-</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) out to the cytoplasmic solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), the H<sup>+</sup>-dependent conformational change characterized here, while not large in magnitude, may extend well beyond the immediate region around Helices P and N.</p><p>To integrate the OF<sub>open</sub> state into a model of the CLC transport cycle, we build on the model of Basilio et al.

Entry of the protonated Glu<sub>ex</sub> into the vacated permeation pathway (State 4) facilitates transfer of one H<sup>+</sup> to the intracellular side, via water wires and the internal H<sup>+</sup>-transfer site Glu<sub>in</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Accardi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lim and Miller, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Han et al., 2014</xref>). Upon unbinding of H<sup>+</sup>, the protein adopts the apo occluded conformation (State 5) which can then undergo conformational change to the inward-facing state (State 6, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Basilio et al., 2014</xref>)). Binding of 2 Cl<sup>-</sup> from the intracellular side knocks Glu<sub>ex</sub> out of the S<sub>ext</sub>-binding site (State 7), which then allows H<sup>+</sup> binding from the extracellular side (back to State 1). This revised model is completely consistent with previous experimental observations, and the addition of new conformational states adds potentially key control points to the mechanism. First, the extracellular occlusion in State 7 assures no extra Cl<sup>-</sup> slips through during the step in which Cl<sup>-</sup> binds from the intracellular side. Second, we hypothesize that the OF<sub>open</sub> state lowers Cl<sup>-</sup> affinity and promotes Cl<sup>-</sup> release, as suggested by the increase in Cl<sup>-</sup>-binding affinity observed when formation of the OF<sub>open</sub> state is inhibited by the D417C cross-link (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>).<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11189.027</object-id><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Revised model of the CLC transporter mechanism.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CLC transporter cycle. The OF<sub>occluded</sub> state (1) undergoes a conformational change to OF<sub>open</sub> (2). This step is pH-dependent but may be promoted by protonation of residues other than Glu<sub>ex</sub> (see Discussion).

The crystal structure of channel-like ClC-ec1 reveals a narrow constriction at the extracellular-gate region, depicted at left.

Previously, it was recognized that the narrow pathway depicted by the crystal structures of channel-like ClC-ec1 is not sufficiently wide to allow rapid ion conduction and that protein dynamics (either breathing or conformational change) must play an important part in the mechanism of ion conduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jayaram et al., 2008</xref>). Our results clarify the issue by showing that channel-like ClC-ec1 populates a conformation different from that seen in the crystal structure and exhibiting similarities to the new OF<sub>open</sub> state characterized in these studies. In this state, the region of the narrowest constriction – just above S<sub>ext</sub> – is significantly widened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>). The population of this state explains why channel-like ClC-ec1 can conduct Cl<sup>-</sup> rapidly at pH 7.5.</p><p>The long-range conformational change described here improves our understanding of CLC mechanisms by providing a first glimpse of an “outward-facing open” CLC conformational state and its mechanistic implications. In future studies, it will be important to investigate the transition between the OF<sub>open</sub>, OF<sub>occluded</sub> and inward-facing conformational state(s). Using a cross-linking strategy, Basilio et al. showed that transition to the inward-facing state involves motion of the intracellular half of Helix O. This motion is thought to be limited in scope, as it is relayed directly to the intracellular gate via a steric interaction between intracellular-gate residue Y445 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and Helix O residue I402 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Basilio et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, since Helix O also makes direct contacts to Helices N and P (studied here), it seems likely that intracellular and extracellular gate-opening motions will be linked through the interaction of these three helices. Understanding these interactions will be critical to providing a molecularly detailed view of the CLC transport mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression, purification, reconstitution and flux assays</title><p>Expression and purification of unlabeled ClC-ec1 WT and mutant proteins was performed as documented in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Accardi and Miller, 2004</xref>) except that the final purification step was by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex gel filtration column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Walden et al., 2007</xref>) rather than ion-exchange chromatography.

Reconstituted liposomes were subjected to 4 freeze-thaw cycles and were extruded through 400-nm filters 15 times using an Avanti Mini-Extruder.

Samples (~300 µL starting volumes) were placed in the outer tube of Shigemi symmetrical microtubes in order to reduce the volume of sample required for data acquisition. The Shigemi tube insert was not used so as to avoid generating froth from adjusting the plunger in the detergent containing sample.

ClC-ec1 eluted from the Superdex 200 column in Buffer A was diluted to 0.2 mg/mL (1.9 μM homodimer; 3.8 µM Cys-containing subunits) before addition of CuP. After an hour of incubation, 1 mM Na-EDTA (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) was added to terminate the cross-linking reaction. Cross-linking was visualized using SDS/PAGE (4–15% gradient gels) and staining with Coomassie brilliant blue (TCI America, Portland, OR). Cross-linking was documented using an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences) using the 700 nm channel. ClC-ec1 band intensities were quantified using NIH ImageJ software. Un-cross-linked ClC-ec1 runs as a monomer (apparent molecular weight ~36 kD) and cross-linked mutant as a dimer (apparent molecular weight ~64 kD). The fraction cross-linked was calculated based on the relative intensities of the dimer and monomer bands. For channel-like ClC-ec1, which exhibited a low efficiency of cross-linking, free thiols were quantified colorimetrically (Life Technologies Thiol and Sulfide quantification kit, T6060). During reconstitution into liposomes, most CuP-treated samples were dialyzed in buffer containing 1 mM DTT in order to avoid additional cross-linking during the dialysis step; this level of DTT was sufficiently low that it did not reduce D417C disulfide bonds that had already been formed.

The ClC-ec1 samples were then purified from the cleaved 6-His tag and excess MTSSL by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column. Glycerol (23% v/v) was added to the protein solution as cryoprotectant. This was achieved by adding an 80% (v/v) glycerol stock solution (prepared in buffer A) to the purified protein.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior editor and Reviewing editor) and three reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes a multimethodological attack on a longstanding dirty little secret hanging over the field of structure-mechanism analysis of CLC transporters and channels. From the first structures over a decade ago, the notion has emerged that a key event in the coupling of anion and proton movements is the sidechain rotation of a conserved &quot;external Glu&quot; residue (Glu<sub>ex</sub>) that opens a pathway for Cl<sup>-</sup> to the extracellular solution, thus converting an &quot;ion-occluded&quot; conformation to an outside-open one. The mechanistic centrality of this Glu<sub>ex</sub> movement is not in doubt, but the precise nature of the outward-open pathway has been mostly ignored, probably because anyone who has actually examined CLC structures can immediately see that it's got a problem: the pathway in structures of the presumed outward-open conformation connecting the central bound Cl<sup>-</sup> ion to external solvent is far too narrow for the ion to squeeze through. The necessity of &quot;protein breathing&quot; has been occasionally invoked, in a more-or-less handwaving spirit, to dismiss this issue as the field builds various models for anion-proton antiport.</p><p>The work takes on the problem directly by bringing a combination of <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup>F NMR, crystallography, crosslinking, and molecular dynamics to bear on the question: does outward opening involve conformational movements more extensive than a mere Glu<sub>ex</sub> rotameric switch? Recent indicators that some sort of backbone rearrangement may be involved have previously been reported from Maduke's lab, using <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup>F NMR, and from Accardi's using crosslinking. Now the authors bear down on the problem in more detail. They identify a residue, buried in the known structures and distant from Glu<sub>ex</sub>, that appears to become water-exposed at low pH, where pathway opening occurs. Inter-subunit disulfide crosslinking of this position does not affect transport, but this 'negative' result is proposed to reflect flexibility of the loop on which the residue resides. They then test a nearby residue on TM Helix P, and find that crosslinking can also occur here, and that the extent of crosslinking (under fairly harsh oxidation conditions) is tightly correlated with transport inhibition. The proposal naturally emerges that pathway opening involves a movement of TM Helices in this region. The idea is then examined by molecular dynamics, which look for collective motion tendencies that would widen the external pathway. Such motions are found in TM Helices F and N, the latter of which contacts Helix P. These motions are suppressed in MD simulations of the crosslinked structure (directly determined by a crystal structure). Mutations that decrease steric contact between Helices N and P are then tested and are found to confirm the prediction that such a loss of contact should remove the inhibitory effect of crosslinking on transport.</p><p>This set of independent lines of analysis, any one of which would alone be unconvincing, lead to a picture that should now be taken seriously by the field: that rather subtle movements of helices distant from Glu<sub>ex</sub> lead to a low-pH conformation slightly different from those repeatedly observed in crystal structures (nearly all of which are at pH 7-9, but see below). In this conformation, as visualized by the MD simulations, the external pathway would open an additional 2 A, which would allow bound Cl<sup>-</sup> access to the extracellular solution. These suggested motions are small – much smaller than the 'rocking-banana' or 'elevator' conformational changes involved in conventional alternating-access mechanisms of other transporters – and the general view of a nearly 'solid-state' mechanism of antiport in CLCs remains valid in broad outline.</p><p>The problem addressed in the manuscript is important, the results interesting, the design of high quality and the manuscript is well written. However, enthusiasm is dampened as there is no single piece of evidence that is completely convincing on its own. While the various parts are of high quality, they are also circumstantial and require extensive hand-waving arguments to hold together. There is no &quot;nail in the coffin&quot; type experiment that unambiguously proves their point. Furthermore, key experiments are missing and some of the results are inconsistent with the authors' interpretation and model. These inconsistencies weaken the logical connections between the observations and the authors' interpretation of the data. The following issues need to be addressed to clarify and strengthen the arguments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The recorded NMR signals appear to an untrained eye weak and noisy. While we understand that this is unavoidable when working with detergent-solubilized large membrane proteins, we wonder how do the authors determine whether the differences between spectra are significant or are within the error of the experiment? It would be great if the authors commented on the decision-making and on how reproducible are the observed differences.</p><p>2) In the analysis of MD results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>, how does one evaluate whether differences between cross-linked and uncross-linked subunits are significant or not? For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref> right panel, the extracellular gates in two subunits show behaviors that by eye looks just as distinct as those of the cross-linked and uncross-linked subunits in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>. Could such variations be simply due to a chance? In other words, what statistical analysis, if any, can be applied to give numbers to the terms that the authors use: &quot;dampened&quot;, &quot;not significantly dampened&quot; (in description of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and &quot;dampened to a lesser extent&quot; (in description of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>)?</p><p>3) To justify the observation that the channel-like variant of CLC-ec1 is inhibited by the D417C crosslink, the authors argue that a relaxation of the Cl<sup>-</sup> pathway, besides the movement of E148, is necessary for Cl<sup>-</sup> movement. However, the evidence supporting this notion is minimal, just small movements seen in the MD simulations, and it is not clear whether these movements are indeed relevant for transport or not. It is therefore important to show that the NMR spectrum of the crosslinked channel-like mutant is different from that of the uncrosslinked one and more similar to that of the WT protein. If this were not possible (because the fraction of crosslinked channel-like mutant is too small) then the authors could test whether the spectrum of the crosslinked WT protein loses pH sensitivity. This experiment, in addition to supporting the authors' hypothesis of a conformational change in the pore, would also provide a much needed link between the conformational changes observed via the NMR to those prevented by the crosslink.</p><p>4) The authors' finding that the crosslink specifically inhibits the Cl<sup>-</sup> pathway while leaving the H<sup>+</sup> pathway largely unaltered is extremely troubling and in stark contrast to their transport model. If H<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> transport are tightly coupled then locking the transporter in one conformational state should result in parallel inhibition of both fluxes. The authors show that this is not the case for the Y445S mutant. The consequence of this observation is that the two processes are not tightly coupled and that H<sup>+</sup> transport can occur independent of Cl<sup>-</sup> movement and of any conformational changes occurring in the protein. This finding poses critical issues that need to be resolved:</p><p>i) As far as we understand, the H<sup>+</sup> fluxes are uphill transport not efflux. Where does the energy driving H<sup>+</sup> movement come from if there is no Cl<sup>-</sup> movement? The only ion out of equilibrium is Cl<sup>-</sup>, all others are at equilibrium. So if there is H<sup>+</sup> movement it must be coupled to Cl<sup>-</sup>. It could be argued that the crosslink &quot;rescues&quot; the mutation by acting on the intracellular gate, reducing leak or even making the transporter &quot;super-coupled&quot;. However this is incompatible with other parts of their arguments. Furthermore, this does not solve the issue of what is the energy source for H<sup>+</sup> transport extrapolated to the &quot;complete&quot; crosslink conditions and inhibition. Thus, this result is puzzling from a thermodynamic point of view.</p><p>ii) The stoichiometry of the Y445S mutant is ~39:1, yet the authors see that this mutant mediates ~40% of WT's H<sup>+</sup> transport rather than ~5% which would be expected for such an altered stoichiometry (assuming that the rate of the mutant is not much different from WT's). This should be clarified.</p><p>iii) In all proposed models (including the authors') H<sup>+</sup> transport requires a movement of E148 which, in turn, is coupled to movement of Cl<sup>-</sup> in the pore. How can this be reconciled with the finding that H<sup>+</sup> transport can occur with no Cl<sup>-</sup> movement and with no conformational changes?</p><p>iv) Protonation of E148 is energetically linked to Cl<sup>-</sup> binding. How can E148 become protonated/deprotonated if no Cl<sup>-</sup> is being transported?</p><p>5) The authors use CuP to promote crosslinking. However, they find that a large fraction of the thiols becomes oxidized and thus prevented from forming disulfide bonds, which then prevents formation of the crosslink. Have the authors tried other strategies to induce disulfide formation? Maybe ones that do not rely on the generation of local concentrations of reactive oxygen like CuP does? Since the inhibition of the crosslinked D417C mutant is the key piece of evidence linking the observed conformational changes to transport it is important to directly show that a completely crosslinked transporter is indeed fully inhibited.</p><p>6) The authors state that &quot;The question remains whether and how these conformational changes are involved in regulating ion binding and translocation during Cl<sup>-</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> transport.&quot; This question is not as open as the authors suggest. Basilio et al. showed that such conformational changes do occur and that they are strictly required for transport.</p><p>7) The authors show (subsection “H<sup>+</sup>-dependent accessibility of Y419 “and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) that the NMR peak corresponding to Y419 shifts and splits when pH is lowered. The authors interpret this (together with other evidence) as an indication that CLC-ec1 adopts different conformations. Can they use the relative weight of the peaks to estimate what fraction of the time CLC-ec1 spends in the OF state? The concern here is that low pH promotes turnover of the transporter and therefore it is plausible that rather than stabilizing a specific state this maneuver populates multiple states.</p><p>It is hard to follow the authors' reasoning when they conclude (subsection “H<sup>+</sup>-independent accessibility of Y419 in channel-likeClC-ec1”) that &quot;In channel-like E148A/Y445S, the accessibility of Y419 to TEMPOL indicates that the external Cl<sup>-</sup>-permeation pathway of the channel-like ClC-ec1 variant adopts a conformation in solution different from that observed in the crystal structure and similar to the conformation adopted by WT at low pH.&quot; Y419 is located quite far from the ion transport pathway, so while their data indicates that the environment surrounding this residue is indeed different in the WT and channel-like backgrounds, we do not see how that the same argument can be readily extended to the Cl<sup>-</sup> pathway.</p><p>8) A point omitted here which seems might go to the heart of the issue is that the PDB includes a single CLC crystal structure at pH 4.6, where the alternative outward-occluded structure of this manuscript is proposed to exist – the original 3.0 A structure of CLC from <italic>Salmonella</italic> (PDB 1KPL). We wonder if you see any differences in helices P, N, or F in this 'Glu<sub>ex</sub>-down' that might differ from the high-pH <italic>E. coli</italic> CLC structures? Any hints here?</p><p>9) We think that the authors are underinterpreting the crucial <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> data – the correlation of fraction of protein crosslinked and fractional inhibition of transport. They ask in the Discussion (fourth paragraph): why doesn't crosslinking completely inhibit activity? – and then they go into some handwaving to suggest various possibilities. But in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref> it could be concluded that to a first approximation, crosslinking fully inhibits. Granted, you cannot achieve 100% crosslinking because of the harsh CuP conditions, which, as you show, produce higher oxidation states of the thiol; but the linear correlation drawn on the figure suggests that if you could have gotten to 100%, you'd have less than 20% activity left, which might not be distinguishable, given the assays, from zero. It's of course always virtuous to be conservative in data interpretation, but this possibility ought to be mentioned along with the rather anodyne alternatives offered up to explain the 'residual activity' of the crosslinked protein.</p><p>10) More on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>. You rather do yourselves a disservice by presenting the flux data as you do. Your point is to illustrate the effect of crosslinking on the initial rate of transport – i.e. at early times. But the bulk of the figure is taken up, purposelessly, by the big jump by detergent that gives you the normalization value. we would leave out that big jump, expand the y-axis to put the early-time flux traces on a full-scale display, and just tell us in the legend or Methods, that fluxes are normalize to values obtained after dissolving the liposomes with Triton. This is not merely a matter of display-aesthetics; the reader would benefit from actually being able to see the degree of inhibition, which is hard to perceive with the meaningful parts of the traces all compressed into the lower 20% of the figure.</p><p>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>. Why do the efflux traces level off at only half the liposomes at the protein density you are using? I would expect all the liposomes to contain active CLCs.</p><p>12) In the MD simulations it would be good to know a bit more about how the special motion-types were identified. Specifically, the word &quot;extrapolated&quot; (subsection “Potential gate-opening motions inWT and cross-linkedClC-ec1”) in finding the looked-for collective motions raises skepticism about what, exactly, those Δ-r distances are in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. Do they represent actual frames in which the pathway is seen to be 2 A wider, or some sort of widening imagined by some sort of sophisticated extrapolation algorithm?</p><p>13) We would take issue with the cavalier use of the term &quot;large-scale motions&quot; to describe the sorts of wiggling you are envisioning. Of course, use of this phrase is subjective, but we think that most structural biologists would refer to these as 'breathing motions.' To call them large-scale might be viewed by many as tendentious.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11189.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions: 1) The recorded NMR signals appear to an untrained eye weak and noisy.

For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref> right panel, the extracellular gates in two subunits show behaviors that by eye looks just as distinct as those of the cross-linked and uncross-linked subunits in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>. Could such variations be simply due to a chance? In other words, what statistical analysis, if any, can be applied to give numbers to the terms that the authors use: &quot;dampened&quot;, &quot;not significantly dampened&quot; (in description of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and &quot;dampened to a lesser extent&quot; (in description of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>)?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. To more quantitatively compare the MD results on cross-linked and uncross-linked ClC-ec1, we counted dominant collective motions that can lead to an increase in the distance between residues lining the gates by Δr &gt; 1.5 Å. To statistically evaluate these counts, each individual extended simulation trajectory of the ClC-ec1 homodimer was divided evenly into three blocks (ref: chapter 4, p. 86, DC Rapaport, The Art of Molecular Dynamics Simulations (second edition) 2004, Cambridge University Press), providing a dataset of six segments (three for each subunit x 2 subunits). Statistical comparisons between datasets were made using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test (Annals of Mathematical Statistics 1947, 18, 50-60). The revised manuscript contains a description of this analysis (pages 30-31) and revised versions of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>, to show the statistical analysis.</p><p> <italic>3) To justify the observation that the channel-like variant of CLC-ec1 is inhibited by the D417C crosslink, the authors argue that a relaxation of the Cl<sup>-</sup> pathway, besides the movement of E148, is necessary for Cl<sup>-</sup> movement. However, the evidence supporting this notion is minimal, just small movements seen in the MD simulations, and it is not clear whether these movements are indeed relevant for transport or not. It is therefore important to show that the NMR spectrum of the crosslinked channel-like mutant is different from that of the uncrosslinked one and more similar to that of the WT protein. If this were not possible (because the fraction of crosslinked channel-like mutant is too small) then the authors could test whether the spectrum of the crosslinked WT protein loses pH sensitivity. This experiment, in addition to supporting the authors' hypothesis of a conformational change in the pore, would also provide a much needed link between the conformational changes observed via the NMR to those prevented by the crosslink.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers’ suggestion to measure the NMR spectrum of the cross-linked channel-like mutant is excellent. We attempted to purify the required “Y419only/D417C/E148A/Y445S” mutant, but unfortunately it was prone to aggregation even at concentrations lower than required for NMR experiments. The alternate experiment suggested is to measure the NMR spectrum of the cross-linked WT protein. Given that Y419 is in a loop that is likely quite flexible (as indicated by the fact that cross-linking Y419C does not inhibit function), we are concerned that some conformational change might remain at this position (thereby complicating interpretation of the data). Therefore, we chose to use double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy to measure distance at the site of interest (D417C) and provide a link between spectroscopically-detected pH-dependent conformational change and the conformational change prevented by the cross-link.</p><p>The inhibition observed upon cross-linking at D417C demonstrates that motions in this region are involved in ClC-ec1’s Cl<sup>-</sup>-transport function. Assuming the pH-dependent conformational change detected by NMR is reporting this same functional motion, then the pH-dependent conformational change involves an increase in the 417-417 inter-subunit distance. We directly tested this prediction using DEER to measure inter-subunit distances on spin labels attached to D417C ClC-ec1 as a function of pH. Consistent with our prediction, the inter-subunit distance increases when the pH is lowered (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). DEER measurements on spin-labeled D417C in channel-like ClC-ec1 provide a further link between the spectroscopically detected conformational changes and the cross-linking results: first, a decrease in pH does not shift the intersubunit distance distribution as in the WT background (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), consistent with the lack of pH dependence observed in the <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup>F NMR experiments on channel-like ClC-ec1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>); second, the inter-subunit distance distribution between labels on D417C in channel-like ClC-ec1 at pH 7.5 is greater than that observed in the WT at pH 7.5 and moves towards that observed in the WT at pH 4.5 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref> shows functional, CW-EPR, and DEER analysis for MTSSL-labeled ClC-ec1 variants.</p><p><italic>4) The authors' finding that the crosslink specifically inhibits the Cl<sup>-</sup> pathway while leaving the H<sup>+</sup> pathway largely unaltered is extremely troubling and in stark contrast to their transport model. If H<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> transport are tightly coupled then locking the transporter in one conformational state should result in parallel inhibition of both fluxes. The authors show that this is not the case for the Y445S mutant. The consequence of this observation is that the two processes are not tightly coupled and that H<sup>+</sup> transport can occur independent of Cl<sup>-</sup> movement and of any conformational changes occurring in the protein. This finding poses critical issues that need to be resolved:</italic> </p><p> <italic>i) As far as we understand, the H<sup>+</sup> fluxes are uphill transport not efflux. Where does the energy driving H<sup>+</sup> movement come from if there is no Cl<sup>-</sup> movement? The only ion out of equilibrium is Cl<sup>-</sup>, all others are at equilibrium. So if there is H<sup>+</sup> movement it must be coupled to Cl<sup>-</sup>. It could be argued that the crosslink &quot;rescues&quot; the mutation by acting on the intracellular gate, reducing leak or even making the transporter &quot;super-coupled&quot;. However this is incompatible with other parts of their arguments. Furthermore, this does not solve the issue of what is the energy source for H<sup>+</sup> transport extrapolated to the &quot;complete&quot; crosslink conditions and inhibition. Thus, this result is puzzling from a thermodynamic point of view.</italic> </p><p> <italic>ii) The stoichiometry of the Y445S mutant is ~39:1, yet the authors see that this mutant mediates ~40% of WT's H<sup>+</sup> transport rather than ~5% which would be expected for such an altered stoichiometry (assuming that the rate of the mutant is not much different from WT's). This should be clarified.</italic> </p><p> <italic>iii) In all proposed models (including the authors') H<sup>+</sup> transport requires a movement of E148 which, in turn, is coupled to movement of Cl<sup>-</sup> in the pore. How can this be reconciled with the finding that H<sup>+</sup> transport can occur with no Cl<sup>-</sup> movement and with no conformational changes?</italic> </p><p> <italic>iv) Protonation of E148 is energetically linked to Cl<sup>-</sup> binding. How can E148 become protonated/deprotonated if no Cl<sup>-</sup> is being transported?</italic> </p><p>We did not intend to imply that H<sup>+</sup> transport can occur independently of Cl<sup>-</sup> movement. Clarification of the Y445S cross-linking result and our interpretation of it is presented here, as well as through additional text in the manuscript.</p><p>Y445S is a highly uncoupled mutant that was originally characterized by Walden et al. (2007, J. Gen. Physiol.) to have a Cl<sup>-</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> stoichiometry of ~39:1. In this manuscript, we find that the D417C/Y445S double mutant is similarly uncoupled, with a stoichiometry of ~43:1, determined from taking the ratio of the Cl<sup>-</sup> transport rate (850 s<sup>-1</sup>, ~40% that of WT) to the H<sup>+</sup> transport rate (~20 s<sup>-1</sup>, ~2% that of WT). We determined stoichiometry of this mutant and all CLC-ec1 variants studied here by taking the ratio of the measured transport rates for Cl<sup>-</sup> and H<sup>+</sup>. This is now clarified in Methods.</p><p>Cross-linking the D417C/Y445S double mutant decreases the Cl<sup>-</sup>-transport rate but did not appear to decrease the H<sup>+</sup>-transport rate (original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>; current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our original interpretation of this result was that, as the reviewers suggest, the cross-link in effect “rescues” the mutation: as the Cl<sup>-</sup>-transport rate decreases, the stoichiometry increases. This effect does not violate any thermodynamic principles because at the maximal cross-linking (70%), the Cl<sup>-</sup>-turnover rate is ~300 s<sup>-1</sup>, the H<sup>+</sup>-turnover rate is ~20 s<sup>-1</sup>, yielding a stoichiometry of 16:1. This interpretation assumes that the Cl<sup>-</sup>-transport rate extrapolates to a low but non-zero value, such that at 100% cross-linking there is some Cl<sup>-</sup> transport remaining that is coupled to the H<sup>+</sup> transport. However, as the reviewers point out, given the uncertainty in measuring such low rates of H<sup>+</sup> transport (20 s<sup>-1</sup>), we agree that we likely overestimated our ability to conclude whether or not the cross-linking inhibits H<sup>+</sup> transport in D417C/Y445S ClC-ec1. We have therefore rewritten this part of the manuscript (subsection “Helix P cross-link specifically affects the Cl<sup>-</sup>-permeation pathway”, second paragraph) accordingly.</p><p><italic>5) The authors use CuP to promote crosslinking. However, they find that a large fraction of the thiols becomes oxidized and thus prevented from forming disulfide bonds, which then prevents formation of the crosslink. Have the authors tried other strategies to induce disulfide formation? Maybe ones that do not rely on the generation of local concentrations of reactive oxygen like CuP does? Since the inhibition of the crosslinked D417C mutant is the key piece of evidence linking the observed conformational changes to transport it is important to directly show that a completely crosslinked transporter is indeed fully inhibited.</italic> </p><p>We performed cross-linking experiments using HgCl<sub>2</sub>, following the protocol reported by Basilio et al. in their studies of ClC-ec1 cross-linking (Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol., 2014). Unfortunately, HgCl<sub>2</sub> is a much less effective catalyst of cross-linking the D417C mutant than is CuP (we used the A399C/A432C mutant generated by Basilio et al. as a positive control). Therefore, we have not been able to achieve 100% cross-linking. Whether or not the completely cross-linked transport is fully inhibited is discussed in point 9 below. We remain cautious in our interpretation of the data, and we think that regardless of whether the completely cross-linked transporter is fully inhibited, the results presented are important and informative of the CLC mechanism.</p><p> <italic>6) The authors state that &quot;The question remains whether and how these conformational changes are involved in regulating ion binding and translocation during Cl<sup>-</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> transport.&quot; This question is not as open as the authors suggest. Basilio et al. showed that such conformational changes do occur and that they are strictly required for transport.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for pointing out that we did not sufficiently elaborate on the important work of Basilio et al. in the Introduction. We clarified the sixth paragraph to emphasize that it is focused specifically on H<sup>+</sup>-dependent conformational change, and we added a more detailed description of the Basilio et al.results in the fourth paragraph.</p><p><italic>7) The authors show (subsection “H<sup>+</sup>-dependent accessibility of Y419 “and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) that the NMR peak corresponding to Y419 shifts and splits when pH is lowered. The authors interpret this (together with other evidence) as an indication that CLC-ec1 adopts different conformations. Can they use the relative weight of the peaks to estimate what fraction of the time CLC-ec1 spends in the OF state? The concern here is that low pH promotes turnover of the transporter and therefore it is plausible that rather than stabilizing a specific state this maneuver populates multiple states.</italic> </p><p>It is certainly possible that multiple states are populated at low pH (and also at high pH). Qualitatively, the relative areas of the two peaks appear similar, suggesting a comparable population between the two pH states. The split in the NMR peak could arise either from two conformational states of ClC-ec1 or from a tyrosine ring flip that occurs slowly on the NMR timescale. Additional experiments would be needed to tease apart these possibilities, however, since the overall interpretation of the data remains the same regardless of the reason for the peak split, these experiments were not prioritized. For example, this could be probed further by a series of temperature experiments to see if the peaks would combine to a single peak at higher temperatures (perhaps supporting the ring-flip), but the inherent instability of the protein at low pH and higher temperature would make this experiment challenging. Alternatively, using a 4F-Phe at position 419 instead of Tyr could also shed light onto the issue, but assessing the functional significance of a Tyr to Phe mutation at position 419, and the additional challenge of generating a Y419F-only mutant, were beyond the scope of our efforts. Our goal in these experiments is simply to shift the conformational equilibrium to increase the population of the OF state. As described above, we now show H<sup>+</sup>-dependent conformational change detected by DEER experiments on MTSSL-labeled D417C CLC-ec1 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). In the WT background, the distance distribution of the label at 417C is clearly pH-dependent. Although in principle DEER can be used to quantify populations, the range of distances present precludes an accurate quantification of the populations. However, the major point – that there is a pH-dependent shift in conformational equilibrium – is confirmed.</p><p><italic>It is hard to follow the authors' reasoning when they conclude (subsection “H<sup>+</sup>-independent accessibility of Y419 in channel-likeClC-ec1”) that &quot;In channel-like E148A/Y445S, the accessibility of Y419 to TEMPOL indicates that the external Cl<sup>-</sup>-permeation pathway of the channel-like ClC-ec1 variant adopts a conformation in solution different from that observed in the crystal structure and similar to the conformation adopted by WT at low pH.&quot; Y419 is located quite far from the ion transport pathway, so while their data indicates that the environment surrounding this residue is indeed different in the WT and channel-like backgrounds, we do not see how that the same argument can be readily extended to the Cl<sup>-</sup> pathway.</italic> </p><p>We agree this was an overstatement at this point and have modified the text accordingly: “In channel-like E148A/Y445S, the accessibility of Y419 to TEMPOL indicates that the channel-like ClC-ec1 variant adopts a conformation in solution different from that observed in the crystal structure and similar to the conformation adopted by WT at low pH.”</p><p><italic>8) A point omitted here which seems might go to the heart of the issue is that the PDB includes a single CLC crystal structure at pH 4.6, where the alternative outward-occluded structure of this manuscript is proposed to exist</italic> –</p><p><italic>the original 3.0 A structure of CLC from Salmonella (PDB 1KPL). We wonder if you see any differences in helices P, N, or F in this 'Glu<sub>ex</sub>-down' that might differ from the high-pH E. coli CLC structures? Any hints here?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for the comment. Indeed, one would expect to see structural differences in a CLC crystallized at low pH, though of course a crystal-seeding step need not involve the predominant species in solution, and thus the Le Chatelier effect can lead to crystallization of a minority species. Nevertheless, one would hope to catch a glimpse of the OF<sub>occluded</sub> or OF<sub>open</sub> states. Instead, the high-pH (1OTS) and low-pH (1KPL) X-ray structures are virtually identical (C-α RMSD 1.0 Å; Helix N/P all-atom RMSD 0.7 Å). In addition, the side chains of key residues (Glu<sub>ex</sub> (E148), F357, L361, L411, M415, D417, and Y419) are similarly positioned. The radius profile of the Cl<sup>-</sup> transport tunnel reveals an extracellular-gate constriction as observed in ClC-ec1 (plus, interestingly, an additional constriction region towards the extracellular side of the ion-permeation pathway). This information has been added to the manuscript in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>9) We think that the authors are underinterpreting the crucial <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> data</italic> – <italic>the correlation of fraction of protein crosslinked and fractional inhibition of transport. They ask in the Discussion (fourth paragraph): why doesn't crosslinking completely inhibit activity?</italic> – <italic>and then they go into some handwaving to suggest various possibilities. But in Figure</italic></p><p><italic>4C and D it could be concluded that to a first approximation, crosslinking fully inhibits. Granted, you cannot achieve 100% crosslinking because of the harsh CuP conditions, which, as you show, produce higher oxidation states of the thiol; but the linear correlation drawn on the figure suggests that if you could have gotten to 100%, you'd have less than 20% activity left, which might not be distinguishable, given the assays, from zero. It's of course always virtuous to be conservative in data interpretation, but this possibility ought to be mentioned along with the rather anodyne alternatives offered up to explain the 'residual activity' of the crosslinked protein.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for making this point. To address the issue, we re-plotted all of the cross-linking data as individual points (rather than averages of 2-4 experiments) indicating absolute (instead of relative) turnover rates, fit these data to linear regressions, and estimated the 95% confidence interval for the activity at 100% cross-linking. These values are summarized in the new <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. It does appear that there is some residual activity at 100% cross-linking, at least in some of the mutants, though given compounding uncertainties in the experimental measurement it is possible that the residual activity is not distinguishable from zero. For example, the turnover rate of un-crosslinked D417C/E148A is as low as the extrapolated value for the turnover of fully cross-linked D417C (~270 s<sup>-1</sup>), yet cross-linking of D417C/E148A further reduces this activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). This result emphasizes that the extrapolated values provide only an estimate for turnover of fully cross-linked transporters. We have now included in Discussion (fourth paragraph) the possibility that the residual activity is not distinguishable from zero.</p><p> <italic>10) More on Figure</italic></p><p><italic>4D. You rather do yourselves a disservice by presenting the flux data as you do. Your point is to illustrate the effect of crosslinking on the initial rate of transport – i.e. at early times. But the bulk of the figure is taken up, purposelessly, by the big jump by detergent that gives you the normalization value. we would leave out that big jump, expand the y-axis to put the early-time flux traces on a full-scale display, and just tell us in the legend or Methods, that fluxes are normalize to values obtained after dissolving the liposomes with Triton. This is not merely a matter of display-aesthetics; the reader would benefit from actually being able to see the degree of inhibition, which is hard to perceive with the meaningful parts of the traces all compressed into the lower 20% of the figure.</italic> </p><p>The figures have been revised as suggested.</p><p><italic>11) Figure</italic></p><p><italic>4F. Why do the efflux traces level off at only half the liposomes at the protein density you are using? I would expect all the liposomes to contain active CLCs.</italic> </p><p>For experiments on channel-like CLC, we used the low range of protein density reported in Methods, 0.2 µg per mg lipid. At this density, we expect roughly half of the liposomes to contain active CLCs, as has been observed by others (for example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> of Walden et al., 2007). We have added a sentence to the Methods to make it clear that the low end of the range was used in experiments on channel-like ClC-ec1.</p><p><italic>12) In the MD simulations it would be good to know a bit more about how the special motion-types were identified. Specifically, the word &quot;extrapolated&quot; (subsection “Potential gate-opening motions inWT and cross-linkedClC-ec1”) in finding the looked-for collective motions raises skepticism about what, exactly, those Δ</italic></p><p><italic>-r distances are in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. Do they represent actual frames in which the pathway is seen to be 2 A wider, or some sort of widening imagined by some sort of sophisticated extrapolation algorithm?</italic></p><p>Thank you for requesting this important clarification. The idea behind our analysis is that a simple equilibrium simulation may not be long enough to show a complete collective motion (due to timescale limitation), <italic>but</italic> one may capture the beginning of it. So, we first use PCA-based collective motion analysis to identify motions from an equilibrium simulation, then we induce larger conformational changes along those motions (similar to the idea of exciting particular normal modes). For example, suppose a 0.5 Å separation of two domains is observed as a collective motion during an equilibrium simulation. We next excite this mode (i.e., move the protein further along this particular deformation/vibration/mode), finding the displacement vector that defines this mode and multiplying it by a factor larger than 1 so as to deform the protein along the identified pathway.</p><p>We do this analysis for the top 20 collective motions of both WT and cross-linked species; how far we go along the vector is based on an arbitrary RMSD that we define as a constant for all of the collective motions that we studied individually. The point of the analysis is to find out how many of the top 20 collective motions of the protein that have been detected during the equilibrium simulation can result in significant motions in the gating regions of the protein. The analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) shows that in the cross-linked species, the coupling between the global fluctuations of the protein (top 20 collective motions capturing 75% of the motion observed in our equilibrium simulations) and gating elements has been reduced. In other words, the protein dynamics “energy” is less funneled into motions that can be used for gating. Or put another way, thermal fluctuations of the protein are now along other degrees of freedom and less engaging gating elements. We have extensively revised the Results and Methods sections (subsections “Potential gate-opening motions in WT and cross-linked ClC-ec1” and Analysis of collective motions of protein”) to clarify these points.</p><p> <italic>13) We would take issue with the cavalier use of the term &quot;large-scale motions&quot; to describe the sorts of wiggling you are envisioning. Of course, use of this phrase is subjective, but we think that most structural biologists would refer to these as 'breathing motions.' To call them large-scale might be viewed by many as tendentious.</italic></p><p>The use of the term “large-scale motions” has been eliminated as suggested.</p></body></sub-article></article>
