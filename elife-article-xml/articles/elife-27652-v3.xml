Whether IL10R regulates lamina propria macrophage function during infant development in mice and whether macrophage-intrinsic IL10R signaling is required to prevent colitis in infancy is unknown. Here we show that although signs of colitis are absent in IL10R-deficient mice during the first two weeks of life, intestinal inflammation and macrophage dysfunction begin during the third week of life, concomitant with weaning and accompanying diversification of the intestinal microbiota. However, IL10R did not directly regulate the microbial ecology during infant development. Interestingly, macrophage depletion with clodronate inhibited the development of colitis, while the absence of IL10R specifically on macrophages sensitized infant mice to the development of colitis. These results indicate that IL10R-mediated regulation of macrophage function during the early postnatal period is indispensable for preventing the development of murine colitis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.27652.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27652.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27652.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Inflammation is an immune response that helps the body to repair damaged tissues and defend itself against bacteria and other harmful microbes. Immune cells called macrophages stimulate inflammation when they detect bacteria and other microbes. However, the strength of the inflammatory response is tightly controlled to prevent too much inflammation when it is not necessary. There is evidence that an inability to control the activity of macrophages can lead to excessive inflammation that can in itself cause injury.</p><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases, including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, occur when the intestine becomes inflamed in response to the bacteria that normally live there. Most patients with these diseases first present symptoms as young adults, but in rare cases the symptoms appear during infancy. Some patients who develop symptoms early in life carry a mutation in a gene encoding IL10R, a receptor protein that normally inhibits the ability of macrophages to cause inflammation. However, it was not known exactly when the inflammation begins in infants.</p><p>Mice are often used in research as models of human health and disease. Redhu et al. investigated the role of IL10R in the intestines of infant mice. These experiments showed that the intestines of mutant mice that lacked the IL10R protein became inflamed as they were weaned from breast milk to a solid diet. This inflammation was accompanied by a greater increase in the number of actively recruited macrophages in the intestine of mutant mice compared to normal mice. Further experiments revealed that macrophages in the mutant mice activate many genes involved in inflammation. The transition from breast milk to a solid diet is accompanied by large increases in intestinal bacteria. Treating the mice with antibiotics decreased the number of bacteria in the intestines and reduced the level of inflammation, as did treating the mice with a compound that killed macrophages.</p><p>The findings of Redhu et al. suggest that IL10R prevents macrophages from causing inflammation when infant mice are weaned. This, in turn, suggests that treatments that modify intestinal macrophages, as well as bacteria, could help infants that have, or are at risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease. In the longer-term, these findings might also aid the development of new treatments for older patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.27652.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27652.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>inflammatory bowel disease</kwd><kwd>infant</kwd><kwd>Interleukin 10</kwd><kwd>Interleukin 10 receptor</kwd><kwd>macrophage</kwd><kwd>intestine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001063</institution-id><institution>Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RFA381023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Redhu</surname><given-names>Naresh S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201411MFE-339308-254788</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Redhu</surname><given-names>Naresh S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-OD010978-26</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fox</surname><given-names>James G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007028</institution-id><institution>Leona M. and Harry B.

While IBD susceptibility is generally considered to arise from complex genetic risk in adolescent and adult patients, those who develop symptoms during infancy (age &lt;2), or before 6 years of age (very early onset IBD, VEOIBD), often present with disease refractory to conventional therapies and are more likely to have disease-causative single gene mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Uhlig et al., 2014</xref>). A detailed understanding of disease pathogenesis in infants, as well as model systems that recapitulate infantile-onset IBD, may lead to fundamental insights into the etiology of IBD, and identify novel therapeutic strategies. In this regard, rare loss-of-function mutations in <italic>IL10</italic>, or its receptors <italic>IL10RA</italic> or <italic>IL10RB</italic> in humans lead to infantile onset IBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Glocker et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shouval et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kotlarz et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that the IL10/IL10R pathway is essential for intestinal mucosal homeostasis and prevention of intestinal inflammation in infancy. Thus, modeling infantile-onset colitis in mice that lack functional IL10R signaling could lead to significant advances in our understanding of the etiopathogenesis of these diseases.</p><p>IL10 is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine that inhibits proinflammatory and co-stimulatory function in both innate and adaptive immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding and Shevach, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fiorentino et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saraiva and O'Garra, 2010</xref>). Like humans, mice deficient in IL10 or the IL10R on the 129SvEv background develop chronic spontaneous colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kühn et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Spencer et al., 1998</xref>), strongly supporting the concept that IL10 signaling plays a central role in preventing mucosal inflammation. These murine models have enabled investigations into the cellular and microbial factors that contribute to the development of IBD. However, because colitis in these models presents after an extended latency, understanding the developmental events early in life that contribute to disease development remain to be defined.</p><p>The IL10 receptor (IL10R) is a heterotetramer consisting of two chains of ligand-binding IL10Rα (IL10R1) and two subunits of signaling IL10Rβ (IL10R2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Donnelly et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moore et al., 2001</xref>). The IL10R is expressed on cells of both the innate and adaptive immune compartments and a number of studies have highlighted the role of IL10R on subsets of regulatory T cells and T helper 17 (Th17) cells in preventing the development of colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chaudhry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kamanaka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Murai et al., 2009</xref>). Recently, we and others have demonstrated a requirement for IL10R in innate immune cells to prevent murine colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shouval et al., 2014b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zigmond et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, we have shown excessive accumulation of inflammatory Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes within the colons of colitic IL10R-deficient mice as well as defects in the differentiation of both murine and human anti-inflammatory macrophages (MΦs) defective in IL10R signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shouval et al., 2014b</xref>). It has previously been shown that intestinal microbiota promotes the accumulation of Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes within the lamina propria (LP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bain et al., 2014</xref>) and there is ample evidence that the microbiota is intimately involved in the development of colitis in many susceptible mouse models including mice lacking IL10 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sellon et al., 1998</xref>). Taken together, these studies imply that IL10R signaling on intestinal MΦs prevents microbially-driven recruitment of Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes and the development of intestinal inflammation.</p><p>While the studies outlined above demonstrate the critical role of IL10R signaling within MΦs in preventing inflammatory responses in the large intestine, the colitis that develops spontaneously in mice that are completely-deficient in IL10R or that specifically lack IL10R within CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> MΦs manifest with a prolonged latency of several weeks, and is strain- and microbiota-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kühn et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Spencer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zigmond et al., 2014</xref>). Given that colitis in infants lacking functional IL10R is an aggressive disease that presents very early in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Glocker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shouval et al., 2014a</xref>), it is unclear whether the same cellular mechanisms observed in adult mice lacking IL10R are in fact operating within the time frame of infant development. Furthermore, it has not been determined whether specific developmental events during the post-partum period such as initial bacterial colonization at the time of birth, or the diversification of the infant microbiome that occurs at the time of weaning are influenced by the absence of IL10R and/or play catalytic roles in driving inflammation in the absence of IL10R.</p><p>To address these issues, we performed detailed time-series experiments using IL10R-deficient infant mice and their littermate co-housed controls, and evaluated histology, inflammatory gene expression, cellular composition of the LP, and luminal bacterial communities from birth to 14 weeks of age. We used clodronate depletion to investigate the role of colonic MΦs in colonic inflammation that develops in infant IL10R-deficient mice. In addition, we analyzed the onset of colitis in crosses between C57BL/6 mice lacking IL10Rα specifically in MΦs and those carrying a genetic locus driving colitis susceptibility, <italic>Cdcs1</italic>, neither of which independently develop colitis.

However, IL10Rβ is also a component of other receptor complexes including the receptors for IL22, IL26, and IFNλ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Donnelly et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the pathology observed in infant mice is secondary to the absence of additional cytokine receptor signaling (specifically IL22R which has an important role in epithelial cell function) rather than the absence of the IL10 receptor itself. To address these issues, we employed <italic>Il10ra<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice in which the IL22R, IL26R, and IFNλR are intact. As <italic>Il10ra<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were only available on the C57BL/6 background, and do not develop spontaneous colitis in our vivarium (data not shown), <italic>Il10ra<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were crossed to cytokine deficiency-induced colitis susceptibility (<italic>Cdcs)1</italic> congeneic mice (C57BL/6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bleich et al., 2010</xref>). This congenic <italic>Cdcs1</italic> strain harbors a region on chromosome originally identified in C3H/HeJBir mice, which increases colitis susceptibility of immunodeficient mice on the C57BL/6 background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beckwith et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farmer et al., 2001</xref>). While infant <italic>Cdcs1<sup>+/+</sup>Il10ra<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice (control) were asymptomatic, 100% of <italic>Cdcs1<sup>+/+</sup>Il10ra<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice developed moderate multifocal proliferative granulocytic colitis with crypt abscesses and loss of goblet cells at 3 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). By 12 weeks, most of the <italic>Cdcs1<sup>+/+</sup>Il10ra<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice developed severe diffuse proliferative granulocytic colitis with loss of goblet cells (data not shown). Consistent with data from <italic>Il10rb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), the 3 week old <italic>Cdcs1<sup>+/+</sup>Il10ra<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice also displayed increased numbers of LP MΦ populations and a skewing of the frequency towards the P1/P2 populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>), and increased IFNγ<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> effector T cells (data not shown).

However, it is important to note that as we did not directly compare the phenotype of mice lacking IL10Rα and IL10Rβ, there may be difference in the phenotype of mice lacking these two components based on differing functions of these receptor components themselves, or conversely due to differences in genetic background or resident microbiota in these two strains.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27652.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>IL10Rα is necessary to prevent intestinal inflammation in infant mice.</title><p><italic>Il10ra<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (C57BL/6) were crossed with congenic <italic>Cdcs1</italic> mice and the development of spontaneous colitis was investigated.

This suggests that during this developmental window a pathway is activated with the potential to induce intestinal inflammation in the absence of physiological IL10R signaling in MΦs. One significant change that occurs during this period is the transition from breast milk to solid food, and the rapid diversification in the intestinal microbiome that ensues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schloss et al., 2012</xref>). It has previously been shown that antibiotics can inhibit colitis that develops in infant IL10Rβ-deficient mice expressing a dominant negative (dn) TGFβRII in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kang et al., 2008</xref>), and further that Gram-positive bacteria promote monocyte/ MΦ recruitment into the colonic LP during DSS colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakanishi et al., 2015</xref>). However, the role of the intestinal microbiota in promoting alterations in MΦ phenotype and inflammation in mice solely lacking the IL10 receptor has not been determined. To assess this, we added a cocktail of broad-spectrum antibiotics including metronidazole, vancomycin, ampicillin, and neomycin (termed Abx), or selective antibiotics that preferentially target Gram-negative organisms (polymyxin B) or Gram-positive organisms (vancomycin) to the drinking water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atarashi et al., 2011</xref>) of pregnant dams, which was then continued after pups were born.

There are at least two possible explanations for this phenomenon. One possibility is that IL10R is necessary on MΦs to prevent excessive microbially-induced inflammation. The second is that the presence of IL10R on MΦs prevents the acquisition of inflammatory microbiota and the development of a dysbiotic state.

However, rare patients with causative single gene defects can present in infancy (age &lt;2), or at an age less than 6 years (VEOIBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Uhlig et al., 2014</xref>). A prime example of this is IL10R deficiency which often presents in the first 2 years of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shouval et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Glocker et al., 2011</xref>). However, because commonly used mouse models lacking IL10R signaling do not exhibit overt signs of colitis until adulthood, there is a paucity of information regarding requirements for IL10R signaling during infancy. Given the rapid developmental changes in intestinal physiology, immune system responsiveness, diet, and the microbiome that occur during the first weeks of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arrieta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pantoja-Feliciano et al., 2013</xref>), characterizing the function of IL10R signaling during this period could reveal fundamental regulatory processes that are essential to preventing IBD in infancy, and may aid our understanding of the pathological mechanisms driving IBD in general. To this end, we have provided a detailed analysis of the function of IL10R signaling during infant development using a series of genetically modified mice.</p><p>Here we demonstrate that although there are no signs of inflammation within the intestine of IL10R-deficient mice less than 14 days of age, IL10R is required to prevent an intestinal inflammatory response that emerges during the third week of life. Consistent with previous work suggesting that IL10R signaling in MΦs prevents excessive lower bowel inflammation in various models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shouval et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zigmond et al., 2014</xref>), the onset of intestinal inflammation in 3 week old <italic>Il10rb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice was associated with increased numbers of LP MΦs, as well as an inversion in the ratio of newly recruited P1/P2 MΦ populations and resident P3/P4 MΦs. Further, while resident P3/P4 MΦs typically exhibit an anti-inflammatory phenotype, RNA-seq analyses indicated that the anti-inflammatory phenotype of IL10R-deficient LP MΦs was compromised at the onset of inflammation, suggesting that altered MΦ phenotype had a causative role in initiating the inflammatory process. In contrast to a clear alteration in LP MΦ phenotype between 2 and 3 week old IL10R-deficient mice, significant alterations in effector T cell populations were not consistently observed. Consistent with a key role for MΦs, we found that clodronate-mediated depletion of MΦs inhibited colitis, and that the lack of IL10Rα specifically on MΦs led to the development of aggressive colitis in 3–4 week old C57BL/6 <italic>Cdcs1</italic> congenic mice. Interestingly, while treatment with antibiotics suppressed inflammation in 3–4 week old mice lacking the IL10R, we found no evidence that IL10R regulated microbiota composition during infancy. These results strongly support a model in which IL10R signaling is required on MΦs to prevent a microbiota-driven inflammatory response that develops during the third week of infant life. Understanding the factors that drive this response, and delineating how IL10 inhibits this, could uncover essential pathways that regulate the development of intestinal inflammation in infants.</p><p>A central question raised by this study is why colonic inflammation in IL10R-deficient mice is first detected in the third week of life. Certainly, one of the most obvious changes in this time frame is the transition from breast milk to solid food, with the concomitant introduction of complex dietary carbohydrates. Multiple aspects of physiology change at the time of weaning (weaning transition), including rapid expansion of the microbiota, alterations in intestinal metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arrieta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pantoja-Feliciano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blacher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Torow et al., 2017</xref>), and the replacement of yolk-sac derived intestinal MΦs with MΦs derived from circulating monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bain et al., 2014</xref>). While hard-wired developmental programs may underlie some aspects of these events, it is conceivable that preventing access to solid food may interfere with expansion of the microbiota observed at the time of weaning, and further that the presence of intestinal microbiota catalyzes the replacement of yolk-sac derived intestinal MΦs with monocyte-derived MΦs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bain et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the weaning transition appears to induce a series of events that remodels intestinal homeostasis, and in the process, activates a pathway whose inflammatory potential is held in check by IL10R signaling.</p><p>The role of microbiota in driving intestinal inflammation in immunodeficient strains is well appreciated, and it has been suggested that dysbiosis caused by underlying immune dysregulation may be sufficient to cause colitis in some situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garrett et al., 2007</xref>). While our studies are consistent with previous studies demonstrating that colitis in IL10-deficient mice is attenuated under germ-free conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sellon et al., 1998</xref>), and that antibiotics can prevent colitis in mice lacking IL10Rβ, or those lacking IL10Rβ and concurrently expressing dnTGFβRII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kang et al., 2008</xref>), the lack of dysbiosis in mice deficient in IL10R suggests that IL10 is not regulating the microbiome per se. Therefore, it appears unlikely that a direct effect of IL10R signaling on the microbiome is responsible for the colitis that develops in infant IL10R-deficient mice. In contrast, it was previously reported that IL10-deficient and WT mice exhibit significant differences in microbial diversity and composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maharshak et al., 2013</xref>). Differences between our results and these previous results might be due to differences in the experimental design, endogenous institutional microbiota, and the nature of the animals models used. For instance, in our study IL10R-deficient and control mice were born and co-housed under SPF condition, whereas in the prior study adult germ-free IL10-deficient and WT mice were recolonized with SPF microbiota and then housed separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maharshak et al., 2013</xref>). Nonetheless, the fact that loss in microbial diversity followed the increase in intestinal inflammation in IL10-deficient mice suggested that dysbiosis was a secondary event to inflammation in the IL10-deficient model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maharshak et al., 2013</xref>). On the other hand, it is certainly possible that the increase in bacterial diversity that is observed at the weaning transition leads to colonization by microbes with augmented inflammatory potential compared to those present in the immediate post-natal period, such as the potential pathobiont <italic>H. ganmani</italic>, thereby revealing a requirement for IL10R signaling that was not present prior to weaning. Notably, it has been shown that colonization of germ-free IL10-deficient mice with <italic>H. hepaticus</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> but not either species alone, led to severe typhlocolitis in germ-free IL10-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Whary et al., 2011</xref>), indicating that colonization with a Gram-negative pathobiont (<italic>Helicobacter</italic>) in association with other microbes is sufficient to drive intestinal inflammation in susceptible murine strains, and raising the possibility that the expansion of <italic>H. ganmani</italic> in the context of other non-pathogenic flora is responsible for development of infantile colitis in our model. The previous observation that inflammation in <italic>Il10<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, positive for <italic>Helicobacter sp.</italic>, is abrogated in mice specifically lacking the TLR signaling adaptor MyD88 in mononuclear phagocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoshi et al., 2012</xref>) indicates the likely importance of direct pathogen recognition, including that of <italic>Helicobacter sp.</italic> and potential other colitis-triggering microbes, for the development of intestinal inflammation in the absence of IL10R signaling.</p><p>The increase in microbial diversity observed at the weaning transition also coincides with the initiation of monocyte recruitment into the LP, and replacement of yolk sac-derived LP MΦs with monocyte-derived MΦs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bain et al., 2014</xref>). It is unclear whether inflammation in infant <italic>Il10rb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice is driven by resident MΦs or the newly recruited monocyte-derived MΦs. The data from our clodronate experiments demonstrated that a phagocytic cell is responsible for driving inflammation in the infant IL10R-deficient mice but whether this is due to newly recruited monocyte/MΦs is an open question. Interestingly, while blocking monocyte recruitment by using a CCR2-neutralizing antibody (MC21) inhibited DSS-induced colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zigmond et al., 2012</xref>), in a preliminary experiment we were unable to detect significant differences in the colonic expression of inflammatory genes including <italic>Il12b</italic>, <italic>Ifng, Tnf</italic>, and <italic>Il1b</italic> between isotype and MC21 antibody-treated 3 week old <italic>Il10rb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice despite markedly decreased infiltration of Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells (data not shown). Consistent with this preliminary experiment, it has previously been demonstrated that genetic loss of CCR2 did not reverse colonic inflammation in IL10-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoshi et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, monocyte recruitment was not completely blocked in <italic>Il10<sup>-/-</sup>Ccr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, suggesting that there might be alternate and potentially redundant mechanisms of monocyte recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoshi et al., 2012</xref>) in these models, and therefore the question of exactly which clodronate-sensitive monocyte/MΦ population drives inflammation in IL10/IL10R deficiency remains open.</p><p>Although we did not perform lineage-tracing experiments, by evaluating macrophage phenotype in early infancy we have presumably examined the function of IL10R-deficient MΦs that are of yolk-sac origin. While it has been previously proposed that the function of yolk sac and monocyte-derived LP MΦs are quite similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bain et al., 2014</xref>), we were surprised to find that prior to the weaning transition, the gene expression profiles of LP MΦs of presumed yolk sac origin from IL10R-deficient mice closely matched gene expression profiles obtained from MΦs isolated from control mice, and lacked strong pro-inflammatory gene expression. These results suggest that LP MΦs of yolk sac origin maintain an anti-inflammatory state even in the absence of IL10R signaling. While the absence of an inflammatory phenotype in IL10R-deficient LP MΦs prior to weaning may be explained by exogenous factors such as difference in the microbiota or diet prior to and after weaning, it is also possible that this phenotype is a result of fundamental differences in MΦ lineages. Understanding the basis for differences in the phenotype of IL10R-deficient LP MΦs prior to and after weaning is an important line of future investigation, and should such studies suggest that there are intrinsic differences in the phenotype of IL10R-deficient LP MΦs prior to weaning, detailed analysis of transcriptional regulation in infant IL10R-deficient LP MΦs could reveal IL10R-independent pathways that inhibit MΦ inflammatory responses. Identification of these pathways could lead to novel therapeutic approaches to patients with defects in IL10R signaling.</p><p>While our study clearly demonstrates the importance of IL10R signaling on MΦs to prevent intestinal inflammation in the infant mouse, the exact mechanisms through which IL10 signaling inhibits inflammatory gene expression in LP MΦs is not completely understood. We have recently shown that IL10 rapidly inhibits LPS-induced enhancer activation in bone marrow-derived MΦs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conaway et al., 2017</xref>), but do not yet know whether the absence of IL10R signaling influences the function of enhancers in LP MΦs. Further, it remains unclear whether the critical function of IL10R is to directly inhibit inflammatory gene expression in MΦs or alternatively to promote production of a factor with a broad inhibitory function. Although it is clear that IL10R signaling strongly inhibits a group of inflammation-induced genes, the ability of a relatively small number of adoptively transferred IL10R-sufficient MΦs to suppress the development of colitis in <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>Il10rb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice reconstituted with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shouval et al., 2014b</xref>) suggests that WT MΦs exert a dominant effect over IL10R-deficient MΦs. This type of effect is more compatible with a requirement for IL10R to induce production of an inhibitory factor than an intrinsic requirement to prevent inflammatory gene expression. Further studies using mixed radiation chimeras with congenically marked control and IL10R-deficient MΦs will be necessary to fully understand this issue.</p><p>Collectively, our data indicate that IL10R signaling in MΦs is pivotal in confining a microbiota-driven inflammatory response beginning at the third week of life. Alterations in colonic LP anti-inflammatory MΦ phenotype is a key early event initiating this inflammatory cascade. While further directed experiments are still needed to address the primary function of IL10R in resident colonic MΦs during infant development, it is enticing to speculate that the intestinal inflammation observed in infants lacking IL10R signaling may be based on the inability of host MΦs to control the inflammatory potential of the expanding intestinal microbiota. In short, our data has uncovered a critical ‘window of opportunity’ to further dissect the mechanism(s) leading to the development of infantile colitis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p><italic>Il10rb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (<italic>Il10rb<sup>tm1Agt</sup></italic>) (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:3603437">MGI:3603437</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shouval et al., 2014b</xref>) mice were maintained on the 129SvEv background. <italic>Il10ra<sup>fl/fl</sup> (</italic>C.129P2-<italic>Il10r<sup>tm1(flox)Greifswald</sup>)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pils et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>Il10ra</italic><sup>-/-</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pils et al., 2010</xref>)<italic>, Lyz2<sup>Cre</sup></italic> (B6.129P2-<italic>Lyz2<sup>tm1(cre)Ifo</sup></italic>/J), also known as LysM<sup>Cre</sup> (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:004781">IMSR_JAX:004781</ext-link>) (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME), and <italic>Cdcs1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> (B6.C3Bir-<italic>Cdcs1</italic> (BC-R)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bleich et al., 2010</xref>) mice were maintained on the C57BL/6 background.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Christoph Mueller (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper is a valuable detailed analysis of the early changes of the IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) deficiency in mice and its pro-inflammatory consequences around the time of weaning germane to the monogenic IL-10R causes of chronic intestinal inflammation in young children. These include colonic pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression and compensatory IL-10 expression. There are increased P1 and P2 macrophage populations in IL-10Rbeta-deficient animals, whereas their P3/4 populations have an inflammatory signature. The inflammatory phenotype is shown to be macrophage-dependent through depletion using clodronate liposomes or macrophage-specific deletion of the IL-10Ralpha receptor. Broad-spectrum antibiotics to reduce the intestinal microbial biomass ameliorate the inflammatory phenotype, with polymyxin B alone (targeting Gram-negatives) being more effective than vancomycin (targeting Gram-positives). No effects of the IL-10R host trait were seen on microbiota α or β diversity, or Helicobacter levels, although the consortial composition required to drive inflammation remains unclear.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major point was the detailed microbial requirements to drive the inflammatory phenotype. Is exposure to the molecular signature from Gram-negative microbes (i.e. is LPS generically sufficient from any Gram-negative) or is it triggered by colonization by a context-dependent pathobiont beyond the resolution of the ordination analysis?</p><p>It was also noted that in a previous article (reference 20) on a related topic, the kinetics of intestinal inflammation observed in <italic>IL10rb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice was more attenuated (reference 20, page 709: &quot;we evaluated <italic>Il10rb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice at 5 weeks of age that lacked any clinical (data not shown), endoscopic, or histologic signs of intestinal inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>)&quot; and in that study (reference 20) for rapid colitis induction adoptive transfer of colitogenic CD4 T cells into <italic>IL10rb<sup>-/-</sup> Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice was used. In the present study, the <italic>IL10rb-</italic> and <italic>IL10rb<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice were found to be colonized with <italic>Helicobacter sp.</italic> around day 17 of age as assessed by 16S RNA pyrosequencing. Whilst formal rederivation to monocolonised or <italic>Helicobacter</italic>-free status is not necessarily considered within the current scope, please address whether differences in the microbial composition (notably, for <italic>Helicobacter sp.</italic>) might account for these differences between the two reports. The caveats to address how microbiota constraints may be responsible for the phenotype need to be included in the Discussion?</p><p>2) Comment on whether you have examined the relevance of the mechanisms of inhibition of inflammatory gene transcription in BMDMs by IL-10 (previous publication JI 2017, 198, 2906-2915) in the context of macrophages in this model.</p><p>3) Specifically clarify the question of chromosome trait dominance determination. The text and figure legends are unclear about exactly when littermates or wild-type age-matched mice were used (compare the subsection “Mice” of Materials and methods and Figure legends 1 and 2).</p><p>4) <italic>IL10ra<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>IL10rb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice on a different genetic background were used. <italic>IL10Rb</italic> deficient mice were maintained on a 129SvEv background, while <italic>IL10ra</italic> deficient mice were used on a <italic>Cdcs1</italic>- congenic, C57BL/6 background. While the colitogenic locus identified in 129SvEv mice (Hiccs) phenocopies most of the effects seen with the <italic>Cdcs1</italic> locus, Hiccs overlaps only with the most telomeric sublocus of <italic>Cdcs1</italic> (Boulard et al., J Exp Med. 209: 1309-24; 2012). Hence, it remains to be seen whether differences seen in <italic>IL10ra</italic>, and <italic>IL10rb</italic> deficient mice are due to the differential binding of other ligands to <italic>IL10ra</italic>, and <italic>IL10rb</italic>; a distinct composition of the intestinal microbiota; notably, of Helicobacter species, and/or the genetic background of the mouse strains. These possibilities need to be considered in the interpretation of the data.</p><p>5) While the authors comment that other work has suggested that CCR2 may not be required for myeloid cell infiltration in some models of colitis, neonatal mice have not been examined in this way. In view of the marked infiltration by monocytes reported here, it should be clear if the authors have conducted any experiments on a potential role for CCR2 in their models.</p><p>6) The authors do not have direct support for their conclusion that embryonically and monocyte-derived macrophages may have intrinsic differences in their regulation by IL10. This idea is based only on comparing macrophages from mice before (embryonic) and after (monocyte derived) the onset of the changes in the microbiota at weaning. Thus, the differences seem likely to reflect the combined effect of microbial stimulation and the absence of IL10 control, rather than an effect of the source of macrophages.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27652.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) A major point was the detailed microbial requirements to drive the inflammatory phenotype. Is exposure to the molecular signature from Gram-negative microbes (i.e. is LPS generically sufficient from any Gram-negative) or is it triggered by colonization by a context-dependent pathobiont beyond the resolution of the ordination analysis?</italic></p><p>The reviewer is raising an important issue regarding the nature of the microflora that drive the onset of infantile colitis in our model system. While our experiments with antibiotics demonstrate that those with specificity towards Gram-negative organisms can inhibit the development of inflammation, we have not tested individual organism or defined communities in this model, or whether the introduction of a gram-negative derived molecular pattern such as LPS would induce colitis in the IL10R-deficient infant mice described here. However, it is well described that members of the gram-negative enterohepatic <italic>Helicobacter</italic> species (EHS) including <italic>H. hepaticus</italic> function as pathobionts and are required for the development of colitis in many immunodeficient strains, including IL10-deficient mice (Kullberg MC et al., Infect Immun 1998; Fox JG et al., Mucosal Immunol 2011). While IL10-deficient mice mono-colonized with <italic>H. hepaticus</italic> do not develop colitis, colonization with both <italic>H. hepaticus</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> led to severe typhlocolitis in germ-free IL10-deficient mice (Whary MT et al., Immunology 2011). In addition, we have recently presented data demonstrating that germ-free Was-deficient mice develop colitis when colonized by both <italic>H. bilis</italic> (an EHS related to <italic>H. hepaticus</italic>) and altered Schaedler’s flora (ASF), but not when colonized by either component alone (Tsou et al., Gastroenterology supplement, April 2017, S111). Collectively, these studies suggest that colonization with enterohepatic <italic>Helicobacter</italic> in association with other minimal microbial communities (ASF or <italic>L. reuteri</italic>) is sufficient to drive intestinal inflammation in susceptible murine strains. Given that we have observed marked increases in colonization with <italic>H. ganmani</italic> (another Gram-negative EHS related to <italic>H. hepaticus</italic>) in both WT and IL10R-deficient mice between 2 and 3 weeks of age, we hypothesize that colonization by a context-dependent Gram-negative pathobiont such as <italic>H. ganmani</italic>, in addition to other minimal microbial communities is necessary for the development of inflammation in the infant model presented here. Future experiments will be necessary to unambiguously identify the specific microflora necessary to drive infant colitis in this model. We have revised the Discussion in consideration of these issues (fourth paragraph).</p><p><italic>It was also noted that in a previous article (reference 20) on a related topic, the kinetics of intestinal inflammation observed in IL10rb<sup>-/-</sup> mice was more attenuated (reference 20, page 709: &quot;we evaluated Il10rb<sup>-/-</sup> mice at 5 weeks of age that lacked any clinical (data not shown), endoscopic, or histologic signs of intestinal inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>)&quot; and in that study (reference 20) for rapid colitis induction adoptive transfer of colitogenic CD4 T cells into IL10rb<sup>-/-</sup> Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> mice was used. In the present study, the IL10rb- and IL10rb<sup>+/-</sup> mice were found to be colonized with Helicobacter sp. around day 17 of age as assessed by 16S RNA pyrosequencing. Whilst formal rederivation to monocolonised or Helicobacter-free status is not necessarily considered within the current scope, please address whether differences in the microbial composition (notably, for Helicobacter sp.) might account for these differences between the two reports. The caveats to address how microbiota constraints may be responsible for the phenotype need to be included in the Discussion?</italic></p><p>As pointed out by this reviewer, we recognize that differences in microbial composition may account for differences in time of disease onset when comparing this study and our prior study. We note that the animal housing conditions have changed over time. In contrast to our previous report where <italic>Il10rb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and WT mice were bred separately and were not co-housed, the mice in our current study were generated with an independent breeding strategy where all mice were co-housed littermate controls. In addition, the mice in our current study were confirmed positive for <italic>Helicobacter sp.</italic> whereas we are unable to verify the <italic>Helicobacter</italic> status of mice from our previous study, as the stool samples from those mice are unavailable. Finally, approximately 15-20% of <italic>Il10rb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice in our current study demonstrate delayed onset of histologic colitis, whereas the altered LP macrophage phenotype is observed in 100% of the mice beginning at 3 weeks. In the previous study, mice that lacked colitis at 5 weeks were specifically selected to demonstrate that LP macrophage dysfunction precedes the development of microscopic colitis, however, we did not intend to suggest that all mice lacked colitis at 5 weeks of age. We have revised our Discussion based on these issues, and intend to pursue this further in follow-up studies (fourth paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) Comment on whether you have examined the relevance of the mechanisms of inhibition of inflammatory gene transcription in BMDMs by IL-10 (previous publication JI 2017, 198, 2906-2915) in the context of macrophages in this model.</italic></p><p>We have recently demonstrated that IL10 rapidly inhibits LPS-induced enhancer activation in bone marrow-derived macrophages (Conaway E et al.,J Immunol 2017). While we have not yet directly examined mechanisms responsible for altered gene expression in LP macrophages isolated from IL10R-deficient mice, we believe that this is a priority for future mechanistic-based research in this area. In response to this comment we have broadened the Discussion of this issue (seventh paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) Specifically clarify the question of chromosome trait dominance determination. The text and figure legends are unclear about exactly when littermates or wild-type age-matched mice were used (compare the subsection “Mice” of Materials and methods and Figure legends 1 and 2).</italic></p><p>All aged-matched mice used in these studies were littermates with one exception. Five wild-type age-matched non-littermate mice were combined with 5 <italic>Il10rb<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice to make up the control group for the 3 week time point shown in the manuscript (original submission, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In our revised version, we have removed the 5 3-week old WT control mice in this figure. While this results in some minor differences in statistical significance at 3 wks (<italic>p</italic> values increased from <italic>0.01</italic> to <italic>0.09</italic> for <italic>Il12b, 0.05 to 0.17 for Il1b</italic>, and <italic>0.08</italic> to <italic>0.38</italic> for <italic>Tnf</italic>), these small changes do not influence our overall conclusions. The Materials and methods section has been updated to reflect this (subsection “Mice”).</p><p><italic>4) IL10ra<sup>-/-</sup> and IL10rb<sup>-/-</sup> mice on a different genetic background were used. IL10Rb deficient mice were maintained on a 129SvEv background, while IL10ra deficient mice were used on a Cdcs1- congenic, C57BL/6 background. While the colitogenic locus identified in 129SvEv mice (Hiccs) phenocopies most of the effects seen with the Cdcs1 locus, Hiccs overlaps only with the most telomeric sublocus of Cdcs1 (Boulard et al., J Exp Med. 209: 1309-24; 2012). Hence, it remains to be seen whether differences seen in IL10ra, and IL10rb deficient mice are due to the differential binding of other ligands to IL10ra, and IL10rb; a distinct composition of the intestinal microbiota; notably, of Helicobacter species, and/or the genetic background of the mouse strains. These possibilities need to be considered in the interpretation of the data.</italic></p><p>While we believe that our data strongly support our contention that the IL10R itself has a function that is necessary to prevent the onset of colitis between the second and third week of life in infant mice, we have not directly compared the phenotype of <italic>Il10rb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Il10ra<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Nonetheless, we agree that there may be differences in the phenotype of the <italic>Il10rb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Il10ra<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and such difference could be based on differences in the function of these two receptor components, genetic background, and/or intestinal microbial composition. We have now included these issues in the interpretation of experimental results (subsection “IL10Rα chain is essential to prevent inflammation in the developing infant colon”).</p><p><italic>5) While the authors comment that other work has suggested that CCR2 may not be required for myeloid cell infiltration in some models of colitis, neonatal mice have not been examined in this way. In view of the marked infiltration by monocytes reported here, it should be clear if the authors have conducted any experiments on a potential role for CCR2 in their models.</italic></p><p>We appreciate this important comment. Indeed, we have considered the potential role of CCR2 in driving colonic inflammation in neonatal <italic>Il10rb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. We found that treatment of 3 week old <italic>Il10rb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice with the anti-CCR2 antibody (MC21, gift of Dr. Matthias Mack, Germany) markedly decreased infiltration of Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells (P1 and P2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1A and B</xref>), but did not decrease the number of P3/P4 macrophages. However, we were unable to detect a significant difference in the colonic expression of inflammatory genes including <italic>Il12b, IFNγ, Tnf</italic>, and <italic>Il1b</italic> between isotype and MC21 antibody-treated <italic>Il10rb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (p&gt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1C</xref>). Given that the P3/P4 macrophages in infant <italic>Il10rb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice exhibit a proinflammatory phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), this is consistent with the hypothesis that P3/P4 macrophages are the key driver of colonic inflammation in this model. Nonetheless, the CCR2 antibody experiment has an important caveat that the depletion was transient and we do not know if this was sufficient to interfere with the inflammatory process in IL10R deficiency setting. Therefore, given that our preliminary data on CCR2 depletion is not definitive, it would be ideal to breed our <italic>Cdcs1<sup>+/+</sup>Il10ra<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice with <italic>Ccr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, which although beyond the scope of our current study, will remain an important question for our future investigations. We have noted the results of this preliminary experiment in the Discussion section of this revised manuscript (fifth paragraph).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27652.019</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>CCR2 blocking does not inhibit inflammatory gene expression in the infant <italic>Il10rb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Flow cytometry analyses of colonic lamina propria macrophages of indicated mice after 5 days of treatment (20μg/mouse/day, i.p.) with anti-CCR2 (MC21) or rat IgG2b, κ (isotype).

This idea is based only on comparing macrophages from mice before (embryonic) and after (monocyte derived) the onset of the changes in the microbiota at weaning. Thus, the differences seem likely to reflect the combined effect of microbial stimulation and the absence of IL10 control, rather than an effect of the source of macrophages.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewers that it is difficult to know whether the lack of an inflammatory phenotype in IL10R-deficient LP MΦs prior to weaning is truly due to differences in site of origin, or conversely due to the absence of specific inflammatory microflora. We have raised these considerations in the revised Discussion (sixth paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
