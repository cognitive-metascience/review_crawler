are regulated by promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Phosphorylation of Pol II CTD by positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) is a necessary precursor event that enables productive transcription elongation. The exact mechanism on how the sequestered P-TEFb is released from the 7SK snRNP complex and recruited to Pol II CTD remains unknown. In this report, we utilize mouse and human models to reveal methylphosphate capping enzyme (MePCE), a core component of the 7SK snRNP complex, as the cognate substrate for Jumonji domain-containing 6 (JMJD6)’s novel proteolytic function. Our evidences consist of a crystal structure of JMJD6 bound to methyl-arginine, enzymatic assays of JMJD6 cleaving MePCE in vivo and in vitro, binding assays, and downstream effects of <italic>Jmjd6</italic> knockout and overexpression on Pol II CTD phosphorylation. We propose that JMJD6 assists bromodomain containing 4 (BRD4) to recruit P-TEFb to Pol II CTD by disrupting the 7SK snRNP complex.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In animals, an enzyme known as RNA polymerase II (Pol II for short) is a key element of the transcription process, whereby the genetic information contained in DNA is turned into messenger RNA molecules in the cells, which can then be translated to proteins. To perform this task, Pol II needs to be activated by a complex of proteins called P-TEFb; however, P-TEFb is usually found in an inactive form held by another group of proteins. Yet, it is unclear how P-TEFb is released and allowed to activate Pol II.</p><p>Scientists have speculated that another protein called JMJD6 (Jumonji domain-containing 6) is important for P-TEFb to activate Pol II. Various roles for JMJD6 have been proposed, but its exact purpose remains unclear. Recently, two enzymes closely related to JMJD6 were found to be able to make precise cuts in other proteins; Lee, Liu et al. therefore wanted to test whether this is also true of JMJD6. Experiments using purified JMJD6 showed that it could make a cut in an enzyme called MePCE, which belongs to the group of proteins that hold P-TEFb in its inactive form.</p><p>Lee, Liu et al. then tested the relationships between these proteins in living human and mouse cells. The levels of activated Pol II were lower in cells without JMJD6 and higher in those without MePCE. Together, the results suggest that JMJD6 cuts MePCE to release P-TEFb, which then activates Pol II. JMJD6 appears to know where to cut by following a specific pattern of elements in the structure of MePCE. When MePCE was mutated so that the pattern changed, JMJD6 was unable to cut it. These results suggest that JMJD6 and related enzymes belong to a new family of proteases, the molecular scissors that can cleave other proteins.</p><p>The molecules that regulate transcription often are major drug targets, for example in the fight against cancer. Ultimately, understanding the role of JMJD6 might help to identify new avenues for cancer drug development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>JMJD6</kwd><kwd>MePCE</kwd><kwd>RNA polymerase II</kwd><kwd>7SK snRNP</kwd><kwd>P-TEFb</kwd><kwd>CDK9</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA201230</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernt</surname><given-names>Kathrin Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32AI007405-28</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Schuyler</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32AI074491-07</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Haolin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012308</institution-id><institution>National Jewish Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA201230</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Gongyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>JMJD6 helps BRD4 to recruit CDK9 to RNA Polymerase II by disrupting 7SK snRNP complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mechanisms of transcription regulation in bacteria are very well established; transcription factors bind to specific DNA to recruit RNA Polymerases (RNAP) to carry out transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ptashne and Gann, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>). In eukaryotes, however, there are additional layers of regulation such as the nucleosome structures, which can prevent RNA Polymerases including RNA Polymerase I (Pol I), RNA Polymerase II (Pol II), and RNA Polymerase III (Pol III) from productive transcription due to high binding affinity between DNA and histones. Precisely how RNA Polymerases overcome nucleosomal barriers to undergo a productive transcription elongation and how Pol II pausing is regulated remain unanswered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jonkers and Lis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Core and Adelman, 2019</xref>). In higher eukaryotes, over ~30% genes are regulated by Pol II promoter-proximal pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Core et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nechaev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Min et al., 2011</xref>), which is resultant from nucleosome barriers at +1 position of transcription start sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Weber et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Voong et al., 2016</xref>). We recently discovered that a group of JmjC domain containing protein family including JMJD5 and JMJD7 specifically cleave histone tails and potentially generate tailless nucleosomes. The cleavage activity by JMJD5 and JMJD7 could be associated with the release of the promoter-proximal paused Pol II and may trigger Pol II into productive elongation in higher eukaryotes, such as mouse and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). The cleavage activity of JMJD5 on histone tails was also independently reported by another group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shen et al., 2017</xref>), thus cross-validating our respective discoveries.</p><p>Compared to the efficient recruitment of P-TEFb (including CDK9 and Cyclin T1) by TAT protein in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peterlin et al., 2012</xref>), BRD4 is claimed to be responsible for the recruitment P-TEFb to the promoters of Pol II pausing regulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">C Quaresma et al., 2016</xref>). However, the binding affinity between BRD4 and P-TEFb (~0.5 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Itzen et al., 2014</xref>) is much weaker than that that of TAT and P-TEFb (~3 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wei et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tahirov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schulze-Gahmen et al., 2014</xref>), and BRD4 lacks a RNA binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu and Chiang, 2007</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize there must exist another factor to help BRD4 to recruit P-TEFb and engages in the instigation of Pol II transcription elongation. Besides the classic Bromo-domains which recognize acetylated histone tails, BRD4 contains an extra terminal domain (ET) recognizing JMJD6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rahman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Konuma et al., 2017</xref>). Incidentally, we found that JMJD6 nonspecifically binds to single stranded RNA with high affinity (~40 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hong et al., 2010</xref>). We propose that JMJD6 may be recruited by both BRD4 and newly transcribed RNAs from Pol II to help BRD4 recruit P-TEFb, acting analogously to that of TAT protein associating with both P-TEFb and TAR.</p><p>JMJD6 is one of the most controversial proteins in biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vangimalla et al., 2017</xref>). It was first cloned as phosphatidylserine (PS) receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fadok et al., 2000</xref>), but was corrected as a nucleus expressed protein unrelated to PS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Böse et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cikala et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cui et al., 2004</xref>). It was later reported to contain arginine demethylase activity on histone tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang et al., 2007</xref>), hydroxylase activity on splicing factor U2AF65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Webby et al., 2009</xref>) and histone tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Han et al., 2012</xref>), and both arginine demethylase activities on histone tails and RNA demethylase activities on 5’ prime of 7SK snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), and surprisingly PS binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Neumann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). The exact or cognate substrate(s) of JMJD6 remains unresolved or controversial. Based on the novel protease activities of JMJD5 and JMJD7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2018</xref>), the high structural similarity among catalytic cores of JMJD5, JMJD6, and JMJD7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2018</xref>), and analogous severe phenotypes among knockouts of <italic>Jmjd5</italic> and <italic>Jmjd6</italic> in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Böse et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ishimura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oh and Janknecht, 2012</xref>), we hypothesized that JMJD6 may contain protease activity working on methylated arginines on some protein candidates which regulate the activity of Pol II, especially promoter-proximally paused Pol II.</p><p>It is well established that the 7SK snRNP complex primarily functions to sequester the CDK9-containing P-TEFb until stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2005</xref>). MePCE (methylphosphate capping enzyme) was first characterized as a component of the 7SK snRNP complex which acts as a capping enzyme on the gamma phosphate at the 5’end of 7SK RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jeronimo et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, a capping-independent function of MePCE via stabilization of 7SK snRNA and facilitation in the assembly of 7SK snRNP was reported by Dr. Qiang Zhou’s group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xue et al., 2010</xref>). Knockdown of MePCE led to destabilization of the 7SK snRNP complex in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xue et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Singh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">C Quaresma et al., 2016</xref>). A nonsense variant of MePCE is reported to be associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder exhibiting hyperphosphorylation of Pol II, potentially caused by enhanced activation of CDK9 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schneeberger et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, one report showed that MePCE may also work in an 7SK snRNP independent manner to recruit CDK9 on a small group of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shelton et al., 2018</xref>). In this report, we reveal that MePCE of the 7SK snRNP complex is a cognate substrate of JMJD6.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>JMJD6 has a unique structure to hold methyl-arginine</title><p>Based on these divergent reports regarding substrates of JMJD6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Webby et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Neumann et al., 2015</xref>), we re-interrogated proposed substrates using stringent and unified criteria. As we reported previously, JMJD6 binds with high binding affinity (~40 nM) to single stranded RNA (ssRNA) without sequence specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hong et al., 2010</xref>). However, truncation analysis showed that JMJD6 barely binds to ssRNA without the C-terminal flexible region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hong et al., 2010</xref>). This suggests that the C-terminal domain of JMJD6 may just serve as ssRNA binding motif and RNAs are not a substrate for the enzymatic activity of JMJD6. On the other hand, the structure of the catalytic core of JMJD6 shows some critical similarity to those of JMJD5 and JMJD7, with a negatively charged microenvironment near the catalytic center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting positively charged substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). As we reported, JMJD5 and JMJD7 specifically recognize methylarginines of histone tails <italic>via</italic> a Tudor-domain-like structure near the catalytic center of JMJD5, which could specifically recognize methylarginines, but not methyllysine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). We reasoned that the similar structural features among JMJD6, JMJD5, and JMJD7 may confer a similar substrate for JMJD6 as those of JMJD5 and JMJD7. In this regard, crystals of JMJD6 without C-terminal motif (1-343) were soaked with a monomethylarginine derivative. Interestingly, four out of eight JMJD6 molecules within an asymmetric unit bound to monomethylarginine, which coordinates with Fe2+ and alpha-KG in the catalytic center similar to that of JMJD5 and methylarginines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). However, the methylated sidechain of arginine is located in a more open catalytic space containing negatively charged residues, compared to that of JMJD5, indicating that the pocket could hold more than one sidechain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This may suggest a novel substrate recognition mode, which is different from that of JMJD5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, the complex structure shows several key evidences. First, JMJD6 does bind to substrates with methylarginine or possibly methyllysine or both arginine and lysine with and without methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Second, the methyl group is far away from either the divalent ion or alpha-KG, suggesting JMJD6 may not act as lysine or arginine demethylases to remove methyl groups on the sidechain of either lysine or arginine. Third, peptides or proteins could be cognate substrates instead of RNA or DNA, which do not contain any positive charge with or without methylation. Fourth, the catalytic center contains analogous residues present in JMJD5 and JMJD7, suggesting a similar novel catalytic mechanism as those of JMJD5 and JMJD7 through an imidic acid as proton mediator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). This novelty is particularly exemplified by the fact that commercially available protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) at 2x concentration cannot inhibit activities of JMJD5, JMJD6, and JMJD7. Furthermore, a comprehensive protein composition analysis using mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) of all purified recombinant JMJD6 samples used in the following experiments could not detect any protease contaminants.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>JMJD6 binds to monomethyl arginine (1-of-4).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Complex structure of JMJD6 (1–343) and monomethyl arginine (MM-Arg).

Interestingly, JMJD6 does in fact have activities on bulk histone in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This result may explain why two groups found that JMJD6 could reduce methylarginine containing histone tails in in vitro assays probed with antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), in which post-cleft short peptides with methylarginines cannot be recognized by antibodies in western blots. To confirm or rule out whether histone tails are cognate substrates of JMJD6, we first assessed the binding affinity between JMJD6 and histone peptides with or without arginine methylation. From fluorescence polarization binding assays, binding affinities between JMJD6 and peptides are weak and around ~150 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). Most importantly, with or without <italic>Jmjd6</italic>, the level of arginine methylated histones or overall histone levels does not change in MEF cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which is in stark contrast to those of JMJD5 and JMJD7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). These data suggest that histone tails are not cognate substrates of JMJD6. Parenthetically, it is reported that JMJD6 binds to LARP7 on 7SK snRNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weimann et al., 2013</xref>), works on methyl cap of 5’ 7SK snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), and binds to BRD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rahman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Konuma et al., 2017</xref>), all suggesting a close relation with the 7SK snRNP complex.</p><p>We hypothesized that JMJD6 may work on some protein component(s) of the 7SK snRNP to regulate the stability of 7SK snRNP complex. Interestingly, all protein components of the 7SK snRNP complex including MEPCE, LARP7, and HEXIM1 are drastically decreased in the MEF cells without <italic>Jmjd6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). One possibility is that all members are transcriptionally regulated by JMJD6. This could be consistent with the severe phenotype of <italic>Jmjd6</italic> knockouts, which results in neonatal lethality and cell growth retardation and tissue differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Böse et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that JMJD6 is a global master transcriptional regulator controlling expression of a large group of genes including components from the 7SK snRNP complex. However, our RNA-Seq data does not support direct transcriptional downregulation of 7SK snRNP complex members at mRNA level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). All of them, including MePCE, LARP7, and HEXIM1 have similar mRNA levels with or without <italic>Jmjd6</italic>. At the moment, the cause of this downregulation of proteins level of these components from 7SK snRNP remains unresolved and is beyond the scope of this report. However, when we introduce back JMJD6 via overexpression into MEF cells lacking <italic>Jmjd6</italic>, protein levels of LARP7 and HEXIM1 are rescued, whereas MePCE is undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) or significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To account for this disappearance of MePCE, we hypothesized that overexpression of JMJD6 may directly target MEPCE for degradation. To confirm this hypothesis, we respectively overexpressed full-length MePCE in wild-type MEF, <italic>Jmjd6</italic> knockout MEF, wild-type JMJD6 overexpression in <italic>Jmjd6</italic> knockout MEF, and inactive mutant JMJD6 overexpression in <italic>Jmjd6</italic> knockout MEF.

Consistent with our in vivo results, JMJD6 cleaves MePCE in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>), but not HEXIM1, HEXIM2, nor LARP7 (data not shown). Upon cleavage of MePCE by JMJD6 in vitro, a band with molecular weight ~25 kDa was detected by antibody against His<sup>6</sup>-tag at the N-terminal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To provide context, MePCE contains a total of 689 residues and a theoretical molecular weight of 74.4 kDa, whereas it is detected at ~90 kDa on SDS-PAGE gel due to its high content of proline residues (10.7%). We expect that the ~25 kDa fragment from N-terminal of MePCE may contain 200 residues or less due to rich proline residues within the N-terminal of MePCE (first 150 residues of MePCE contains 27 prolines, 18.0% prolines). Furthermore, our in vivo assay yielded a cleaved MePCE band with a molecular weight ~65 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The anti-MePCE antibody used in this assay was generated using a peptide immunogen containing residues 200–250 of MePCE. Thus, the ~65 kDa band may correspond to the cleaved C-terminal segment of MePCE containing the approximate residues 200–689.</p><p>Based on the binding of JMJD6 to methylated arginine we obtained from the complex crystal structure, we reasoned that arginine residues within approximately the first 200 residues of MePCE could contain the recognition site. Several peptide fragments including residues from 81 to 160, residues 154 to 184, and residues 187 to 244 were synthesized. Peptides of 81–160 and 187–244 did not show any cleavage when incubated with JMJD6. Peptides of 154–184 showed cleavage activity, but at levels of &lt;1% compared to peptide input. We attributed this low activity as a matter of insolubility and dimerization via C177 oxidation. To overcome this obstacle, a shorter peptide from residue 161 to 179 containing C177S was synthesized and subjected to enzymatic reaction under JMJD6. This peptide also contains symmetric dimethylation on R171, given that our binding data, described in the next section, suggests that this particular modification yields the highest binding affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

The highest binding affinity was exhibited by the MePCE (154-184)-R171-me2s peptide with Kd = 159 ± 77 nM, followed by the peptide containing no modification with Kd = 471 ± 292 nM, and lastly the peptide with R170-me2s with Kd = 568 ± 316 nM. Fluorescence polarization assays were used to cross-validate the Kd values obtained via MST above, all of which respectively fell within the margin of error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B,C</xref>). These data suggest that methylation on R171 enhances binding nearly 3-fold compared to no modification, whereas methylation on R170 diminishes binding marginally. Whether or not these particular methylations occur in vivo is yet to be explored. Interestingly, the YASARA Energy Minimization Server developed by Dr. Kevin Karplus’ group yielded a theoretical model that positions R171 in the identical position to the monomethyl-arginine observed in our crystal model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krieger et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, the energy-minimized model displayed eight separate charge-charge interactions between JMJD6 and MePCE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Although a <italic>bona fide</italic> complex structure is preferred, this computational model is in excellent agreement with all our findings and provides a coherent justification for the experimentally observed high binding affinities between JMJD6 and MePCE. To compare the abovementioned binding affinities to that of JMJD6 and histone tails, as other groups have previously purported, the identical MST assay was performed using peptides derived from Histone 3 (1-21) containing no modification (H3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), Histone 3 (1-16)-R2-me2s (H3R2me2s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), and C-peptide (57-87) as a negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). For the Histone three peptides, low binding affinity was exhibited with Kd = 77 ± 34 μM for H3 peptide and Kd = 98 ± 14 μM for H3R2me2s peptide. No meaningful binding was observed for the C-peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). To verify the authenticity of the above model and confirm our proposed cleavage site of JMJD6 within MePCE, we generated an MePCE knockout 293 T cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) and respectively overexpressed C-terminal His<sup>6</sup>-tagged wild-type MePCE or C-terminal His<sup>6</sup>-tagged mutant MePCE, which replaced -RRRR- to -AAAA- at the cleavage site. Interestingly, when probed with anti-His<sup>6</sup> antibody in a western blot, wild-type MePCE generates two bands of MePCE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>, left lane), consistent with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, whereas the mutant version does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>, right lane), suggesting that this site is the authentic cleavage site for JMJD6.

This data provides another solid evidence of the cleavage site within MePCE by JMJD6. To further verify our proposed role of JMJD6 on MePCE, the mutant MePCE containing N-terminal His<sup>6</sup>-tagged was expressed in insect cells and purified for an in vitro assay. The native form of MePCE generates a small band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>), consistent with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, whereas the mutant MePCE does not generate any additional band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

Does MePCE cleavage mediate P-TEFb to be released from the 7SK snRNP complex, allowing P-TEFb to be recruited to CTD of Pol II, and then to phosphorylate Ser2-CTD of Pol II? Nuclear extracts from both wild-type MEFs, <italic>Jmjd6</italic> knockout MEFs and JMJD6 overexpression in <italic>Jmjd6</italic>-deficient MEFs were subjected to investigation as to the level of Ser2p-CTD of Pol II. Consistent with all our current and previous findings, Ser2p-CTD of Pol II is drastically reduced (~80%) in MEF cells without <italic>Jmjd6</italic>, despite CDK9 levels remaining unchanged, suggesting that Ser2p-CTD of Pol II is regulated by JMJD6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). A question raised here is whether the drop of active Pol II (Ser2p-CTD) is related to the protease activity of JMJD6 toward the CDK9-sequestering role of MePCE. Therefore, the MePCE knockout cell line was investigated for its effect on Pol II. To our great satisfaction, Pol II Ser2p-CTD is dramatically increased in 293 T cells with MePCE knockout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, right lane) compared to the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, left lane). Of interest, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shelton et al. (2018)</xref> showed that CDK9 interacts with the N-terminal region of MePCE (1-400)). We found a very similar JMJD6 cutting site around residues 363–367 (-RKRRR-) compared the site we characterized around residues 167–172 (-KRRRR-). If JMJD6 also cuts this site as well, it seems that MePCE may act as an anchor site for CDK9 on 7SK snRNP complex. It is an interesting topic that requires further investigation.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>JMJD6 regulates Pol II Ser2-CTD phosphorylation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot of wild-type MEF, <italic>Jmjd6</italic> knockout MEF, and JMJD6 overexpression in <italic>Jmjd6</italic> knockout MEF probed with antibodies specific for Pol II CTD, Pol II ser2p-CTD, CDK9, and Actin.

This data suggests not only that JMJD6’s cleavage of MePCE is essential for P-TEFb to be released from the 7SK snRNP complex and ultimately the phosphorylation of Ser2-CTD of Pol II, but also further cross-confirms that a species of Ser2p-CTD of Pol II is indeed generated by CDK9. The content of Ser2p-CTD of Pol II is recovered when JMJD6 is re-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>), suggesting the direct relation of JMJD6 and phosphorylation of Ser2-CTD of Pol II in vivo. When these results are aggregated with previously published reports, whereby (1) JMJD6 exhibits strong binding affinity to nonspecific ssRNA as we previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hong et al., 2010</xref>), (2) JMJD6 associates with BRD4 as reported by others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rahman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Konuma et al., 2017</xref>), and (3) JMJD6 digests MePCE so as to disrupt the overall stability of 7SK snRNP complex as highlighted in this report (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), a model of P-TEFb transcription regulation unique to higher eukaryotes can be generated: JMJD6 binds to 20–50 nt newly transcribed 5’ prime end of ssRNAs of initiated Pol II of any stimulating genes. The association between BRD4 and JMJD6 allows BRD4 to bring P-TEFb (CDK9) to close proximity of CTD of Pol II, allowing for Ser2-CTD phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Remarkably, this recruitment of P-TEFb by JMJD6, with the assistance of BRD4, is similar to that of TAT protein hijacking P-TEFb complex after associating with TAR transcript to trigger the expression of HIV retroviral genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peterlin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">C Quaresma et al., 2016</xref>). Here, our observation regarding the direct relation of JMJD6 and level of Ser2p-CTD of Pol II in vivo is corroborated by Liu et al.’s report, in which 7SK snRNP complex pulled-down through HEXIM1 antibody from HEK293 cells could be disrupted by JMJD6 in vitro, as indicated by the decrease in CDK9 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), thus strongly supporting our proposed role of JMJD6 as a direct disruptor of the 7SK snRNP complex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>It took us nearly two decades to address the structure and function of JMJD6 since it was first cloned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fadok et al., 2000</xref>). During the long journey, based on the conserved structure of JmjC domain containing family, we pioneered in characterizing the catalytic core of JMJD2 subfamily, which turned out to be a novel lysine demethylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Whetstine et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2007</xref>). We then solved the structure of JMJD6 with the help of a monoclonal antibody and discovered its unique ssRNA binding property almost a decade ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hong et al., 2010</xref>). However, the exact function and its cognate substrate remained a mystery, though several groups claimed variety of enzymatic activities and substrates in past two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Webby et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). The accidental discoveries of novel protease activities of JMJD5 and JMJD7 by our group prompted the exploration of potential protease activity of JMJD6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). The report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al. (2013)</xref> helped us to narrow down the potential cognate substrate within the 7SK snRNP complex. Reports of arginine demethylase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2013</xref>) helped us to focus on methylated arginine as the potential cleavage sites. Thanks to these reports, we identified MePCE to be the cognate substrate of JMJD6, as well as the potential cleavage site. Numerous lines of evidence from our current discoveries and other publications corroborates the authenticity of this conclusion: First, JMJD6 is specifically associated with BRD4 through the ET domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rahman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Konuma et al., 2017</xref>), while BRD4 is very well established to recruit P-TEFb to paused Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). Second, JMJD6 could disrupt the 7SK snRNP complex in vitro as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al. (2013)</xref>. Third, our current discoveries showed that JMJD6 cleaves MePCE of the 7SK snRNP complex. Fourth, our previous discovery of JMJD6’s interaction with non-specific ssRNA bridges JMJD6 to the initiated Pol II which generates 20–50 nt long ssRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hong et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The findings that JMJD5 and JMJD7 are in fact proteases was highly unexpected, and required multiple lines of evidence pursued with great scrutiny. It is quite extraordinary that a very conserved Jumonji domain containing hydroxylase family should contain a subfamily which evolutionarily adopted distinctive protease activities, as well as exhibit several unexpected novelties including the catalysis mechanism involving imidic acid and both endopeptidase and exopeptidase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, recombinant proteins derived from bacteria have a high chance of contamination by bacterial proteases, although we exhausted innumerable means to exclude the possibility of contamination in our assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). In this report, the novel protease activity of JMJD6, which cleaves <italic>before</italic> the methylated arginine, is remarkably distinct to the cleavage <italic>after</italic> the methylated arginine mediated by JMJD5 and JMJD7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). This important piece of evidence supports the claim of JMJD5 and JMJD7 as proteases. It is highly improbable that one batch of proteins we purified was contaminated by one type of undiscovered protease(s) (cleavage after methylated arginine for JMJD5 and JMJD7) while another batch of proteins was contaminated by a different type of undiscovered protease(s) (cleavage before methylated arginine for JMJD6), all which respectively have substrate specificity matching the expected biological profiles of JMJD5/6/7.</p><p>Based on our current discoveries, we may derive a novel transcription regulation pathway for genes regulated by promoter-proximal pausing Pol II. First, upon stimulation of cells, signals will reach specific transcription factors through signal transduction pathways. With modification or with the help of other partner molecules, these transcription factors bind to enhancers close to the paused Pol II. These transcription factors will recruit P300/CBP with the help of H3K4(me1) at enhancer regions, which in turn acetylates H3 and/or H4 on the same nucleosome bound by P300/CBP through association with H3K4(me1) to generate acetylated H3 and/or H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Next, BRD4 is recruited to acetylated H3 and/or H4, and in turn engages with JMJD6 and the initiated Pol II complex. JMJD6 specifically cleaves MePCE of the 7SK snRNP complex so as to release the P-TEFb complex containing CDK9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Finally, JMJD6 and BRD4 brings P-TEFb to close proximity of CTD of Pol II through super elongation complex. P-TEFb (CDK9) then phosphorylates Ser2-CTD of Pol II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Model of P-TEFb release from 7SK snRNP complex.</title><p>(a.) Pol II is initiated at the TSS and remains in the paused state until further stimulation.

Each experiment was performed in triplicate or quadruplicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Modeling of JMJD6(1–343)-MePCE(164-178) interaction</title><p>Crystal structure of JMJD6 (1–343) monomer (PDB:6MEV) sans methylarginine was used as the template to build in residues corresponding to MePCE (164-178) near the catalytic center of JMJD6 in PyMol. No regard for clashes, bonds, or optimization was considered. Structure was exported in. pdb format and uploaded to YASARA energy minimization server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yasara.org/minimizationserver.htm">http://www.yasara.org/minimizationserver.htm</ext-link>) using default parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krieger et al., 2009</xref>). Energy-minimized output model was converted to. pdb format and the MePCE (164-178) residues were minimally adjusted in PyMol to superimpose R171 of MePCE with the methylarginine observed in the crystal structure (PDB:6MEV).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantification of pol II Ser2p-CTD</title><p>Western blot of Pol II Ser2p-CTD and unmodified Pol II CTD in wild-type MEF, <italic>Jmjd6</italic> knockout (KO) MEF, or wild-type JMJD6 overexpression in <italic>Jmjd6</italic> KO MEF was reproduced in four separate experiments. All blot bands were quantified using ImageJ and the band intensity of Pol II Ser2p-CTD was normalized against the band intensity of unmodified Pol II CTD in each respective cell lines. The band intensity of each replicate was normalized against the Pol II Ser2p-CTD level in wild-type MEF, then averaged. The error bars indicate one standard deviation to the observed mean. The P-value was obtained using a paired t-test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>RNA-Seq</title><p>RNAs from wild type MEF cells, MEF cells with <italic>Jmjd6</italic> knockout, and MEF cells with JMJD6 overexpression cells in <italic>Jmjd6</italic> knockout background, respectively, were extracted with Trizol reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific). The extracted RNAs were then sent to Quick biology (Quick Biology, Pasadena) for further mRNA purification using oligo-d(T) beads. The purified mRNA was then used to build a mRNA library. Mouse Genome mm10 was used as the reference.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. David Price from University of Iowa for cDNAs of MePCE and HEXIM1/2, samples of 7SK snRNP complex from Dr. Qiang Zhou at UC Berkeley, Dr. Peter Henson, Dr. James Hagman, Dr. Shaodong Dai, and Dr. Yang Wang, and Janice White for long time support in this project, and other researchers at National Jewish Health (NJH) for their kind support.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Zhiguo Zhang as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. Although the work is of interest, we regret to inform you that the findings at this stage are too preliminary for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specifically, both reviewers agreed that the study is reporting interesting findings and contained both structural and biochemical data. However, both reviewers thought that additional experiments are needed to support the proposed model, so we decided to reject the manuscript at the current form. However, we would be happy to reconsider the manuscript if you could address major concerns listed from 1 to 4 experimentally as well as other concerns with the text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, Lee et al. studied the role of JMJD6 in the release of P-TEFb, a protein involved in the regulation of RNA polymerase II activity. Several activities including histone lysine/arginine demethylase activity were described for JMJD6. Based on the previous findings from the PI's laboratory, Lee et al. show that JMJD6 has a proteolytic activity, likely targeting MePCE, a core component of 7SK snRNP complex. First, based on the structural studies, Lee et al. found that JMJD6 bound methylated arginine. The binding configuration between methylated arginine and JMJD6 likely rules out the possibility that JMJD6 acts as an arginine demethylase. Instead, JMJD6 functions like JMJD5 and JMJD7 as a protease. Based on the in vitro binding and enzymatic assays as well as in vivo analysis the degradation products of MePCE, they show that MePCE instead of histones is a substrate of JMJD6. Overall, this study is interesting and most of data are convincing. I have following suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p><p>1) More data is needed to support the model presented in Figure 3G. for instance, mutations at key residues shown in this figure in MePCE should be made and test how JMJD6 cleavages the mutant form MePCE in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>2) To support the model of Figure 5, MePCE mutants that cannot be digested by JMJD6 especially R171 should be used: how do MePCE mutants that cannot be digested by JMJD6 affect Pol2 phosphorylation?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript reports an interesting finding that JMJD6 contains protease activity that is methyl-arginine guided and targets MePCE, a component of the 7SK snRNP, in vitro. The strength of the manuscript is the nice biochemical study of in vitro expressed MePCE and JMJD6 in Figure 2. However, this finding remains largely disjointed from the rest of the manuscript, which left me overall a bit underwhelmed especially with respect to the biological data.</p><p>1) The structure of JMJD6 binding to a monomethyl-arginine derivative in Figure 1. Later in Figure 3, dimethyl-arginine in MePCE is critical for binding and cleavage. A structure of a dimethyl-arginine-MePCE peptide would be much more informative.</p><p>2) The finding that most inhibitory components of the 7SK snRNP including MePCE itself are positively regulated by JMJD6 via an unknown mechanism is confusing (Figure 2A). This introduces a huge confounding element that remains unexplained but could have direct influence on the phenotype in Figure 4.</p><p>3) The model in Figure 4 does not mention MePCE cleavage and is exclusively composed of elements from other publications featuring the recruitment of JMJD6 via RNA and binding to BRD4. No experimental data in the manuscript supports this model. In fact, this model can function without MePCE cleavage.</p><p>4) The recognition and cleavage site mapping in MePCE is nice but would be even nicer if supported by mutagenesis of full-length MePCE and testing in vitro and after overexpression in cells.</p><p>5) The S2P phenotype in Figure 4 is not the cleanest and should be quantified in multiple experiments. No evidence links this phenotype to the described cleavage of MePCE. In fact, a recent paper by Shelton et al., 2018 questions that MePCE is indeed part of the inhibitory 7SK snRNP but activates P-TEFb in a BRD4-independent manner. This paper should be discussed and the finding should be linked to MePCE cleavage, i.e. by looking at 7SK snRNP large complex levels in the JMJD6 KO cells.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;JMJD6 Cleaves MePCE to Release P-TEFb&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

No experimental data in the manuscript supports this model. In fact, this model can function without MePCE cleavage.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added new data to support the Figure 4 model, in which we show the relative position of JMJD6 and how it is recruited by RNA and BRD4. As you can see from Figure 4A, knockout of JMJD6 lead to drastic loss of active Pol II (Pol II Ser2p-CTD) whereas JMJD6 overexpression leads to a drastic increase in active Pol II. The newly added Figure 4B showed that Pol II Ser2p-CTD dropped ~50% in three repeats when JMJD6 is knocked out, whereas Pol II Ser2p-CTD is increased to ~150% when JMJD6 is overexpressed. Newly added Figure 4C showed that MePCE knockout dramatically increases the content of active Pol II (Pol II Ser2p-CTD). These new data confirm that both JMJD6 and MePCE are closely related to the activities of Pol II.</p><p>We have added mutation data to support the model of Figure 3G now. Our new collaborator (author added), Dr. Yuhua Xue’s group has generated MePCE knockout 293T cell line as demonstrated in Figure 3H. When we introduced wild type of MePCE into this MePCE KO cell line (Figure 3I), we saw a degraded band (Figure 3I, left lane), but not the mutant MePCE with –RRRR- to –AAAA- change (Figure 3I, right lane). On the other hand, it remains true that when the two versions are introduced to the JMJD6 overexpression cell line with JMJD6 knockout background (Figure 3J), wild type MePCE has two bands (Figure 3J, left), while mutant MePCE has a dominated band but a weak low molecular band. We believe that the high content of overexpressed JMJD6 could lead to weak non-specific cut at the mutant site. in vitro data is shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 2B (native MePCE), and Figure 3—figure supplement 2C (mutant MePCE).</p><p><italic>4) The recognition and cleavage site mapping in MePCE is nice but would be even nicer if supported by mutagenesis of full-length MePCE and testing</italic> in vitro <italic>and after overexpression in cells.</italic> </p><p>Please see our response to comment #3 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The S2P phenotype in Figure 4 is not the cleanest and should be quantified in multiple experiments.

This paper should be discussed and the finding should be linked to MePCE cleavage, i.e. by looking at 7SK snRNP large complex levels in the JMJD6 KO cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added new data in Figure 4, three repeats showed the drastic dropping of active Pol II (~50%,Pol II Ser2p-CTD) when JMJD6 is knocked out, whereas a drastic increase of active Pol II (~150%,Pol II Ser2p-CTD) is observed when JMJD6 is overexpressed (Figure 4B). At the same time, knockout of MePCE just works opposite and dramatically increase the content of active Pol II in an 293T MePCE knockout cell line (Figure 4C). All these new data support our model of the role of JMJD6 in helping BRD4 to recruit CDK9 to Pol II (Figure 4D).</p><p>There is an interesting finding showing an alternative or free form of MePCE that could recruit CDK9 directly in Shelton et al.’s 2018 report. This form may work on a small number of gene targets as the authors mentioned, but overall MePCE should play an inhibitory role on CDK9. A recent nonsense mutant in a human disease, which increase the activity of CDK9 or Pol II, also support this general role of MePCE (Schneeberger et al., 2019). Both are cited in our revision now. Of interest, Shelton et al., found that CDK9 interacts with the N-terminal domain of MePCE (residues 1-400), it is possible that MePCE acts as an anchor to help 7SK snRNP to fast CDK9. We found that there is a similar cutting site around residues 363-366 (-RKRRR-) compared to our identified site around residues 167-172 (-KRRRR-) though we did not detect fragments cut from this site from our in vitro experiments so far, this may be an interest topic needing further investigation. We discuss it in the revised version now. The N-terminal portion of MePCE is glycine rich, which makes it a big challenge for expression and characterization.</p><p>The effect of JMJD6 on stability of 7SK snRNP was very well characterized by Drs. Michael Rosefeld and Wei Liu’s groups (Liu et al., 2013). They found that JMJD6 disrupts the 7SK snRNP complex, we have discussed it in the context.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;JMJD6 Cleaves MePCE to Release P-TEFb&quot; for further consideration by eLife.
