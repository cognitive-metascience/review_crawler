Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of pre- and postnatal endolymphatic sacs demonstrates two types of differentiated cells. Early ribosome-rich cells (RRCs) have a transcriptomic signature suggesting expression and secretion of extracellular proteins, while mature RRCs express genes implicated in innate immunity. The transcriptomic signature of mitochondria-rich cells (MRCs) indicates that they mediate vectorial ion transport. We propose a molecular mechanism for resorption of NaCl by MRCs during development, and conclude that disruption of this mechanism is the root cause of hearing loss associated with EES.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endolymphatic sac</kwd><kwd>Slc26a4</kwd><kwd>organ culture</kwd><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd><kwd>gene array</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z01-DC000060</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Griffith</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z01-DC000059</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kelley</surname><given-names>Matthew W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z01-DC000086</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morell</surname><given-names>Robert J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z01-DC000088</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoa</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DC012151</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wangemann</surname><given-names>Philine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000097</institution-id><institution>National Center for Research Resources</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20-RR017686</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wangemann</surname><given-names>Philine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genome-wide RNA-seq analysis of single cells of the developing mouse endolymphatic sac reveals its molecular-cellular architecture and a model for salt and fluid absorption required for acquisition of normal inner ear structure and function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct (EVA; OMIM 600791) is the most commonly detected osseous malformation of the inner ear in children with sensorineural hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Griffith and Wangemann, 2011</xref>). The vestibular aqueduct is a bony canal containing the endolymphatic duct and part of the endolymphatic sac. The width of this bony canal is thought to be established during development when the width of its mesenchymal precursor is determined by the epithelial endolymphatic duct. Therefore, enlargement of the endolymphatic sac and duct (EES) is the soft tissue correlate of EVA. The enlargement of the bony structures persists throughout life and is a radiologic marker of the underlying molecular pathophysiologic process that occurred during embryogenesis. The enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct is not considered to be the direct cause of hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Griffith and Wangemann, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The mammalian inner ear includes the cochlea, the vestibular labyrinth with saccule, utricle and three orthogonally arranged semicircular canals, and the endolymphatic duct and sac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These structures comprise a continuous, fluid-filled epithelium called the membranous labyrinth. The cochlea, saccule, utricle and ampullae of the semicircular canals contain sensory hair cells. Cochlear hair cells detect sound. Vestibular hair cells in the saccule and utricle detect linear acceleration including gravity and vestibular hair cells in the ampullae of the semicircular canals detect rotational acceleration of the head. Although the endolymphatic sac lacks hair cells, it is an important structure that is essential for cochlear and vestibular function. The endolymphatic sac is an evolutionarily conserved structure present even in the primitive inner ear of hagfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jørgensen et al., 1998</xref>). Moreover, the endolymphatic sac is the first structure to develop from the otocyst during early organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Raft et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morsli et al., 1998</xref>). These observations imply that the endolymphatic sac fulfills an important role in the development of the inner ear. Previous investigations suggest that the embryonic endolymphatic sac engages in NaCl resorption and that the ensuing fluid resorption is critical for morphogenesis of the inner ear and the progression of development leading to the acquisition of hearing and vestibular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim and Wangemann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2013a</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26851.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fluid absorption in isolated endolymphatic sacs of <italic>Slc26a4</italic><sup>Δ/+</sup> and <italic>Slc26a4</italic><sup>Δ/Δ</sup> mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of the membranous labyrinth illustrating the location of the endolymphatic sac and other structures of the inner ear.

In adulthood, the endolymphatic sac appears to absorb endolymph and may thereby regulate endolymphatic pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Salt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Inamoto et al., 2009</xref>). The observations of proteins and related substances in the lumen of the endolymphatic sac had led to speculations that epithelial cells of the endolymphatic sac process these substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rask-Andersen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erwall et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guild, 1927</xref>). Other investigations suggest that the endolymphatic sac contributes to immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tomiyama and Harris, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wackym et al., 1987</xref>).</p><p>The adult endolymphatic sac has been described as a simple cuboidal epithelium consisting of at least two cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dahlmann and von Düring, 1995</xref>). Ribosome-rich cells (RRCs), also called dark cells, comprise a majority (~70%) of the epithelial cells. RRCs are characterized by an abundance of cytosolic ribosomes, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and cytoskeletal elements. Mitochondria-rich cells (MRCs), also called light cells, have plentiful mitochondria and numerous apical microvilli. The morphology of MRCs suggests they play a role in endolymph resorption.</p><p>Mitochondria-rich cells express SLC26A4 (also known as pendrin), an anion exchanger encoded by the <italic>SLC26A4</italic> gene. Mutations of <italic>SLC26A4</italic> are the most common cause of EVA and the first or second most common cause of childhood deafness worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Park et al., 2003</xref>). The mouse model deficient in SLC26A4 (<italic>Slc26a4</italic><sup>Δ<italic>/</italic>Δ</sup>) has profound hearing loss, vestibular dysfunction, and massively enlarged endolymphatic spaces throughout the entire inner ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Everett et al., 2001</xref>). Our previous studies of transgenic mouse models indicate that <italic>Slc26a4</italic> expression is required from embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) to postnatal day 2 (P2) in the endolymphatic sac but, remarkably, not the cochlea for the development of normal hearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2011</xref>).

Gene ontology analysis of genes that are differentially expressed between these two cell types indicate that these morphologic descriptions are accurate and appropriate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). Most importantly, our results indicate that MRCs are the primary cells in the developing endolymphatic sac that express ion transport mechanisms necessary for transepithelial fluid absorption. This observation, in combination with the observation that MRCs, not RRCs, express known EVA genes, implicates MRC dysfunction as the initial lesion in the cascade of events leading to EVA and hearing loss.</p><p>Based upon functional data and expression profiles of transporters, channels, pumps, and exchangers in MRCs, we have generated a molecular model for fluid absorption in the developing endolymphatic sac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The model assumes that fluid absorption is driven by transepithelial NaCl absorption since Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> are the prevalent solutes in endolymph of the endolymphatic sac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Couloigner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Couloigner et al., 1999</xref>). The onset of NaCl absorption in the embryonic endolymphatic sac between E13.5 and E14.5 coincides with a steep rise in the expression of the genes that are implicated in the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim and Wangemann, 2010</xref>).

A central feature of our model is absorption of endolymphatic Cl<sup>-</sup> across the apical membrane into the cytosol of MRCs by the Cl<sup>-</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> exchanger SLC26A4. Na<sup>+</sup> is absorbed across the apical membrane via a gadolinium-sensitive pathway and exported across the basolateral membrane by the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase. K<sup>+</sup> is recycled in the basolateral membrane through K<sup>+</sup> channels that establish a cytosolic-side negative potential across the basolateral membrane. This potential drives the release of Cl<sup>-</sup> through Cl<sup>-</sup> channels into the interstitial fluid. Excess HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> generated by carbonic anhydrases is released across the basolateral membrane via a basolateral Cl<sup>-</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> exchanger.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26851.025</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Hypothetical model of NaCl absorption by mitochondria-rich cells of the endolymphatic sac.</title><p>Mitochondria-rich cells (MRC) are interspersed among ribosomal-rich cells (RRC).

This finding is consistent with minimal v-ATPase activity at E14.5, which is evident from the observation that the luminal pH at E14.5 is only 0.1 pH-units more acidic than the interstitial fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim and Wangemann, 2011</xref>). The activity of v-ATPase appears to increase with development, leading to a luminal pH at E17.5 that is 0.55 pH-units more acidic than the interstitial fluid. Activation of v-ATPase would enhance the rate of SLC26A4-mediated Cl<sup>-</sup> absorption across the apical membrane through luminal acidification and a steepened HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> gradient. It is conceivable that v-ATPase, which is expressed at E14.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013b</xref>), is located mainly in sub-apical membrane vesicles that are subsequently trafficked to the apical membrane later in development. This mechanism has been reported for other epithelia expressing v-ATPase including α-intercalated cells of the renal collecting duct and clear cells of the epididymis that, like MRCs, belong to the FORE family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Păunescu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belleannée et al., 2010</xref>). The v-ATPase-dependent increase in fluid absorption appears to be required for normal inner ear development, consistent with the association of EVA with mutations of <italic>ATP6V1B1</italic> and <italic>ATP6V0A4</italic> and the observation of EVA in <italic>Atp6v0a4</italic><sup>Δ/Δ</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lorente-Cánovas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hennings et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stover et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Fluid absorption depends on NaCl absorption and thus requires pathways for Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> absorption. SLC26A4 appears to be required for apical absorption of Cl<sup>-</sup>. The molecule mediating Na<sup>+</sup> absorption, however, remains unclear. Na<sup>+</sup> absorption could be transepithelial, paracellular, or both. The driving force for moving Na<sup>+</sup> through a paracellular pathway consists mainly of the transepithelial potential. A lumen-positive transepithelial potential can drive paracellular Na<sup>+</sup> absorption, whereas a lumen-negative potential would drive Na<sup>+</sup> in the opposite direction. Observations of lumen-negative transepithelial potentials in endolymphatic sacs of embryonic <italic>Slc26a4</italic><sup>Δ/+</sup> and <italic>Slc26a4</italic><sup>Δ/Δ</sup> mice argue against the hypothesis of a paracellular route of Na<sup>+</sup> absorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim and Wangemann, 2011</xref>). In adulthood, however, the situation may be different since small lumen-positive transepithelial potentials have been recorded in adult guinea pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Couloigner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mori and Wu, 1996</xref>).</p><p>Transcellular Na<sup>+</sup> absorption occurs in a variety of epithelia. Key features of some of the best understood mechanisms were used to guide the present study. Transcellular NaCl transport in the proximal renal tubule occurs via parallel Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> exchangers with NHE3 being the molecule mediating Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aronson, 2006</xref>). The hypothesis that NHE3 is involved in fluid absorption in the endolymphatic sac can be dismissed by our observation that fluid transport was insensitive to S3226 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Many epithelia, including principal cells of the renal collecting duct, employ a Na<sup>+</sup>-permeable channel in the apical membrane and a combination of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase and K<sup>+</sup> channels in the basolateral membrane. A consequence of the localization of these ion channels is a lumen-negative transepithelial potential. The observations of lumen-negative transepithelial potentials in embryonic endolymphatic sacs provide support for this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim and Wangemann, 2011</xref>). The Na<sup>+</sup>-permeable channel could be a Na<sup>+</sup>-selective channel or a non-selective cation channel. One candidate for a Na<sup>+</sup>-selective channel is ENaC. ENaC is a benzamil-sensitive epithelial Na<sup>+</sup>-selective channel that requires three subunits encoded by <italic>Scnn1a</italic>, <italic>Scnn1b</italic> and <italic>Scnn1g</italic>, proper intracellular trafficking, and protein modifications for channel activity. The observation that fluid absorption was insensitive to benzamil argues against a role of ENaC in fluid absorption at E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This observation is consistent with our detection of expression of only two (<italic>Scnn1a</italic> and <italic>Scnn1b</italic>) of the three genes encoding the subunits required for ENaC activity. However, ENaC Na<sup>+</sup> channels have been shown to contribute to Na<sup>+</sup> absorption in the adult human endolymphatic sac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The Na<sup>+</sup>-permeable channel could also be a non-selective cation channel. Many non-selective cation channels are sensitive to gadolinium. Our observation that fluid absorption was sensitive to gadolinium provides support for the hypothesis that the Na<sup>+</sup> absorption pathway consists of a non-selective cation channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The molecular identity of this channel, however, remains unclear. It is conceivable that the two ENaC subunits, encoded by <italic>Scnn1a</italic> and <italic>Scnn1b,</italic> expressed in the developing endolymphatic sac form a non-selective cation cannel that is gadolinium-sensitive but benzamil-insensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fyfe and Canessa, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Awayda et al., 2004</xref>). Studies of adult endolymphatic sac tissues have provided evidence for Na<sup>+</sup> permeable channels and Na<sup>+</sup> influx mechanisms into MRCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mori and Wu, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miyashita et al., 2007</xref>), as well as the presence of purinergically controlled non-selective cation channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu and Mori, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miyashita et al., 2001</xref>). The mechanism of Na<sup>+</sup> absorption in the embryonic endolymphatic sac thus remains to be determined.</p><p>The Cl<sup>-</sup> channel subunits CLCNKB and BSND may not be essential elements for NaCl absorption. EVA has not been associated with hearing loss in Bartter syndrome and endolymphatic enlargement was not observed in <italic>Bsnd</italic><sup>Δ/Δ</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rickheit et al., 2008</xref>). The loss of hearing is instead associated with a loss of function of CLCNKB and BSND in the stria vascularis. There may be another molecular pathway for Cl<sup>-</sup> absorption that works independently or redundantly with CLCNK and BSND in the basolateral membrane of MRCs.</p><p>The observations that the mechanism of NaCl absorption in the endolymphatic sac has some similarity to that in intercalated cells of the renal collecting duct is not surprising since both cell populations are members of the FORE family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hulander et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vidarsson et al., 2009</xref>). The renal collecting duct epithelia consist of at least three cell types, α intercalated cells, β intercalated cells, and principal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kleyman et al., 2013</xref>). The α intercalated cells are mainly responsible for urinary acidification through v-ATPase on the apical membrane and anion exchanger 1 SLC4A1 (AE1) on the basolateral membrane. The β intercalated cells are engaged in Na<sup>+</sup> absorption via SLC26A4 and Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> exchanger SLC4A8 (NDCBE) in the apical membrane and v-ATPase and anion exchanger 4 SLC4A9 (AE4) in the basolateral membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leviel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gueutin et al., 2013</xref>). CLCNKB (Clc-Kb) and BSND (Barttin) expression are also detected on the basolateral membrane of both α and β intercalated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Estévez et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Our data highlight several differences between MRCs and intercalated cells: (1) we could not detect any subtype classification among MRCs; (2) we and others cannot detect expression of v-ATPase in the basolateral membrane of MRCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dou et al., 2004</xref>; (3) expression of <italic>Slc4a8</italic> which, in conjunction with <italic>Slc26a4</italic>, plays a crucial role in NaCl absorption in β-intercalated cells, is expressed at low levels in a cell-nonspecific pattern in the endolymphatic sac; and (4) <italic>Scnn1a</italic>, encoding the α subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), a marker of principal cells, is exclusively expressed in MRCs. It appears that the molecular components for ion transport in the endolymphatic sac are consolidated into only one cell type, MRCs, and that the endolymphatic sac is a less complex system than the renal collecting duct. This is not surprising given the requirement of the kidney to regulate a much higher dynamic range of fluid and ion homeostasis.</p><p>Fluid absorption requires not only transport of ions but also the permeation of water. In the renal collecting duct, water reabsorption is controlled by expression of AQP2, AQP3 and AQP4 in principal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pearce et al., 2015</xref>). Our data demonstrate that mRNA expression levels of aquaporin family members are quite low in the endolymphatic sac. In our single-cell RNA-seq analysis, only two to five cells of a total of 213 cells expressed <italic>Aqp1, Aqp3, Aqp4, Aqp6, Aqp7</italic>, or <italic>Aqp11</italic>, and the expression levels were low. Our microarray study analysis detected expression of <italic>Aqp1</italic>, <italic>Aqp3</italic>, <italic>Aqp8 and Aqp11</italic> in <italic>Slc26a4<sup>∆/+</sup></italic> mice at ages E14.5, E16.5 and E17.5. However, none of these genes showed significant differences in their mRNA levels among time points or between <italic>Slc26a4</italic> genotypes, and they all exhibited much lower expression levels in comparison to those of ion transporter and channel genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). There are at least three possible explanations for our observations. First, aquaporin proteins may be stable with only low copy numbers of mRNA. However, a proteome-wide study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sandoval et al., 2013</xref>) of proteins expressed in vasopressin-sensitive mouse collecting duct cell line (mpkCCD cells) indicated that the half-life of AQP2 is shorter than the median half-life of 3691 proteins (9.25 hr vs. 31.2 hr). Half-lives of other aquaporin proteins were not reported in that study. Second, incubation of the endolymphatic sacs in buffer during dissection and cell dissociation may lead to a selective decrease in aquaporin mRNA abundance. Third, the endolymphatic sac epithelium may not require the enhanced permeability of water conferred by aquaporin expression. Considering the relatively small volume of the developing inner ear and the absorptive surface area of the endolymphatic sac, the flux of water traversing the epithelium may be much smaller in the endolymphatic sac than in the kidney. The volume requirement for fluid absorption in the developing sac must also depend on the rate of fluid secretion into the developing endolymph, which is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim and Wangemann, 2010</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that diffusion of water via transcellular pathways, paracellular routes, or both, in combination with permeation through a small number of aquaporin channels may be sufficient for normal development.</p><p>Our results are consistent with previous observations that SLC26A4 is equally distributed across the entire endolymphatic sac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim and Wangemann, 2011</xref>). It is interesting that we observed a subset of RRCs with low expression of <italic>Slc26a4</italic> (<italic>Slc26a4</italic>-positive RRCs). Principal component analysis or hierarchical clustering did not separately cluster the <italic>Slc26a4</italic>-positive RRCs from other RRCs, presumably because of the absence of genes whose expression strongly correlated with <italic>Slc26a4</italic> levels in RRCs. Inspection of the RNA-seq read alignments indicates there are no unique or different isoforms in the <italic>Slc26a4</italic>-positive RRCs. Remaining challenges include determining whether the presence of <italic>Slc26a4</italic> mRNA and SLC26A4 protein in RRCs is functionally important, a result of more promiscuous expression, or a reflection of a transitional differentiation state between RRCs and MRCs.</p><p>Interpretation of single-cell RNA-seq data has caveats. First, the enzymatic dissociation of tissue, the length of time from dissection to cell lysis, or both may cause transcriptional changes. Second, the Fluidigm C1 chip that we used is designed to capture cells ranging from 10 to 17 µm in diameter. Therefore, we may have missed larger or smaller cells. Third, single-cell RNA-seq might not detect functionally important genes expressed at levels below the limit of detection. Fourth, our strategy to detect differentially expressed genes may have missed functionally important genes expressed at similar levels in both cell types. Our microarray approach compensates for these shortcomings of single-cell RNA-seq analysis. In order to look for functionally important genes in the endolymphatic sac, we used profiles of averages of mixed cell populations, instead of comparing cell-type specific genes among cell types as we did in single-cell RNA-seq. Thus, the microarray approach, in combination with qPCR and immunohistochemistry analyses of expression of a subset of genes, supports the validity of our RNA-seq results and interpretations.</p><p>In conclusion, our data provide a comprehensive model for the normal function and differentiation of the developing endolymphatic sac. The numerous new details of our model should be further tested experimentally. The results will enhance our understanding of the structure of the endolymphatic sac and reveal potential opportunities to modulate this pathway in order to prevent or treat loss of hearing or balance associated with EVA and other diseases associated with endolymph homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>A colony of C57BL/6J mice (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link>) was established at the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) with animals obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine).

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript &quot;Molecular architecture underlying fluid absorption by the developing inner ear&quot; to <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor and three expert reviewers. As you will see, all of the reviewers were impressed with the importance and novelty of your work, but they also had multiple comments for improving the study and the manuscript. The three reviews are appended to this letter.</p><p>In our on-line discussions among the reviewers, one over-arching critique was that more validation would strengthen the study, and in particular would strengthen (or not) the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. If other investigators have immunolocalized some of the relevant proteins, then a Table summarizing the existing data would be helpful. To give you the flavor of our discussion, an excerpt follows:</p><p>&quot;As for validation, there are two major transcriptomics approaches, single cell and microarray. To some degree, they could be seen as cross-checking each other, but the authors don't do that. That seems a minimum requirement; although they can't distinguish RRCs and MRCs in the microarray data, they can get a rough developmental progression in the single cell data. Since both approaches are genome-wide, they should cross-check all of their data to see how well the two datasets compare. And then they should take a representative set of transcripts and do RT-qPCR to confirm trends… Only then should they discuss their model, and they should discuss it as such only if they have localization data to position key molecules on apical or basolateral sides. They need to show that the v-type ATPase is on the same side of the epithelium as SLC26A4 and that the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase is on the basolateral side. They may also need to show that all of the transporters are localized in the same cell type; they comment that some (<italic>Scnn1b, Kcnq1</italic>, and <italic>Atp1a1</italic>) and say they are not in MRCs, but the others are. The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> only works if all the transporters are in the same cell type, so just detecting them in enolymphatic sac is not enough.&quot;</p><p>A stylistic point regarding gene names/protein names. Please use only the official name (the gene name) throughout, but when first used in the text note if there is an older and still commonly used name (e.g. Barttin).

This manuscript presents a careful and thorough transcriptomic analysis of cells of the developing endolymphatic sac at different developmental stages. The data add new detail to current descriptions and understanding of the endolymphatic sac, but are also consistent with the earlier literature. The authors propose a model-based on their data and on existing literature-for the uptake of NaCl by mitochondria-rich cells in the endolymphatic sac. They make an interesting comparison of the endolymphatic sac to the cortical collecting duct in the kidney, where they propose that three cell types together perform a similar function, but with a much higher fluid turnover. There is a good discussion of the advantages and limitations of the single-cell transcriptomics approach, and for a few genes, expression data have been validated by immunohistochemistry. The figures are all very clear and the manuscript is well written.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript investigates the underlying molecular basis of the EES disorder, which in some cases is due to mutations of SLC26A4. The authors show that fluid absorption by the endolymphatic sac is indeed partially controlled by the presence of SLC26A4, indeed using mice with <italic>Slc26a4</italic> mutations to show that they may have an enlarged endolymphatic sac because they cannot absorb fluid found in their lumens as fast as control mice can. The authors then use single-cell sequencing to infer the presence of two types of cell in the endolymphatic sac, and determine a proposed trajectory for development of these two cell types from common precursors. Finally, they provide evidence for a variety of transmembrane molecules involved in vectorial transport of ions or water, which allows them to propose a molecular model for NaCl absorption (along with fluid) by the sac.</p><p>In general, their conclusions follow from their data. I found the order of presentation of the data to be confusing, and I've commented on that below. Importantly, they present a model for NaCl adsorption by the endolymphatic sac. The model is plausible but, other than SLC26A4, is untested for the role of specific molecules. They did use immunocytochemistry to localize several molecules that they detected in transcriptomics experiments, but they did not do this for all of the components of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>.</p><p>Moreover, the connection between fluid absorption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and NaCl absorption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) was not made experimentally. Presumably fluid absorption by endolymphatic sac corresponds to water flux that occurs in tandem with NaCl flux-but this was not tested, either by ion-substitution experiments or using inhibitors of the components of their model. In the end, I feel that the data doesn't quite come together into the grand model they have proposed. As they state in the last paragraph, &quot;The numerous new details of our model should be further tested experimentally.&quot;</p><p>Other major comments:</p><p>1) The authors clearly have run up against the typical nomenclature problem where the protein name is radically different from the gene name. This leads to inconsistencies throughout the manuscript. For example, for the central gene SLC26A4/<italic>Slc26a4</italic> (properly italicized in the text), the common name is pendrin. But &quot;pendrin&quot; lacks any connection to the gene name. HUGO recommends (but cannot dictate) that for protein names and especially symbols, one should use the gene name with all caps and no italicization. I agree with that. Eventually we will get there for all genes and their proteins. I recommend that the authors use SLC26A4 to refer to both the gene (italics) and protein (not italics), and that they note that its common name is pendrin just once. The same holds for other genes with radically different common protein names, such as SLC4A1 (AE1), CLCNKB (Clc-Kb), and BSND (Barttin). Use the protein symbols that refer to these proteins in the figures as well as the text. An example of the problem is that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7B-C</xref> use different names than <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, so it's very difficult to compare the figures.</p><p>2) The order of presentation of the data in this manuscript makes the story quite confusing. For example, as far as I can tell, the single-cell sequencing data are presented in the order the experiments were done (I'm guessing), so that we get P5&gt;P30&gt;E12.5 and E16.5. While there may be some logic to this order, it doesn't help me understand the data. I would either start with the P30 data and work backwards or start with E12.5 and move forwards. It is also strange that the microarray data with <italic>Slc26a4</italic> hets vs. KOs is not shown right after the functional data. Maybe the right order is a) fluid uptake, b) microarray, c) single cell in temporal order.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26851.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In our on-line discussions among the reviewers, one over-arching critique was that more validation would strengthen the study, and in particular would strengthen (or not) the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you and the reviewers for pointing this out and below we address your specific recommendations for validation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If other investigators have immunolocalized some of the relevant proteins, then a Table summarizing the existing data would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a new table titled “Summary of immunolocalization of proteins in mitochondria-rich cells” as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata1">Figure 9—source data 1</xref>.

To some degree, they could be seen as cross-checking each other, but the authors don't do that. That seems a minimum requirement; although they can't distinguish RRCs and MRCs in the microarray data, they can get a rough developmental progression in the single cell data. Since both approaches are genome-wide, they should cross-check all of their data to see how well the two datasets compare. And then they should take a representative set of transcripts and do RT-qPCR to confirm trends. Only then should they discuss their model, and they should discuss it as such only if they have localization data to position key molecules on apical or basolateral sides.</p></disp-quote><p>We have cross-checked the microarray and single-cell RNA-seq data against each other.

In addition, we calculated changes of average expression for representative genes between two time points in each of the two methods. A comparison indicates the two methods show positive correlation for moderately or highly expressed genes. Wider dispersion is seen for genes with lower expression levels, which may reflect unreliability of low-end TPM values and high stochastic variation in single-cell RNA-seq data.
