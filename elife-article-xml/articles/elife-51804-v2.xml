cellular homeostatic circuit regulating protein synthesis and processing in the ER by three ER-to-nucleus signaling pathways. One pathway is triggered by the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), which splices the X-box binding protein 1 (<italic>Xbp1</italic>) mRNA, thereby enabling expression of XBP1s. Another UPR pathway activates the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). Here we show that murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), a prototypic β-herpesvirus, harnesses the UPR to regulate its own life cycle. MCMV activates the IRE1-XBP1 pathway early post infection to relieve repression by XBP1u, the product of the unspliced <italic>Xbp1</italic> mRNA. XBP1u inhibits viral gene expression and replication by blocking the activation of the viral major immediate-early promoter by XBP1s and ATF6. These findings reveal a redundant function of XBP1s and ATF6 as activators of the viral life cycle, and an unexpected role of XBP1u as a potent repressor of both XBP1s and ATF6-mediated activation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells survive by making many different proteins that each carry out specific tasks. To work correctly, each protein must be made and then folded into the right shape. Cells carefully monitor protein folding because unfolded proteins can compromise their viability. A protein called XBP1 is important in controlling how cells respond to unfolded proteins. Normally, cells contain a form of this protein called XBP1u, while increasing numbers of unfolded proteins trigger production of a form called XBP1s. The change from one form to the other is activated by a protein called IRE1.</p><p>Viruses often manipulate stress responses like the unfolded protein response to help take control of the cell and produce more copies of the virus. Murine cytomegalovirus, which is known as MCMV for short, is a herpes-like virus that infects mice; it stops IRE1 activation and XBP1s production during the later stages of infection. However, research had shown that the unfolded protein response was triggered for a short time at an early stage of infection with MCMV, and it was unclear why this might be.</p><p>Hinte et al. studied the effect of MCMV on cells grown in the laboratory. The experiments showed that a small dose of cell stress, namely activating the unfolded protein response briefly during early infection, helps to activate genes from the virus that allow it to take over the cell. Together, XBP1s and another protein called ATF6 help to switch on the viral genes. The virus also triggers IRE1 helping to reduce the levels of XBP1u, which could slow down the infection. Later, suppressing the unfolded protein response allows copies of the virus to be made faster to help spread the infection.</p><p>These findings reveal new details of how viruses precisely manipulate their host cells at different stages of infection. These insights could lead to new ways to manage or prevent viral infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>murid herpesvirus 1</kwd><kwd>unfolded protein response</kwd><kwd>transcription factor</kwd><kwd>XBP1u</kwd><kwd>ATF6</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BR1730/6-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brune</surname><given-names>Wolfram</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ITN-TREATMENT grant 721236</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tirosh</surname><given-names>Boaz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001736</institution-id><institution>German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant I-1471- 414.13/2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tirosh</surname><given-names>Boaz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006781</institution-id><institution>Giovanni Armenise-Harvard Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Career Development Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Anken</surname><given-names>Eelco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A herpesvirus harnesses the unfolded protein response to regulate its own life cycle, revealing an unexpected role of XBP1u as a potent repressor of the most important viral promoter.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is responsible for synthesis, posttranslational modification, and folding of a substantial portion of cellular proteins. When protein synthesis is increased or ER function is compromised, the folding capacity of the ER may get out of balance, leading to an accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER. To alleviate ER stress and restore homeostasis, the cell activates three ER-to-nucleus signaling pathways, collectively called the unfolded protein response (UPR), which lead to a reduced protein synthesis and an increased expression of folding chaperones and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). Subsequently, ER folding capacity increases and terminally misfolded protein species are exported from the ER and targeted for proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christianson and Ye, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In mammalian cells, the UPR comprises three main signaling pathways named after the initiating ER stress sensors: PERK (PKR-like ER kinase), ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6), and IRE1 (inositol-requiring enzyme 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). Upon activation by ER stress, PERK phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2α, which leads to a massive attenuation of protein synthesis and an immediate reduction of the protein load in the secretory system. However, phosphorylated eIF2α selectively supports the translation of selected cellular proteins such as the transcription factor ATF4, which activates a negative feedback loop resulting in dephosphorylation of eIF2α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Novoa et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Upon activation by ER stress, ATF6 travels to the Golgi, where it undergoes intramembrane proteolysis. This process liberates its cytosolic N-terminus, the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor ATF6(N), and enables it to travel to the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of chaperone genes as well as of the gene encoding XBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The third sensor, IRE1 (also known as ER-to-nucleus signaling 1, ERN1), is an ER transmembrane protein kinase that oligomerizes upon accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen. Oligomerization and auto-transphosphorylation activate the RNase function of IRE1, which mediates an unconventional splicing of the XBP1 mRNA in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calfon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>). Removal of the 26-nt intron from the XBP1 mRNA leads to a frame shift and expression of transcription factor XBP1s, comprising an N-terminal basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain followed by a C-terminal transcription activation domain. By contrast, the unspliced XBP1 mRNA encodes XBP1u, which lacks the transcription activation domain but contains in its C-terminal part a hydrophobic patch and a translational pausing region required for the recruitment of its own mRNA to the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kanda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yanagitani et al., 2011</xref>). XBP1u is rapidly degraded and has a short half-life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tirosh et al., 2006</xref>). It can interact with XBP1s and ATF6(N) and target them for proteasomal degradation. Therefore, XBP1u is thought to act as a negative regulator involved in fine-tuning the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tirosh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yoshida et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yoshida et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, XBP1u affects autophagy by interacting with transcription factor FOXO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). Apart from mediating XBP1 mRNA splicing, IRE1 can also cleave ER-associated mRNA molecules that contain a specific recognition motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moore and Hollien, 2015</xref>). This process, which leads to mRNA degradation, is called regulated IRE1-dependent mRNA decay (RIDD). However, the importance of RIDD in different cellular processes such as lipid metabolism, antigen presentation, and apoptosis remains incompletely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maurel et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>During viral replication large quantities of viral proteins must be synthesized. Folding, maturation, and posttranslational modification of secreted and transmembrane proteins take place in the ER and require a plethora of chaperones, foldases, and glycosylating enzymes. While properly folded proteins are transported to the Golgi, unfolded or misfolded proteins are retained in the ER and exported to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation via the ERAD pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smith et al., 2011</xref>). However, the high levels of viral envelope glycoproteins that are being synthesized particularly during the late phase of the viral life cycle can overwhelm the folding and processing capacity of the ER and cause accumulation of unfolded and misfolded proteins in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang and Wang, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) are prototypic members of the β subfamily of the <italic>Herpesviridae</italic>. Their large double-stranded DNA genomes contain at least 165 protein-coding ORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dolan et al., 2004</xref>) end encode an even larger number of polypeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012</xref>). Through millions of years of co-evolution with their respective hosts, the CMVs have acquired the ability to moderate immune recognition and modulate cellular stress responses to their own benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alwine, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mocarski, 2002</xref>). Considering the important role of the UPR in controlling cell fitness, it is hardly surprising that the CMVs have evolved means to modify the UPR. For instance, human and murine CMV (HCMV and MCMV) induce PERK activation, but limit eIF2α phosphorylation. By doing this the CMVs prevent a global protein synthesis shutoff but allow eIF2α phosphorylation-dependent activation of transcription factor ATF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Isler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qian et al., 2012</xref>). The CMVs also increase expression of the ER chaperone BiP to facilitate protein folding and virion assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buchkovich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buchkovich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qian et al., 2012</xref>), and HCMV uses PERK to induce lipogenesis by activating the cleavage of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). We have previously shown that both, MCMV and HCMV, downregulate IRE1 levels and inhibit IRE1 signaling at late times post infection. This downregulation is mediated by the viral proteins M50 and UL50, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stahl et al., 2013</xref>). However, a real-time transcriptional profiling study has revealed that cellular ER stress response transcripts are upregulated as early 5–6 hr after MCMV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marcinowski et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that MCMV transiently activates the IRE1-XBP1 pathway at early times post infection to relieve repression of viral gene expression and replication by XBP1u. When IRE1-mediated XBP1 mRNA splicing is inhibited, XBP1u blocks the activation of the viral major immediate-early promoter (MIEP) by XBP1s and ATF6(N). Thus, MCMV exploits UPR signaling to boost the activity of its most important promoter. Moreover, these findings reveal a redundant function of XBP1s and ATF6 as activators of viral gene expression and replication, and an unexpected role of XBP1u as a potent repressor of both XBP1s and ATF6-mediated activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Early activation of IRE1-XBP1 signaling promotes MCMV replication</title><p>Previous studies have shown that MCMV inhibits IRE1-XBP1 signaling at late times (≥24 hr) post infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stahl et al., 2013</xref>). However, cellular ER stress response transcripts were shown to be upregulated at 5–6 hr after MCMV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marcinowski et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that UPR signaling is activated at early times post infection. Thus, we decided to analyze whether MCMV activates the IRE1-XPB1 signaling pathway within the first few hours after infection. To do this, we infected mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with MCMV and quantified spliced and unspliced XBP1 transcripts by qRT-PCR. We detected a short and transient increase of XBP1 splicing between 5 and 7 hr post infection (hpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This increase was massively reduced when cells were infected with UV-inactivated MCMV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), suggesting that XBP1 splicing was not caused by viral attachment and entry into cells but required viral gene expression. The transient activation of the IRE1-XBP1 pathway was confirmed by immunoblot detection of phosphorylated IRE1 and XBP1s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). MCMV-induced XBP1 splicing was suppressed by cycloheximide (CHX, a translation inhibitor), but not by phosphonoacetic acid (PAA), an inhibitor of viral DNA replication and late gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These results suggested that the transient activation of the IRE1-XBP1 pathway is caused by viral proteins expressed at immediate-early or early times post infection.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MCMV induces <italic>Xbp1s</italic> mRNA splicing at early time of infection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MEFs were infected with MCMV-GFP or UV-inactivated MCMV-GFP (MOI 4).

IRE1-GFP expression was induced with different concentrations of doxycycline, and cells were infected at low or high multiplicity of infection (MOI) for multi-step and single-step growth curves, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). In both types of replication analysis, MCMV replicated to low titers when IRE1 expression was induced with very low or very high doxycycline concentrations. High MCMV titers (~10<sup>6</sup> infectious units per ml), comparable to those obtained in wildtype (WT) MEFs, were attained only upon moderate induction of IRE1-GFP with 5 to 10 nM doxycycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). We observed that IRE1-GFP induction with high doxycycline concentrations resulted in a significantly decreased cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting that IRE1 overexpression is detrimental to cell viability. This is consistent with the previously reported cytotoxicity of IRE1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2009</xref>). To formally exclude the possibility that strong activation of the TetON transactivator alone impairs MCMV replication, we infected TetON-expressing cells with MCMV and analyzed viral replication in the presence of different doxycycline concentrations. As expected, MCMV replication was not affected by different doxycycline concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, we concluded that IRE1 is necessary for efficient replication of MCMV, but needs to be carefully regulated as too high expression levels are detrimental for cell viability and viral replication.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Moderate IRE1 expression is beneficial for MCMV replication.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoblot analysis of IRE1-deficient (<italic>Ern1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) MEFs expressing IRE1-GFP (TetON-IRE1-GFP) in a doxycycline (dox)-inducible manner.

(ii) Alternatively, MCMV replication could be inhibited by XBP1u, the product of the unspliced <italic>Xbp1</italic> mRNA, since <italic>Ern1</italic> ko cells differ from other cells in that they express only XBP1u (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

However, the inhibition of MCMV replication by XBP1u cannot be explained solely by a repressive effect on XBP1s as a complete loss of XBP1 is not detrimental to MCMV replication in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and has only a modest effect on viral replication in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drori et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that XBP1u might impair MCMV replication by repressing the activity of additional transcription factors besides XBP1s. For several reasons ATF6 appeared to be a likely target of XBP1u: (i) Like XBP1s, ATF6 is a bZIP transcription factor activated by ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoshida et al., 1998</xref>); (ii) XBP1s and ATF6 are known to synergize in the activation of numerous ER stress response genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2002</xref>); and (iii) XBP1u can interact with ATF6 and inhibit its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yoshida et al., 2009</xref>).

Indeed, MIEP-4-only was inducible by XBP1s and ATF6(N) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), suggesting that motif 4 is sufficient to confer MIEP responsiveness to XBP1s and ATF6. To determine whether motif 4 is also of crucial importance for MCMV replication, we mutated motif four within the MCMV genome. The resulting virus, MCMV-GFP-4-mut, was compared to the parental MCMV-GFP virus in a multi-step replication kinetic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Indeed, viral replication was massively reduced when motif 4 within the MIEP was mutated.

The MCMV major immediate-early promoter requires XBP1s or ATF6(N) binding to motif 4 for full activation, and XBP1u prevents promoter activity by both TFs. Thus, XBP1u acts as a key repressor of two UPR pathways, the IRE1-XBP1 and the ATF6 pathways, which have overlapping and redundant functions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study shows how MCMV harnesses UPR signaling to regulate its own life cycle. The viral MIEP, the key promotor of the lytic replication cycle, contains five ACGT motifs, of which motif 4 is most important for MIEP activation by XBP1s or ATF6(N) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The fact that MIEP activity and viral replication are virtually unaffected in the absence of either XBP1 or ATF6 but are massively reduced in the absence of both, strongly suggests that the two UPR TFs have redundant roles in the activation of the MIEP. The most important finding, however, is the dominant role of XBP1u as a repressor of viral gene expression and replication. When IRE1 is absent or its RNase activity is blocked, XBP1u dominates and prevents MIEP activation by XBP1s and ATF6(N). Thus, the transient activation of IRE1 during the early phase of MCMV infection serves the virus by increasing XBP1s and decreasing XBP1u expression, thereby relieving XPB1u-mediated repression. At present, the MCMV protein(s) responsible for the early activation of IRE1 remains unknown. Most of the viral envelope glycoproteins are expressed at late times post infection (i.e., starting 12 hpi) and are thus unlikely to be responsible. However, it is conceivable that certain early glycoproteins are particularly potent stress inducers, either by binding and sequestering BiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bakunts et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vitale et al., 2019</xref>) or by inducing ER calcium release. Possible candidates for the latter include the MCMV homolog of the HCMV UL37x1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sharon-Friling et al., 2006</xref>) or the viral G protein-coupled receptors, which can activate phospholipase C and the inositol trisphosphate receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boeck and Spencer, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sherrill et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>How exactly XBP1u antagonizes XBP1s and ATF6(N)-mediated promoter activation, remains to be determined. Two possible mechanisms may be involved: XBP1u could interact with XBP1s and ATF6(N) and target them for proteasomal degradation as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yoshida et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yoshida et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, XBP1u could bind directly to DNA and inhibit promoter activation by XBP1s and ATF6(N). Indeed, we show that XBP1u is fully capable of binding to the same DNA sequences that XBP1s binds to (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Moreover, a truncated XBP1 protein, XBP1stop, which lacks the C-terminal destabilizing domain of XBP1u, had a similar repressive effect as XBP1u (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) indicating that destabilization is not required for repression.</p><p>Ever since its discovery, the importance of XBP1u has been the subject of controversy. In yeast, the unspliced mRNA of HAC1, the yeast homolog of XBP1, is posttranscriptionally silenced, and a protein product of the unspliced HAC1 mRNA has not been detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rüegsegger et al., 2001</xref>). In mammalian cells, the XBP1u protein is readily detectable, but XBP1u has a short half-life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Navon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tirosh et al., 2006</xref>). This has led to the conclusion that XBP1u is of minor importance and its function restricted to fine-tuning of the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byrd and Brewer, 2012</xref>). Hence, many review articles on the UPR barely mention XBP1u. On the other hand, XBP1u has been shown to dimerize with XBP1s and ATF6(N) and destabilize them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yoshida et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yoshida et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting a more important regulatory role. However, the physiological relevance of these findings has been called into question by some scientists because the findings were made in cells overexpressing XBP1u. The results of our study show that XBP1u plays a very important role as a repressor of XBP1s and ATF6(N)-mediated activation of the MCMV MIEP, which results in a massively (up to 100-fold) reduced production of progeny virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5D</xref>). In IRE1-deficient cells, the <italic>Xbp1</italic> transcript is expressed from its endogenous promoter, not from a strong heterologous promoter. Thus, the observed effects cannot be dismissed as overexpression artifacts. Moreover, the fact that MCMV replication is massively reduced in <italic>Ern1</italic> ko cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref>), but not in <italic>Ern1</italic>/<italic>Xbp1</italic> dko cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), demonstrates that XBP1u expression rather than the absence of RIDD is responsible for the observed effect. Hence, the data of our study suggest that XBP1u plays an unexpectedly important role as a repressor, at least under the conditions of viral infection. Whether XBP1u can repress expression of cellular genes in a similar fashion is an important question that needs to be answered in future studies.</p><p>XBP1 binding sites have also been identified in immediate-early gene promoters of the γ-herpesviruses Epstein-Barr virus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, and murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68), suggesting a potential role for XBP1s in transactivating these promoters during reactivation from latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhende et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sun and Thorley-Lawson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yu et al., 2007</xref>). However, one study demonstrated that XBP1 was not required for MHV-68 reactivation in B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matar et al., 2014</xref>). The authors of the study speculated that the apparent independence of MHV-68 reactivation from XBP1 expression in B cells might reflect redundancy among CREB/ATF family TFs. In light of our data showing a redundancy of XBP1s and ATF6(N) in the activation of the MCMV MIEP, this conjecture may well be correct. Conversely, it would be interesting to know whether XBP1 and ATF6 also regulate MCMV reactivation from latency. Unfortunately, this obvious question is difficult to address as there is no manageable cell culture system for MCMV latency and reactivation. Nonetheless, it appears likely that β and γ-herpesviruses harness UPR TFs in a similar fashion to regulate their life cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">GS1783</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16526409">16526409</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">BAC host for recombineering</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>murid herpesvirus 1</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MCMV-GFP</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11209080">11209080</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">BAC-derived MCMV (Smith strain) expressing GFP</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HEK 293A</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">R705‐07;

For immunodetection, antibodies against the following epitopes were used: HA (16B12, Covance), β-actin (AC-74, Sigma), XBP1 (M-186, Santa Cruz), IRE1 (14C10, Cell Signaling), pIRE1 (NB100-2323, Novus Biologicals), TRAF2 (Cell Signaling), and GFP (Roche). Antibodies against MCMV IE1 (CROMA101), M57, and M55/gB (SN1.07) were provided by Stipan Jonjic (University of Rijeka, Croatia). Secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were purchased from Dako.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>RNA isolation and quantitative PCR</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from MEFs using an innuPREP RNA Mini Kit (Analytik-Jena). Reverse transcription and cDNA synthesis was carried out with 2 µg RNA using 200 U RevertAid H Minus Reverse Transcriptase, 100 pmol Oligo(dT)<sub>18</sub>, and 20 U RNase inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Quantitative real-time PCR reactions employing SYBR Green were run in a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The following primers were used: 5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">GAGTCCGCAGCAGGTG</named-content>-3′ and 5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">GTGTCAGAGTCCATGGGA</named-content>-3′ for <italic>Xbp1s</italic>, 5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">GTGTCAGAGTCCATGGGA</named-content>-3′ and 5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">GTGTCAGAGTCCATGGGA</named-content>-3′ for X<italic>bp1u, and</italic> 5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">CCCACTCTTCCACCTTCGATG</named-content>-3′ and 5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">GTCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAG</named-content>-3′ for <italic>Gapdh</italic>. Primers for the amplification of IE1 (M123), E1 (M112), gB (M55), and M37 transcripts have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chapa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chapa et al., 2014</xref>). Reactions were performed under the following conditions: 45 cycles of 3 s at 95°C and 30 s at 60°C. Three replicates were analyzed for each condition, and the relative amounts of mRNAs were calculated from the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) values by using <italic>Gapdh</italic> as reference.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Replication kinetics</title><p>Cells were seeded in 6-well plates and infected by an MOI of 3 or 0.1 for single or multi-step replication kinetics, respectively. Six hpi the medium was exchanged to remove the inoculum. Supernatant samples were harvested at different times post infection, and viral titers were determined on 10.1 fibroblasts using the TCID<sub>50</sub> method.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>MIE promotor activity assay</title><p>The firefly luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Basic, the renilla luciferase control vector pGL4.73, and the Dual-Glo Luciferase assay system were purchased from Promega. WT and mutant versions of the MCMV MIE promotor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies and cloned in pGL3-Basic. Cells were transfect in 6-well dishes using GenJet with pGL3-MIEP (0.5 µg), pGL4.73 (0.05 µg) and transcription factor expression plasmids. The total amount of DNA was kept constant at 3 µg by filling up with empty pcDNA3 vector. On the following day, the medium was exchanged and cells were incubated for another 24 hr. Cells were harvested in lysis buffer and luciferase activity was measured using a Dual-Glo Luciferase assay and a luminescence plate reader (FLUOstar-Omega, BMG Labtech). Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were evaluated for each sample. At least three biological replicates were used for each condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>DNA-Protein interaction ELISA (DPI-ELISA)</title><p>The DPI-ELISA was performed essentially as described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brand et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Underwood et al., 2013</xref>). Terminally biotinylated dsDNA oligonucleotides containing 3 copies of putative TF binding sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) were purchased from Eurofins. Oligonucleotides were adsorbed to streptavidin-coated 96-well microtiter plates and incubated with nuclear extracts (10 µg protein) from transfected HEK 293A cells expressing the HA-tagged XBP1 or ATF6(N) proteins. Nuclear extracts were obtained as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stahl et al., 2013</xref>). TF binding to DNA was quantified by ELISA using an anti-HA antibody, an HRP-coupled secondary antibody, and an ABTS substrate (Roche). Absorbance at 405 nm wavelength was measured using a FLUOstar-Omega plate reader. At least three biological replicates were used for each condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Cell viability assay</title><p>TetON-IRE1-GFP cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1000 cells per well. Cells were treated with 0, 10 or 25 nM doxycycline at the time of seeding. Medium was replenished 1 and 3 days after seeding. Cell viability was determined on day 3 and day 5 by measuring intracellular ATP levels with a Cell Titer-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit (Promega) and a FLUOstar Omega luminometer (BMG Labtech). The values were normalized to non-stimulated cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 5.0 software.

pathways on lytic herpesvirus replication. Importantly, very little is known about XBP1u effects on any virus, and the discovery of a repressive function for XBP1u provides a tidy explanation for IRE1 activation observed during early lytic replication. The study makes good use of CRISPR technology to knock out various components of the UPR pathway to identify genetic determinants of these responses. It is a well-investigated example of how a virus can both take advantage of a cellular pathway and subsequently repress it during a single infectious cycle.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Repression of viral gene expression and replication by the unfolded protein response effector XBP1u&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Karla Kirkegaard as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Hiderou Yoshida (Reviewer #2); Craig McCormick (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an organelle where secretory and membrane proteins are synthesized and folded with the assistance of ER chaperones. When synthesis of secretory or membrane proteins is increased and overwhelms the capacity of the ER, unfolded proteins are accumulated in the ER (ER stress), resulting in ER stress-induced cell death. To cope with ER stress, eukaryotic cells activates a cytoprotective mechanism called the ER stress response (also called the unfolded protein response (UPR)) in order to augment the capacity of the ER. In mammalian cells, the UPR consists of three response pathways, that is, the ATF6, IRE1 and PERK pathways. Each pathway is regulated by a specific sensor and a transcription factor. For instance, pATF6(P) and pATF6(N) are a sensor and a transcription factor for the ATF6 pathway, while IRE1 and pXBP1(S) are those for the IRE1 pathway. Mammalian XBP1 gene encodes two proteins, that is, pXBP1(U) and pXBP1(S). In normal growth conditions, pXBP1(U) protein is translated from unspliced XBP1 mRNA, whereas upon ER stress, activated IRE1 converts unspliced XBP1 mRNA into spliced mRNA, from which pXBP1(S) is translated. pXBP1(S) is an active transcription factor that induces transcription of ER-related genes, while pXBP1(U) has several functions, including transcriptional suppression against pXBP1(S) and pATF6(N), and anchoring unspliced mRNA to ER membrane.</p><p>During viral replication, a number of viral proteins are synthesized and activate the UPR to support the synthesis of their proteins. On the other hand, the system of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) augmented by the IRE1 pathway degrades viral proteins and the PERK pathway attenuates translation of viral proteins. Thus, the UPR is beneficial as well as harmful to virus, and in some cases virus modulate the UPR of host cells to ensure propagation of their offspring.</p><p>It has been revealed that cytomegalovirus (CMV) modulates the mammalian UPR. It limits translational repression of their proteins by the PERK pathway, and enhances folding of their proteins through induced expression of ER chaperones by the ATF6 pathway. Interestingly, the authors previously revealed that the UPR is activated during the early phase of viral replication, while CMV reduces expression of IRE1 by their proteins (M50 and UL50) during the late phase of the replication.</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors examined the mechanism and the biological significance of the transient activation of the UPR in the early phase of CMV replication. They found that moderate activation of RNase activity of IRE1 is beneficial to replication. Interestingly, they showed that pXBP1(U) can suppress replication, while pATF6(N) and pXBP1(S) are beneficial for replication by upregulating transcription of the viral major immediate-early promoter (MIEP) genes through the Motif 4 enhancer element. From these observations, the authors concluded that CMV harnesses the UPR to regulate its own life cycle by activating the IRE1-XBP1 pathway during the early post infection to relieve repression by pXBP1(U). Their findings are important not only for viral research but also for the research of the UPR, since they revealed the redundant function of pXBP1(S) and pATF6(N) as activators of the viral life cycle, and an unexpected role of pXBP1(U) as a potent repressor of both pXBP1(S) and pATF6(N)-mediated activation.</p><p>That the product of an unspliced version of a cellular message is subverted by a virus is extremely interesting, and this work is well-executed.

Figure 1 shows XBP1u mRNA gets spliced at 6-7 hours after infection with a rapid decline of XBP1u splicing from 8-24 hours.

The late glycoprotein B is already observed at 2 days after infection (Figure 3D-F).</p><p>c) Figure 3. The effect of IRE1 ko on viral replication is very clear; IRE1 deficiency drops multiround replication by several logs. The diminished viral protein accumulation on the western blots in Figure 3D is quite subtle by comparison, but understandable because it is a high MOI single-cycle infection rather than low MOI multiround. Essentially, it is difficult to draw a strong conclusion from these western blots, and they certainly could use more support in the form of RT-qPCR for viral transcripts (which would not be limited to available antibodies, and could be used in concert with multi-round infection, as in Figure 3B.)</p><p>d) Some conclusions are not adequately supported by the data. For example, while the authors provide evidence for transient IRE1 activation during MCMV infection via an RT-qPCR assay that measures XBP1 mRNA splicing, they do not corroborate this data with more direct evidence of IRE1 activation via immunoblotting for IRE1 phosphorylation or XBP1s protein accumulation, which is standard practice in the UPR field. Moreover, they do not investigate whether MCMV infection (in either low MOI or high MOI infections) affects the levels or activation of IRE1, XBP1, or any other UPR component. In this regard, application of the RT-qPCR assay for XBP1 splicing to an MCMV infection time course would be quite informative.</p><p>e) It remains unclear whether MCMV infection causes alterations in the levels or activation of any of the cellular UPR machinery like IRE1, XBP1s or ATF6. At the least, this RT-qPCR data should be accompanied by western blots that show clear accumulation of XBP1s protein, so the authors can confidently conclude that IRE1 is indeed being activated and having the anticipated effect on XBP1s protein accumulation. The authors should directly demonstrate IRE1 activation in response to infection using conventional western blotting techniques, looking for IRE1 phosphorylation and impeded electrophoretic mobility, or accumulation of XBP1u or XBP1s proteins.</p><p>2) In Figure 2, it remains formally possible that higher doses of dox in Figure 2 negatively impact MCMV replication in an IRE1-independent manner.

We fully agree that this is the most likely explanation. A seminal paper by Feroz Papa’s laboratory has shown that strong induction of IRE1 expression leads to its autoactivation, ER stress, and apoptosis (Han et al., 2009). We have measured the viability of the IRE1-GFP expressing fibroblasts on day 3 and 5 after induction with different concentrations of doxycycline and found a significantly decreased viability upon induction with 25 nM dox. In the revised manuscript we state that impaired cell viability is probably the reason for the low virus titers obtained after induction with high dox concentrations and refer to the paper of Han et al. as well as our own data (included as Figure 2D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Figure 3.

We agree that this is a good way to support our claim that MCMV activates IRE1 and XBP1s at early times post infection. A Western blot time course showing total IRE1, phosphorylated IRE1, and XBP1s has been included in Figure 1 as a new panel C.

We do not know yet which viral proteins are responsible, but there are a few obvious candidates. Calcium release from the ER can cause ER stress and activate IRE1, and therefore viral protein inducing ER calcium release would be good candidates. In HCMV, the UL37x1 protein causes ER calcium release (Sharon-Friling et al., 2006). Its homolog in MCMV, the m38.5 protein, might have the same function. Moreover, MCMV encodes several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCR-dependent activation of phospholipase C and production of IP3 can also induce ER calcium release. Indeed, preliminary experiments in our lab have shown that inhibitors of PLC or the IP3 receptor inhibit the MCMV-induced Xbp1 mRNA splicing.</p><p>The transient induction of Xbp1 splicing occurs at early times (peak at 6 hpi), whereas massive accumulation of MCMV glycoproteins occurs much later. Most of the viral envelope glycoproteins are expressed at late times post infection (i.e., starting 12 hpi). However, it is possible that certain early glycoproteins are particularly potent ER stress inducers, either by causing ER calcium release (as suggested above) or by binding and sequestering BiP. In the revised manuscript, we discuss possible mechanisms (Discussion paragraph one).</p></body></sub-article></article>
