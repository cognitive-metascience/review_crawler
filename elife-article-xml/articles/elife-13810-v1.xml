debate. Here we show that PCs use a multiplexed spike code. Synchrony/spike time and firing rate encode different information in behaving monkeys during saccadic eye motion tasks. Using the local field potential (LFP) as a probe of local network activity, we found that infrequent pause spikes, which initiated or terminated intermittent pauses in simple spike trains, provide a temporally reliable signal for eye motion onset, with strong phase-coupling to the β/γ band LFP. Concurrently, regularly firing, non-pause spikes were weakly correlated with the LFP, but were crucial to linear encoding of eye movement kinematics by firing rate. Therefore, PC spike trains can simultaneously convey information necessary to achieve precision in both timing and continuous control of motion.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13810.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13810.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13810.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The cerebellum is a part of the brain that uses information from the senses to coordinate movement. Cells called Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum produce the final ‘output’ of its cortex. Therefore, Purkinje neurons have to communicate precise information about different aspects of the movement, such as its speed and timing. This information is likely to be represented by patterns of electrical activity within Purkinje neurons, but these patterns are still not fully understood.</p><p>Hong et al. recorded and analyzed electrical ‘spikes’, the output activity of Purkinje neurons, while monkeys made rapid eye movements. The recordings showed that occasional pauses in the otherwise regularly firing spikes of Purkinje neurons signaled the start of the eye movements. The pauses were accompanied by a sharp change in the local field potential, another electrical signal that comes from many neurons in the neighborhood. In the same cells, the rate of regularly firing spikes increased and decreased with the direction and speed of eye movements, following a simple relationship and independently of the local field potential.</p><p>Purkinje neurons therefore appear to use both the timing and the rate of their spiking activity to represent movement. This resolves conflicting reports in the literature claiming that either rates of spiking or their timing code essential information about movements: both are important. This way of representing information by combining more than one source is known as multiplexed coding.</p><p>Next, experiments recording electrical activity from many cells in the cerebellum at the same time are needed to find out how multiple Purkinje neurons can pause their spiking activity at the same time. Future experiments should also uncover how pauses in spiking and firing rates change with learning.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13810.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13810.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>neural coding</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>Purkinje cell</kwd><kwd>sensorimotor system</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004199</institution-id><institution>Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hong</surname><given-names>Sungho</given-names></name><name><surname>Negrello</surname><given-names>Mario</given-names></name><name><surname>De Schutter</surname><given-names>Erik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Unit FOR 1847/1, Project A3 (TH 425/13-1)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thier</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Joint project Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience, 01GQ1002A, Project C3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Junker</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name><name><surname>Smilgin</surname><given-names>Aleksandra</given-names></name><name><surname>Thier</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PITN-GA-2009-238214-C7</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smilgin</surname><given-names>Aleksandra</given-names></name><name><surname>Thier</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cerebellar Purkinje neurons use a multiplexed simple spike code combining synchrony/spike time and firing rate, with each component encoding distinct information about movements such as motion onset timing and kinematics.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Movements are often executed with high precision in timing and trajectory control. The cerebellum is heavily involved in online motor control and should process sensorimotor information with great accuracy. In particular, PCs, which deliver the final output from the cerebellar cortex, should use an appropriate coding strategy for this task, but the nature of their coding mechanism is actively debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Zeeuw et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heck et al., 2013</xref>). In one view, transmission of timing-sensitive information is performed by precisely timed PC spikes and their synchronized firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ebner and Bloedel, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gauck and Jaeger, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shin and De Schutter, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Solages et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Zeeuw et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Person and Raman, 2012</xref>). In the other, PCs use <italic>linear</italic> firing-rate coding with weak PC-to-PC correlations to robustly control continuous movement kinematics, where high signal-to-noise ratio is achieved by averaging the rates of many PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shidara et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thier et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roitman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Medina and Lisberger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Catz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Herzfeld et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we re-examined this controversy using a new approach to analyze PC spike trains. We classified PC spikes into specific spike categories, and correlated spike categories with the LFP, using the LFP as a proxy signal for local network activity. In particular, we focused on the role of long, infrequent interspike intervals (ISI), called pauses, which abruptly interrupt the rapid and very regular firing of PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schonewille et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shin and De Schutter, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yartsev et al., 2009</xref>). Pauses in the PC spike train are a well-known phenomenon in many contexts, such as saccades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ohtsuka and Noda, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnstein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Herzfeld et al., 2015</xref>), and classical conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rasmussen et al., 2008</xref>), etc. Spikes that initiate and terminate pauses often synchronize sharply across nearby PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shin and De Schutter, 2006</xref>). This suggests that pauses can be simultaneously involved in spike coding by individual PCs and with collective encoding in a local network.</p><p>Our approach was to examine the relationships among PC spikes, cerebellar LFPs, and eye motion, with a focus on how those relationships change, depending on the spike category. Using this, we demonstrate that PC spikes simultaneously contribute to precision, both in timing and control of motion by adaptive use of synchrony/spike time and rate coding scheme.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cerebellar LFP and single PC firing correlate to saccadic eye movements</title><p>From three rhesus (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) monkeys (E, H, and N), we simultaneously recorded spikes of single PCs, the slow component of the LFP below low-γ frequency (42 Hz), and eye positions during spontaneous and visually guided saccades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Two sharp differences between the LFP and spikes were noticed: First, CCF<sub>LFP-EV</sub> was significant in recordings from 49 cells (p&lt;0.01, <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>n </italic>= 33, 15, 1 from E, H, and N, respectively), but significant CCF<sub>Spike-EV</sub> was found only in a subset of 34 cells (p&lt;0.01, <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>n </italic>= 21, 12, 1 from E, H, and N, respectively). These 34 cells were used in the rest of the analysis. Second, when computed to account for the eye speed component for specific directions, the CCF varied less significantly with the angles of eye movements for the LFP than for spikes, in most cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). We also computed the average LFP and firing rates for saccades with different directions and durations, and found that they shared the same properties, having similar waveforms as the CCFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>).</p><p>We identified eye saccade-related neurons based on CCF<sub>LFP-EV</sub> and CCF<sub>Spike-EV</sub>; this is essentially identical to the classical method used to localize eye motion-sensitive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ohtsuka and Noda, 1992</xref>). Differences in how LFP and PC spikes relate to eye movements were similar to previously reported differences between multiple PCs versus single units, where the averaged activity of multiple PCs is more robust, but much less direction-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ohtsuka and Noda, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thier et al., 2000</xref>). This supports the view that the LFP represents the average activity of many neurons with diverse angle-dependencies in the local network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buzsáki et al., 2012</xref>) rather than reflecting the activity of a single PC or a cluster of PCs with similar directional tuning. For this reason, the LFP and spikes apparently do not encode identical information about eye motion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PCs fire regularly most of the time, but occasionally pause</title><p>All recorded PCs fired rapidly (55 ± 18 Hz, mean ± SD) with high regularity.

Some previous studies discussed extremely long (&gt;200 ms) pauses and related them to membrane bistability of the PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Loewenstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schonewille et al., 2006</xref>). However, the majority of longer ISIs, or pauses, were much shorter (&lt;100 ms), even when they were associated with a moderately large AI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Note that these were therefore comparable or larger in duration to pauses triggered by complex spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Latham and Paul, 1970</xref>) (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>) and also those following simple spike bursts induced by optogenetic excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Although complex spikes triggered pauses, their contribution to pauses in our study remained limited. Complex spikes had a larger average AI than simple spikes (complex: 0.36 ± 0.12, simple: 5.9 × 10<sup>-4</sup> ± 7.7 × 10<sup>-4</sup>), but their standard deviations were comparable (complex: 0.36 ± 0.05, simple: 0.31 ± 0.04). This implies that AI values were widely distributed in both simple and complex spikes. However, durations of complex-spike pauses did not increase as rapidly with AI as those of simple-spike pauses. In all cells, correlations between AI and log<sub>10 </sub>(ISI) were significantly smaller for complex spikes than simple spikes (complex: 0.24 ± 0.15, simple: 0.66 ± 0.03; p&lt;2.84 × 10<sup>-12</sup>, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), which made complex-spikes pauses poorly predicted by AI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Therefore, if we select ~10% of all ISIs as representative 'pauses', based on ISI size and the AI value of a preceding spike (see below), only 4.3 ± 2.5% of all pauses would be caused by complex spikes. For this reason, we did not include complex spikes and their associated pauses in our analysis beyond this point.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Pause spikes couple strongly to the LFP and specifically to the β/γ band</title><p>Our first question was whether the relationship between spikes of individual PCs and the activity of the local network vary with specific spike categories, i.e., regular-firing or pause-related. To examine this, we first selected three subsets of simple spikes from each cell, representing regular, pause-initiating, and pause-terminating spikes, based on a criterion combining AI and ISI duration (see Materials and methods) that selected ~10% of all spikes in each category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Then, we computed the spike-triggered average LFP (STA<sub>LFP</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gray and Singer, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Soteropoulos and Baker, 2006</xref>) for each.</p><p>We found that the STA<sub>LFP</sub> of spikes that initiated or terminated pauses was sharply different from those of regular spikes: the pause-related STA<sub>LFP</sub> was characterized by strong and sharp peaks around the spike time, whereas the regular spike-related STA<sub>LFP</sub> showed only a weak modulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> left, B). For comparison, if computed with randomly selected, or all simple spikes, the STA<sub>LFP</sub> showed a level of peak correlation similar to that of regular spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> right, B).

To estimate how reliably spikes fired at certain LFP phases, we computed the pairwise phase consistency (PPC), which is an average coincidence between any two spikes in the LFP phase space (see Materials and methods for more details) and provides an unbiased measure of phase locking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vinck et al., 2010</xref>). Again, we found a large difference between pause and regular spikes in their PPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), specifically for the β/γ LFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Notably, pause-initiating spikes preferentially occurred near the climbing phase, i.e., &lt;φ<sub>PauseI</sub>&gt; = 48.7º ± 45.7º where φ<sub>PauseI</sub> was the most preferred phase for each data set, and pause-terminating spikes were shifted by about 3/4 cycles on average (&lt;φ<sub>PauseT</sub>&gt; = &lt;φ<sub>PauseI</sub>&gt; + 278.3º ± 35.3º) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>These results clearly show that pauses are not randomly occurring events.

The most significant pattern that we observed was that pause-initiating spikes encode saccade onsets with a significant and sharp increase in average firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This could be caused either by a firing rate increase of pause spikes during some saccades, or by a sharp spike-time correlation across most saccade trials, i.e. reliable spiking. To ascertain which, we estimated how many spike coincidence events occurred beyond the prediction from the firing rate, from all possible pairings of spike trains and saccades, which we called the spike reliability: Briefly, for each pair of saccade trials, we counted spike coincidences (|<italic>Δt</italic>|≤3 ms) between two spike trains within a 50 ms-long moving time window, centered at <italic>t</italic> (−100 ms ≤<italic>t</italic>≤150 ms, relative to saccade onset).

The fraction of those significant coincidences from all cells, summed over all trials and time, became the spike reliability. Significantly coincident spikes were indeed found during significant peaks of firing probability (colored regions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>); therefore, spike reliability was significantly higher for pause spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), further emphasizing their role in encoding the onset of eye motion. Finally, the LFP phase and spike reliability were much more steeply related to each other for pause-initiating spikes than for regular spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

For this, we imposed different thresholds on CV<sub>2</sub> (=2|AI|) for selecting the regular spikes, computed the direction-dependent CCF<sub>Spike-EV</sub> of those selected spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and estimated its similarity to that of the full spike train by computing their correlation coefficient <italic>ρ</italic>. We found that <italic>ρ</italic> quickly grew as we increased the CV<sub>2</sub> threshold, whereas the fraction of regular spikes increased more slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). For example, when we select ~47% of all spikes as regular spikes by imposing CV<sub>2 </sub>&lt; 0.4, their CCF<sub>Spike-EV</sub> is very similar (<italic>ρ ≈ </italic>0.93 in average) to that of the full spike train. Even at 20%, CCF<sub>Spike-EV</sub> of these regular spikes had <italic>ρ ≈ </italic>0.85 on average, similar to the linear coding property (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Note that <italic>ρ</italic> for pause spikes behaved very differently; it was not significant for a reasonable fractions of pause spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> inset).</p><p>The combination of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> demonstrates that regular spikes dominate rate coding. Regular spike and full spike trains respond to similar motion features and also share the linear coding property. Our results resemble those of a previous report in which 'patterns' of regularly firing spikes dominate the rate responses of PCs to sensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shin et al., 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, pause spikes can make small contributions to rate coding. With all spikes, the LN model is empirically linear, but the rate coding of regular spikes predicted by the model is slightly less linear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). Pause spikes, which by definition represent fast rate changes, must compensate for this.</p><p>One regular spike is inexpensive from the standpoint of information content, because a small and very regular subset can already provide a good approximation of the full rate modulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, regular spikes are weakly coupled to network activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This evidence strongly suggests linear rate coding as the primary role of regular spikes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Examples in sensory and motor systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Riehle et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Panzeri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gire et al., 2013</xref>) and theoretical analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ratté et al., 2013</xref>) have shown that neurons can use multiplexed coding strategies, where each spike in a single spike train can differentially couple to local network activity and encode different information about sensory stimuli or behavior. This study presents the first evidence for multiplexed coding in cerebellar Purkinje cells. Specifically, spikes that initiate pauses are strongly coupled to the β/γ band of the LFP and are therefore probably synchronized among nearby PCs. These spikes form a temporally reliable signal to initiate saccadic eye motion. Conversely, regular spikes in the same spike trains are desynchronized among nearby PCs and form a rate code that predicts direction selective eye kinematics. Use of a multiplexed code resolves the perceived contradiction between temporal and rate coding that has dominated recent discussions about PC spiking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Zeeuw et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heck et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Pauses in the spike train are observed in many tonically firing neurons in various contexts. In striatal cholinergic interneurons, synchronized pauses after bursts encode a salient stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aosaki et al., 1995</xref>). Since pause-initiating and -terminating spikes can synchronize sharply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jaeger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shin and De Schutter, 2006</xref>), PCs can potentially operate by a similar coding mechanism. In fact, spike synchronization by PCs is a powerful mechanism to control their postsynaptic targets in the cerebellar nucleus (CN). With exceptionally fast GABAergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Person and Raman, 2012</xref>), CN neurons can reliably generate time-locked rebound spikes in response to synchronized inputs followed by simultaneous disinhibition, even at moderate levels of synchrony (≤50%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Person and Raman, 2012</xref>) and spike time jitter (≤20 ms) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gauck and Jaeger, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sudhakar et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, recent optogenetic experiments have shown that synchronous pauses induced either by direct/indirect inhibition or at the offset of direct excitation, can reliably trigger firing in CN neurons, and importantly, at movement onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heiney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). Crucially, excitation-induced pauses were short (~35 ms), but effective, and even shorter pauses from direct inhibition caused similar effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Synchronized pause spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shin and De Schutter, 2006</xref>) can not only represent timing information, but also can complement a rate code. Previous studies have analyzed PC firing collected over many trials and neurons, and found that a collective representation of time and motion emerges as a form of burst firing alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thier et al., 2000</xref>) or together with suppressed/paused firing of many PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Catz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnstein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Herzfeld et al., 2015</xref>). Our results suggest that pause spikes can enhance temporal fidelity of such population-level representations since their temporal consistency across different PCs (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) can offer a reliable representation, despite large heterogeneity in rate coding schemes of different PCs. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Herzfeld et al. (2015)</xref> found that population PC coding of saccade direction depends critically on the timing of pause onset, which varies only up to ~10 ms. Here we showed that pause spikes of individual PCs can indeed fire with a reliability of a few milliseconds. This can be particularly important at the single trial/saccade level, but averaging over multiple trials and cells may not be a suitable approach to probe it. Instead, we evaluated the correlation between simultaneously recorded PC spikes and LFP, and also trial-to-trial correlation (reliability) of those signals, for each cell. Our results show that synchronized pause spikes constitute the most significant population signal in PCs despite their sparse appearance in individual spike trains, suggesting that they can be a specific signaling mechanism in the PC-CN part of the motor pathway.</p><p>The spike-LFP relationship indicates that pause spikes are generated by the local network. While firings by presynaptic afferents, granule cells, Golgi cells, as well as by the postsynaptic targets, are clearly related to the LFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Soteropoulos and Baker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dugué et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ros et al., 2009</xref>), PCs only occasionally or weakly modulate their simple spike firing with the LFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Courtemanche et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ros et al., 2009</xref>), except for the very high frequency component (~200 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Solages et al., 2008</xref>). Here we found that the β/γ LFP robustly and preferentially couples to pause spikes and that both can reliably encode time information in a correlated way. Considering that cerebellar LFP is coherent with neocortical LFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Courtemanche and Lamarre, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Soteropoulos and Baker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ros et al., 2009</xref>) and also plays a critical role in maintaining LFP coherence between the sensory and motor cortex, particularly in the low γ band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Popa et al., 2013</xref>), pause spikes may also have a special relationship with the LFP in the cerebral cortex.</p><p>We did not attempt to resolve the origin of the time encoding LFP signal due to limitations of the experimental setup. However, there are multiple possible primary sources. One is the dense activation of mossy fibers and granule cells that accompanies the significant LFP in the granular layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morissette and Bower, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roggeri et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diwakar et al., 2011</xref>). Because our electrodes are probably too far from the granular layer to detect the signal directly, it is likely that that localized massive activity propagates via ascending and parallel fibers to activate many interneurons and ultimately PCs. In particular, molecular layer interneurons (MLI) could provide significant feedforward inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mittmann et al., 2005</xref>), causing PCs to pause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mittmann and Häusser, 2007</xref>). If simultaneous activation of local MLIs (and/or their synaptic inputs to the local population of PCs) contributes to the LFP, this would explain our observed correlation of the fast LFP signal and pauses in PCs. However, the time-encoding signal components we observed seem to be highly localized in the cerebellar cortex. In LFPs recorded ~1 mm horizontally from the spike electrode, STA<sub>LFP</sub> amplitude, particularly of pause spikes was greatly diminished to absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). This suggests that the pause-related β/γ LFP signal originates from localized sources and decays quickly with distance, spreading at most a few hundred microns. This is consistent with the fact that PCs are rarely synchronized unless they are very close to each other (&lt;100 μm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ebner and Bloedel, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jaeger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shin and De Schutter, 2006</xref>).</p><p>We also found that the effect of complex spikes was minimal since pauses triggered by complex spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Latham and Paul, 1970</xref>) had a distinct distribution compared to simple-spike pauses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The overall impact of complex spikes was negligible, most probably because none of our tasks involved sensorimotor learning where complex spikes are crucial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Catz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Medina and Lisberger, 2008</xref>), as they tend to occur after saccades, triggered by significant saccade errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Herzfeld et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Many studies have reported significant correlated spiking in similar settings. In the motor and visual cortex, synchronized spikes have larger STA<sub>LFP</sub> and better phase locking to the motion-related LFP β oscillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ito et al., 2011</xref>). In another part of the cerebellum, Medina and Lisberger found that firing rate variability and cross-correlation of PC firing both peaked at the onset of smooth-pursuit eye motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Medina and Lisberger, 2007</xref>). Our findings are consistent with their observations since pause spikes, which fire reliably with respect to motion onset, have higher ISI variability, and significant coupling to the LFP implies correlated firing. Medina and Lisberger also suggested that such correlated spiking is due to common input to PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Medina and Lisberger, 2007</xref>), which can significantly contribute to the LFP signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denker et al., 2011</xref>) and trigger synchronized pauses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jaeger, 2003</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, PCs also use linear rate coding of eye movements and here non-pause regular spikes are predominant. Linear coding of motion kinematics by the PC firing rate has been repeatedly observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shidara et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roitman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Medina and Lisberger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Herzfeld et al., 2015</xref>). If correlations with other PCs are weak, as is the case for regular spikes, rate coding by individual PCs can precisely control continuous movements since CN neurons receive inputs from many PCs and can average away noise in individual inputs.</p><p>Because different stages of a movement may demand that some aspects of the motion be controlled more precisely than others, it is useful for PCs to use different spike codes. Our study demonstrates that PCs can use both temporal- and rate-coding schemes to multiplex their population output with different types of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Schutter and Steuber, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ratté et al., 2013</xref>), so that precision in motion timing and continuous control can be managed adaptably.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Timothy Behrens as the Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Fred Rieke, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Consensus review (discussed by all reviewers):</p><p>This is an interesting paper that suggests that cerebellar Purkinje cells exhibit multiplexed coding – in which spikes at the onset or offset of pauses in spike activity signify the onset of an eye movement, while spikes part of more regular firing patterns represent eye movement properties. The reviewers felt the paper had the potential to provide key insights into Purkinje cell coding and to resolve some issues in the literature. Several issues, however, limited enthusiasm and need to be dealt with before considering the paper further. These are listed below in rough order of importance.</p><p>1) Importance of complex spikes. Complex spikes are described in the Discussion as having effectively no impact on the conclusions of the paper. However, it is not clear to what extent the results presented reflect complex-spike-triggered pauses in Purkinje cell firing (see Reviewer #2 comments). This issue needs to be clarified, presumably by additional analyses.</p><p>2) Event selection. All of the reviewers had concerns about how spikes were selected for analysis. The core issue is whether the selection process used in the paper biased the results by focusing on a small subset of spikes and omitting others. Controls to test for such biases and to assess the generality of the reported result are needed. These include a more straightforward analysis to identify pauses (see Reviewer #3 comments) and analysis that are more inclusive of all the spikes (see Reviewer #1 comments).</p><p>3) LFP phase reliability and Purkinje cell synchrony. How confident can we be that the reliability of the LFP phase is due to synchrony? The reviewers did not feel this point necessarily needed to be resolved by data from cell populations, but instead that any caveats of the interpretation needed to be discussed carefully.</p><p>4) Writing. The results could be presented in a more accessible manner, which will be particularly important give <italic>eLife</italic>'s broad readership. See reviewer comments for specific suggestions.</p><p>These, and other, issues are detailed below in the comments from the individual reviewers.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>I am not an expert in Purkinje cell coding, so will leave comments about significance of the findings and relation with other work on the cerebellum to the more expert reviewers. The comments below deal specifically with more general coding issues and overall presentation of the work. My main concerns had to do with the selection of data to analyze, and how that selection influences the results and interpretation of the findings as well as some writing issues.</p><p>Data selection.</p><p>I was concerned about several issues about the data included or excluded from analysis. First, in a subset of recordings (subsection “Cerebellar LFP and single PC firing correlate to saccadic eye movements”, second paragraph) spike times and eye velocity exhibited significant correlations. The other recordings were apparently omitted from subsequent analysis. Is that because these are likely cells that do not participate in the control of eye movements? It would be helpful to indicate why that selection of data is justified.</p><p>Second, related to above, some selection of recordings was apparently made based on LFP coherence (subsection “Pause spikes and their correlated LFP component encode the timing of eye motion”, second paragraph) – but the details are also unclear.</p><p>Third, the identification of pause spikes and regularly firing spikes omits the majority of the recorded spikes. Given the large differences in properties of the pause and regular spikes, the question of what the other spikes are doing comes up immediately. I think this is a key issue with respect to the multiplexing concept – is there a continuum between the extremes represented by the pause and regular spikes, or is there a more discrete transition?

The experimental systems used by the authors (cerebellum and saccadic eye movements) offer some powerful advantages for analyzing this issue. The manuscript builds on the De Schutter group's previous work suggesting that brief, synchronized pauses in Purkinje cell firing may play a key role in cerebellar function.

Pause beginning spikes are defined so that they are 10% of all spikes. Complex spikes are nearly 2% of all spikes, so could potentially account for ~20% of the pause beginning spikes-if pause beginning spikes associated with a complex spike are removed, do the results still hold? If so, that would strengthen the authors' claim that the effects they report are not related to the complex spikes.

Although this appears to be true, it also appears that there is a nonlinearity in the encoding of eye velocity by the regular spikes, which is compensated by the pause spikes in a way that makes the population as a whole more linear re eye velocity. Is this a reasonable interpretation? If so, it seems worth mentioning.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript by Hong et al. describes analyses of Purkinje neuron spike trains that shed light on the potential population encoding strategies of this cell population with respect to movement kinematics. They analyze LFPs and simple spikes during saccadic eye movements and find that LFP measurements are more tightly correlated with eye movement onset than single-spike trains, and that long interspike interval – &quot;pauses&quot; – phase-locked with these predictive LFPs. The conclusion from these pause-related data is that pauses encode saccade onsets. On the other hand, overall firing rate is highly correlated with eye velocity, with the &quot;regular&quot; spikes within this population. Pairing these observations, the authors conclude that multiplexed coding occurs with Purkinje firing.</p><p>I like the direction taken here and find most of the analyses important. There are some important missing pieces of information, however, that make evaluating the findings challenging and therefore a strong recommendation for accepting or rejecting the manuscript is premature. Of paramount importance is the selection of spikes beginning long pauses: &quot;we selected 15% of largest AI values. […] then removed 25% of the spikes with the shortest pause ISI.&quot; Since this process operates on ISI ratios, it is unclear what the ISI durations are that are being analyzed as pauses. Moreover, because this analysis relies on ratios and not overall ISI duration, (which would seem a more natural criterion for long ISIs), it is selecting for essentially bursty sequences of short-then-longish spikes. Interpreting the data through this light seems different than interpreting it through the lens of 'pauses' or longest ISIs. While I acknowledge that there may be no perfect solution to identifying pauses, I am not provided enough information to evaluate their claims because I don't know if the pauses they have chosen are unique in any way, or are alternatively unique in ways they do not highlight. In addition to the distribution of 'pause' ISIs vs. all ISIs, a plot of ISI<sub>n</sub> vs. ISI<sub>n+1</sub> would provide non-ratioed data that may help reveal unique characteristics of the 'pause' population.</p><p>An important assumption to the interpretation of the data advanced by the study is that the LFP correlation with pause onset spikes reflects synchronous firing. Since LFPs reflect synaptic and spiking currents, it may be that correlation detected is simply a readout of the fact that pushing the ISI off of the basal firing rates reflects synaptic input, which is also reflected in the LFP. I am not confident that any data analysis short of multi single-unit array recordings could resolve whether single spikes are temporally aligned at the onset of a pause to the degree necessary for synchrony coding in the nuclei, but I could be persuaded by experts of LFP interpretation.</p><p>Overall I think this manuscript could really help resolve an ongoing debate and find many of their observations tantalizing. The information and caveats I raise above prevent me from providing overwhelming support.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13810.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>This is an interesting paper that suggests that cerebellar Purkinje cells exhibit multiplexed coding – in which spikes at the onset or offset of pauses in spike activity signify the onset of an eye movement, while spikes part of more regular firing patterns represent eye movement properties. The reviewers felt the paper had the potential to provide key insights into Purkinje cell coding and to resolve some issues in the literature. Several issues, however, limited enthusiasm and need to be dealt with before considering the paper further. These are listed below in rough order of importance.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Importance of complex spikes. Complex spikes are described in the Discussion as having effectively no impact on the conclusions of the paper. However, it is not clear to what extent the results presented reflect complex-spike-triggered pauses in Purkinje cell firing (see Reviewer #2 comments). This issue needs to be clarified, presumably by additional analyses.</italic></p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have included expanded statistics and discussion about the impact of complex spikes on our results (see also our response to Reviewer #2). We found that the effect of complex spikes was almost negligible, mainly because pauses triggered by complex spikes have different characteristics from simple-spike pauses that we selected.</p><p>This is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref> based on the cell used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. In A(included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> in the revision), we plot the asymmetry index (AI) versus post-spike ISI where “pauses” selected by our criterion are in light blue, complex spike pauses in orange, and the rest in purple. First, the AI distribution of complex spikes was slightly shifted to the right but widely spread. In all cells, complex spikes had a larger average AI (complex: 0.36 ± 0.12, simple: 5.9 × 10<sup>-4</sup> ± 7.7 × 10<sup>-4</sup>, mean ± SD) whereas their standard deviations were comparable (complex: 0.36 ± 0.05, simple: 0.31 ± 0.04). Therefore, many complex spikes had smaller AI than the thresholds. Second, durations of complex-spike pauses did not increase as rapidly as those of simple spike pauses with the asymmetry index. In all the cells, the correlation between AI and log<sub>10</sub>(ISI) was significantly larger for simple spikes than complex spikes (complex: 0.24 ± 0.15, simple: 0.66 ± 0.03, p = 2.84 × 10<sup>-12</sup>, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), which made the complex-spikes pauses poorly predicted by the asymmetry index. This led to only a small overlap between the orange and light blue dots. In all the cells, the overlap, or the fraction of the complex spike-triggered pauses in selected pauses, was only 4.3 ± 2.5% (B).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13810.016</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13810.016">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13810.016</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-13810-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p>Even in the few cases where complex spikes contributed more than 10% of selected pauses, removing complex spikes improved our signal-to-noise ratio. This is because the LFP triggered by complex spikes have a large positive peak while other pause-initiating simple spikes tend to be associated with a sharp negative peak, as shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 2</xref> (PauseI, PauseT, and Regular stand for pause-initiating, -terminating, and regular spikes, respectively).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13810.017</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13810.017">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13810.017</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-13810-resp-fig2-v1"/></fig></p><p>In the revised version, we write in Results “PCs fire regularly most of the time, but occasionally pause”:</p><p>“Although complex spikes triggered pauses, their contribution to pauses in our study remained limited. […] For this reason, we did not include complex spikes and their associated pauses in our analysis beyond this point.”</p><p>Also in Discussion:</p><p>“We also found that the effect of complex spikes was minimal since pauses triggered by complex spikes (Latham and Paul 1970) had a distinct distribution compared to simple-spike pauses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The overall impact of complex spikes was negligible, most probably because none of our tasks involved sensorimotor learning where complex spikes are crucial (Catz et al. 2005; Medina and Lisberger 2008), as they tend to occur after saccades, triggered by significant saccade errors (Herzfeld et al. 2015).”</p><p><italic>2) Event selection. All of the reviewers had concerns about how spikes were selected for analysis. The core issue is whether the selection process used in the paper biased the results by focusing on a small subset of spikes and omitting others. Controls to test for such biases and to assess the generality of the reported result are needed. These include a more straightforward analysis to identify pauses (see Reviewer #3 comments) and analysis that are more inclusive of all the spikes (see Reviewer #1 comments).</italic></p><p>We checked whether including more spikes would change our results. In the selection criterion for pause spikes described in the original submission, we chose 15% of the spikes with larger CV<sub>2</sub> values and removed 25% of those that were associated with shorter pauses. Previously we used a simpler criterion, the CV<sub>2</sub> criterion, which gave very similar results as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 3</xref>, which shows the STA<sub>LFP</sub>s for the same cell as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. Because we received feedback that this resulted in the inclusion of rather short pauses, we added the short pause removal step to the selection criterion.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13810.018</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13810.018">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13810.018</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-13810-resp-fig3-v1"/></fig></p><p>As an additional control, we varied the fraction of the initial choice from 10% to 50% by steps of 10%, and also applied the 25% removal of short pauses. Therefore, the fraction of pause spikes varied from 7.5% to 37.5% in increments of 7.5%. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref> shows how the STA<sub>LFP</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> varied with different number of spikes chosen. In pause spikes, the fast fluctuating initial part of the STA<sub>LFP</sub> is quite invariant in shape while the amplitude slightly decreases as we include more spikes. In the regular spike case, there was almost no difference.</p><p>For all data, we computed STAs specifically with the β-γ LFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and their amplitude relative to the STA of all spikes (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref> shows how they change when more spikes are included. Amplitudes for the pause spike case again tended to decrease with more spikes, but they were still much larger than those for regular spikes. Therefore, conservatively speaking, if we choose about 25% of all spikes as pause-initiating or -terminating spikes, based on our criterion, their behavior will be qualitatively similar to the more extreme selections of ~10% in the paper. However, the distinction shows a gradient rather than a clear cut.</p><p>A similar analysis was already included in the original submission for linear encoding of motion kinematics by regular spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We would like to stress that the lack of a clear separation between pause and regular spikes in our data – which is compatible with the multiplexing hypothesis – was one of the motivations to compare the three extreme cases in our analysis. This also addresses Reviewer #3’s comments about the pause criterion: we have tried multiple criteria for pauses, and as long as we can obtain a sufficient sample size in each group, all of them resulted in qualitatively more or less the same results. Therefore, we decided to settle on one of the simplest ones.</p><p>Following the request of Reviewer #3, we made a pre-spike ISI versus post-spike ISI plot (same cell as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) (A) (included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Here, the red, cyan, and black dots represent, pause-initiating, -terminating, and regular spikes, based on our criterion, while the gray dots are the rest of the spikes. Contours represent log<sub>10</sub>(density) and become quickly triangular as we move to the tail part of the ISI distribution (pauses), which is captured by the selected pause spikes. We previously wrote “The minimal pause duration varied with the average firing rate of the cell, but was in general ~20% larger than the ISI corresponding to the mean firing rate.” We see this more explicitly in the ISI histograms, normalized by their peaks (B). Post-spike ISIs of pause-initiating spikes (red solid line) are significantly larger than those corresponding to the mean firing rate (18.4 ms, blue dot and vertical line). Pre-spike ISIs (red dotted line) are the shortest of all, but it is still within the overall spike distribution that peaks around 10-15 ms.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13810.019</object-id><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13810.019">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13810.019</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-13810-resp-fig4-v1"/></fig></p><p><italic>3) LFP phase reliability and Purkinje cell synchrony. How confident can we be that the reliability of the LFP phase is due to synchrony? The reviewers did not feel this point necessarily needed to be resolved by data from cell populations, but instead that any caveats of the interpretation needed to be discussed carefully.</italic></p><p>Unfortunately, we don’t have any data to resolve how much of the LFP signal originates from Purkinje cell synchrony and we do not wish to suggest that Purkinje cell synchrony is a direct cause of the LFP signal. The contribution of other cells, providing inputs to the Purkinje neurons, could also be substantial. Therefore, we instead argue that Purkinje cell pausing reflects this temporary, sharp, circuit-wide activity and that accordingly, synchrony of pause spikes may be a part of it. Previous studies observed similar LFP phenomena in the granular layer (Morisette and Bower, Exp Brain Res, 1996; Roggeri et al., J Neurosci 2008), which seems to arise from dense synchronous activation of granule cells (Diwakar et al., PLOS One 2011). We do not have any means to probe whether our LFP signal was conducted from the granular layer, but even if not, we think it is likely that such a synchronous activation of mossy fibers and granule cells could spread to many cells, including molecular layer interneurons and ultimately Purkinje cells. Strong activation of interneurons will provide feedforward inhibition to Purkinje cells (Mittmann et al., J Physiol, 2004). This inhibition can cause simple-spike pausing (Mittmann and Häusser, J Neurosci, 2007) while significantly contributing to the LFP signal.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have now modified the Discussion to state:</p><p>“We did not attempt to resolve the origin of the time encoding LFP signal due to limitations of the experimental setup. […] If simultaneous activation of local MLIs (and/or their synaptic inputs to the local population of PCs) contributes to the LFP, this would explain our observed correlation of the fast LFP signal and pauses in PCs.”</p><p><italic>4) Writing. The results could be presented in a more accessible manner, which will be particularly important give eLife's broad readership. See reviewer comments for specific suggestions.</italic></p><p>We made all the changes that reviewers suggested. Also, to improve readability of our manuscript extensively, OIST’s technical editor has twice reviewed the manuscript. We have substituted the phrases “pause-initiating” and “pause-terminating” for “pause beginning” and “pause ending.” Because the editor streamlined and simplified the language, we believe that our paper is now as accessible as possible, given the subject’s technical complexity.</p><p><italic>These, and other, issues are detailed below in the comments from the individual reviewers.</italic> </p><p> <italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p> <italic>I am not an expert in Purkinje cell coding, so will leave comments about significance of the findings and relation with other work on the cerebellum to the more expert reviewers. The comments below deal specifically with more general coding issues and overall presentation of the work. My main concerns had to do with the selection of data to analyze, and how that selection influences the results and interpretation of the findings as well as some writing issues.</italic> </p><p> <italic>Data selection.</italic></p><p><italic>I was concerned about several issues about the data included or excluded from analysis. First, in a subset of recordings (subsection “Cerebellar LFP and single PC firing correlate to saccadic eye movements”, second paragraph) spike times and eye velocity exhibited significant correlations. The other recordings were apparently omitted from subsequent analysis. Is that because these are likely cells that do not participate in the control of eye movements? It would be helpful to indicate why that selection of data is justified.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is right about our assumption that cells with non-significant responses do not participate in encoding eye motion. The eye saccade-related area in the cerebellar vermisVIc (oculomotor vermis, OMV) is limited to a tiny subregion of lobuli VIc and VIIA, the OMV proper (Prsa and Thier, Eur J Neurosci, 2011), and the classical studies on which our study builds used activity-based techniques to identify eye motion-related responses, such as 1) identifying saccade-related background activity, 2) saccade-related Purkinje cell discharge, and 3) saccade-triggering microstimulation, to locate this subregion (Ohtsuka and Noda, Neurosci Res, 1992). Our criteria based on significant correlations of eye speed to LFP and Purkinje cell firing are equivalent to 1 and 2.</p><p>We explain this in the updated manuscript:</p><p>“We identified eye saccade-related neurons based on CCF<sub>LFP-EV</sub> and CCF<sub>Spike-EV</sub>, because this is essentially identical to the classical method used to localize eye motion-sensitive cells (Ohtsuka and Noda 1992). Differences in how the LFP and PC spikes relate…”</p><p> <italic>Second, related to above, some selection of recordings was apparently made based on LFP coherence (subsection “Pause spikes and their correlated LFP component encode the timing of eye motion”, second paragraph) – but the details are also unclear.</italic> </p><p>We regret that this part was not clear. We did not sub-select data sets based on the LFP coherence, but showed results for recordings from all 34 cells. Therefore, for example, there is a wide range of variation in LFP phase reliability (=LFP coherence across trials), while a majority of data shows statistical significance compared to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p><italic>Third, the identification of pause spikes and regularly firing spikes omits the majority of the recorded spikes. Given the large differences in properties of the pause and regular spikes, the question of what the other spikes are doing comes up immediately. I think this is a key issue with respect to the multiplexing concept – is there a continuum between the extremes represented by the pause and regular spikes, or is there a more discrete transition? I think of multiplexing as being about a set of discrete signals rather than a continuum. It is important to know how much the results extend to encompass all of the Purkinje cell spikes. This issue comes up in particular with regard to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</italic></p><p>Our original intent in selecting small subsets of spikes was that we wanted to probe differences between extreme cases. We performed extra analyses by including more spikes in the selection, which is described in our response to consensus review 2. To summarize our conclusion, our observations are quite robust to variation. The transition seems quite continuous, just like many other aspects of our data. For example, there is no discrete transition between the regular ISI and longer pauses, but they form a unimodal distribution with a long tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> in the manuscript). The reliability of pause spikes in encoding saccade onset is not distinguishably higher than that of regular spikes in some PCs, but it varies with LFP reliability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We believe that for efficient multiplexing it may be beneficial if a population of PCs differ in the degree to which each behavior is expressed. This should be more advantageous in encoding eye motion since there is a continuous gradient from short and tiny to long and large saccadic eye motion. For effective coding, Purkinje cell pauses should have variable sizes and effects.</p><p><italic>Writing.</italic></p><p><italic>I think the writing can be improved in several places.

Highly synchronized inhibitory inputs are definitely possible, and can be a source of the LFP signal related to pauses.</p><p><italic>In the third paragraph of the subsection “PC firing rate linearly encodes eye motion, mostly by regular spikes”, you describe the pause spikes as exhibiting a high degree of nonlinearity, but it seems to me like that the firing rate is just not very dependent on eye movements. In other words, how do you separate nonlinearity from lack of correlation?</italic></p><p>We used “nonlinearity” to simply describe the lack of a linear relationship between the linear prediction and the actual firing rate. The reason why the firing rate of pause spikes does not look very dependent on eye movements is that we computed motion features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) from all spikes. Pause spikes do correlate with eye motion (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), but very differently from the full spike train for which the correlation to eye motion is dominated by regular spikes, as we argued in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and the related text. Therefore, the firing rate of pause spikes has a weak and nonlinear dependence along the direction of those motion features. To further illustrate this, we plotted a figure (included as an inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplementary 1</xref> in the revision) how similar (measured by the correlation ρ) the CCF<sub>Spike-EV</sub> for pause spikes is to that of the full spike train, as we change thresholds for pause spikes, similarly to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. In contrast to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, the CCF<sub>Spike-EV</sub> of pause spikes is still unmatched to that of all spikes, even when we classify more than 50% of the spikes as pause spikes.</p><p>In the revised text, we clarified this point in Results – PC firing rate linearly encodes eye motion, mostly by regular spikes:</p><p>“On the other hand, pause spikes (both pause-initiating and -terminating spikes) showed high degrees of nonlinearity (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.39 ± 0.25) as their firing rate did not vary as steeply as for regular spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>).

We have added a more detailed account of why the effect of complex spikes is limited in our response to consensus review 1.</p><p><italic>Second, it would be nice to see a more systematic analysis of different frequency bands in the LFP to determine whether it is really just the 15-42 Hz band that couple with the pause spikes.</italic></p><p>Since the STA<sub>LFP</sub> of pause spikes fluctuates transiently, it triggers a high coherence in a wide frequency band, following the time-frequency uncertainty principle. However, the coherence peak was located at higher frequencies (28.2 ± 5.7 Hz, 29.2 ± 4.6 Hz for pause-initiating and -terminating spikes, respectively), which was the most consistent pattern that we observed. In the lower frequency band (&lt; 15Hz), coherence peaks tend to be smaller, by a factor of 0.36 ± 0.66 and 0.16 ± 0.23 for pause-initiating and -terminating spikes, respectively. This made the average coherence less than 0.05 in the lower frequency band, which predicted much weaker phase-locking in this band.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13810.020</object-id><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13810.020">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13810.020</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-13810-resp-fig5-v1"/></fig></p><p>Our measure of spike-LFP phase locking, pairwise phase consistency (PPC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), indeed showed this. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> shows the PPC of each frequency band and type of spikes, normalized by the β-γ case. The PPC sharply dropped as we moved to lower frequency bands such as the low β (12-15 Hz), theta (4-10 Hz), and δ (0-4 Hz), except for a few outliers, in pause-spike cases.

Although this appears to be true, it also appears that there is a nonlinearity in the encoding of eye velocity by the regular spikes, which is compensated by the pause spikes in a way that makes the population as a whole more linear re eye velocity. Is this a reasonable interpretation? If so, it seems worth mentioning.</italic></p><p>It is indeed reasonable since we are testing how the LN model constructed from all spikes can predict the firing rate of each group. Therefore, if the coding by all spikes is really linear, nonlinearity in one group should be compensated by those of other groups. As the reviewer remarks, we show that linearity is indeed slightly smaller for regular spikes, and pause spikes should compensate. The revised text now reads,</p><p>“Nevertheless, pause spikes can make small contributions to rate coding. […] Pause spikes, which by definition represent fast rate changes, should compensate for this. However, overall rate coding is dominated by regular spikes.”</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p> <italic>The manuscript by Hong et al. describes analyses of Purkinje neuron spike trains that shed light on the potential population encoding strategies of this cell population with respect to movement kinematics. They analyze LFPs and simple spikes during saccadic eye movements and find that LFP measurements are more tightly correlated with eye movement onset than single-spike trains, and that long interspike interval – &quot;pauses&quot; – phase-locked with these predictive LFPs. The conclusion from these pause-related data is that pauses encode saccade onsets. On the other hand, overall firing rate is highly correlated with eye velocity, with the &quot;regular&quot; spikes within this population. Pairing these observations, the authors conclude that multiplexed coding occurs with Purkinje firing.</italic> </p><p> <italic>I like the direction taken here and find most of the analyses important. There are some important missing pieces of information, however, that make evaluating the findings challenging and therefore a strong recommendation for accepting or rejecting the manuscript is premature. Of paramount importance is the selection of spikes beginning long pauses: &quot;we selected 15% of largest AI values.[…] then removed 25% of the spikes with the shortest pause ISI.&quot; Since this process operates on ISI ratios, it is unclear what the ISI durations are that are being analyzed as pauses. Moreover, because this analysis relies on ratios and not overall ISI duration, (which would seem a more natural criterion for long ISIs), it is selecting for essentially bursty sequences of short-then-longish spikes. Interpreting the data through this light seems different than interpreting it through the lens of 'pauses' or longest ISIs. While I acknowledge that there may be no perfect solution to identifying pauses, I am not provided enough information to evaluate their claims because I don't know if the pauses they have chosen are unique in any way, or are alternatively unique in ways they do not highlight. In addition to the distribution of 'pause' ISIs vs. all ISIs, a plot of ISI<sub>n</sub> vs. ISI<sub>n+1</sub> would provide non-ratioed data that may help reveal unique characteristics of the 'pause' population.</italic> </p><p>For the plots, please see our response to consensus review 2. The ISI<sub>n</sub> versus ISI<sub>n+1</sub> plot shows that the distribution of (ISI<sub>n</sub>, ISI<sub>n+1</sub>) is stretched along the x- and y-axes, particularly for longer ISIs. In combination with the ISI distribution with pause ISIs vs. all ISIs, this shows that indeed our criterion selects the tail of the distribution. Selected pauses are indeed longer than average ISIs, but they are not all at extreme durations.</p><p>Choosing the longer ISIs following shorter ones, by using ratios, is important to us, since they occurred at saccade onsets in many Purkinje cells. Some Purkinje cells show relatively long periods of very low firing far after saccade onset, and long ISIs there should have a different role than our pauses in encoding eye movements, such as contributing to a rate code. Long pauses that follow short ISI are also likely to release cerebellar nucleus neurons from inhibition, which has been shown to encode motion onsets (e.g., Lee et al., Neuron, 2015).</p><p> <italic>An important assumption to the interpretation of the data advanced by the study is that the LFP correlation with pause onset spikes reflects synchronous firing. Since LFPs reflect synaptic and spiking currents, it may be that correlation detected is simply a readout of the fact that pushing the ISI off of the basal firing rates reflects synaptic input, which is also reflected in the LFP. I am not confident that any data analysis short of multi single-unit array recordings could resolve whether single spikes are temporally aligned at the onset of a pause to the degree necessary for synchrony coding in the nuclei, but I could be persuaded by experts of LFP interpretation.</italic> </p><p>We think it is unlikely that the LFP reflects only synaptic events in recorded cells. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> show that, although the LFP signal more or less stays the same for different saccade angles, the direction of firing modulation can flip completely. Our conclusion is that the LFP signal should reflect a certain network event that involves many neurons (but not necessarily only Purkinje neurons). We provide a more detailed discussion in our response to consensus review 3.</p></body></sub-article></article>
