towards microtubule minus ends. To understand how a single motor achieves cargo specificity, we identified the human dynein interactome by attaching a promiscuous biotin ligase (‘BioID’) to seven components of the dynein machinery, including a subunit of the essential cofactor dynactin. This method reported spatial information about the large cytosolic dynein/dynactin complex in living cells. To achieve maximal motile activity and to bind its cargos, human dynein/dynactin requires ‘activators’, of which only five have been described. We developed methods to identify new activators in our BioID data, and discovered that ninein and ninein-like are a new family of dynein activators. Analysis of the protein interactomes for six activators, including ninein and ninein-like, suggests that each dynein activator has multiple cargos.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

are the primary means of long-distance intracellular transport in humans and many other eukaryotic organisms. Mutations in the transport machinery cause both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lipka et al., 2013</xref>). Microtubules are polar structures, with dynamic ‘plus’ ends typically found near the cell periphery and ‘minus’ ends anchored in internal microtubule organizing centers. Dynein motors move towards the microtubule minus end, whereas most kinesins move in the opposite direction. The human genome contains 15 motor domain-encoding dynein genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vale, 2003</xref>), but only cytoplasmic dynein-1 (DYNC1H1; ‘dynein’ hereafter) is involved in long-distance, minus-end-directed transport in the cytoplasm. Dynein transports dozens of distinct cargos including organelles, ribonucleoprotein complexes, proteins and viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kardon and Vale, 2009</xref>). A major outstanding question in the field is to understand how dynein achieves temporal and spatial specificity for cargo interactions.</p><p>Most cytoskeletal motors that transport cargos over long distances in cells are processive motors, capable of taking multiple steps along their track. While dimers of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> dynein heavy chain move processively in the absence of cofactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>), mammalian dynein requires the 1.1 MDa dynactin complex and a coiled coil-containing activator (‘activator’ hereafter) for robust processive motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Trokter et al., 2012</xref>).

The activators BICD2 and HOOK3 have been definitively shown, using purified components, to activate dynein/dynactin motility in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schroeder and Vale, 2016</xref>). HOOK1, Spindly (SPDL1), and RAB11FIP3 are also likely activators based on their ability to co-purify and co-migrate with dynein/dynactin in in vitro motility assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Olenick et al., 2016</xref>). Other proteins may be activators based on their homology to BICD and HOOK family activators, including BICD1, BICDL1, BICDL2, and HOOK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoogenraad and Akhmanova, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Simpson et al., 2005</xref>). Known and predicted activators all contain long stretches of predicted coiled coil, but share very little sequence homology across activator families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gama et al., 2017</xref>); currently it is not possible to identify activators based on sequence alone. Central to understanding how dynein performs so many tasks is to determine if it has additional activators.</p><p>Here we used new proteomics tools to address major unanswered questions about dynein-based transport. What is the dynein protein interactome? How many activators does dynein have in a given cell type? Which cargos do activators link to? Does each cargo have its own activator? To answer these questions, we used proximity-dependent labeling in living human cells. Traditionally, protein-protein interaction discovery using immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry has been confined to relatively stable interactions. However, recently developed methods such as BioID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roux et al., 2012</xref>) and APEX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rhee et al., 2013</xref>) allow the discovery of weak and short-lived interactions in living cells, in addition to more stable interactions. The BioID method relies on expressing a protein of interest fused to a promiscuous biotin ligase that releases activated biotin-AMP in the absence of substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roux et al., 2012</xref>). Biotin-AMP covalently modifies the primary amines of proximal proteins within a nanometer-scale labeling radius (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). Biotinlyated proximal proteins are identified by isolation with streptavidin followed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). For example, this approach has been used to map protein interactions at human centrosomes and cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>), focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong et al., 2016</xref>) and the nuclear pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Using these methods we describe the human dynein/dynactin interactome. We also developed methods to identify dynein activators within these datasets and identified two new activators that constitute a novel activator family. Finally, to determine the candidate cargos of six distinct activators we elucidated their individual interactomes. Our results suggest that each dynein activator has multiple cargos. We propose that activators provide the first layer of defining cargo specificity for cytoplasmic dynein, but that refinement of cargo selection will require additional factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of the dynein/dynactin interactome</title><p>To identify the human dynein/dynactin interactome, we began by biochemically characterizing dynein and dynactin subunits fused to BioID that were stably expressed in HEK-293 cells. The 1.4 MDa dynein holoenzyme is composed of dimers of heavy chains (HC; DYNC1H1), intermediate chains (IC1 or IC2; DYNC1I1 and 2), light intermediate chains (LIC1 or LIC2; DYNC1LI1 and 2), and three types of light chains: Roadblock (RB; DYNLRB1 and 2), LC8 (DYNLL1 and 2), and TCTEX (DYNLT1 and 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We first generated a cell line stably expressing IC2 with C-terminal BioID G2 (‘BioID’ here) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2016b</xref>) and 3×FLAG tags. Immunoprecipitations confirmed that IC2-BioID was incorporated into the dynein/dynactin complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B—E</xref>). Gel filtration analysis of IC2 immunoprecipitates revealed that 51% of the BioID-tagged IC2 was incorporated into the dynein complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We obtained similar results when BioID was fused to the C-terminus of the p62 dynactin subunit. The stably expressed p62-BioID-3×FLAG subunit incorporated into the dynactin complex as shown by immunoprecipitations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), and gel filtration analysis of these immunoprecipitatates revealed that 47% was incorporated into the high molecular weight dynactin complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>To perform BioID experiments, we lysed cells in the presence of additional detergents (see Materials and methods), which disrupt both the dynein and dynactin complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and F</xref>). Disruption of the complexes makes it likely that our BioID experiments identified only proximal proteins that were modified with biotin prior to cell lysis. All BioID experiments with tagged dynein or dynactin subunits were performed in quadruplicate using a label-free quantitative proteomics approach to calculate the enrichment of each identified protein relative to a soluble BioID alone control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). ‘Hits’ were proteins with greater than 3-fold enrichment and p-values greater than 0.05 relative to the control. We first characterized the IC2 subunit of dynein, which is known to be centrally located within the tripartite dynein/dynactin/activator complex based on cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structural studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chowdhury et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Urnavicius et al., 2015</xref>).

In addition, the dataset contained the known activators BICD2, HOOK1, and HOOK3, as well as BICD1, a homolog of BICD2 that is a likely activator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">2</xref>). The only known dynein activators that we did not identify were Spindly and RAB11FIP3. Spindly regulates mitotic-specific dynein functions in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gassmann et al., 2010</xref>), likely the reason we did not identify it in an unsynchronized cell population.

dynein and dynactin subunits with BioID. Specifically, we generated five additional HEK-293 cell lines stably expressing BioID fused to the IC1, LIC1, LIC2, RB1, and TCTEX1 dynein subunits and analyzed these along with the tagged dynein IC2 and dynactin p62 subunits. Each BioID fusion protein incorporated into their respective complexes based on their ability to co-immunoprecipitate with dynein and dynactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Validating our approach, a protein-protein interaction network consisting of the hits shared between BioID-tagged subunits revealed that 13 of 20 hits present in three or more datasets were dynein/dynactin subunits and activators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Further validation of our approach came from the presence of T-complex and prefoldin subunits as IC-specific hits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), as prefoldin is a T-complex co-chaperone, and T-complex has been shown to interact with newly synthesized ICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Özdemir et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vainberg et al., 1998</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28257.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>BioID reports on the spatial organization of the dynein/dynactin/activator complex.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Dynein (IC1, IC2, LIC1, LIC2, RB1, TCTEX1) and dynactin (p62) subunits tagged with BioID-3×FLAG were immunoprecipitated (for 16 hr in A or 2 hr in B) from stable HEK-293 cell lines using α-FLAG antibodies.

IC1 and IC2 BioID samples detected more dynactin subunits than either LIC1 or 2, consistent with the dynein LIC being further away from dynactin compared to the IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). With respect to activators, we found that the IC1, LIC1 and LIC2 dynein subunits and the p62 dynactin subunit identified dynein activators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">3</xref>).

Thus, BioID provides spatial information about the large dynein complex, which is capable of moving in the cytoplasm. Importantly, these results also show that BioID experiments with the dynein IC and LIC subunits and dynactin p62 subunit can be used to identify activators, providing a method to discover dynein activators in other cell types or tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Ninein and ninein-like constitute a new family of dynein activators</title><p>To identify novel dynein activators in the dynein/dynactin interactome, we performed a secondary screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Because all known activators contain long stretches of coiled coil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), we pooled datasets with known activators present (IC1, IC2, LIC1, LIC2, and p62) and selected a set of proteins with predicted coiled coils of at least 100 amino acids. We then expressed each predicted coiled coil domain tagged with GFP and 3×FLAG in HEK-293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). A hallmark of known activators is their ability to co-immunoprecipitate dynein and dynactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Olenick et al., 2016</xref>).

We immunoprecipitated GFP-tagged BICD2 (aa 1–422), HOOK3 (aa 1–552), NIN (aa 1–693), NINL (aa 1–702), daple (aa 1–545) and girdin (aa 1–542) from HEK-293 cells and observed the motility of any co-purifying dynein and dynactin on microtubules using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. Our positive controls, BICD2 and HOOK3, exhibited robust processive motility, as did NIN and NINL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–H</xref>). In contrast, daple and girdin showed only a very modest ability to isolate activated dynein/dynactin complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>). Because reconstituted purified dynein and dynactin occasionally show processive runs in the absence of an activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>), we cannot yet conclude if daple and girdin are bona fide dynein activators.</p><p>The gold standard assay for dynein activators is to reconstitute dynein/dynactin/activator motility from purified components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>). To this end, we purified dynein and dynactin individually from HEK-293 cell lines stably expressing either IC2 or p62 tagged with SNAP or Halo tags (for fluorophore labeling) and 3×FLAG (for purification) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

After reconstituting the complexes, we used near-simultaneous three-color TIRF microscopy to visualize the motility of single dynein/dynactin/activator complexes on microtubules. As expected, BICD2 activated and co-migrated with processively moving dynein and dynactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Both NIN and NINL also activated and co-migrated with moving dynein/dynactin complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>).

This is especially critical for dynein, which moves all microtubule minus-end-directed cargos in the cytoplasm. How many cargos does each activator recognize? Does each activator allow dynein/dynactin to recognize a specific subset of cargo, or is there overlap in the number of activators that can recognize any given cargo? To begin to address these questions, and to provide a starting point for future exploration of activator-cargo interactions, we used BioID to identify the interactomes of six dynein activators. We made both N- and C-terminal BioID fusions with each activator because, for the known activators BICD2 and HOOK3, their N-termini interact with dynein/dynactin and their C-termini bind to cargos or cargo adaptor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cianfrocco et al., 2015</xref>). We generated HEK-293 cell lines stably expressing full-length BICD1, BICD2, HOOK1, HOOK3, NIN, and NINL with BioID tags at either their N- or C-termini, and used MS/MS to detect activator proximal proteins that had been biotinylated in living cells from each cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">4</xref>). As with our earlier experiments, we used detergent conditions (see Materials and methods) that made it likely we only identified proteins that were directly biotinylated and considered hits to be proteins with greater than 3-fold enrichment, p-values greater than 0.05 relative to a soluble BioID control, and average spectral counts greater than two.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28257.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Dynein activators have distinct proteomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Location of predicted coiled coils in dynein activators, with minimal activating regions shown (orange rectangles).

Given this, and the likely elongated nature of other activators, we reasoned that BioID would be ideally suited to report on the spatially separated functional differences between the N- and C-termini of activators. We analyzed the N- and C-terminal BioID datasets from all six activators. We first contrasted the N- and C-terminal datasets separately, in both cases seeking to reveal activator-specific interactions and those shared between multiple activators. The shared interactions were used to construct interaction networks revealing the connections between activators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Overall, in comparison to N-terminal datasets, the C-terminal datasets had more unique hits (except for NIN), more hits shared between activators, and more total hits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>We next identified proteins that were found in all activator families (BICD1/2, HOOK1/3, and NIN/NINL). When we performed this analysis for the N-terminal datasets only four out of 225 proteins were present in at least one dataset from each activator family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, white circles). Strikingly, three of these four proteins were dynein subunits (HC, LIC1, and LIC2), highlighting that the shared function associated with the N-termini of activators is their interaction with dynein. When we performed this analysis with the C-terminal datasets we found 21 out of 547 proteins were present in each activator family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gene Ontology Consortium, 2015</xref>) of these 21 proteins revealed an association with cellular locations that correlate with microtubule minus ends (‘ciliary basal body’, ‘microtubule organizing center’, and ‘centrosome’) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Other GO terms that were enriched included ‘F-actin capping complex’, ‘intraciliary transport particle B’, and ‘ciliary tip’. In contrast to the N-terminal dataset we did not detect any dynein subunits in the C-terminal dataset. Overall, this data highlights the power of the BioID technique to report on the distinct protein interactions of different regions of the dynein activators.</p><p>We next contrasted all 12 activator datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">4</xref>). This analysis allowed for the removal of hits shared between the N- and C-termini of activators and focus on C-terminal-specific activator hits, as this is the region of cargo interaction for characterized activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cianfrocco et al., 2015</xref>). Each activator had dozens of C-terminal specific hits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">4</xref>). These proteins are candidates for activator-specific cargos, cargo adaptors, or proteins that regulate how dynein connects to its cargo. GO term enrichment analysis of these activator-specific hits revealed several trends. The BICD2 C-terminal interactome was enriched for GO terms relating to cortical actin cytoskeleton structures, including adherens junctions and focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 5</xref>), consistent with previous studies that have linked dynein to these cortical actin-based structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ligon et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rosse et al., 2012</xref>). The HOOK3 C-terminal interactome was enriched for GO terms relating to clathrin coated vesicles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Both the NIN and NINL C-terminal interactomes were enriched for GO terms generally related to structures found at microtubule minus ends (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 5</xref>).</p><p>We also analyzed the shared interactions of activators within the same family (e.g. BICD1/2, HOOK1/3 and NIN/NINL). Activators within families share significant sequence similarity (global identity, global similarity: BICD1/BICD2 = 53.6%, 65.2%; HOOK1/HOOK3 = 57.0%, 73.2%; NIN/NINL = 21.1%, 33.9%). Reflecting this protein conservation, activators from the same protein family had more C-terminal-specific overlap than activators from different families (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The BICD activator family was enriched for GO terms associated with the actin cytoskeleton. The HOOK family was enriched for GO terms related to kinesin motors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 5</xref>); we identified C-terminal-specific interactions of HOOK1 and HOOK3 with the kinesins KIF1C and KIF5B, as well as the KIF5B associated light chains, KLC2 and KLC4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>).

HOOK1 and HOOK3 are members of the FHF complex, which is involved in endosomal sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). We identified proteins in this complex (AKTIP/FTS and FAM160A2/FHIP), as well as two proteins that are homologous to FAM160A2 (FAM160A1, FAM160B1) as specifically enriched in the HOOK1 and HOOK3 datasets. FAM160A1 and FAM160A2 share sequence identity (global identity 36.4%, global similarity 50.5%), and FAM160A2 was reported to interact with HOOK3 and AKTIP/FTS in a recent high-throughput proteomics study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huttlin et al., 2015</xref>). We also identified RIMBP3, a known HOOK1 interacting protein involved in spermatogenesis, as a HOOK1 C-terminal-specific hit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). In the BICD2 interactome, we identified RANBP2, a well-characterized BICD2-interacting protein that is responsible for targeting dynein/dynactin/BICD2 to nuclear pore complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Splinter et al., 2010</xref>). The NINL C-terminal interactome was specifically enriched for MICAL3, a protein that interacts with Rab8 and is localized to the base of primary cilia in a NINL-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachmann-Gagescu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We were intrigued by the presence of kinesin, including the kinesin-3 KIF1C, in the HOOK datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Although Hook proteins are not known to interact with kinesins in humans, studies in filamentous fungi have linked dynein, Hook, and kinesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bielska et al., 2014</xref>). We used co-immunoprecipitation experiments to verify the interaction of HOOK3 with the dynein heavy chain, FAM160A2/FHIP, and KIF1C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Our BioID data had identified the interaction of HOOK3 with KIF1C and FAM160A2/FHIP as C-terminal-specific and the interaction with dynein/dynactin as N-terminal-specific. In agreement with our BioID data, immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the interaction of KIF1C and FAM160A2/FHIP with HOOK3 was specific to the C-terminus of HOOK3 (553–718) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), while dynein’s interaction was specific to the N-terminus of HOOK3 (aa 1–552) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>). This data further validates the BioID approach and highlights how BioID can identify spatially restricted interactions. In addition, this data suggests that HOOK3 may represent a new class of dynein activator, one that not only activates dynein/dynactin, but can also recruit the opposite polarity motor KIF1C.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We applied proximity-dependent biotinylation to identify the dynein/dynactin and activator interactomes. Our data show that BioID reports on the spatial organization of both the tripartite dynein/dynactin/activator complex, as well as the domain organization of dynein activators. Using a secondary screen of our dynein/dynactin BioID data, we developed an approach to identify novel dynein activators. We identified ninein and ninein-like as a new family of dynein activators and two Hook-related proteins, girdin and daple, as candidate dynein/dynactin activators. Our analysis of the activator interactomes suggests that there are dozens of unique interactions for each activator, as well as shared interactions particularly among activators of the same family. We propose that these proteins represent novel dynein cargos, cargo adaptors or regulators of motor-cargo interactions and that each activator will link dynein to multiple cargos.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>BioID provides spatial information about the large cytosolic dynein transport machinery</title><p>We tagged seven distinct dynein or dynactin subunits with the BioID tag. Our analysis of their interactomes suggests that BioID can provide spatial information about the large dynein machinery, capable of moving in the live cells we used for our experiments. The recent cryo-EM structures of the dynein/dynactin/activator complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chowdhury et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Urnavicius et al., 2015</xref>) allowed us to roughly map the interactions we identified. The interactomes of each dynein or dynactin subunit identified other dynein and dynactin subunits that were located in close proximity based on these structural studies. Important for future discovery efforts, we found that proteins that were in the vicinity of the activator (the dynein ICs and LICs and the p62 subunit of dynactin) had interactomes containing activators. Thus, tagging these proteins with proximity-dependent biotinylation tags will allow future efforts to identify dynein activators in other cell types and tissues.</p><p>We also found that each activator, all of which contain long stretches of predicted coiled coil and likely have elongated structures, had largely non-overlapping protein interactions depending on whether their N- or C-terminus was tagged with BioID. Our data agrees with published data showing that the N-termini of activators interact with dynein/dynactin and that the C-termini with cargos or cargo adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cianfrocco et al., 2015</xref>). We also identified a novel interaction between the dynein activator HOOK3 and the kinesin-3 KIF1C. Both our BioID data and confirmatory immunoprecipitation experiments showed that dynein interacts with the N-terminus of HOOK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>), while kinesin interacts with its C-terminus. This further highlights the ability of BioID to provide spatial information about protein-protein interactions and also raises the exciting possibility that HOOK3 is a scaffold for plus- and minus-end-directed microtubule-based motors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>BioID identifies ninein and ninein-like as members of a new family of dynein/dynactin activators</title><p>Our secondary screen of predicted coiled coil-containing proteins found in the dynein/dynactin interactome identified four proteins that could co-immunoprecipitate with dynein and dynactin: NIN, NINL, girdin and daple. Further analysis of these proteins demonstrated that NIN and NINL activated dynein/dynactin motility in single-molecule motility assays, while girdin and daple did not. Here, we focused on determining if predicted coiled coil-containing proteins could activate dynein/dynactin motility. Future analysis of the hits found in the dynein/dynactin interactome could identify additional positive or negative regulators of dynein motor activity. It is possible that there will be dynein activators lacking large stretches of coiled coil, which were not assessed in our secondary screen.</p><p>Both NIN and NINL localize to the centrosome, are involved in microtubule nucleation, and have been shown previously to immunoprecipitate with dynein/dynactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Casenghi et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delgehyr et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). The ability of NIN and NINL to activate dynein suggests that they control their own, as well as any associated proteins, recruitment to the centrosome or other sites of microtubule nucleation. NINL has also been implicated in dynein-based vesicle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dona et al., 2015</xref>), in support of the idea that each activator has multiple cargos (see below).</p><p>Girdin and daple are Hook-related proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Simpson et al., 2005</xref>), which also act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors for small G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aznar et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2015</xref>). While both robustly co-immunoprecipitated dynein and dynactin, they did not conclusively activate dynein/dynactin motility. We used girdin and daple constructs that were identical in length to a HOOK3 construct that could activate motility. However, it is possible that longer girdin or daple constructs will be required for activation or that post-translational modifications regulate their ability to activate dynein/dynactin motility. For example, both daple and girdin are phosphoproteins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huttlin et al., 2015</xref>). It is also possible that girdin and daple regulate dynein by blocking the ability of motility-inducing activators to bind to dynein. CCDC88B/gipie is related to girdin and daple and interacts with dynein and dynactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ham et al., 2015</xref>). We did not identify gipie in our screen, likely because it is not expressed in HEK-293T cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huttlin et al., 2015</xref>). Future studies of these Hook-related proteins will be aimed at exploring if and how they regulate dynein/dynactin activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Activators have many new candidate cargos</title><p>Our findings suggest that the number of dynein activators is much smaller than the number of dynein cargos, strongly implying that each activator links dynein to multiple cargos. There are hints of this concept in the literature as BICD2 interacts with both Rab6 and RanBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoogenraad and Akhmanova, 2016</xref>), and in <italic>Drosophila</italic> the RNA binding protein egalitarian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dienstbier et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with this, our GO analysis of the interactomes of six distinct dynein activators suggests that each of these activators is involved in multiple dynein-based functions. Overall, our data imply a tiered mode of dynein regulation in which activators, such as members of the BICD, HOOK and NIN families constitute the first step in cargo recognition, but additional layers must be required to achieve cargo specificity.</p><p>Our data raise a number of interesting questions for future exploration. How are activators released from dynein/dynactin? Which factors mediate this? Given that the dynein/dynactin machinery may be relatively invariant compared to activators, are activators exchanged? And, if so which factors mediate this? Are there proteins that bind to the same region of dynein/dynactin as activators, but don’t activate motility? Finally, are activators promiscuous and if so what is the balance of stochastic versus regulated motor-cargo interactions? Our dynein transport machinery interactome provides a rich dataset to address these fundamental questions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular cloning and generation of stable cell lines</title><p>All plasmids used in this study were constructed by PCR and Gibson isothermal assembly.

LIC2 (isoform 1, 492 aa) and HOOK1 (isoform 1, 728 aa) were obtained from the Harvard Medical School PlasmID Repository, BICD2 (isoform 1, 824 aa) from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA), BICD1 (isoform 1, 975 aa) from Genescript (Piscataway, NJ), HOOK3 from GE Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO), and NIN was the kind gift of Dr. Yi-Ren Hong (Department of Biochemistry, Kaohsiung Medical University, Taiwan). NINL (isoform 1, 1382 aa) was synthesized in segments (IDT; Coralville, IA) and assembled by Gibson isothermal assembly. For constitutive expression, ORFs were inserted into pcDNA5/FRT (Invitrogen). IC1, IC2, LIC1, LIC2, and p62 were constructed as C-terminal fusions with BioID (e.g. pcDNA5-FRT-IC1-5×GA-BioID-3×FLAG); Roadblock1 and TCTEX1 were constructed as N-terminal fusions (e.g. pcDNA5-FRT-BioID-5×GA-Roadblock1-3×FLAG); and activators (BICD1, BICD2, HOOK1, HOOK3) were constructed as both N- and C-terminal fusions.

After 24 hr, biotin was added to the media to a final concentration of 50 µM, and the cells were incubated for an additional 16 hr. Tetracycline was added to tetracycline-inducible stable cell lines (1 µg/mL final concentration) at the same time as biotin. After decanting the media, cells were dislodged from each plate by pipetting with ice-cold PBS. Cells were centrifuged at 1000 x g for 2 min and the PBS was decanted. Cells were washed once more with ice cold PBS before proceeding to cell lysis. Cells were resuspended and lysed in 10 mL RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 150 mM NaCl, 1% (v/v) NP-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1 mM DTT, and protease inhibitors (cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Roche; Switzerland) by gentle rocking for 5–10 min at 4°C. The cell lysate was clarified via centrifugation at 66,000 x g for 30 min in a Type 70 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter; Brea, CA) at 4°C. The clarified lysate was retrieved and dialyzed twice against dialysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100) for 2 hr per exchange. The dialysate was retrieved, supplemented with fresh protease inhibitors, and combined with 1 mL streptavidin-conjugated beads (Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated overnight at 4°C with gentle rocking. Bead/lysate mixtures were collected on a magnetic stand into a single 2 mL round-bottom microcentrifuge tube. The beads were then washed 4 times with 2 mL RIPA buffer, with immobilization and solution removal performed on a magnetic stand. To elute bound immobilized proteins, the beads were boiled for 10 min at 100°C in 100 µL elution buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS (w/v), 20 mM DTT, 12.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM biotin). Typically, 10 µL was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Sypro Red staining and the remaining eluate (90 µL) was diluted to a final volume of 400 µL with 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. 100% trichloroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 20% and the solution was incubated overnight at 4°C. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed, the pellet was washed with 500 µL ice cold 100% acetone, and was centrifuged at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4°C. The acetone was removed, and the wash was repeated.

The loaded microcapillary columns were then connected to a 100 µm fused-silica column pulled to a 5 μm tip using a P 2000 CO2 laser puller (Sutter Instruments) packed with 8 cm of 5 μm C18 reverse phase particles.

Overflow tubing was used to decrease the flow rate from 0.1 mL/min to about 200–300 nL/min. During the course of fully automated chromatography, ten 120 min cycles of increasing salt concentrations followed by organic gradients slowly released peptides directly into the mass spectrometer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Florens and Washburn, 2006</xref>). Three different elution buffers were used: 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid (Buffer A); 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid (Buffer B); and 0.5 M ammonium acetate, 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid (Buffer C). The last two chromatography steps consisted in a high salt wash with 100% Buffer C followed by the acetonitrile gradient. The application of a 2.5 kV distal voltage electrosprayed the eluting peptides directly into LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometers equipped with a nano-LC electrospray ionization source (ThermoFinnigan). For LTQ MS runs, each full MS scan (from 400 to 1600 m/z) was followed by five MS/MS events using data-dependent acquisition where the first most intense ion was isolated and fragmented by collision-induced dissociation (at 35% collision energy), followed by the 2nd to 5th most intense ions. For Orbitrap Elite MS runs, full MS spectra were recorded on the peptides over a 400 to 1600 m/z range, followed by 10 tandem mass (MS/MS) events sequentially generated in a data-dependent manner on the first to tenth most intense ions selected from the full MS spectrum (at 35% collision energy).

Beads were collected by centrifugation at 1000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 2 min and washed four times with ‘mild’ detergent lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted with 250 µL lysis buffer containing 0.4 mg/mL 3×FLAG peptide at 4°C for 30 min. Eluates were precipitated with TCA as described above. MS/MS analysis was performed as described above.</p><p>We used FLAG-immunoprecipitation combined with FPLC to determine the percent incorporation of BioID-tagged subunits into their respective complexes. Cells expressing either IC2-BioID-3×FLAG or p62-BioID-3×FLAG were collected from 8 × 15 cm plates as described above. Cells were lysed in 10 mL GF buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM ATP, 1X protease inhibitor cocktail) and centrifuged as described. The lysate was added to 200 µL packed Anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma-Aldrich) for 16 hr at 4°C with gentle mixing. After washing in batch twice with 50 mL GF buffer, elutions were performed with 250 µL of lysis buffer with 0.5 mg/mL 3×FLAG peptide at 4°C for 30 min. A Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL was equilibrated in GF buffer containing 5% glycerol. Molecular weight standards were analyzed first and consisted of a mixture of thyroglobulin (669 kDa), beta-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), albumin (66 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa). 200 µL of each BioID fusion protein eluate were then run separately, and 1 mL fractions were collected for each. Selected fractions were mixed with 10 µL packed Anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated with mixing at 4°C for 2 hr. This mixture was then centrifuged briefly, the supernatant was removed, and the resin was boiled in 2X SDS sample buffer. Released proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG, anti-dynein heavy chain, and anti-p150 dynactin antibodies (see “Western analysis and antibodies, below, for details). Image intensities of bands were quantified using FIJI. Peak anti-FLAG Western band signal intensities of the low molecular weight (= free) and high molecular weight (= incorporated) IC2- and p62-containing species were used to calculate the percent incorporation of IC2 and p62 into the dynein and dynactin complexes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and G</xref>). The percent incorporation was calculated as intensity<sub>incorporated</sub>/(intensity<sub>free</sub>+ intensity<sub>incorporated</sub>). To construct the graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> the intensity of each fraction was divided by the sum of the intensities for all fractions and plotted against the elution volume.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Western analysis and antibodies</title><p>Lysates and eluates were run on 4–12% polyacrylamide gels (NuPage, Invitrogen/ Thermo Fisher Scientific) and transferred to PVDF (Immobilon-P, EMD Millipore; Billerica, MA) for 1.5 hr at 300 mA constant current. Blots were blocked for 10 min with TBST +5% dry milk (w/v), and immunoblotted with appropriate antibodies. All antibodies were diluted in TBST +5% milk (w/v). Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C, while secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. Antibodies used were anti-FLAG conjugated HRP (A8592, Sigma-Aldrich, 1:5000 dilution), rabbit anti-dynein heavy chain (R325, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, 1:500-1:1000 dilution), mouse anti-p150 dynactin (610474, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, 1:500-1:1000 dilution), rabbit anti-BICD2 (ab117818, Abcam; Cambridge, MA, 1:5000 dilution), rabbit anti-FAM160A2 (ab184160, Abcam, 1:1000), rabbit anti-KIF1C (NB100-57510, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, 1:1000), goat anti-rabbit HRP (sc-2030, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:5000 dilution) and goat anti-mouse HRP (sc-2031, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:5000 dilution). Westerns were visualized with Supersignal West Pico or Femto Chemiluminescent reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a VersaDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad Laboratories; Hercules, CA). Image intensity histograms were adjusted and images were converted to 8-bit with FIJI before being imported into Adobe Illustrator to make figures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Secondary screen and hit validation</title><p>For the secondary screen described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, we pooled BioID datasets from the core dynein/dynactin subunits where at least one known activator (BICD1, BICD2, HOOK1, or HOOK3) was enriched. Proteins were selected for coiled coil analysis if they had a dNSAF<sub>ORF-BioID</sub>:dNSAF<sub>BioID</sub> ratio greater than 3, were present in 3 of 4 replicates, and contained a predicted coiled coil of at least 100 aa. Predicted coiled coil sequences were extracted from UniProt; those from nuclear proteins, dynein/dynactin subunits, and a single protein that was entirely coiled coil (GOLGA4), were discarded. Each coiled coil was then codon optimized for synthesis and expression in mammalian cells, synthesized (IDT), and cloned by isothermal assembly into pcDNA5/FRT/TO as fusions with super folder (sf) GFP (e.g. pcDNA5/FRT/TO-sfGFP-CC<sub>x</sub>-3×FLAG). A negative control was used consisting of sfGFP-3×FLAG alone, and two known activator coiled coil constructs were used as positive controls (sfGFP-BICD2 [1-422]−3×FLAG, sfGFP-HOOK3 [1-552]−3×FLAG). Transient transfections, ‘mild’ detergent immunoprecipitations and Western blot analysis were performed as described above.</p><p>The length of expression constructs for the positive hits (NINL, daple and girdin), and NIN, a protein closely related to NINL were further optimized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). Although our initial girdin construct (sfGFP-girdin [1-425]−3×FLAG) immunoprecipitated dynein/dynactin, it was expressed as a truncated protein (open triangle, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Informed by a recent study of Hook proteins (both daple and girdin contain a Hook domain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schroeder and Vale, 2016</xref>), we made longer girdin and daple constructs (1–542 and 1–545, respectively). Since girdin was truncated, yet still produced a FLAG positive Western signal, we reasoned that GFP was proteolytically cleaved from the construct in cells. To circumvent this, we moved the sfGFP module to the C-terminus of girdin (girdin [1-542]-sfGFP-3×FLAG). This construct was not proteolyzed, as was the case with a longer version of daple (sfGFP-daple [1-545]−3×FLAG); both constructs immunoprecipitated dynein/dynactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In our secondary screen NINL (373-702) immunoprecipitated dynein/dynactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), while a construct from the closely related protein, NIN (353-580), did not. Based upon a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Casenghi et al., 2005</xref>), we generated longer versions of NIN (1-693) and NINL (1-702); both immunoprecipitated dynein/dynactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>sfGFP-tagged HOOK3 constructs were used to map the interaction between HOOK3 and KIF1C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Full length HOOK3 (1–718) was moved from pcDNA5/FRT/TO-HOOK3-BioID-3×FLAG to pcDNA5/FRT/TO-sfGFP-3×FLAG by PCR and isothermal assembly. pcDNA5/FRT/TO-HOOK3 [1-552]−3×FLAG is described above. pcDNA5/FRT/TO-sfGFP-HOOK3 [553-718] was generated by PCR and ligation using pcDNA5/FRT/TO-sfGFP-HOOK3 [1-718]−3×FLAG as a template.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Protein purification</title><p>Dynein and dynactin were purified from stable HEK293 cell lines expressing IC2-SNAPf-3xFLAG or p62-HALO-3xFLAG, respectively. Cell lines were constructed using the FLP/FRT system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as outlined above. Between 60–100 80% confluent, 15 cm plates were harvested per purification. Cells were collected by pipetting with ice-cold PBS and centrifuged at 1000 x g for 2 min to pellet. Cells were washed once more with ice-cold PBS. Cell pellets were either snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen in 50 mL conical tubes or immediately lysed for protein purification. To lyse, cell pellets were resuspended in dynein lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 50 mM KOAc, 2 mM MgOAc, 1 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol (v/v), and 1 mM DTT) supplemented with 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM Mg-ATP, and 1X protease inhibitors (cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Roche). To ensure complete lysis, resuspended cells were slowly rotated lengthwise at 4°C for 15 min. The lysate was clarified via centrifugation at 66,000 x g for 30 min in a Type 70 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter) at 4°C. The clarified supernatant was mixed with 0.75–1 mL of Anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4°C. During incubation, the slurry was rotated about its long axis in a full 50 mL Falcon tube. Beads were collected by gravity flow and washed with 50 mL wash buffer (dynein lysis buffer with 0.02% Triton X-100 and 0.5 mM Mg-ATP) supplemented with protease inhibitors (cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Roche). Beads were then washed with 50 mL high salt wash buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 300 mM KOAc, 2 mM MgOAc, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 0.02% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM Mg-ATP, and 1X protease inhibitor (cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Roche) and then with 100 mL wash buffer.</p><p>To label with a fluorophore the beads were resuspended in 1 mL wash buffer and incubated with either 5 μM SNAP-Cell TMR Star (New England BioLabs; Ipswich, MA) (to label IC2) or 5 μM Halo-Atto647N (Promega) (to label p62) for 10 min at room temperature. Unreacted dye was removed from beads with 50–80 mL of wash buffer. Protein complexes were eluted with 0.5–1 mL of elution buffer (wash buffer with 2 mg/mL 3xFLAG peptide). Elution was collected, diluted to 2 mL in Buffer A (50 mM Tris pH 8, 2 mM MgOAc, 1 mM EGTA, and 1 mM DTT) and injected onto a MonoQ 5/50 GL column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) at 0.5 mL/min. The column was washed with 20 CV of Buffer A at 1 mL/min. To elute, a linear gradient was run over 40 CV into Buffer B (50 mM Tris pH 8, 2 mM MgOAc, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 M KOAc). Pure dynein complex elutes from ~60–70% Buffer B, while pure dynactin complex elutes around ~70–80% Buffer B. Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated, Mg-ATP was added to 0.1 mM and glycerol was added to 10%. Samples were then snap frozen in 2 µL aliquots.</p><p>Activators and potential activators were cloned into pET-28a vectors with an N-terminal StrepII-sfGFP tag. Mouse BICD2 (mBICD2) (aa 25–400) was a gift from Rick McKenney (University of California, Davis), while NIN (aa 1–693) and NINL (aa 1–702) were sub-cloned from ORFs outlined above. All constructs were transformed into BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL cells (Agilent Technologies; Santa Clara, CA). 2 L of cells were grown at 37°C in LB media to a 600 nm optical density of 0.4–0.8 before the temperature was reduced to 18°C and expression was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG. After 16–18 hr, cells were harvested via centrifugation for 6 min at 4°C at 6000 rpm in a JLA 8.1000 fixed angle rotor (Beckman Coulter). Pellets were resuspended in 30–40 mL of dynein lysis buffer with 0.5 mM PefaBloc SC (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mg/mL lysozyme and incubated at 4°C for 30 min. Cells were lysed via sonication (Branson Digital Sonifier, Emerson; Saint Louis, MA) and clarified via centrifugation at 66,000 x g for 30 min in a Type 70 Ti rotor (Beckman) at 4°C. Supernatant was loaded onto a 5 mL StrepTrap column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and washed with 50–100 mL of lysis buffer. Activators were then eluted with 25–50 mL of elution buffer (dynein lysis buffer with 3 mM d-Desthiobiotin). Finally, all activators were purified via size exclusion chromatography on either a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL or a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) that had been equilibrated with degassed dynein lysis buffer. Peak fractions were collected and used for single molecule motility experiments immediately or snap-frozen in 2–20 µL aliquots. Care was taken not to concentrate the activators as we observed that this led to aggregation and inactivity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Single-molecule motility assays and data analysis</title><p>Two types of single-molecule motility assays were performed. Owing to the presence of sfGFP on each construct from the secondary screen described above, we were able to use a TIRF-based motility assay to determine if dynein/ dynactin present in coiled coil immunoprecipitations was activated. Here, immunoprecipitation eluate was imaged in a single-molecule motility assay (see ‘Immunoprecipitation’ section above for sample preparation details). In this experiment, microtubules were labeled with HiLyte 647 tubulin (Cytoskeleton, Inc.; Denver, CO) for visualization.</p><p>In the second type of single-molecule assay, purified ~6 nM dynein (labeled with TMR),~60 nM dynactin (labeled with Atto-647N) and ~24–260 nM bacterially expressed and purified activator (labeled with sfGFP) were mixed together for ten minutes at 4°C before imaging. Immediately before imaging, the dynein/ dynactin/ activator complexes were diluted 1:20-1:80 in imaging buffer (see below for composition). In this experiment, microtubules were labeled with Alexa Fluor 405 tubulin (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p><p>Each type of single-molecule motility assay was performed in flow chambers. Biotinylated and PEGylated coverslips (Microsurfaces; Englewood, NJ) were used to reduce non-specific binding. Microtubules contained ~10% biotin-tubulin for attachment to streptavidin-coated cover slip and ~10% HiLyte 647 tubulin (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) or ~10% Alexa Fluor 405 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) tubulin for visualization. The imaging buffer used consisted of dynein lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 50 mM KOAc, 2 mM MgOAc, 1 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol (v/v), and 1 mM DTT) supplemented with 0.75–1 mg/mL casein, 1 mM Mg-ATP, 71.5 mM βME (beta-mercaptoethanol) and an oxygen scavenger system (0.4% glucose, 45 μg/ml glucose catalase (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1.15 mg/ml glucose oxidase (Sigma-Aldrich)). Images were recorded every 0.5 s for 10 min. Each individual sample was imaged no longer than 35 min. At least two technical replicates were performed for all single-molecule experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p>Motility assays were performed with an inverted Nikon (Melville, NY) Ti-E Eclipse microscope equipped with 100 × 1.4 N.A. oil immersion Plano Apo Nikon objective. The xy position of the stage was controlled by ProScan linear motor stage controller (Prior Scientific; Rockland, MA). The microscope was equipped with an MLC400B laser launch (Agilent Technologies) equipped with 405 nm (30 mW), 488 nm (90 mW), 561 nm (90 mW), and 640 nm (170 mW) laser lines. The excitation and emission paths were filtered using appropriate filter cubes (Chroma; Bellows Falls, VT). The emitted signals were detected with an iXon Ultra electron multiplier CCD camera (Andor Technology; United Kingdom). Illumination and image acquisition is controlled by NIS Elements Advanced Research software (Nikon).</p><p>The velocity of moving particles was calculated from kymographs generated in ImageJ as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roberts et al., 2014</xref>). For the immunoprecipitation followed by single-molecule experiments, particles moving in the 488 channel (activator) were used for velocity calculations. For the motility experiments with purified components, the 561 channel (dynein) was used for quantification of velocity. Velocities were only calculated from molecules that moved processively for greater than five frames. Non-motile or diffusive events were not considered in velocity calculation.</p><p>Processive events were defined as events that move uni-directionally and do not exhibit directional changes greater than 600 nm. Diffusive events were defined as events that exhibit at least one bi-directional movement greater than 600 nm in each direction. Single-molecule movements that change apparent behavior (e.g. shift from non-motile to processive) were counted as multiple events.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Chris Patil, Agnieszka Kendrick, John Salogiannis, and Andres Leschziner for critical comments on the manuscript, Kyle Roux for sharing the G2 BioID plasmid ahead of publication, and Wade Harper and members of the Harper lab for scientific advice.

The authors produce a very large dataset as a result of BioID G2-tagging of several dynein subunits and p62 of dynactin, as well as known coiled-coil activators of dynein-dynactin motility. The dataset will be of great interest to the dynein field, as previous proteomic studies have used methods that are likely to miss transient protein-protein interactions. In addition to other dynein-dynactin subunits, a small number of proteins are identified in proximity to multiple dynein subunits, which will undoubtedly seed future mechanistic studies. In this study, the authors follow up NIN and NINL, which were identified in the IC1 and IC2 BioID experiments, and were previously shown by others to associate with dynein and dynactin in cells. It is convincingly shown that NIN and NINL are sufficient to activate dynein-dynactin motility in vitro, thus increasing the number of known activators of dynein. The authors also identify a large number of proteins in proximity to the C-terminal regions of previously known coiled-coil activators of dynein, as well as NIN and NINL. The long list contains some known cargo adaptors that were shown to associate with the activators by more stringent methods, suggesting that it also contains novel proteins of this class. The authors use this information to hypothesize that activators/adaptors have many interaction partners, constituting a tiered mechanism for linking specific cargoes to dynein.</p><p>Overall the experiments are well controlled and the advances are substantive. However, there are some essential points that need to be addressed.</p><p>1) For a publication in a journal of this standing I would expect to see evidence that the list of proteins identified in proximity to the C-terminal regions of activators contains novel, bona fide interactors. An alternative possibility is that these proteins do not interact directly with the activators but are present at high concentrations in the regions of the cells where these fusion proteins accumulate. Without some validation readers will be unsure how much confidence they can have in this part of the dataset. This issue could, for example, be addressed by performing immunoprecipitations from tissue culture cells for at least one of the C-terminal constructs, followed by western blotting with available antibodies to some of the proteins on the list. Whereas some bona fide interactions may be too transient to detect by this method, others may not be. Elucidating which biological processes depend on validated interactions is not, however, necessary.</p><p>2) The identification of NIN and NINL as activators of dynein is a key part of the study and the authors should state explicitly in the Results section of the text in which BioID experiments they were (and were not) identified.</p><p>3) The legends for the motility assays should describe if the number of complexes analyzed come from a single technical replicate or a combination of multiple technical replicates. The Methods should give more information on what constitutes a technical replicate in this study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Cytoplasmic dynein is a microtubule motor that transports many different cargoes. While recent work has revealed how dynein is activated by binding an adaptor protein and dynactin to form a tripartite complex, what is not clear is how many adaptors there are, and whether there is one per cargo, and so forth. This work provides significant new insight into this question, by using the proximity ligation BioID approach combined with mass spectrometry. Two new adaptors, NIN and NINL, are identified as interacting with dynein and dynactin. Importantly, the authors also clearly demonstrate that this interaction leads to activation of dynein's motor activity, using elegant in vitro motility approaches. The authors go on to perform BioID on the new and previously identified adaptors themselves, which reveals a range of shared and distinct interacting proteins. This leads to the conclusion that there is a small number of adaptors, each of which can interact with multiple cargo components. One surprise is that several known membrane-associated adaptors were not detected (RILP, Rab11FIP3), but this is explained by their low expression in HEK cells. A complication of the approach used is that while ~50% of the BirA-tagged IC2 or p62 subunits are in the dynein or dynactin complexes, respectively, that does mean that 50% are not, and could be contributing non-specific interactions. Even with this caveat, this is an important study.</p><p>Overall, the work is thorough, well presented and explained, and the conclusions are sound. The methods are described in detail, which is excellent to see. The mass spectrometry data will be a valuable resource for the motor community. I have no substantive concerns.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28257.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>This manuscript by Reck-Peterson and colleagues used the BioID strategy to identify proteins that transiently interact and are / or located within ~ 10 angstroms of dynein or its associated proteins.

We chose to focus on these datasets because we were intrigued by the presence of the kinesin, KIF1C, in both the HOOK1 and HOOK3 datasets, but not in the dataset of any other activator. KIF1C is a kinesin-3 and its interaction with a dynein activator suggests that HOOK proteins could serve as scaffolds for plus- and minus-end-directed motors. Our results are summarized in the following paragraph.</p><p>We used co-immunoprecipitation experiments to verify the interaction between KIF1C and HOOK3 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, we showed that this interaction requires the C-terminus of HOOK3 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Highlighting the power of BioID to detect proximal interactions, we only identified KIF1C in the HOOK1 and HOOK3 C-terminal BioID datasets(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Conversely, dynein and dynactin were enriched only in the N-terminal BioID datasets and dynein was immunoprecipitated only by full length and N-terminal portions of HOOK3 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Together, these results further validate our approach and provide additional support for the spatially restricted nature of BioID. They also provide an exciting new biological finding that HOOK proteins may function as scaffolds for both plus- and minus-end-directed motors. We have added text in both the Results and Discussion to highlight this important finding.</p><p>We would also like to emphasize that BioID involves the labeling of proteins within cells, in their physiological environments – the cytoplasm for constructs used in our study. Any experiment performed post-lysis can only be an approximation of the conditions that exist in a living cell. As mentioned by reviewer #2, BioID also has the potential to identify interactions that are transient or of low affinity; thus, BioID can identify interactions that do not survive the dilution or the timescale of an immunoprecipitation experiment. In addition to the new experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2, a</xref> wealth of data in our original submission validated the power of our approach (see points 1-4 below). We feel that further validation would best be done using localization and depletion studies in living cells, but think that this is beyond the scope of the current work.</p><p>1) In the dynein and dynactin interactomes we identified known subunits of the dynein and dynactin complexes that are known to be in close proximity to the labeled subunit based on cryo-EM structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) (Chowdhury et al., 2015; Urnavicius et al., 2015).</p><p>2) We identified known (BICD2, HOOK1 and HOOK3) or suspected (BICD1) activators in the datasets of dynein or dynactin subunits that are located in close proximity to activators based on cryo-EM structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) (Chowdhury et al., 2015; Urnavicius et al., 2015).</p><p>3) We performed immunoprecipitation experiments using 24 coiled coil-containing proteins that were enriched in our dynein/dynactin interactome. Four of these proteins co-immunoprecipitated with dynein and dynactin (NIN, NINL, CCDC88A, and CCDC88C). While we did not detect a dynein/dynactin interaction with the other 20 proteins by co-immunoprecipitation, as described above, this could be because the interactions are not stable enough to be detected under the conditions we use for an immunoprecipitation experiment. It is also possible that some of these “hits” do not represent bona fide interactions with dynein/dynactin. Localization experiments in cells, which we think are beyond the scope of this work, will be the best next step to verify these interactions.</p><p>4) We identified a number of known interactions in our activator datasets, further validating our approach (for more details see Discussion).</p><p>a) AKTIP/FTSis a known HOOK1 and HOOK3 interacting protein present in our HOOK datasets.</p><p>b) FAM160A2/FHIP is a known HOOK1 and HOOK3 interacting protein in our HOOK datasets. We also identified two homologues of FHIP in our datasets: FAM160A1 and FAM160A2.</p><p>c) RIMBP3 is a known HOOK1-interacting protein that we identified in our dataset.</p><p>d) RANBP2 is a well-characterized BICD2 interacting protein that we identified in our BICD2 dataset.</p><p>e) MICAL3 is a known interaction partner of NINL, which we identified in our NINL dataset.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> motility assays seem to miss some control. The experiments have a positive control of known activators, but no negative control. I am not sure what would constitute a negative control of dynein without activators. There is a kind of control incorporated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, which may be more appropriate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, or a better control is needed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</italic> </p><p>We have included a kymograph of the control immunoprecipitation of soluble GFP, which shows no motile events (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Another informative control/comparison is our daple and girdin data, which show that although daple and girdin can bind dynein/dynactin, motile events are extremely rare (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Motile events are also extremely rare with fully reconstituted dynein/dynactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), as has been reported previously for dynein/dynactin in the absence of an activator (McKenney et al., 2014; Schlager et al., 2014; Trokter et al., 2012).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] Overall the experiments are well controlled and the advances are substantive. However, there are some essential points that need to be addressed.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) For a publication in a journal of this standing I would expect to see evidence that the list of proteins identified in proximity to the C-terminal regions of activators contains novel, bona fide interactors. An alternative possibility is that these proteins do not interact directly with the activators but are present at high concentrations in the regions of the cells where these fusion proteins accumulate. Without some validation readers will be unsure how much confidence they can have in this part of the dataset. This issue could, for example, be addressed by performing immunoprecipitations from tissue culture cells for at least one of the C-terminal constructs, followed by western blotting with available antibodies to some of the proteins on the list. Whereas some bona fide interactions may be too transient to detect by this method, others may not be. Elucidating which biological processes depend on validated interactions is not, however, necessary.</italic> </p><p>Please see response #2 to reviewer #1.</p><p><italic>2) The identification of NIN and NINL as activators of dynein is a key part of the study and the authors should state explicitly in the Results section of the text in which BioID experiments they were (and were not) identified.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have amended the text to include specific reference to the core dynein and dynactin subunit datasets enriched for NIN and NINL.</p><p><italic>3) The legends for the motility assays should describe if the number of complexes analyzed come from a single technical replicate or a combination of multiple technical replicates. The Methods should give more information on what constitutes a technical replicate in this study.</italic> </p><p>We have added this information.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] Overall, the work is thorough, well presented and explained, and the conclusions are sound.
