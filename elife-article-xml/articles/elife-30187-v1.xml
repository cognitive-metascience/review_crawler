Magnetic sensation has been shown in migratory birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Zapka et al., 2009</xref>), mole rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Nemec et al., 2001</xref>), pigeons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Keeton, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Lefeldt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Mora et al., 2004</xref>), and turtles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Lohmann et al., 2004</xref>). While behavioral evidence supporting the existence of a magnetic sense is strong, the underlying sensory mechanisms and neuronal circuitry that transduce and integrate magnetic information are largely unknown. A major impediment to progress in the field is the lack of genetic and molecular tools in magnetosensitive species. One such model system could be the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, which has proved to be a powerful tool to explore a wide variety of senses. It has been claimed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Vidal-Gadea et al. (2015</xref>) that <italic>C. elegans</italic> possess a magnetic sense which can easily be exploited for mechanistic investigation (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bainbridge et al., 2016</xref>). They argue that <italic>C. elegans</italic> possess a magnetic sense that is employed for vertical orientation, worms adopting a correction angle relative to the inclination of the Earth's magnetic field. This conclusion was based on results from three assays which they developed: (1) a ‘vertical burrowing assay’; (2) a ‘horizontal plate assay’; and (3) a ‘magnetotaxis assay’. Here, we set out to replicate the aforementioned behavioral assays, adopting several critical controls that were absent in the original study.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Benzaldehyde control experiment</title><p>We established a positive control for our experiments employing the odorant benzaldehyde.

Worms were allowed to migrate overnight, and the number on each end of the tube were counted. In the absence of an external field the authors reported that animals preferentially migrated downwards, however, when exposed to an inverted Earth strength magnetic field worms migrated upwards. This preference was reversed in the case of fed animals. We repeated these experiments, but observed no effect of inverting the magnetic field on the burrowing index when the worms were starved (Mann-Whitney U-test, n<sub>1</sub> = 38, n<sub>2</sub> = 40, U = 681, n. s.) or fed (Mann-Whitney U-test, inclination down: n<sub>1</sub> = 20, n<sub>2</sub> = 35, U = 300, n. s.)

Control experiments employed antiparallel currents resulting in a zero magnetic field.

They reported that in the absence of magnetic stimuli worms displayed no directional preference, whereas in the presence of a horizontal field fed worms distributed in a biased direction 120° from north.

An extremely strong neodynium magnet generating a field up to 0.29 T (approximately 8000 times Earth strength), was placed beneath one of the goal areas. Vidal-Gadea reported that in the absence of this magnet worms were distributed evenly between the goal areas, however, if the magnet was present worms migrated toward it. We replicated their set up placing a strong neodynium magnet under one goal area, but added an equally size non-magnetic brass control under the opposing goal area. We observed no preference for the goal area associated with the neodynium magnet (n = 49 plates, Wilcoxon signed rank test, V = 565, n.s., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The confidence interval did not include the results reported by Vidal-Gadea and colleagues (95% CI: −0.138 to 0.128). As false-positives in magnetoreception have been associated with contamination of biological material with exogenous iron we asked whether this might influence the behavior of worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Edelman et al., 2015</xref>). We tested this by growing worms on agar plates spiked with magnetite particles, and repeated the magnetotaxis assay. We found a weak but significant preference for the goal area under which the magnet resided (Wilcoxon signed rank test, n = 49 plates, V = 670.5, p = 0.042, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Why are our results different from those of Vidal-Gadea? We have gone to great lengths to employ the same protocols. We have used worms from the same source, we have employed the same neodymium magnets, we have used the same assay plates, and the same synchronization and starvation protocols. There were, however, a number of important differences. First, we have used double wrapped coils for our experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Kirschvink, 1992</xref>). Our double wrapped coils (unlike single wrapped coils) allow the application of a magnetic stimulus without generating a change in temperature compared to the control condition. Heat is an issue when dealing with <italic>C. elegans</italic> as it is known that they can reliably detect temperature changes that are &lt;0.1 °C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ramot et al., 2008</xref>). Second, we used strict blinding procedures in all our assays, assuring an unbiased assessment of the worm responses. While Vidal-Gadea report blinding when comparing different genotypes, they do not report blinding to the magnetic condition. Third, we have applied the appropriate statistical methodology when analysing our data from the horizontal plate assay. Vidal-Gadea placed ≈50 worms on a plate treating each worm as a biological replicate. However, as worms tested on the same plate can interact with each other, they are not true independent biological replicates. The approach adopted by Vidale-Gadea is known as pseudoreplication, as it confuses the number of data points with the number of independent samples, increasing the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis whilst it is actually true (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Lazic, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, there are a number of conceptual issues that undermine the assertion that <italic>C. elegans</italic> are magnetosensitive. First, the magnetotaxis assay relies on a permanent magnet that generates a field that is up to 8000 times Earth strength (0.29 T). At no time in its natural environment would <italic>C. elegans</italic> encounter such a strong field. An alternative explanation for this ‘magnetotactic behavior’ could be that exogenous iron particles attached to, or ingested by the worm, might, in the presence of an extremely large magnetic field influence the direction of locomotion by applying a force to surface mechanoreceptors.</p><p>More troubling is the underlying hypothesis that nematodes adopt a correction angle (α) relative to the inclination of the field to guide their vertical movement. Imagine a nematode is located in Cairo where the inclination of the Earth's magnetic vector is 44° 33'. To migrate vertically (i.e. 90°) it should adopt a correction angle of approximately 45° to the magnetic vector and maintain that trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Assuming that nematodes cannot distinguish up from down, the adoption of a fixed 45° angle from the inclination of the field is just as likely to result in horizontal movement (180°) as vertical translation (90°). This problem is exacerbated as the correction angle increases (e.g. 60°) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In the best case scenario, worms could undertake random walks around a set angle (45°), that would result in a meandering descending trajectory, but with a large increase in path length. The concept proposed by Vidal-Gadea is only an efficient strategy if the worms are using the ‘correction angle’ in relation to an independent reference (i.e. gravity). However, if worms are able to distinguish up from down based on gravity, why would they rely on a magnetic field vector?</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30187.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Conceptual issues with the Vidal-Gadea hypothesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The hypothesis advanced by Vidal-Gadea and colleagues argues that nematodes exploit the inclination of the Earth's magnetic field to guide vertical movement. They propose that nematodes adopt a correction angle (α, e.g. 45°) relative to the inclination of the field, which varies depending on the latitude. However, if the worms adopt such an angle and take a fixed trajectory this is as likely to result in a worm that travels horizontally as vertically. (<bold>B</bold>) As the latitude nears the equator the correction angle increases (e.g. 60°), and consequently a worm is just as likely to translate downwards, or at an oblique angle toward the Earth's surface. The light blue lines show the magnetic field vector.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-30187-fig4-v1"/></fig><p>In conclusion, we were not able to replicate the findings of Vidal-Gadea and colleagues. We have made a number of arguments why this might be the case, but it is possible that our failure to replicate this work is due to a factor we are not aware of. However, it is pertinent to note that other attempts to elicit magnetoreceptive behavior in <italic>C. elegans</italic> have also been unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Njus et al., 2015</xref>). Collectively, we conclude that <italic>C. elegans</italic> is not a suitable model system to understand the molecular basis of magnetoreception because (a) they lack a magnetic sense, or, (b) their magnetotactic behaviour is not robust.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods and materials</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Worms (N2 strain, received from Caenorhabditis Genetics Center) were maintained on the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain OP50 as food.

Worms were picked from the culture plates and collected in a small drop of NGM on a parafilm strip. In order to reduce bacterial contamination we carefully removed liquid containing bacteria and replaced it with new NGM. Worms were pipetted onto the center of the assay plate and 1 µl 1% benzaldehyde solution (in ethanol) was applied to one scoring circle and 1 µl 100% ethanol was applied to the other scoring circle. The plates were covered with aluminum foil and placed in the shielded room and left undisturbed for one hour. For our pre-exposure experiments a strip of parafilm with a 2 µl drop of 100% benzaldehyde was placed on the upper inside lid of a plate. After 90 min of pre-exposure the worms were tested as described above. For all chemotaxis experiments, we tested ≈50 worms per test. A preference index (PI) was calculated by ascertaining the difference between the number of worms reaching the benzaldehyde decision circle (B) and the 100% ethanol decision circle (E) and divided it by the total number of worms scored, PI=(B-E)/(B) + (E).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Magnetic coil set-up and magnetic shielding</title><p>For earth-strength magnetic field manipulations, we used a double wrapped custom built Helmholtz coil system (Serviciencia, S. L). The coils were located in the center of a 4.4 m (long) x 2.9 m (wide) x 2.3 m (high) shielded room. The diameter of coils were as follows: 1200 mm (Z-axis), 1254 mm (Y-axis) and 1310 mm (X-axis). The room was shielded against static magnetic fields by a 1 mm thick layer of Mu-metal and against oscillating electromagnetic fields by an aluminum layer (5 mm) (Magnetic Shielding). The ‘Inclination down’ setting as used in this study comprises a magnetic field vector with a 25 µT horizontal component, −42 µT vertical component and an inclination of −59.16°. The vertical component was inverted in the ‘inclination up’ treatment. Static magnetic fields were measured using a Three-axis Fluxgate Magnetometer (Bartington Instruments, UK). Radio frequencies were measured using an EMI test receiver (Rhode and Schwarz: MNr: E01180) and an active shielded loop antenna 6507 (EMCO: MNr: E0575). The receiver was put on MAXHOLD and measurements were taken for one min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Burrowing assay</title><p>We used 24 cm long tubes filled with 3% chemotaxis agar (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), each end was closed with a plastic stopper. The tubes contained three small holes (3 mm in diameter), one in the center and two 10 cm apart from the center hole on either side. During filling of the tubes great care was taken to avoid air bubbles at the ends of the tubes. Tubes with air bubbles were discarded. 1.5 µl of 1 M NaN<sub>3</sub> was added to each end-hole of a test tube and ≈50 were injected into the center-hole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The test tube was then covered with aluminum foil and placed upright in a holder. The holder was placed in the shielded room inside a smaller copper Faraday cage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Tubes were left undisturbed overnight or alternatively over a day. At the conclusion of the test the tubes were removed from the room and worms on either side (3 cm from the end hole) were counted. The ‘Inclination down’ setting as used in this study comprises a magnetic field vector with a 25 µT horizontal component, −42 µT vertical component and an inclination of −59.16°. The vertical component was inverted in the ‘inclination up’ treatment. These magnetic conditions were identical to those employed by Vidal-Gadea. We calculated the burrowing index (BI) by dividing the difference between worms on either side of the plastic tube (A), (B) by the total number of scoring worms, BI=(A-B)/(A) + (B).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Horizontal plate assay</title><p>Non-starved worms (≈50) were placed, with a droplet of NGM, on the center of a 100 mm style petri dish filled with 3% chemotaxis agar. Sodium azide (0.1 M, 20 µl) was applied to the rim of the plate to immobilize the worms once they reached it. Worms were released from the NGM droplet by removing the liquid with a tissue. The plate was then immediately placed in the center of the magnetic coils, described above, and covered with aluminum foil. Animals were tested in one of four magnetic directions (magnetic north pointing toward topographic north, east, south or west), with a field strength of 32.5 µT and 65 µT (close to the strength of the horizontal component of the Earth’s magnetic field). In addition, we used two control conditions where the double wrapped coils were switched to antiparallel currents, which resulted in a zero magnetic field. We performed this control for the 32.5 µT and 65 µT field settings. Worms were allowed to move freely on the plate for 1 hr, then the position and the direction of each worm relative to the center was recorded. Magnetic field conditions were set by a person not involved in the analysis. Treatments and field conditions were revealed after all worms were counted and the angles measured.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Magneto-taxis assay</title><p>We used 100 mm style petri dishes filled with 3% chemotaxis agar as test plates, marked with one center release point and two smaller ‘scoring’ circles. Sodium azide (1.5 µl of 1 M) was applied to the center of each of the scoring circles to immobilize the worms. We randomly placed a magnet (N42 Neodymium 3.5 cm diameter magnet 5 mm thick and nickel-plated) under one goal area, and a brass coin with identical dimensions as a control under the opposing goal area. The magnet was placed with the magnetic north pole pointing up in all tests. ≈50 worms were placed in the central release point with a droplet of NGM. After the worms were released by removing the liquid the plate was covered quickly with aluminum foil and placed in the shielded room. After 1 hr, the number of worms in each goal area were counted blind. It should be noted that Vidal-Gadea performed this experiment over 30 min; however, our pilot experiments showed that a longer time resulted in a higher percentage of worms in the goal areas. For our iron contamination experiments, the OP50 (in solution) was mixed thoroughly with magnetite to create a 1% magnetite/OP50 solution. Worms were then synchronized and grown on OP50 covered plates until they reached adulthood. Experiments were performed as described above. In order to avoid cross-contamination separate picks were used for the magnetite and non-magnetite trials. To calculate the preference index (PI) the number of worms on the magnetic side (M) were subtracted by the number of worms on the control side (C) and then divided by the total number of scoring worms, PI = (M - C)/ (M + C).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistics</title><p>In all tests, the experimenter was blind to the particular treatment when counting the worms. In general, we counted all tests, and did not discount tests based on low numbers of scoring worms or similar criteria in order to have an unbiased result. However, in the rare cases where no worms scored, the tests were excluded from further analysis. A one-tailed Wilcoxon one-sample test was used to test if worms preferred the benzaldehyde and the magnet. For the burrowing assay, we used a two-tailed Wilcoxon one-sample test to ascertain whether worms burrowing preference differed from zero. In order to compare groups we used a Mann–Whitney U test. All linear statistical tests were performed in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">R core team, 2012</xref>). The circular data from the horizontal plate assay were analyzed using Oriana 4. Worms tested together at the same time on the same plate can interact with each other and hence constitute non-independent samples. Therefore, we calculated one mean orientation vector for each test plate, by calculating the vector sum of all worms from this plate. The directions from the plates, relative to the magnetic field and a geographically fixed direction (door to the shielded room), were then tested for a significant unimodal orientation using the Rayleigh test. Full statistics are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We wish to thank Boehringer Ingelheim for funding basic research at the Institute for Molecular Pathology.

That is why we welcome your challenge to the research of Vidal-Gadea and colleagues, as we all agree that it is important to determine the validity of the original study.</p><p>General comments:</p><p>1) Subsection “Vertical Burrowing Assay”: &quot;We repeated these experiments, but observed no effect of inverting the magnetic field on the burrowing index when the worms were starved…(n.s.)&quot;: The authors' results are much stronger than stated here and their presentation should be revised. (1) The statement currently focuses on &quot;no effect of inverting the field&quot; but actually the observation is simply &quot;no effect at all&quot;. There is no evidence for directional burrowing, i.e. a non-zero BI, under any of the conditions. (2) For making a negative claim it is not sufficient to merely state &quot;no significant difference&quot;. You can get &quot;no significant difference&quot; simply by not experimenting hard enough. Absence of significance is not significance of absence. A better method (not the only one) is to state the 4 results as mean {plus minus} 95% confidence limits. Then interpret this by showing that the null hypothesis (BI = 0) is within the confidence limits in all 4 cases, and that the numbers reported by Vidal-Gadea Figure 1B and 2G are far outside the confidence limits.</p><p>2) “Horizontal Plate Assay”: Again, statistical significance is irrelevant for making your case. Please state the strength of the directionality effect with confidence limits. Test whether that is consistent with zero effect and whether it is consistent with the Vidal-Gadea’s claims. In this case the effects in Vidal-Gadea Figure 2 are rather weak and may well be consistent with your measurements.</p><p>3) “Magnetotaxis Assay”: Again, the p-value is not helpful. State the effect size with confidence limits and compare to the Null hypothesis and to Vidal-Gadea Figure 4.</p><p>4) Introduction section: &quot;Magnetic sensation has been shown in…&quot;. The authors may want to express this more carefully, especially given their current pursuit. Several of the papers they cite here contain weaker behavioral evidence than the Vidal-Gadea 2015 report. Wu and Dickman 2012 contains strong data, but has never been replicated, not even in the PI's laboratory, and not for lack of trying.</p><p>5) Subsection “Infrastructure and double wrapped coils”: &quot;Radio frequency contamination within this room is very low…&quot; What hypothesis would lead one to be interested in radio frequency magnetic fields? If you want to reassure us about possible environmental confounds, I would be more interested in odor plumes for example.</p><p>6) Subsection “Horizontal Plate Assay”: &quot;worms distributed in a biased direction 60° either side of the imposed vector.&quot;: Actually in Vidal-Gadea Figure 2, the direction is 120 degrees from North for fed worms, and 60 degrees from North for starved worms.</p><p>7) Subsection “Magnetotaxis Assay”: &quot;was placed beneath one of the goal areas&quot;: Strictly speaking Vidal-Gadea placed the magnet &quot;above&quot; the goal area.</p><p>8) Discussion section, paragraph three: More generally, worms should with equal probability choose directions on a cone whose surface is 45 degrees relative to the magnetic axis. On average they will therefore travel in the direction of the magnetic axis, but slower by a factor of 1/sqrt(2). So if the goal is to descend vertically, this strategy will take 41% longer on average than simply following the field.</p><p>9) Materials and methods section: Define &quot;OP50&quot;?</p><p>10) Figure 1: Maybe state that each dot is an independent test involving &gt;50 worms.</p><p>11) Figure 2 legend: Is Figure 2B a power spectrum? If so, please state and label vertical axis accordingly.</p><p>12) I understand the authors' argument regarding the use of large double-wrapped coils instead of the single-wrapped coils used by Vidal-Gadea et al. However, it would be valuable for the authors to repeat the Vidal-Gadea experiments exactly according to their protocols, to see if this difference (and presumably generated heat) is responsible for the different results. (While I agree with the authors' points about double blinding and biological replicates, neither of these factors seems likely to explain the very divergent experimental outcomes.)</p><p>13) On a similar note, in the acknowledgements, it is stated that one of the authors (LL) visited the Vidal-Gadea lab. Did LL try to replicate the magnetotaxis results when he was there? Or did this visit simply involve an observation of protocols? Again, this might address specifically why the authors obtained different results from those in the Vidal-Gadea paper. At minimum, the authors should provide more detail about what the visits involved.</p><p>14) While the data presented challenge the results published by Vidal-Gadea and colleagues, we strongly recommend more modest interpretation of the data, especially omission of the last sentence of the paper. The failure of the replication cannot automatically be used to disprove original study. History of magnetoreception research teaches us that replication of some experiments may be difficult. For instance, it has taken years to replicate independently original experiments showing magnetic compass orientation in birds.</p><p>15) One potential caveat of the study is that the worms were kept and tested in different magnetic conditions. If I am right, the worms were kept in normal (i.e., rather noisy) magnetic field in a laboratory and then tested in the magnetically shielded Mu-metal chamber. It has been shown repeatedly in birds that pre-exposure to the same magnetic intensity and light conditions may be necessary for efficient magnetic orientation. For the sake of reproducibility and critical assessment of study design, magnetic and light conditions to which animals were exposed before and during the experiments must be described in detail.</p><p>16) The authors indicate levels of radiofrequency fields in the shielded experimental room between 0.5 and 5 MHz. Because it has been shown that broadband radiofrequencies (0.1 – 10 MHz) and single frequency of 7 MHz disrupt magnetic compass orientation of birds (Ritz et al., 2004), much broader frequency range has to be characterized to exclude possible interference with radical-pair mechanism. Information concerning levels of ELMF before and during experiment shall also be given.</p><p>17) While iron-contamination from the laboratory may lead to false positive results, the way in which the experiment was done seems unrealistic. The worms were grown on 1% magnetite/OP50 bacteria solution. Such a strong contamination is highly unlikely under standard lab conditions. In this context, the claim made in the Abstract (we … demonstrates that iron-contamination from laboratory settings can result in false positive results) is inappropriate and must be reformulated.</p><p>18) In the Discussion, the authors claim: &quot;Our large double wrapped coils allow the application of a magnetic stimulus without generating a change in temperature compared to the control condition. In contrast, the small single wrapped coils employed by Vidal-Gadea generate a temperature gradient.&quot; This is a misleading statement for two reasons. First, Vidal-Gadea and colleagues used Merrit coil of 1 m3. It is not small for experiments with <italic>C. elegans</italic> that are performed on 100 mm petri dishes. Second, Vidal-Gadea et al. reported some measurable temperature gradient between center and periphery of petri dishes. However, there was no significant difference in this temperature gradient between different magnetic conditions (see their Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Thus, they actually did not face problem that your double wrapped coil solves. On the other hand, double wrapped coil in both parallel and anti-parallel mode will produce some heat and therefore potentially create temperate gradient on plates. Indicate size of Helmholz coils used in the study and temperature measurements if available.</p><p>19) The authors discuss problems associated with utilization of the inclination of the Earth magnetic vector as a cue for vertical movement. While the inclination is not an unambiguous cue, I do not agree that an independent reference (e.g. gravity) is needed. The inclination of magnetic vector is good enough for &quot;directional random walk&quot;, which may suffice navigational needs of <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Comment on &quot;Magnetosensitive neurons mediate geomagnetic orientation in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>General Comments:</p><p>The authors have generally done a good job responding to reviewer comments. We agree with their view that it is important to report instances in which earlier work is difficult or impossible to replicate, and the reviewers share your skepticism about aspects of the Vidal-Gadea paper, particularly the idea that worms use the earth's magnetic field to orient vertically in the soil.</p><p>Subsection “Infrastructure and double wrapped coils” and point 5 of the original review. Please add a citation of Engels, 2014 or some other explanation why you are measuring RF fields.</p><p>Subsection “Vertical Burrowing Assay”: Could the authors show control measurements without a magnetic field, and test whether the variance in worm trajectories is greater with than without field. This would address the concern that the assay may have averaged over fed and starved worms with positive and negative magnetotaxis.</p><p>Subsection “Magnetotaxis Assay”: &quot;under one goal area&quot;, point 7 of the original review. To the reader this appears as a departure from Vidal-Gadea's published protocol &quot;above one goal area&quot;. Please add the explanation you give in the reply to reviewers.</p><p>Discussion section, paragraph two: As pointed out in Vidal-Gadea's rebuttal, this is true only if the magnet were to lie in the plane of the worms. In reality the magnet is somewhat below that plane and that asymmetry produces a horizontal component to the field. Also in Figure 4A the field lines are unrealistic, far exaggerating the vertical component. This should be corrected or, perhaps better, the panel and its associated argument could be omitted.</p><p>Discussion section, paragraph three: &quot;spiraling descending trajectory&quot;: I don't think a random walk would lead to any kind of spiral. But regardless of the overall shape of the path, if the worm always travels at 45 degrees relative to the intended direction, its rate of progress in that direction will be only 71% of optimum.</p><p>The first paragraph of the Discussion seems to attribute the lack of replication to one of three specific defects in Vidal-Gadea et al's experimental design. Without actually testing single wrapped coils in their hands, the authors cannot conclude that this is the causative factor. Likewise, I think the behavioral assay (counting paralyzed worms in a circle) should be relatively resistant to observer bias, and Vidal-Gadea's results look different from the author's irrespective of the statistical test used. It is quite possible, even likely, that a different factor explains the different results, and this should be noted in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30187.012</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>General comments:</p><p>1) Subsection “Vertical Burrowing Assay”: &quot;We repeated these experiments, but observed no effect of inverting the magnetic field on the burrowing index when the worms were starved…(n.s.)&quot;: The authors' results are much stronger than stated here and their presentation should be revised.

In all cases the mean results obtained by Vidal-Gadea and colleagues were outside our 95% confidence intervals. We now state this in subsection “Vertical Burrowing Assay”. The null hypothesis (BI=0) fell within the confidence interval in all cases, with the exception of worms that are starved and presented with a downward inclination field. In this case the lower confidence interval is 0.006, reflecting the fact that starved worms in general tend to burrow upwards.

Therefore RF shielding and measurements are common and important practice in magnetic orientation experiments. Odor plumes are an unlikely confounding factor in our case as the experiments were done using closed plates, or sealed tubes, in an enclosed room.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Subsection “Horizontal Plate Assay”: &quot;worms distributed in a biased direction 60° either side of the imposed vector.&quot;: Actually in Vidal-Gadea Figure 2, the direction is 120 degrees from North for fed worms, and 60 degrees from North for starved worms.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified this in the text of our paper.

In initial preliminary trials we also performed the experiments this way.

Having given this matter some thought we think this depends on whether or not an individual worm adopts a fixed direction with respect to the magnetic vector. If the worm employs a &quot;random walking&quot; approach we think the reviewer is correct and you could expect them to descend around that vector in a spiraling fashion but at a slower rate. Alternatively, if the animal adopts a single fixed heading and maintains that vector it could either be going horizontally or vertically. To address this issue we have added the following sentence to the manuscript &quot;In the best case scenario worms could undertake random walks around a set angle (45°), that would result in a spiraling descending trajectory, but with a large increase in path length.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Materials and methods section: Define &quot;OP50&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>OP50 is the standard bacterial lawn (<italic>E. coli</italic>) used to feed <italic>C. elegans</italic>.

The primary goal of this visit was to learn and observe the behavioural protocols developed by Vidal-Gadea. An analysis of the results obtained did not reveal a significant magnetic effect, but the n number was low, and the experiments were not performed in shielded conditions and not always blinded.

We think this needs to be balanced with the need for independent replication of key papers. We do not, as stated by the reviewer claim to have &quot;disproved&quot; the original study. Proof is an ellusive and difficult goal to obtain, requiring (in our view) multiple independent labs that perform experiments that stand the test of time.</p><p>Rather our argument is that worms are not a good model to study magnetoreception. We have clarified this by modifying the last sentence so it now reads &quot;Collectively, we conclude that <italic>C. elegans</italic> is not a suitable model system to understand the molecular basis of magnetoreception because (a) they lack a magnetic sense, or, (b) their magnetotactic behaviour is not robust.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) One potential caveat of the study is that the worms were kept and tested in different magnetic conditions.

If a worm follows a straight path, adopting a fixed correction angle, it will not necessarily result in vertical translocation – it is just as likely to end up travelling horizontally. However, we do acknowledge that the adoption of a &quot;random walking&quot; approach around an inclination angle would result in a worm that spirals downward (with a greater path length).
