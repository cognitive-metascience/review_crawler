The Hippo kinase cascade represses the growth-promoting transcription co-activator Yorkie. The FERM protein Expanded is one of the main upstream Hippo signalling regulators in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as it promotes Hippo kinase signalling and directly inhibits Yorkie. To fulfil its function, Expanded is recruited to the plasma membrane by the polarity protein Crumbs. However, Crumbs-mediated recruitment also promotes Expanded turnover via a phosphodegron-mediated interaction with a Slimb/β-TrCP SCF E3 ligase complex. Here, we show that the Casein Kinase 1 (CKI) family is required for Expanded phosphorylation. CKI expression promotes Expanded phosphorylation and interaction with Slimb/β-TrCP. Conversely, CKI depletion in S2 cells impairs Expanded degradation downstream of Crumbs. In wing imaginal discs, CKI loss leads to elevated Expanded and Crumbs levels. Thus, phospho-dependent Expanded turnover ensures a tight coupling of Hippo pathway activity to epithelial architecture.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippo

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The maintenance of epithelial tissue architecture through cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix contacts, as well as cell polarity, is essential for organ function and size control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Genevet and Tapon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Low et al., 2014</xref>). The evolutionarily conserved Hippo (Hpo) pathway, a key signalling module that senses and responds to epithelial organisation, has emerged as a critical regulator of growth and epithelial integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Genevet and Tapon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schroeder and Halder, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu and Guan, 2013</xref>). At the core of Hpo signalling is a kinase cascade comprising Hpo and Warts (Wts), which promote the phosphorylation and inactivation of the pro-growth transcriptional co-activator Yorkie (Yki, YAP in mammals), thereby repressing tissue growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu and Guan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fulford et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hong and Guan, 2012</xref>). When Hpo signalling is inactive, Yki/YAP is able to enter the nucleus, associate with its transcription factor partner Scalloped (TEAD1-4 in mammals) and promote the expression of cell cycle regulators and apoptosis inhibitors, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Genevet and Tapon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu and Guan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hong and Guan, 2012</xref>). To ensure that epithelial homeostasis is maintained, Yki/YAP also control the expression of Hpo pathway upstream regulators that dampen Yki/YAP activity as part of a negative feedback mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Genevet and Tapon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Halder and Johnson, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Yki/YAP activity responds to epithelial organisation through the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gaspar and Tapon, 2014</xref>), basolateral polarity determinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cordenonsi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grzeschik et al., 2010</xref>), adherens junction components, such as α-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schlegelmilch et al., 2011</xref>), and apical polarity proteins, such as Crumbs (Crb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grzeschik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hafezi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Varelas et al., 2010</xref>). While the vast majority of these inputs act through Hpo and/or Wts, some engage core kinase cascade-independent signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Genevet and Tapon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu and Guan, 2013</xref>). The FERM domain protein Expanded (Ex) is a key regulator of Yki function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hamaratoglu et al., 2006</xref>), which inhibits tissue growth using both Hpo-dependent and -independent mechanisms, in a manner analogous to mammalian Angiomotins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moleirinho et al., 2014</xref>). Ex is an upstream activator of the Hpo core kinase cassette that forms a complex with Kibra and Merlin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baumgartner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Genevet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McCartney et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yu et al., 2010</xref>). Ex has been proposed to promote core kinase activity by bridging Hpo association with the upstream kinase Tao-1 together with Schip1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Genevet and Tapon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2016</xref>), and by recruiting Wts to the apical membrane where it can be activated by Hpo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). Ex also restrains tissue growth in a phosphorylation-independent manner by tethering Yki at the apical membrane via a direct PPxY:WW domain-mediated interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badouel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oh et al., 2009</xref>), a process regulated by Ack-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Ex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, Ex has also been linked with F-actin-mediated regulation of Yki function, by antagonising the action of Zyxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaspar et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>ex</italic> is a Yki target gene and, therefore, it is a prime candidate to mediate the Hpo pathway feedback regulation that controls tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Genevet and Tapon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Halder and Johnson, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Ex is a key link between epithelial polarity and Hpo signalling. This is controlled by the transmembrane protein Crb, which in addition to its recognised role in polarity, also regulates tissue growth by modulating the Notch and Hpo pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grzeschik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hafezi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Richardson and Pichaud, 2010</xref>). Via its FERM-binding motif (FBM), Crb recruits Ex to the apical membrane, where it can promote inhibition of Yki (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Genevet and Tapon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hafezi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Su et al., 2017</xref>). However, besides activating Hpo signalling through Ex, Crb also stimulates Ex phosphorylation and turnover of Ex protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Genevet and Tapon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grzeschik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ribeiro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laprise, 2011</xref>). We have previously shown that ubiquitylation and degradation of Ex downstream of Crb is mediated by the phospho-dependent SCF<sup>Slimb/β-TrCP</sup> E3 ligase complex, which is also thought to regulate Ex levels independently of Crb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ribeiro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). However, the identity of the kinase(s) that promote Ex degradation downstream of Crb is currently unknown.</p><p>Here, we identify the Casein Kinase 1 (CKI) family of protein kinases as regulators of Ex stability that function downstream of the polarity protein Crb. Depletion of CKI kinases suppresses Crb-induced Ex phosphorylation, ubiquitylation and degradation. Interestingly, CKI kinases regulate Ex in a partially redundant manner, which suggests that regulation of Ex stability is a key step in the regulation of Yki function and the maintenance of tissue homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Crb promotes interaction of Ex with Casein kinase 1 family proteins</title><p>We have previously shown that Crb regulates Ex protein stability in a β-TrCP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ribeiro et al., 2014</xref>). The Ex:Slimb (Slmb, <italic>Drosophila</italic> β-TrCP) interaction is mediated by a β-TrCP consensus sequence immediately following the Ex N-terminal FERM domain (<sup>452</sup><bold>TSG</bold>IV<bold>S</bold><sup>457</sup>). In agreement with the fact that β-TrCP targets substrates for ubiquitylation and degradation through the recognition of a phosphodegron, Ex is phosphorylated in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells in the presence of ectopic Crb (full-length or the intracellular domain, Crb<sup>intra</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ribeiro et al., 2014</xref>). However, the kinase(s) involved in Ex degradation downstream of Crb are currently unknown. In our previous report, we used affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP-MS) to identify Slmb as an Ex interacting protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ribeiro et al., 2014</xref>). Upon re-analysis of our AP-MS data, we observed that Gilgamesh (Gish), the <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologue of Casein kinase 1γ, was specifically purified by an Ex truncation that fully recapitulates the Crb-mediated effect on Ex stability (Ex<sup>1-468</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ribeiro et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, Gish peptides were detected in the Ex<sup>1-468</sup> AP-MS only upon co-expression with wild-type (wt) Crb but not with a FERM-binding motif mutant version of Crb (ΔFBM) that cannot bind Ex or promote its depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ribeiro et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, Hpo interacted with Ex regardless of Crb presence, in agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yu et al., 2010</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46592.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Gish, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologue of CkIγ interacts with Ex in a Crb-dependent manner.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) An AP-MS approach identified Gish as an Ex-interacting protein.

To this end, we analysed Ex electrophoretic mobility shift and protein levels (indicative of phosphorylation and degradation, respectively) in S2 cells upon expression of different CKI kinases. Co-expression of Ex<sup>1-468</sup> and Gish<sup>isoI</sup> in the absence of Crb resulted in a mild depletion of Ex<sup>1-468</sup> protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), whereas Gish<sup>isoF</sup> had no effect. We reasoned that the mild effect of Gish<sup>isoI</sup> on Ex stability might be due to relatively low levels of Ex<sup>1-468</sup> reaching the membrane in the absence of Crb, which is not endogenously expressed in S2 cells. To mimic the apical membrane localisation of endogenous Ex, we generated an Ex variant containing a C-terminal CAAX sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sotillos et al., 2004</xref>), which targets Ex to cellular membranes (Ex<sup>1-468 CAAX</sup>). Importantly, this variant remains responsive to Crb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and co-immunoprecipitates with Gish in a Crb-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Ex<sup>1-468 CAAX</sup> ran mostly as a single band in S2 cells in the presence of the Crb<sup>ΔFBM</sup> mutant and, similar to wt Ex<sup>1-468</sup>, as a higher mobility band or doublet in the presence of wt Crb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). An electrophoretic mobility shift and depletion was also observed when Ex<sup>1-468 CAAX</sup> was co-expressed with Gish<sup>isoI</sup>, but not with a kinase-dead version of Gish (Gish<sup>KD</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

To test this, we co-expressed CkIα, Dco or Gish<sup>isoI</sup> in S2 cells with either wt Ex<sup>1-468 CAAX</sup> or a variant carrying a mutation at S453 (Ex<sup>1-468 S453A CAAX</sup>), one of the crucial residues that mediates the interaction between Ex and Slmb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ribeiro et al., 2014</xref>). All three kinases readily promoted the degradation of wt Ex<sup>1-468 CAAX</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). However, the S453A mutant levels were largely unaffected by CKI isoforms, consistent with the notion that the CKI-mediated regulation of Ex stability is dependent on the ability of Ex to interact with Slmb via the phosphodegron surrounding S453. Interestingly, expression of CkIα or Gish<sup>isoI</sup> resulted in the appearance of a slower-migrating Ex<sup>1-468 S453A</sup> band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This suggests that, at least for CkIα and Gish, there may be alternative CKI phosphorylation sites in Ex<sup>1-468</sup> besides S453.</p><p>We also assessed whether CKI kinases could promote the Ex:Slmb interaction, which we have previously shown can be triggered by Crb over-expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ribeiro et al., 2014</xref>).

CkIα and Dco were also able to induce binding between Ex<sup>1-468 CAAX</sup> and Slmb in the absence of Crb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Dco consistently showed a weaker effect on Ex phosphorylation than the other two kinases. Our previous findings showed that the Crb-induced Ex:Slmb interaction relies on the region surrounding the β-TrCP consensus motif (aa 450–468 in Ex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ribeiro et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, an Ex truncation mutant lacking this domain (Ex<sup>1-450</sup>) was refractory to degradation, and did not display a mobility shift following Gish<sup>isoI</sup> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that CKIs act upstream of Slmb to promote Ex phosphorylation and degradation.</p><p>β-TrCP substrates are often targeted for degradation by the sequential action of GSK3β and CKI kinases (e.g. β-catenin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gammons and Bienz, 2018</xref>). Thus, we tested if the <italic>Drosophila</italic> GSK3β orthologue Shaggy (Sgg) was involved in the regulation of Ex phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Siegfried et al., 1992</xref>). However, we found that over-expression of Sgg did not promote Ex:Slmb binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Moreover, RNAi-mediated depletion of <italic>sgg</italic> did not abrogate Crb-induced Ex phosphorylation and degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>). Together, our results indicate that the CKI kinases, but not Sgg, regulate Ex phosphorylation and stability, acting upstream of Slmb/β-TrCP.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>CKI kinases promote Ex phosphorylation and degradation in vivo</title><p>Next, we wanted to validate our observations in developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues. However, assessing Ex protein stability in vivo is complicated by the fact that <italic>ex</italic> is a Yki target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hamaratoglu et al., 2006</xref>) and, therefore, its steady state protein levels reflect not only direct post-translational effects but also transcriptional inputs via the modulation of Hpo signalling. To directly study Ex stability in the absence of any confounding effects due to Yki-mediated transcriptional feedback, we generated transgenic flies carrying an Ex stability reporter construct consisting of Ex<sup>1-468</sup> fused to GFP, whose expression is controlled by the <italic>ubiquitin 63E</italic> promoter rather than its endogenous promoter (ubi-Ex<sup>1-468</sup>::GFP). We also generated a mutant version that is refractory to Crb-induced degradation by mutating Ser 453, which mediates binding to Slmb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ribeiro et al., 2014</xref>). As predicted, the ubi-Ex<sup>1-468</sup>::GFP reporters resemble endogenous Ex in that they are normally localised at the apical cortex of wing imaginal disc cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B,D,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Importantly, the in vivo reporters recapitulate the effect of Crb on Ex protein stability and localisation. In agreement with previous observations of Ex<sup>FL</sup>, ubi-Ex<sup>1-468</sup>::GFP failed to localise to the apical surface in <italic>crb</italic> mutant tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–A’</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and accumulated at the apical cortex in <italic>slmb</italic> mutant clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–B’</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hafezi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ribeiro et al., 2014</xref>). Loss of both <italic>crb</italic> and <italic>slmb</italic> led to accumulation of Ex<sup>1-468</sup>::GFP in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–C’</xref>), suggesting that the Ex sensor can be degraded by SCF<sup>Slimb/β-TrCP</sup> in the cytoplasm, as had been suggested for endogenous Ex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). When a Crb<sup>intra</sup> transgene was expressed in the posterior compartment using the <italic>hedgehog-Gal4</italic> driver (<italic>hh-Gal4</italic>), ubi-Ex<sup>1-468</sup>::GFP was lost from the apical surface and degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In contrast, the S453A mutant reporter accumulated upon Crb<sup>intra</sup> expression, presumably due to the fact that it cannot be recognised by Slmb and degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This re-localisation of Ex<sup>1-468 S453A</sup> mirrored the localisation of over-expressed Crb<sup>intra</sup>, which localised to the apical cortex as well as basal membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). It is therefore possible that Ex<sup>1-468 S453A</sup> is mislocalised to the basolateral membrane by ectopic Crb, where it cannot be degraded. A further advantage of using this N-terminal fragment as a reporter is that our constructs lack the Yki-binding PPxY motifs, and therefore, do not induce cell death and reduced tissue growth, as does full length Ex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hamaratoglu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badouel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oh et al., 2009</xref>).

Triple mutant clones for <italic>ckIα</italic>, <italic>gish</italic> and <italic>dco</italic> had elevated Ex and Crb levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1I</xref>), but these were comparable to <italic>ckIα</italic> clones alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>). Thus, in vivo, it does not appear that CKI family members function redundantly to control Ex levels, at least in wing discs under normal developmental conditions. To test whether the regulation of Ex levels by Slmb and CkIα occurs in tissues other than the wing disc, we generated mutant clones in the eye, leg and haltere imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). In the eye disc, loss of either <italic>slmb</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–A’</xref>) or <italic>ckIα</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D–D’</xref>) led to a strong clone extrusion phenotype and a loss of ommatidial differentiation posterior to the morphogenetic furrow. We did not observe a strong elevation of the Ex::GFP reporter in these mutant clones. However, as the Ex::GFP signal was most prominent in the apical domain of the ommatidial units, it is difficult to conclude if Slmb and CkIα regulate Ex stability in the absence of differentiated ommatidia in the mutant tissue. In contrast, Ex::GFP levels were elevated in both <italic>slmb</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B–C’</xref>) or <italic>ckIα</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–6F’</xref>) mutant clones in the leg and haltere discs.

In agreement with its key role in growth control, it is increasingly evident that Ex is tightly regulated, both at the transcriptional level via Yki itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hamaratoglu et al., 2006</xref>) and through its subcellular localisation and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Su et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ribeiro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ma et al., 2017</xref>). Crb recruits Ex to its site of activity at the apical plasma membrane, but also limits its apical levels by triggering Ex turnover via Slmb/β-TrCP, ensuring the fine-tuning of Yki activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ribeiro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Slmb can also promote the degradation of Ex in the cytoplasm in a Crb-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and C’</xref>). Another ubiquitin ligase, Plenty of SH3s (POSH) has also been implicated in Ex degradation in parallel to Slmb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ma et al., 2018</xref>). Since our data indicate that Ex levels are not sensitive to Slmb in the eye imaginal disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), it is possible POSH is the dominant Ex regulator in this tissue. Interestingly, recent work indicates that the Fat atypical cadherin, a major upstream branch of Hippo signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennett and Harvey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Silva et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Willecke et al., 2006</xref>) also influences Ex stability by apically recruiting the adaptor Dlish/Vamana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Misra and Irvine, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Dlish binds the Ex C-terminus via its SH3 domain and promotes the Slmb:Ex association, thereby increasing Ex turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, Ex functions as a hub in Hippo signalling that receives input from both the Crb and the Fat branches of upstream signalling.</p><p>However, recognition by Slmb/β-TrCP requires substrate phosphorylation, which had remained an unexplored aspect of Ex regulation. Here, we provide evidence that the CKI family of kinases and, in particular, CkIα and Gish, act downstream of Crb to promote phosphorylation of Ex, in turn allowing binding to Slmb/β-TrCP and Ex ubiquitylation and degradation. In conditions whereby Crb-mediated turnover of Ex is active, such as through Crb<sup>intra</sup> expression, loss of <italic>ckIα</italic> (and <italic>gish</italic> in cell culture) inhibited Ex degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref>). In the absence of CKI function, Crb is unable to trigger Ex:Slmb binding and thus can no longer induce Ex degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>). In agreement with the requirement for Slmb/β-TrCP function, Ex degradation is dependent on phosphorylation and the presence of a β-TrCP consensus site (<sup>452</sup><bold>TSG</bold>IV<bold>S</bold><sup>457</sup>), which is phosphorylated to allow the interaction to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ribeiro et al., 2014</xref>). Our data indicate that CKIs mediate Ex phosphorylation downstream of Crb, as the effect of CKIs on Ex stability is dependent on their kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>) and mutation of a conserved residue in the Slmb/β-TrCP consensus (S453A) rendered Ex insensitive to degradation induced by Crb, CKIs or Slmb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ribeiro et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2D</xref>). Interestingly, CkIα and Gish were still able to induce a mobility shift in Ex when the S453 residue was mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting that other residues besides S453 may be targets of CKI-mediated phosphorylation. An Ex truncation lacking residues 450–468 (Ex<sup>1-450</sup>) fails to undergo a mobility shift in the presence of Crb<sup>intra</sup> or Gish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This may indicate that the additional residues targeted by CKI are in this region, or simply that CKI needs these residues to dock onto Ex.</p><p>It remains to be determined whether phosphorylation at additional sites besides S453 is required to promote Ex:Slmb binding, and whether CKIs are part of a phospho-priming mechanism that involves additional kinases, as commonly seen for other CKI targets, such as β-catenin downstream of Wnt signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amit et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang and Struhl, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stamos and Weis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Winston et al., 1999</xref>). In the case of β-catenin, CK1α acts as a priming kinase for GSK3β/Sgg; however, our data suggest that Sgg does not affect Ex stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>). Wts/LATS is another candidate, since mammalian LATS1/2 act as priming kinases for CK1δ/ε to target YAP for degradation by SCF<sup>β-TrCP</sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>). However, Wts has been suggested to stabilise Ex through phosphorylation at S1116, rather than promote its degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, Crb-dependent Ex degradation appears to override Wts-mediated stabilisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2015</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The potential involvement of other kinases in Ex/Slmb binding therefore remains an open question.</p><p>An unexpected aspect of our results is the fact that, in cultured S2 cells, Gish (CKIγ) depletion has a strong effect on Ex stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>), while CkIα appears to be the dominant player in the wing imaginal disc, both in the presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref>) and absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) of Crb<sup>intra</sup> expression. This is surprising, since Crb-induced Ex phosphorylation and ubiquitylation presumably occurs at the apical plasma membrane, where Gish is known to be localised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morin et al., 2001</xref>). This is unlikely to be due to a lack of Gish activity, since it is implicated in several signalling pathways in the wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gault et al., 2012</xref>). However, CKI isoforms are known to exist in distinct subcellular pools associated with components of the signalling pathways they regulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jiang, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Knippschild et al., 2014</xref>). It is therefore possible that recruitment of CkIα to Crb/Ex may involve an adaptor protein expressed in the wing disc, as is the case for CkIε, which requires the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX3 to phosphorylate Dishevelled2 in the mammalian Wnt pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cruciat et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>As Ex apical accumulation is predicted to antagonise Yki, we measured several readouts of Yki-dependent transcription and found that Yki activity is indeed decreased upon <italic>ckIα</italic> depletion and increased by CkIα overexpression, while Gish manipulations had no such effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C,E–H</xref>). <italic>ckIα</italic> mutations would therefore be predicted to reduce tissue growth by reducing Yki activity. However, we observed that <italic>ckIα</italic> mutant clones are generally overgrown, round, and tend to delaminate from the wing disc epithelium, so that they often do not contribute to the adult wing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,C</xref>). This overgrowth phenotype is due to a strong elevation of Wingless (Wg) signalling in <italic>ckIα</italic> mutant tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Legent et al., 2012</xref>) and is very similar to the loss of two Wg antagonists, <italic>axin</italic> and <italic>APC1/2</italic> (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Muñoz-Descalzo et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, it is likely that the decreased growth occurring as a result of partial loss of Yki activity in <italic>ckIα</italic> mutant clones is compensated by a strong increase in Wg signalling.</p><p>Our data also revealed that loss of either <italic>ckIα</italic> or <italic>slmb</italic> function results in an increase in the apical levels of Crb as well as Ex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). This is not due to a general increase in apical domain size, since aPKC is not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>). These observations raise two possibilities; either that Crb stability is regulated by the same mechanism as Ex, or that Crb and Ex can affect each other’s apical localisation. It seems unlikely that Crb is co-degraded with Ex in a Slmb/β-TrCP-dependent manner, since Crb lacks clear β-TrCP and CKI consensus sequences in its intracellular domain. Moreover, it has been previously shown that Crb levels increase in <italic>ex</italic> mutant clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2010</xref>), a result not easily reconcilable with co-degradation. Instead, we favour the second possibility, in which excess Ex accumulation leads to increased Crb apical levels. Consistent with this idea, over-expression of Ex<sup>1-468</sup> leads to a robust increase in apical Crb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Apical Crb endocytosis occurs through docking of the AP-2 (adaptor-protein 2) complex member α-adaptin, which competes with Stardust to bind the Crb intracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2015</xref>). It is therefore possible that excess Ex interferes with Crb recognition by α-adaptin, thereby decreasing Crb internalisation rates in <italic>ckIα</italic> or <italic>slmb</italic> mutant clones.</p><p>CRB3, the mammalian orthologue of Crb, can regulate Hippo signalling by mechanisms analogous to those described in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. CRB3 interacts with two proposed orthologues of Ex, Angiomotin (AMOT), and FRMD6, in a density-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Varelas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angus et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moleirinho et al., 2013</xref>). It would therefore be interesting to test if the stability of either AMOT or FRMD6 is regulated by CRB3, CKI and β-TrCP. In summary, our data support a model whereby the apical polarity determinant Crb promotes Ex phosphorylation by CKI family kinases, which in turn stimulates Slmb/β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitylation and degradation. We propose that this mechanism facilitates precise and dynamic control of Ex protein levels at the apical membrane, which is crucial for the regulation of Hippo signalling.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> cell culture, expression constructs and chemical treatments</title><p>Work involved the use of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell line Schneider S2 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_Z232">CVCL_Z232</ext-link>).

However, recognition by Slmb/β-TrCP requires substrate phosphorylation, which had remained an unexplored aspect of Ex regulation. In this paper, Fulford et al. provide evidence that the CKI family kinases, CkIα and Gish, act downstream of Crb to promote phosphorylation of Ex, in turn promoting Ex degradation. The paper comprises a large amount of supporting data, which is generally of very good quality and consistent with the authors' interpretations. The strong points of this manuscript are the thoroughness of the biochemistry assays although it is still unclear about the phosphorylation site(s) of CKI on Ex. Overall, this paper gave me a feeling that the authors described a quite simple biological context using a very complicated way. I would suggest the authors simplify this paper. In addition, the major weakness of this paper is that it doesn't show any biological function of CKI in regulating organ size and Yki activity, which dramatically reduced the significance of this work. My concerns listed below should be addressed in revision.</p><p>1) To assess the functional significance of CKI kinases in controlling Hippo pathway activation, it will be important to examine whether CKI controls organ growth. CkIα (and/or Gish) mutant- or overexpression- MARCM clone assays would be required.</p><p>2) Following the above question, the authors need to examine Yki activity in CkIα (and/or Gish) mutant/overexpression background using Diap1-lacZ or <italic>ex-lacZ</italic> reporter.</p><p>3) The authors showed that CKI phosphorylates Ex in vitro, however, it is important to identify the phosphorylation site(s) of Ex and generate the phosphor-specific antibody to examine the endogenous Ex phosphorylation. Alternatively, the phosphor-tag gel or pan-phosphor S/T antibody could be used for the phosphorylation detection.</p><p>4) All biochemistry assays were using overexpression system. They should detect endogenous Ex expression and degradation. For example, CHX treatment could be used to avoid <italic>gish</italic>-mediated transcriptional regulation of endogenous Ex expression.</p><p>5) Although the biochemistry assays have shown that CKI kinase Gish is required for Crb-mediated Ex turnover, the genetic epistasis between Crb and CkIα in controlling Yki activation and organ growth is still needed to be tested. I would suggest the authors perform the following experiments &quot;<italic>hh</italic>&gt; Crbintra vs. <italic>hh</italic>&gt;Crbintra + CkIαRNAi&quot;, then compare the Yki reporter induction (e.g. Diap1-LacZ) and P-compartment size.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46592.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] 1) My major concern/confusion is the lack of any discussion about the seeming contradiction that both loss of Crb and excess Crb leads to Ex degradation.

Previous work from ourselves and others had indeed shown that Crb is required to recruit Ex to the apical plasma membrane (Ling et al., 2010, Chen et al., 2010, Hafezi et al., 2012, Ribeiro et al., 2014). However, as well as promoting Ex activation by membrane recruitment, Crb also brings Ex into proximity with CKI family members and the SCF<sup>Slimb</sup> complex, as shown by our Affinity Purification/Mass Spectrometry analysis (Figure 1A and Ribeiro et al., 2014). Thus, we believe Crb is both responsible for Ex recruitment to its site of activity and also for ensuring its fast turnover through degradation in order to fine-tune Yki regulation. We have clarified this issue in the first paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>The reviewer raises in interesting point in enquiring about the fate of Ex in the cytoplasm upon loss of Crb. Previously published data indicated that endogenous Ex accumulates in the cytoplasm upon Crb loss (Ribeiro et al., 2014, Robinson et al., 2010, Ling et al., 2010), which had been interpreted as meaning that Ex is mainly degraded at the apical plasma membrane, and failure of apical recruitment leads to stabilisation and cytoplasmic accumulation. However, our Ex::GFP reporter does not accumulate in the cytoplasm in Crb clones (Figure 4A, A’), suggesting a different possibility: that endogenous Ex cytoplasmic accumulation is primarily due to <italic>ex</italic> transcriptional upregulation in <italic>crb</italic> mutant clones. Indeed, work published by the Jiao lab suggests SCF<sup>Slimb</sup> can also degrade Ex in the cytoplasm (Zhang et al., 2015). To directly test this possibility and as requested by the reviewer, we examined the Ex::GFP sensor in <italic>crb, slmb</italic> double mutant clones (new Figure 3C, C’). We observed that, as anticipated, loss of <italic>slmb</italic> leads to Ex sensor cytoplasmic accumulation in <italic>crb</italic> mutant clones, confirming the finding from the Jiao lab that Ex can be degraded in the cytoplasm and supporting the idea that transcriptional elevation of <italic>ex</italic> plays a role in cytoplasmic accumulation of Ex protein in Crb clones. Thus, although Crb promotes Ex degradation by SCF<sup>Slimb</sup> at the plasma membrane, there is also a Crb-independent Slimb-dependent cytoplasmic Ex degradation pathway, though the relative turnover rate of these mechanisms is not clear. Since Ex activity in growth control is thought to occur at the apical plasma membrane (Fulford et al., 2018), it is likely that the Crb-dependent mechanism is key in determining Ex functional levels. We discuss this new result in the first paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) in vivo, at least in wing discs, CK1α seems to be the major kinase. Is this also true in other imaginal discs? They could extend their results to other discs by analyzing slimb and CK1α mutant clones with and without Crb overexpression.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewer, we examined the levels of the Ex::GFP reporter in haltere, leg and eye imaginal discs. In the haltere and leg disc, the levels of the Ex reporter were elevated in both <italic>ckI</italic>α and <italic>slmb</italic> clones, suggesting a similar mechanism operates as in the wing disc. Interestingly, we did not see a clear increase in the eye disc. However, <italic>ckI</italic>α and <italic>slmb</italic> loss in these tissues elicited a very strong clone extrusion phenotype, and a complete loss of ommatidial differentiation, making the analysis difficult, especially since the most prominent Ex localisation in the eye disc is at the apical side of the emerging ommatidial clusters. These new data are presented in Figure 5—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors state: &quot;When a Crbintra transgene was expressed in the posterior compartment using the hedgehog-Gal4 driver (hh-Gal4), ubi-Ex<sup>1-468</sup>::GFP was lost from the apical surface and degraded (Figure 3C-D and Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). In contrast, the S453A mutant reporter accumulated all over the cell upon Crbintra expression, presumably due to the fact that it cannot be recognised by Slmb and degraded (Figure 3E-F and Figure 3—figure supplement 1D). &quot;</p><p>I disagree with the conclusion that Ex-S453A mutant accumulates all over the cell, it does not accumulate at the apical membrane. Therefore, it seems to be still degraded at the membrane suggesting involvement of other residues. Alternatively, it is mislocalized to the basolateral membrane by ectopic Crb and cannot be degraded there.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is possible that the Ex<sup>S453</sup> reporter is mislocalised to the basolateral membrane by ectopic Crb and is refractory to degradation there. We have changed the manuscript text to reflect this possibility. “It is therefore possible that Ex<sup>1-468 S453A</sup> is mislocalised to the basolateral membrane by ectopic Crb, where it cannot be degraded”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] Overall, this paper gave me a feeling that the authors described a quite simple biological context using a very complicated way.

We believe that whilst it is tempting to consider that Expanded regulation by Crb is a simple biological process, the reality is that the existence of multiple layers of regulation and the fact that there is Yki-dependent feedback regulation of transcriptional levels of <italic>ex</italic> make these studies challenging to perform and to explain in a simple manner. Nevertheless, based on the reviewer’s comments, we have endeavoured to highlight the relevance of the biological phenomenon studied and to clarify our arguments in the manuscript accordingly. We believe that our revised manuscript and new data significantly improve the quality and strength of our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) To assess the functional significance of CKI kinases in controlling Hippo pathway activation, it will be important to examine whether CKI controls organ growth. CkIα (and/or Gish) mutant- or overexpression- MARCM clone assays would be required.</p><p>2) Following the above question, the authors need to examine Yki activity in CkIα (and/or Gish) mutant/overexpression background using Diap1-lacZ or ex-lacZ reporter.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is important to correlate the stabilisation of Ex in <italic>ckI</italic>α mutant clones with Yki activity. To address this, we examined two transcriptional readouts of Yki activity: <italic>ex-lacZ</italic>, an enhancer trap in the <italic>ex</italic> locus (Hamaratoglu et al., 2006), and <italic>diap1-GFP3.5</italic>, a fragment of the <italic>diap1</italic> promoter driving a GFP reporter (Zhang et al., 2008), both of which are widely used in the field. Results of this analysis are shown in the new Figure 7. In accordance with our model, while <italic>gish</italic> mutant clones had wild type levels of <italic>ex-lacZ</italic> (Figure 7B), both <italic>diap1-GFP3.5</italic> and <italic>ex-lacZ</italic> levels were markedly reduced in <italic>ckI</italic>α clones (Figure 7A and 7C). In addition, we used a Yki-GFP knock-in fly line (Fletcher et al., 2018) to show that Yki is excluded from the nucleus in <italic>ckI</italic>α mutant cells compared with control (Figure 7D). Thus, decreased Yki activity is correlated with increased Ex stability upon CkIα disruption, while Gish loss has no effect. We then examined the effect of CKI overexpression on <italic>ex-lacZ</italic>. In further support of our model, CkIα overexpression increased <italic>ex-lacZ</italic> expression, while Gish expression had no effect (Figure 7E-H).</p><p>The effect on growth is more complicated to address because, like many kinases, CkIα likely regulates a number of substrates. In fact, rather than being smaller as expected from decreased Yki activity, <italic>ckI</italic>α clones are larger than control clones and are often excluded from the disc epithelium once they reach a certain size. This overgrowth phenotype is due to excess Wingless (Wg) signalling, and can be suppressed by expression of dominant negative TCF (Legent et al., 2012). In fact, the clonal overgrowth and exclusion phenotype of <italic>ckI</italic>α mutants closely resembles that of the Wg signalling negative regulators <italic>axin</italic> and <italic>APC1/2</italic> (see for example Munoz-Descalzo et al., 2011). Thus, it is likely that the undergrowth induced by Ex stability and consequent Yki downregulation is masked by the very strong overgrowth due to Wg signalling upregulation upon <italic>ckI</italic>α loss. We now consider these points in the Discussion. In the case of CkIα overexpression, we do observe a mild overgrowth phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>), which correlates with increased Yki activity (as measured by <italic>ex-lacZ</italic> expression, shown in Figure 7). As expected, Gish overexpression causes neither <italic>ex-lacZ</italic> expression (Figure 7) nor overgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). It is possible that this overgrowth is observed because Wg and Hippo signalling are sensitive to a different threshold of CkIα activity, so that mild gain of CkIα increases Yki activity without strongly impairing Wg. However, as it is difficult to verify this interpretation, we have not included the effect of CKI overexpression on wing size in the manuscript, though we are happy to include it if the reviewer so requires.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Overexpression of CkIα, but not Gish<sup>isoI</sup>, causes a mild overgrowth of the posterior compartment of the wing.</title><p>(<bold>A-C</bold>) Adult wings from female flies overexpressing no transgene (<bold>A</bold>), UAS-CkIα (<bold>B</bold>), or UAS-Gish<sup>isoI</sup> (<bold>C</bold>), in the posterior compartment of the developing wing under the control of <italic>hhGal4</italic>.

Unfortunately, we were unable to validate the p-S453 antibodies we generated in both rabbits and sheep, in any system we tested (e.g. Western blot; see Author response images 2 and 3) and the antibody failed to recognise Ex.

Shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig5">Author response image 5</xref> are the results of this analysis, where Ex<sup>1-468</sup> was coexpressed with either WT or mutant Crb<sup>intra</sup> and the lysates were assessed by Phos-tag gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot analysis.</p><p>Co-expression of Ex<sup>1-468</sup> with Crb<sup>intra</sup> WT, but not DFBM, resulted in a shift in Ex mobility in Phos-tag gels, consistent with our previous results on standard PAGE gels. Our analysis of the Ex mutants confirmed our previous observations regarding their effect on the stability of Ex and their ability to interact with Slmb/b-TrCP. We have previously shown that S453 is crucial for Slmb/b-TrCP recognition and Ex degradation. When S453A is mutated, Ex fails to bind to Slmb/b-TrCP and is therefore more stable. We had previously observed that S453A mutation does not abrogate the Ex mobility shift and this is confirmed with the Phos-tag analysis. Ex<sup>1-468</sup> is still shifted and it is significantly more stable. Interestingly, unmodified Ex S453A is also seen in the Phos-tag gel, perhaps indicating that, indeed, this residue is phosphorylated in response to expression of Crb. However, it is clear that even if that is the case, it is not the only phosphorylation event triggered by Crb expression.</p><p>The other mutations tested (S457A and S462A) behaved very similarly to WT Ex, showing only a slight increase in Ex stability. In the case of S457A, the Ex detected is nearly completely modified, suggesting that this residue may not be phosphorylated in response to Crb expression. In the case of S462A, we could detect some unmodified Ex, again perhaps suggesting that it may be phosphorylated but, like S453, it is not the only residue involved. What is clear from the modest band shifts we observed is that Phos-tag gels do not allow us to readily separate different individual phosphorylated species of Ex any better than standard PAGE gels. Therefore, given the fact that the sequence surrounding the Slmb/b-TrCP consensus site is extremely rich in Ser and Thr residues, this approach is very unlikely to allow us to identify the (potentially multiple) CKI phosphorylation sites.</p><fig id="respfig5"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>Evaluation of Ex electrophoretic mobility shift using Phos-tag gels.</title><p>S2 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids 48h prior to lysis.

They should detect endogenous Ex expression and degradation. For example, CHX treatment could be used to avoid gish-mediated transcriptional regulation of endogenous Ex expression.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we attempted to monitor the levels of endogenous Ex in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells. However, we found that the Ex antibody was not sufficiently specific (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>) and, unfortunately, this precludes the analysis suggested by the reviewer. As shown in vivo and mentioned by the reviewer, the use of endogenous Ex is complicated by transcriptional feedback, making the use of CHX, which has pleiotropic effects on many signalling pathways, necessary. We therefore believe that use of exogenous Ex allows us to dissect Ex stability in a cleaner experimental setup.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Although the biochemistry assays have shown that CKI kinase Gish is required for Crb-mediated Ex turnover, the genetic epistasis between Crb and CkIα in controlling Yki activation and organ growth is still needed to be tested. I would suggest the authors perform the following experiments &quot;hh&gt; Crbintra vs. hh&gt;Crbintra + CkIαRNAi&quot;, then compare the Yki reporter induction (e.g. Diap1-LacZ) and P-compartment size.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewer, we examined the effect of CkIα depletion on the Crb<sup>intra</sup> phenotype (overgrowth and Yki activity using <italic>ex-lacZ</italic>) in the posterior compartment of the wing disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig6">Author response image 6</xref>). We observed that, consistent with our model, both the overgrowth phenotype and the <italic>ex-lacZ</italic> increase elicited by Crb<sup>intra</sup> expression are suppressed by CkIα depletion. However, the discs combining Crb<sup>intra</sup> and CkIα depletion appear heavily disrupted and, therefore, we want to be cautious about the interpretation of this experiment. In particular, it is possible that the suppressed growth is due to toxicity of combining Crb<sup>intra</sup> with CkIα depletion rather than specifically lowering Yki activity. Nevertheless, we are happy to include the data as supplementary material if required by the reviewer.</p><fig id="respfig6"><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption><title><italic>ckIα<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> partially reverts Crb<sup>intra</sup>-induced upregulation of Yki target genes and overgrowth.</title><p>(A-E) <italic>ckIα<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> partially reverts Crb<sup>intra</sup>-induced upregulation of the Yki activity reporter <italic>ex-lacZ</italic>.
