Temperature is one major cue controlling flowering time, particularly before the winter but also during spring when ambient cool temperatures generally delay and warm temperatures promote flowering. Different molecular pathways controlling flowering in different temperature ranges and environments have been genetically dissected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Capovilla et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Verhage et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In many plant species and in many accessions of the plant model species <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Arabidopsis), the well-studied vernalization pathway prevents premature flowering before the long cold periods of the winter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Song et al., 2012</xref>). In Arabidopsis, flowering of winter-annual accessions without vernalization is strongly delayed by the MADS-box transcription factor <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS C</italic> (<italic>FLC</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Song et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Michaels and Amasino, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johanson et al., 2000</xref>). FLC forms a repressor complex through interactions with the MADS-box transcription factor SVP (SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE) to repress the transcription of the flowering promoting genes <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS T</italic> (<italic>FT</italic>) and <italic>SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO1</italic> (<italic>SOC1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2007</xref>). As a result of the prolonged exposure to cold temperatures during winter, <italic>FLC</italic> abundance is gradually reduced, predominantly through epigenetic mechanisms, and flowering repression is gradually relieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Song et al., 2012</xref>). Substantial natural variation in the vernalization-dependent expression of <italic>FLC</italic> has already been described and characterized in many Arabidopsis accessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coustham et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>During spring, ambient temperature is an important climatic factor. Temperature changes by only a few degree Celsius (°C) during cold or warm spring periods shift flowering time in many plant species. Since temperature changes associated with global warming could lead to similar flowering changes and threaten agricultural production systems, elucidating the ambient temperature pathway has recently received increased attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moore and Lobell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wheeler and von Braun, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jagadish et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The complexities of the ambient temperature flowering pathway are just beginning to be understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Capovilla et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Verhage et al., 2014</xref>). After vernalization or in vernalization-insensitive accessions, flowering in ambient temperatures is largely under control of the <italic>FLC</italic>-related <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS M</italic> (<italic>FLM</italic>) and residual <italic>FLC</italic> retains only a minor role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balasubramanian et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blázquez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>FLM</italic> controls flowering in the range between 5°C and 23°C and FLM can form, just like FLC, a flowering repressive complex with SVP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Posé et al., 2013</xref>). Besides <italic>FLM,</italic> as the dominant regulator, ambient temperature flowering is also regulated by the <italic>FLM</italic>-homologs <italic>MAF2 - MAF4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ratcliffe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Airoldi et al., 2015</xref>). Conversely, loss-of-function mutations of <italic>SVP</italic> lead to early and temperature-insensitive flowering in the range between 5°C and 27°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2013</xref>).</p><p>Within the ambient temperature range, <italic>FLM</italic> is differentially spliced in a temperature-dependent manner through the alternative use of the exons 2 (<italic>FLM-ß</italic>) and 3 (<italic>FLM-δ</italic>). Based on transgenic experiments, a model was proposed according to which FLM-ß and FLM-δ function antagonistically with SVP. Accordingly, FLM-ß engages in flowering repressive interactions with SVP in cooler temperatures. Conversely, FLM-δ would outcompete FLM-ß in warmer temperatures and form heterodimers with SVP unable to bind DNA and repress flowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Posé et al., 2013</xref>). Recent data suggest that this attractive model, based solely on transgenic experiments, may not be valid in natural contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sureshkumar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lutz et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>As yet, it has remained largely unknown whether genetic variation of the <italic>FLM</italic> gene locus plays a role in flowering time regulation across Arabidopsis accessions and if so, which variations determine basal and temperature-dependent <italic>FLM</italic> expression and splicing. Although two <italic>FLM</italic> deletion alleles conferring temperature-insensitive early flowering were identified in the Arabidopsis accessions Niederzenz-1 (Nd-1) and Eifel-6 (Ei-6), their limited demographic and genetic spread indicated that <italic>FLM</italic> deletions may be disadvantageous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Werner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balasubramanian and Weigel, 2006</xref>). A first <italic>FLM</italic> expression variant was determined from the early flowering accession Killian-0 (Kil-0). In Kil-0, a LINE retrotransposon insertion in <italic>FLM</italic> intron 1 caused premature transcription termination, aberrant <italic>FLM</italic> splicing, consequently reduced <italic>FLM</italic> expression and earlier flowering. This phenotype was especially prominent at a temperature of 15°C , which is closer to the average temperature in the native range of the species than the commonly used 21°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lutz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoffmann, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Weigel, 2012</xref>). The subsequent identification of nine further accessions with an identical LINE insertion was suggestive for a recent adaptive selective sweep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lutz et al., 2015</xref>). It was thus concluded that <italic>FLM</italic> expression-modulating alleles are advantageous for flowering time adaptation in the ambient temperature range, particularly since there are no other pleiotropic growth changes observed in <italic>FLM</italic> mutant alleles.</p><p>Previous work had shown that an intronless <italic>FLM</italic> cDNA expressed from a <italic>FLM</italic> promoter fragment was unable to rescue the <italic>flm</italic> mutant phenotype. Since this suggested that important information for <italic>FLM</italic> expression may reside in <italic>FLM</italic> non-coding sequences, we examined non-coding sequence polymorphisms with a potential role in controlling <italic>FLM</italic> expression and splicing. Using phylogenetic footprinting, we found conserved <italic>FLM</italic> promoter and intron 1 regions essential for <italic>FLM</italic> expression. By association analysis using polymorphism data from ≈800 Arabidopsis accessions, we identified a small polymorphic region in the <italic>FLM</italic> promoter and a highly polymorphic nucleotide triplet in <italic>FLM</italic> intron 6 controlling basal and temperature-dependent <italic>FLM</italic> expression. Small changes in the relative abundance of the <italic>FLM-ß</italic> splice variant dynamically modulated flowering at 15°C over a range of 15 leaves. When tested in a homogenous genetic background, <italic>FLM</italic> abundance correlated almost perfectly with flowering time (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.94) and contributed (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.21) to flowering time variation in heterogeneous natural Arabidopsis populations. Our data suggest that <italic>FLM-ß</italic> is an important determinant of flowering during cool or warm spring periods.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Intronic sequences are required for basal and temperature-sensitive <italic>FLM</italic> expression</title><p>Temperature-dependent changes in <italic>FLM</italic> abundance and alternative splicing are critical for flowering time control in ambient temperatures in Arabidopsis. How <italic>FLM</italic> expression is regulated and whether Arabidopsis accessions have employed differential <italic>FLM</italic> expression and splicing to adapt to different temperature climates remained to be shown. We previously found that Arabidopsis transgenic lines expressing an intronless <italic>FLM</italic> from a functional <italic>FLM</italic> promoter fragment cannot express <italic>FLM</italic> to detectable levels and fail to rescue the flowering time phenotype of a <italic>flm-3</italic> loss-of-function mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lutz et al., 2015</xref>). We subsequently compared <italic>FLM</italic> expression in transgenic lines expressing a genomic <italic>FLM</italic> fragment, obtained from the Columbia-0 (Col-0) wild type, containing all six introns (pFLM::gFLM; FLM<sup>Col-0</sup>) with lines expressing the <italic>FLM-ß</italic> (pFLM::FLM-ß) or <italic>FLM-δ</italic> (pFLM::FLM-δ) splice variants retaining intron 1 but lacking all other introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The presence of intron 1 was sufficient to restore the basal expression of <italic>FLM</italic> at the ambient temperatures 15°C, 21°C, and 27°C, but introns 2–6 were required for the temperature-sensitive regulation of the splice variants <italic>FLM-ß</italic> and <italic>FLM-δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We concluded that intron 1 may contain critical information for <italic>FLM</italic> expression and introns 2–6 may contribute to temperature-dependent <italic>FLM</italic> expression.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22114.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>FLM</italic> intronic sequences determine basal and temperature-dependent <italic>FLM</italic> expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the pFLM::gFLM (FLM<sup>Col-0</sup>), pFLM::FLM-ß, and pFLM::FLM-δ constructs.

The <italic>FLM</italic> locus explains flowering time variation in different ambient temperatures but the underlying genetic bases of <italic>FLM</italic>-dependent flowering remained largely unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Salomé et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">el-Lithy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O'Neill et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>We found that, besides the <italic>FLM</italic> promoter, also intron 1 sequences were essential for <italic>FLM</italic> basal expression and subsequently identified by phylogenomic footprinting a conserved 373 bp intron 1 region essential for <italic>FLM</italic> basal expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Further, through association analyses using genomic sequence information, we uncovered <italic>FLM</italic> regulatory regions (PRO2+ and INT6+) that control temperature-dependent <italic>FLM</italic> expression in a haplotype-specific manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). While most PRO2+ and INT6+ haplotypes displayed differential basal but temperature-sensitive <italic>FLM</italic> expression, correlating strongly with changes in flowering time, one INT6+ variant, INT6+<sup>CAA</sup>, was strongly compromised in temperature-sensitive <italic>FLM</italic> regulation and flowering pointing at the importance of this intronic region for flowering time adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>).</p><p>In all our experiments, <italic>FLM-ß</italic> highly correlated (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.94) with flowering time over a broad vegetative range (15–30 rosette leaves) when determined at 15°C and tested in a homozygous background, regardless of the type of variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Our finding that <italic>FLM-ß</italic> had a stronger effect in the control of flowering time than <italic>FLM-δ</italic> indicates that previously phrased functional models proposing that FLM-δ had an antagonistic activity to FLM-ß need to be corrected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Posé et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sureshkumar et al., 2016</xref>). This is further supported by the fact that our results estimate that <italic>FLM-δ</italic> levels are overall very low and that we did not identify a single <italic>FLM-δ</italic> clone in a directed sequencing approach that identified 53 <italic>FLM-ß</italic> clones. Our findings thus support more recent studies suggesting that the <italic>FLM-δ</italic> splice variant may be biologically irrelevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sureshkumar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lutz et al., 2015</xref>). One of these studies also identified a large number of biologically irrelevant transcripts that could be identified with the primer combination used here for the detection of <italic>FLM-δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sureshkumar et al., 2016</xref>). Our data thus support the conclusion that none of these amplification products has a biologically important function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sureshkumar et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Whereas the PRO2+ and INT6+ polymorphisms tested affected <italic>FLM</italic> transcript abundance, the molecular causes of these transcription changes varied among the different polymorphisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Deletion of a 225 bp promoter region including the PRO2+ polymorphic site was associated with tenfold reduced levels of <italic>FLM</italic> pre-mRNA indicating that this promoter region was essential for <italic>FLM</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). A twofold relative difference of <italic>FLM-ß</italic> levels was found when comparing the PRO2+<sup>GATAC</sup> and PRO2+<sup>AAACC</sup> variants with the lowest and highest <italic>FLM-ß</italic> expression, respectively, and our linear model would predict a flowering time difference of 14.4 leaves at 15°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). The PRO2+ region harbours a predicted MADS-box transcription factor binding site and several instances of auto- or cross-regulation of MADS-box factors have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Folter et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaufmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Smaczniak et al., 2012</xref>). It can therefore be envisioned that <italic>FLM</italic> expression is regulated by MADS-box transcription factors and that PRO2+ polymorphisms modulate the efficiency or specificity of these binding events and thereby modulate basal <italic>FLM</italic> expression.</p><p>Similarly, the deletion of a 373 bp fragment in <italic>FLM</italic> intron 1 resulted in an elevenfold reduction in <italic>FLM</italic> expression and earlier flowering by 11.5 leaves as experimentally determined. This effect size is much smaller than predicted by the linear model. However, as proposed earlier, this may likely be due to a critical lower threshold for <italic>FLM-ß</italic> to become effective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Intronic <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory transcription factor binding sites have been identified in other MADS-box transcription factors and interactions of enhancer and silencer elements that reside in the promoter sequence or the 3’-end of the first intron were reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hong et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schauer et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, similar mechanisms may govern the expression of <italic>FLM</italic> at intron 1 sites that may act in isolation or together with binding events at the <italic>FLM</italic> promoter.</p><p>Interestingly, natural polymorphisms in intron 6 (INT6+) led to about fourfold differences in the abundance of <italic>FLM-ß</italic>, which could, as predicted by the linear model, relate to a flowering time delay by 28.8 leaves, suggesting that INT6+ harbours extensive potential to fine-tune flowering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Importantly, this molecular effect appears to be mediated, in the case of INT6+<sup>CAA</sup>, by effects on the splicing efficiency and specificity at the distal intron 1. There, INT6+<sup>CAA</sup> promotes the formation of short intron 1-containing transcripts, at the expense of <italic>FLM-ß</italic>, that are likely subjected for degradation by nonsense-mediated decay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lutz et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The INT6+ site is directly flanked by a short PolyA motif and such sites represent potential recognition sites of hnRNP (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein) splicing factors. The predicted hnRNP binding pattern at INT6+ depended indeed on the INT6+ haplotype, when predicted by web-based algorithms, and their binding preference and activity, in concert with other splicing or transcriptional regulators, may ultimately be the basis of the splicing changes observed here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Piva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carrillo Oesterreich et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reddy et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The cooccurrence of PolyA motifs ([A]<sub>7-11</sub>) with the PRO2+ and the INT6+ sites had attracted our attention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Combinatorial deletions of all six <italic>FLM</italic> PolyA motifs led to gradual decreases in <italic>FLM-ß</italic> abundance, which could be explained be altered intron 1 splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This ultimately resulted in <italic>FLM-ß</italic> levels below a lower effective threshold in the PolyA_6xΔ lines and consequently very early flowering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggested that the PolyA motifs may modulate <italic>FLM</italic> expression by altering <italic>FLM</italic> splicing. In support of this conclusion, we found that an extended PolyA motif, as it is present in the INT6+<sup>AAA</sup> variant when compared to the Col-0 reference variant INT6+<sup>AAT</sup>, correlated with strong increases in <italic>FLM-ß</italic> but not in <italic>FLM-δ</italic> abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). PolyA motifs are known to prevent nucleosome binding and changes of chromatin architecture may influence splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reddy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Suter et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wijnker et al., 2013</xref>). The knowledge about the underlying molecular mechanisms and the identity and specificity of the splicing regulators in plants is still very limited. We noted with interest, however, that several hnRNPs have a reported role in flowering time regulation in Arabidopsis and wheat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kippes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fusaro et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Streitner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xiao et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The nine PRO2+/INT6+ haplotype combinations included in our transgenic experiments represent 69% of the world-wide PRO2+/INT6+ variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). We found, that <italic>FLM-ß</italic> explained around 21% of flowering time in a genetically heterogeneous population of summer-annual Arabidopsis accessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Hence, PRO2+ and INT6+ haplotypes regulate <italic>FLM-ß</italic> abundance and, in turn, contribute to flowering time regulation in Arabidopsis accessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). We consider it not surprising that the correlation of flowering time with <italic>FLM-ß</italic> levels (21% versus 94%) as well as the responsiveness of flowering time to <italic>FLM-ß</italic> levels differ between a genetically heterogeneous natural population and the homogenous transgenic population. First, we showed that residual <italic>FLC</italic> transcript may also slightly contribute to variation of flowering time of summer-annual accessions, possibly interfering with the effects of <italic>FLM-ß</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balasubramanian et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2006</xref>). Further, additional sequence variation in <italic>FLM</italic> in natural accessions may contribute to relevant expression changes, e.g. in the part of intron 1 identified as essential for <italic>FLM</italic> expression but not analysed in further detail here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Then, it is possible that these accessions harbour variation in the <italic>FLM</italic>-related <italic>MAF2 - 4</italic>, and this variation may differentially affect flowering time, in isolation or in combination with variation of their common interaction partner <italic>SVP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ratcliffe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Airoldi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scortecci et al., 2003</xref>). Bearing these possible genetic and environmental interferences in mind, we regard the detected effect of <italic>FLM-ß</italic> on flowering (21%) in cool (15°C) temperatures as considerable and suggest that it is rather an underestimation.</p><p>We found a uniform distribution of nine PRO2+/INT6+ haplotype combinations among the genetic clusters that have recently been established based on the analysis of genomic sequences from 1135 Arabidopsis accessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">The 1001 Genomes Consortium, 2016</xref>). Interestingly, the PRO2+<sup>GGAAC</sup>/INT6+<sup>AAT</sup> haplotype was overrepresented among the relict accessions and the PRO2+<sup>AAAAC</sup>/INT6+<sup>AAA</sup> haplotype was overrepresented among the Asian group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">The 1001 Genomes Consortium, 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). In our experiments, both of these haplotypes were associated with increased <italic>FLM-ß</italic> transcript levels and consequently late flowering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Since the relict and Asian accessions have been proposed to originate from glacial refugia from where central Europe was recolonized after the last ice age, these late-flowering PRO2+/INT6+ haplotypes may represent original haplotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sharbel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schmid et al., 2006</xref>). The late flowering phenotype associated with these haplotypes would be in line with the hypothesis that late flowering alleles are more ancient and that early flowering alleles were derived only during the more recent Arabidopsis evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Toomajian et al., 2006</xref>). Further, genetic linkage among the PRO2+ and INT6+ polymorphic sites was overall low (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.11–0.55) and the sequences surrounding PRO2+ and INT6+ were comparatively conserved. Taken together, this suggests that mutations in the PRO2+ and INT6+ sites independently arose multiple times and that these sites were preferentially selected during Arabidopsis flowering adaptation. All PRO2+/INT6+ alleles displayed a broad geographic distribution, except PRO2+<sup>GGAAC</sup>/INT6+<sup>AAT</sup>, which was overrepresented in Spain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Likely, microclimates at specific geographic locations rather than general climate conditions at broad geographic regions may be important to drive adaptation of flowering to changing ambient temperature, as it was previously suggested for broadly distributed non-coding haplotypes of <italic>FLC</italic> that explain variation in vernalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Weigel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shindo et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Mutations in cis-regulatory regions are important for adaptation and phenotypic evolution and have a low probability to generate negative pleiotropic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Swinnen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meyer and Purugganan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wray, 2007</xref>). <italic>FLM</italic> may be an ideal candidate for flowering time adaptation through non-coding sequence variation at PRO2+ and INT6+ sites since changes in <italic>FLM-ß</italic> abundance precisely modulate flowering while maintaining phenotypic plasticity and without generating negative pleiotropic effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Changes at the PRO2+ and INT6+ sites should allow adapting flowering time in response to altered geographic distribution and consequently climate conditions as well as during changing global environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The role of <italic>FLM</italic> orthologues in other <italic>Brassicaceae</italic>, including a number of agronomically important species, is as yet not understood. It is thus at present not possible to predict the role of Arabidopsis <italic>FLM</italic> polymorphisms for flowering time adaptation and plant breeding in this plant family. However, in view of the availability of new genome editing methodologies, the knowledge about important non-coding regions may be useful to fine-tune flowering time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shan et al., 2013</xref>). This may allow buffering the anticipated negative effects on agricultural systems that occur as a consequence of small temperature changes during climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moore and Lobell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wheeler and von Braun, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Biological material</title><p>All <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> accessions used in this study as well as <italic>flm-3</italic> (Salk_141971; Col-0) and Nd-1 (N1636) were provided by the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC; Nottingham, UK). <italic>flc-3</italic> and <italic>FRI<sup>SF-2</sup> FLC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Michaels and Amasino, 1999</xref>) were a gift from Franziska Turck and George Coupland (Max-Planck Institute of Plant Breeding Research, Cologne, Germany). pFLM::gFLM (pDP34), pFLM::FLM-ß (pDP96), and pFLM::FLM-δ (pDP97) were previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Posé et al., 2013</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Ian Baldwin (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Dan Runcie (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript describes an interesting illustration of how to utilize genome wide association in combination with a variety of genomic tools and thoughts to begin to improve the model of how FLM integrates temperature into the flowering time decision.</p><p>There are four key concerns that need to be addressed prior to any final decision.</p><p>1) The FLM expression to flowering correlation is not sufficient. The exclusion of multiple accessions was considered not justified. A multiple regression approach with FLC expression included in the model is a way that may account for this and would be a more correct statistical test of the hypothesis.</p><p>2) There are other significant statistical concerns that may affect the core claims from the manuscript such as temperature sensitivity, etc. These must be corrected and the claims either supported or changed pending the results.</p><p>3) The role of vernalization in FLM expression and variation thereof needs to be assessed to allow for the data to be properly integrated into the broader model. Given that the integration into the broader model is the critical interest in this paper.</p><p>4) There was concern about including FLMd if it is not found in the measurements? This should be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please also address the following concerns that will improve the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors present a detailed search for the genetic basis of variation in ambient temperature sensitivity for flowering time in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Focusing specifically on the control of the expression of FLM which has been previously linked to temperature sensitivity, the authors draw on a range of modern and innovative tools to pinpoint alleles conferring variation FLM expression within the species. They identify the major alleles controlling both basal expression and temperature sensitivity of FLM segregating at high frequency in the species and confirm effects of these alleles using transgenics. Overall, this study is important in its demonstration of how modern tools in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> can be used to rapidly identify the specific base-pairs underlying natural variation in important traits. While I think that the major conclusions seem robust and well-supported, this is a very complicated paper and I do have concerns about specific analyses and interpretations.</p><p>1) My main concern is with the central focus on the comparison between two isoforms of FLM (FLMb and FLMd). A recent study showed that the qPCR assays targeting these isoforms actually pick up other isoforms, many of which produce truncated proteins (Sureshkumar et al. 2016 Nature Plants). Here, the authors note that they can't even find a true FLMd transcript (out of 163 tested). It is not clear what if any conclusions can be drawn from the FLMd assay, and so devoting so much space throughout the article and figures to FLMd is not useful and distracting. On the other hand, this and earlier studies the FLMb assay does seem to be useful for assaying FLM activity, so I am comfortable with these results.</p><p>2) Secondly, I am concerned with the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> – the correlations between FLM expression in accessions and a) expression in constructs and b) flowering times of the accessions. In order to find a correlation between FLM expression in accessions and in the transgenic lines with the corresponding constructs, the authors dropped an &quot;outlier&quot; point (1 each for FLMb and FLMd). No justification for this is given beyond the point not fitting expectations. It's not clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> that these points are really more outliers than any others. And, it's not that this is really a single point – on the y-axis this is the average expression of ~10 accessions, so why should they all be dropped?</p><p>3) For the flowering time comparison, the lines were vernalized. However, FLM is known to be repressed by vernalization (as the authors note), so how could it be affecting flowering, and might there be variation among lines in how FLM responds to the vernalization? It seems more likely that other loci that are correlated with FLM are controlling flowering time here. The authors should either measure FLM expression in these vernalized plants and correlate that with flowering, or repeat the experiment without vernalization where FLM and FLC expression in these lines has already been measured. A better way to control for FLC variation would be to statistically account for its effects with multiple regression.</p><p>4) Finally, on the statistical side, the conclusions about &quot;temperature insensitivity&quot; for INT6+ alleles are not backed by statistics – the authors should explicitly test for a change in the temperature sensitivity between FLM-Col0 and INT6+. From the graphs, it appears temperature sensitivity is reduced, but certainly not eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In “Natural haplotypes of FLM non-coding sequences fine-tune flowering time in ambient spring temperatures in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>&quot; Lutz et al. address the biological relevance of FLM splice variants for variation in flowering time in natural accessions and identify non-coding sequence polymorphisms that contribute to the regulation of basal expression levels and the differential, thermo-responsive generation of the β and δ splice variants. As such, this work provides novel insights into the regulation of flowering in the ambient temperature range and manages to dissect polymorphisms which are relevant for basal FLM expression and temperature-induced effects on the β and δ splice variants.</p><p>The manuscript is overall very well written and the authors provide extensive data which has apparently been subjected to comprehensive and sound statistical analyses. The data is presented in an attractive manner. Main manuscript figures are supported by extensive supplementary material including the presentation of extensive control data, which is greatly appreciated. In some cases the figure descriptions or legends should be extended. Due to the vast amount of data condensed in the figures, the descriptions (at least in the text) should be detailed enough for a wide readership to follow the authors through their argumentation.</p><p>1) The authors state that “The presence of intron 1 is sufficient to restore the basal expression of FLM” – while it does restore expression levels to detectable levels, the expression level of the β splice variant at 15°C is considerably lower than the WT, whereas the FLMδ levels are similar the WT at this temperature. This would indicate that intron 1 alone cannot fully account for basal levels of FLM β.</p><p>2) The use of pools of independent segregating T2 lines for transcriptional analysis seems unusual. While the controls presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> suggest that this can recapitulate the “natural” situation (why not subjected to statistical analysis?), it seems nonetheless risky to deliberately tolerate the presence of non-transgenics in the mix. Could the authors state their reasoning for this unusual procedure and provide the missing statistics here? Also, the phrase “replicate pools compromising…” should probably read “comprising”.</p><p>3) I had a hard time to comprehensively grasp the information provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, especially when it comes to the color code and its use in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> provides additional information, but still the color coding of haplotypes which is provided for three different regions (full length, intron 1 or intron 6) is confusing as the composition of the different haplotypes varies depending on the selected gene region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>—figure supplement.1G). The authors may want to better explain these figures to enable a wide readership to follow their analysis and key points here. Also, in the caption of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref> the haplotype “Numbers on the left” probably refer to (D) not (E)?</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>: Please specify again in the figure caption that this data corresponds to 40 selected accessions. Why was the FLM β level not determined in the vernalized plants?

While this may be an attractive assumption, it negates the fact that each line pool may represent its individual set of variances (also present in ND-1 itself). This would at least require a spot check for the presence of transgenes in this pool or the percentage of “clean” Nd-1 individuals. In principle, a simple test by PCR would have provided a solid answer to that. As is, the authors should include these lines in the correlation analysis as the factual genotype is not known.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Natural haplotypes of FLM non-coding sequences fine-tune flowering time in ambient spring temperatures in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

All felt that this is necessary.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>I thank the authors for their improvements to the paper – the figures especially are more clear now. I still have the following concerns about the overall conclusions and analysis. These relate to three important conclusions:</p><p>1) That FLM variation contributes to flowering time variation across a diverse panel of summer annual accessions.</p><p>The new experiment to test this is very helpful, and does provide good evidence that FLMB expression level is important for flowering time variation. My concern is with interpretation: The authors provide several explanations for why the correlation between flowering and FLMB expression in this accession set is lower than in the transgenics. This is trivial because there is much more variation within each haplotype class in the accessions than the transgenics, because they vary at many loci across the genome. I think the real question should be: Is the slope of the relationship between FLMB and flowering time significantly less in the accessions? This would ask if the equivalent change in FLMB expression would cause the same change in flowering. This is a more meaningful metric than change in R2. The correct test would be to include both accessions and transgenics in the same model (flowering_time ~ FLMB * genotype_class), and ask if the interaction is significant.</p><p>2) That the 9 promoter haplotypes explain the variation in FLMB expression in the accessions.</p><p>This is the aim of the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D/E</xref>. The main claim is that the expression variation induced by these haplotypes in the transgenics is correlated with the expression variation of accessions carrying the same haplotypes. This conclusion only holds when one of the 9 haplotypes is excluded. The explanation given for excluding this haplotype is that the correlation goes up after removing this. I did a quick simulation study and found that using this algorithm you'd expect that the best correlation found by dropping each of the 9 pairs would be greater than 46% about 21% of the time even if there were actually no correlation at all. So, this is really not very strong evidence that the haplotype effects are similar. Certainly, the statement &quot;We found that the PRO2+/INT6+ effects, as detected in transgenic experiments (R2 = 0.94), partially explain the FLM-ß expression variation in natural <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions (R2 = 0.46)&quot; is not supported, because this 46% number is only true when you exclude those accessions that don't fit.</p><p>As above, I think a more appropriate analysis would be to ask if the sizes of the differences between the haplotypes is the same in the transgenics and the accessions (i.e., is the slope of the graph different from 1?). A more straightforward answer to the question of how much variation in FLMB is explained by these haplotypes is simply to report the R2 for the analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D</xref>.</p><p>3) That the INT6+(CAA) haplotype controls temperature sensitivity.</p><p>This conclusion is important because of the model that FLM controls temperature sensitivity of flowering. New data are presented here relative to the previous version, though where they came from is not clear. The correct test for a change in temperature sensitivity is to ask if the interaction between genotype and temperature is significant (expression ~ Genotype + Temp + Genotype:Temp). The n.s. effect of temperature on expression for INT6+ is not evidence of no temperature effect, only a lack of evidence for a temperature effect. The figure caption states the statistics are done based on a t-test. A t-test can't be used to test for an interaction (except in 6C/D if the 5 transgenic lines per genotype were used as the replicates, n = 5). An ANOVA is needed to conclude that this haplotype affects temperature sensitivity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The authors have generally met my major concerns and provide additional data as well as detailed explanations for the changes in the manuscript.</p><p>Remaining concerns:</p><p>1) The authors have clarified that the major concerns about the exclusion of accessions from the correlation of FLM expression and flowering time was largely based on a misunderstanding of the method and intention of the analysis. The changes to the text makes this much more clear now. The exclusion of the “exceptional&quot; haplotypes raises the correlation from 0.13 to 0.46 in a linear regression analysis.

Focusing specifically on the control of the expression of FLM which has been previously linked to temperature sensitivity, the authors draw on a range of modern and innovative tools to pinpoint alleles conferring variation FLM expression within the species. They identify the major alleles controlling both basal expression and temperature sensitivity of FLM segregating at high frequency in the species and confirm effects of these alleles using transgenics. Overall, this study is important in its demonstration of how modern tools in Arabidopsis can be used to rapidly identify the specific base-pairs underlying natural variation in important traits. While I think that the major conclusions seem robust and well-supported, this is a very complicated paper and I do have concerns about specific analyses and interpretations.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) My main concern is with the central focus on the comparison between two isoforms of FLM (FLMb and FLMd). A recent study showed that the qPCR assays targeting these isoforms actually pick up other isoforms, many of which produce truncated proteins (Sureshkumar et al. 2016 Nature Plants). Here, the authors note that they can't even find a true FLMd transcript (out of 163 tested). It is not clear what if any conclusions can be drawn from the FLMd assay, and so devoting so much space throughout the article and figures to FLMd is not useful and distracting. On the other hand, this and earlier studies the FLMb assay does seem to be useful for assaying FLM activity, so I am comfortable with these results.</italic> </p><p>The major concept of our study had been to elucidate regulatory regions of FLM transcription and this also included analysis of FLMd. Rejecting the importance of FLMd was not a prerequisite but an important result of the study. It is true that the finding that FLMd may not have a function in flowering time control had already been a conclusion from our earlier work (Lutz et al., 2015). On the other side, the two papers that led to the original model, which now has to be considered invalid, were published very prominently (Nature, Science), reached a very large readership and are still frequently discussed and cited, e.g. in a very recent review (Deng and Cao, 2016, Current Opinion in Plant Biology). We therefore also felt that it may be used as an argument against our current data analysis and manuscript if we ignored FLMd.</p><p>We also felt that the two recent studies that put the model that attributed a functional role to FLMd into question (Lutz et al., 2015; Sureshkumar et al.,2016) did not yet convincingly proof that any regulatory role for FLMd could be completely rejected. We therefore included FLMd in the present study to test a putative regulatory role of FLMd with our new genetic materials and testing FLM expression in different environmental conditions. We had discussed internally and before submission of the original manuscript whether it was possible to reduce the data load by omitting FLMd data but came to the conclusion that this would weaken the significance of the data set. We have now reexamined this point and made the following changes to reduce the FLMd data load:</p><p>We have moved the FLMd data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement1D</xref>. We removed the FLMd data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1E/F</xref> and the respective section in the text since, at this point, the conclusion that FLMd was not important had already been phrased.</p><p>That the primers used to detect FLMd may also amplify other minor isoforms was published comparatively late during our analysis (Sureshkumar et al., 2016). We agree that this issue needs to be addressed in the manuscript and discuss this point briefly in the Discussion:</p><p>“Our findings thus support more recent studies suggesting that the <italic>FLM-δ</italic> splice variant may be biologically irrelevant {Lutz, 2015 #118;Sureshkumar, 2016 #96}. One of these studies also identified a large number of biologically irrelevant transcripts that could be identified with the primer combination used here for the detection of <italic>FLM-δ</italic> {Sureshkumar, 2016 #96}. Our data thus support the conclusion that none of these amplification products has a biologically important function {Sureshkumar, 2016 #96}.&quot;</p><p>We have also modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and now show the position of the primers and specify in the graphs, which primer combinations had been used for the respective amplification product.</p><p><italic>2) Secondly, I am concerned with the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> – the correlations between FLM expression in accessions and a) expression in constructs and b) flowering times of the accessions. In order to find a correlation between FLM expression in accessions and in the transgenic lines with the corresponding constructs, the authors dropped an &quot;outlier&quot; point (1 each for FLMb and FLMd). No justification for this is given beyond the point not fitting expectations. It's not clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> that these points are really more outliers than any others. And, it's not that this is really a single point – on the y-axis this is the average expression of ~10 accessions, so why should they all be dropped?</italic> </p><p>We apologize for having used the term “outlier” in an apparently misleading manner. In this analysis, we asked whether one of the nine haplotype groups influenced FLMb levels in a different manner from the others. We thereby examined whether it had a kind of outlying regulatory role. For this purpose, we performed the analysis by excluding, one by one, each of the nine haplotypes and calculated R<sup>2</sup>. None of these exclusions substantially changed R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">2</xref></sup> except when PRO2+<sup>AAAAC</sup>/INT6+<sup>CAA</sup> was excluded. When this haplotype was excluded R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">2</xref></sup> increased from 0.13 to 0.46 indicating that this haplotype substantially and negatively influenced our analysis. Herein, our aim had not been to force the linear model to fit our expectations but to identify a PRO2+/INT6+ haplotype, which possesses a differential effect when tested in transgenic lines when compared to accessions. We have now clarified the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, removed the term outlier, and improved the description of the findings in the text. We also removed the correlation analysis of FLMd from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>Legend 8A:</p><p><bold>“</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. <italic>FLM-ß</italic> expression shows high correlation with flowering time in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions.

However, FLM is known to be repressed by vernalization (as the authors note), so how could it be affecting flowering, and might there be variation among lines in how FLM responds to the vernalization? It seems more likely that other loci that are correlated with FLM are controlling flowering time here. The authors should either measure FLM expression in these vernalized plants and correlate that with flowering, or repeat the experiment without vernalization where FLM and FLC expression in these lines has already been measured. A better way to control for FLC variation would be to statistically account for its effects with multiple regression.</italic> </p><p>We have extracted from the literature that the role of vernalization on FLM expression is rather unclear. Ratcliffe et al. (2001, Plant Phys.) observed decreased <italic>FLM</italic> levels after six to eight weeks of vernalization, even though <italic>FLM</italic> seems not to be as strongly repressed by vernalization as <italic>FLC</italic>. Scortecci et al. (2001, Plant Journal) did not find an effect on <italic>FLM</italic> transcript abundance after 30 days of vernalization. However, this observation was revisited in Sung et al. (2006, Genes and Development), who showed that <italic>FLM</italic> is repressed by vernalization through epigenetic mechanisms. Finally, Lee et al. (2013, Science) did not observe any effect of vernalization on <italic>FLM</italic> abundance whereby no information on the duration of the vernalization treatment was provided. Even though a repressive effect of vernalization on <italic>FLM</italic> abundance seems to be the consensus we suppose that the effect of vernalization on <italic>FLM</italic> abundance needs much more detailed investigation. Especially the duration of vernalization may be a critical factor. We had summarized this literature and findings in our original manuscript. Since we now present an improved analysis based on improved experimental design as described below, we have deleted the respective sections since they were no longer relevant.</p><p>Regarding the improved experiment as suggested by the reviewer, we considered it not insightful to conduct an experiment with vernalized plants (and including winter annuals) since the FLC-dependent vernalization pathway is epistatic to the effects of FLM.</p><p>Instead, we have now performed an experiment with summer annuals not requiring vernalization (all carrying PRO2+/INT6+ haplotypes of the described range). As many summer-annual accessions carry weak <italic>FLC</italic> alleles with residual low <italic>FLC</italic> abundance, which still are able to contribute to repression of flowering time {Duncan, 2015 #156;Coustham, 2012 #30;Li, 2014 #111}, we measured <italic>FLM</italic> and <italic>FLC</italic> transcript levels and tested their combined and single contribution to flowering time (rosette leaf numbers). Flowering time data was generated in a new experiment. Interestingly, we found a comparable significant contribution of FLMb to flowering time than in the first experiment (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.21, before R<sup>2</sup>= 0.15), with a smaller, however not significant, contribution of the residual FLC levels (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.119). We integrated the findings of this new experiment into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, changed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>, changed the Results, Discussion, and figure legends.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“To examine the correlation between <italic>FLM-ß</italic> expression and flowering time, we determined flowering time of accessions at 15°C.

From the graphs, it appears temperature sensitivity is reduced, but certainly not eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</italic> </p><p>To address this comment, we have re-evaluated the observation with a new measurement and corrected the calculation and integrated statistical tests.

As such, this work provides novel insights into the regulation of flowering in the ambient temperature range and manages to dissect polymorphisms which are relevant for basal FLM expression and temperature-induced effects on the β and δ splice variants.</italic> </p><p><italic>The manuscript is overall very well written and the authors provide extensive data which has apparently been subjected to comprehensive and sound statistical analyses. The data is presented in an attractive manner. Main manuscript figures are supported by extensive supplementary material including the presentation of extensive control data, which is greatly appreciated. In some cases the figure descriptions or legends should be extended. Due to the vast amount of data condensed in the figures, the descriptions (at least in the text) should be detailed enough for a wide readership to follow the authors through their argumentation.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors state that “The presence of intron 1 is sufficient to restore the basal expression of FLM” – while it does restore expression levels to detectable levels, the expression level of the β splice variant at 15°C is considerably lower than the WT, whereas the FLMδ levels are similar the WT at this temperature. This would indicate that intron 1 alone cannot fully account for basal levels of FLM β.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is correct in stating that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> may invite the conclusion that intron 1 does not fully account for basal FLMb levels. However, as we used transgenic lines for this analysis we suggest that no conclusions about the basal expression levels of native FLMb nor FLMd can be drawn from this analysis. Nevertheless, the relative change of transcript levels in response to changing temperature can be detected and compared to the WT construct, which is the main aim of this analysis. To avoid any misunderstandings, we normalized the transcript levels measured at 21°C to “1” and provided an improved description in the legend.</p><p>Figure legend:</p><p>“<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. <italic>FLM</italic> intronic sequences determine basal and temperature-dependent <italic>FLM</italic> expression.

While the controls presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> suggest that this can recapitulate the “natural” situation (why not subjected to statistical analysis?), it seems nonetheless risky to deliberately tolerate the presence of non-transgenics in the mix. Could the authors state their reasoning for this unusual procedure and provide the missing statistics here? Also, the phrase “replicate pools compromising…” should probably read “comprising”.</italic> </p><p>By adopting this pooling strategy, we have followed procedures that were described in publications from leading flowering time labs (e.g. Coustham, 2012, Science; Caroline Dean lab). This is an attractive way to reduce the variability of transgene expression that result from positional effects in different transgenic lines. In view of the ample analysis of transgenic lines presented in our manuscript, this presented the most efficient way for reducing cost and time while still producing a meaningful data set. If we had used T3 generation plants, we would have had to propagate and test the segregation of over 3000 individual plants. We have modified (and thereby improved) the above-described strategy by pooling plants into four pools, which we designate replicate pools. We have also verified the trustworthiness of this pooling system by demonstrating that it is possible to precisely recapitulate the effects observed with the Col-0 and Kil-0 <italic>FLM</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). The statistical analysis has now been integrated into the figure as requested by the reviewer.</p><p>It should also be noted that we verified that the lines are single insertion lines by scoring their segregation, which was possible due to the use of the FAST vector system, which allows the identification of transgenes by seed fluorescence (Shimada, 2010). Further, we compared the transcript levels to a Col-0 allele reference transgenic construct, which was obtained by the exact same procedure of pooling etc.</p><p>&quot;Compromising&quot; has been corrected to &quot;comprising&quot;.</p><p><italic>3) I had a hard time to comprehensively grasp the information provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, especially when it comes to the color code and its use in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>.</italic> </p><p>Yes, it is true that the use of the same color in both panels may imply that the two data sets are related to each other, but they are not.

While this may be an attractive assumption, it negates the fact that each line pool may represent its individual set of variances (also present in ND-1 itself). This would at least require a spot check for the presence of transgenes in this pool or the percentage of “clean” Nd-1 individuals. In principle, a simple test by PCR would have provided a solid answer to that. As is, the authors should include these lines in the correlation analysis as the factual genotype is not known.</italic> </p><p>We have provided the full data set without corrections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>/E) as well as the corrected data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). For the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, we precisely removed the lower quartile and emphasize that we had confirmed that all lines carried single locus inserinots, using a fluorescence marker. Thus, 25% of the plants should be wild type segregants from the transgenic lines and these should correspond to the early flowering individuals since the genetic background for the transgenic analysis had been the <italic>FLM</italic> deletion accession Nd-1. In this analysis, the homozygous wild type lines Nd-1 and Col-0 are not included since they do not segregate and the correction procedure of removing the lower quartile could not be applied.</p><p>Regardless of this correction, very similar R<sup>2</sup> values were obtained with the corrected (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.94) and uncorrected data (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.89). We assume that the high correlation between FLMb levels and flowering time is generally very high, regardless of the only small improvements in the correlation analysis when using the corrected or uncorrected flowering time values.</p><p>We have clarified the text and added further detailed information.</p><p>Figure legend:</p><p>“<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. <italic>FLM-ß</italic> expression shows high correlation with flowering time of transgenic plants.

None of these require new wet lab experiments and are relatively easy and quick to clean up.

I still have the following concerns about the overall conclusions and analysis. These relate to three important conclusions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) That FLM variation contributes to flowering time variation across a diverse panel of summer annual accessions.</italic></p><p><italic>The new experiment to test this is very helpful, and does provide good evidence that FLMB expression level is important for flowering time variation. My concern is with interpretation: The authors provide several explanations for why the correlation between flowering and FLMB expression in this accession set is lower than in the transgenics. This is trivial because there is much more variation within each haplotype class in the accessions than the transgenics, because they vary at many loci across the genome. I think the real question should be: Is the slope of the relationship between FLMB and flowering time significantly less in the accessions? This would ask if the equivalent change in FLMB expression would cause the same change in flowering. This is a more meaningful metric than change in R2. The correct test would be to include both accessions and transgenics in the same model (flowering_time ~ FLMB * genotype_class), and ask if the interaction is significant.</italic> </p><p>We performed the suggested test for interaction FLMB:genotype_class and found that the slopes differ (p = 0.0321). We included this analysis in the results (subsection “PRO2+ and INT6+ polymorphisms contribute to global variation of FLM levels”, last paragraph) and Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) That the 9 promoter haplotypes explain the variation in FLMB expression in the accessions.</italic></p><p><italic>This is the aim of the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D</xref>/E. The main claim is that the expression variation induced by these haplotypes in the transgenics is correlated with the expression variation of accessions carrying the same haplotypes. This conclusion only holds when one of the 9 haplotypes is excluded. The explanation given for excluding this haplotype is that the correlation goes up after removing this. I did a quick simulation study and found that using this algorithm you'd expect that the best correlation found by dropping each of the 9 pairs would be greater than 46% about 21% of the time even if there were actually no correlation at all. So, this is really not very strong evidence that the haplotype effects are similar. Certainly, the statement &quot;We found that the PRO2+/INT6+ effects, as detected in transgenic experiments (R2 = 0.94), partially explain the FLM-ß expression variation in natural Arabidopsis accessions (R2 = 0.46)&quot; is not supported, because this 46% number is only true when you exclude those accessions that don't fit.</italic> </p><p><italic>As above, I think a more appropriate analysis would be to ask if the sizes of the differences between the haplotypes is the same in the transgenics and the accessions (i.e., is the slope of the graph different from 1?). A more straightforward answer to the question of how much variation in FLMB is explained by these haplotypes is simply to report the R2 for the analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D</xref>.</italic> </p><p>We understand the reviewer's concern and deleted the analysis excluding the exceptional haplotype from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and reported the R2 of the full dataset shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1E</xref> (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.13) as suggested. We changed the respective parts of the text, worded the related conclusions less strongly (subsection “PRO2+ and INT6+ polymorphisms contribute to global variation of FLM levels” and Discussion) and changed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> accordingly.</p><p><italic>3) That the INT6+(CAA) haplotype controls temperature sensitivity.</italic></p><p><italic>This conclusion is important because of the model that FLM controls temperature sensitivity of flowering. New data are presented here relative to the previous version, though where they came from is not clear. The correct test for a change in temperature sensitivity is to ask if the interaction between genotype and temperature is significant (expression ~ Genotype + Temp + Genotype:Temp). The n.s. effect of temperature on expression for INT6+ is not evidence of no temperature effect, only a lack of evidence for a temperature effect. The figure caption states the statistics are done based on a t-test. A t-test can't be used to test for an interaction (except in 6C/D if the 5 transgenic lines per genotype were used as the replicates, n = 5). An ANOVA is needed to conclude that this haplotype affects temperature sensitivity.</italic> </p><p>The new data was generated by measuring FLM-β levels with qRT-PCR using the same samples. As suggested by the reviewer, we performed an interaction test between genotype and temperature of the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>. We found a significant change in temperature sensitivity (p = 0.012259). We integrated this test in the Results section subsection “The INT6+CAA polymorphism confers temperature-insensitive FLM expression and flowering”) and the figure legend. As the change in temperature sensitivity was now reported by testing the interaction of genotype to temperature, we removed the t-tests from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and B.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors have generally met my major concerns and provide additional data as well as detailed explanations for the changes in the manuscript.</italic> </p><p><italic>Remaining concerns:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors have clarified that the major concerns about the exclusion of accessions from the correlation of FLM expression and flowering time was largely based on a misunderstanding of the method and intention of the analysis. The changes to the text makes this much more clear now. The exclusion of the “exceptional&quot; haplotypes raises the correlation from 0.13 to 0.46 in a linear regression analysis. Please also provide the corresponding p-values here to make sure that the p-values reflect a robust correlation effect (as is done in the further analysis of FLMß/FLC expression via multiple regression analysis). Please also describe how p-values were obtained for both cases then.</italic> </p><p>Please see our reply to comment #2 of reviewer #2. According to his comment and reasoning, removing the exceptional haplotype may not be appropriate. Therefore, we decided to simply report the R2 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D</xref> in the text. For further details please see our answer to comment #2 of reviewer #2.</p><p><italic>2) I appreciate the explanation regarding the use of the pooling strategy and the inclusion of statistics. However, no information on the performed test is given in the figure caption. was this also a t-test as mentioned in the methods? If so, please state whether a two-sided t-test and correction for multiple testing was implicated. Otherwise perform an ANOVA with suitable post-hoc test.</italic> </p><p>A t-test was applied previously. We now performed an ANOVA and Tukey HSD post-hoc test. The interpretation remained unchanged compared to the previously applied t-tests. We changed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C, D</xref> and the respective figure legend accordingly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
