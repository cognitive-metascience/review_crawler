In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the dynein attachment molecule Num1 interacts with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria to facilitate spindle positioning across the mother-bud neck, but direct evidence for how these cortical contacts regulate dynein-dependent pulling forces is lacking. We show that loss of Scs2/Scs22, ER tethering proteins, resulted in defective Num1 distribution and loss of dynein-dependent MT sliding, the hallmark of dynein function. Cells lacking Scs2/Scs22 performed spindle positioning via MT end capture-shrinkage mechanism, requiring dynein anchorage to an ER- and mitochondria-independent population of Num1, dynein motor activity, and CAP-Gly domain of dynactin Nip100/p150<sup>Glued</sup> subunit. Additionally, a CAAX-targeted Num1 rescued loss of lateral patches and MT sliding in the absence of Scs2/Scs22. These results reveal distinct populations of Num1 and underline the importance of their spatial distribution as a critical factor for regulating dynein pulling force.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36745.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells must divide so that organisms can grow, repair damaged tissues or reproduce. Before dividing, a cell creates two identical copies of its genetic information – one for each daughter. A molecular machine known as the mitotic spindle then moves each set of genetic material to where it will be needed when the daughter cells form. For the process to work properly, however, a motor protein known as dynein must correctly position the spindle by pulling it into place from the outskirts of the cell.</p><p>When a baker’s yeast cell divides, it first forms a ‘bump’, which grows into a bud that will ultimately become another yeast. The spindle needs to be precisely placed at the midpoint between the original cell and the bud, so the genetic material can get into the future daughter cell. To do so, dynein travels to the bud, where a protein called Num1 helps it attach to the periphery and pull the filaments of the mitotic spindle (known as microtubules) to the correct position. Num1 also attaches to other cellular structures in the bud, including one known as the endoplasmic reticulum. It was unclear how this connection changes where dynein is located, and how it can pull on the spindle.</p><p>To study this, Omer et al. labeled Num1, dynein and microtubules with fluorescent markers so they could be followed in living baker’s yeast using time-lapse microscopy. Mutant yeast strains were also used to disrupt how these proteins associate, which helps to tease out their roles. The experiments show that there are several populations of Num1 in the bud. One associates with the endoplasmic reticulum, and it helps dynein grab the side of a microtubule and make it slide into the bud. The other does not attach to the reticulum, but instead is located at the very tip of the bud. There, it makes dynein capture the end of the microtubule; this destabilizes the filament, which starts to shorten. As the microtubule shrinks, the spindle is pulled closer to the bud’s tip, which aligns it in the right position. The yeast cells thus need Num1 in both locations to fine-tune the pulling activity of dynein, and the spindle’s final positioning.</p><p>In the human body, not all divisions create two identical cells; for example, the daughters of stem cells can have different fates. This is due to a precise asymmetric division which dynein partly controls. The results by Omer et al. could help to unravel this mechanism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nuclear migration</kwd><kwd>spindle positioning</kwd><kwd>dynein</kwd><kwd>yeast</kwd><kwd>dynactin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008975</institution-id><institution>University of Massachusetts Amherst</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship as part of the T32 Biotechnology Training Program GM108556</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Omer</surname><given-names>Safia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008299</institution-id><institution>Dartmouth College</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Undergraduate Presidential Scholar Assistantship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greenberg</surname><given-names>Samuel R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM076094</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Wei-Lih</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dynein-dependent microtubule-cortex interactions – &quot;side-on&quot; versus &quot;end-on&quot; pulling – are regulated by cortical ER and mediated by distinct pools of cortical anchor that are differentially localized along the cell periphery.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proper positioning of the mitotic spindle is essential for successful cell division and is crucial for a wide range of processes including creation of cellular diversity during development, maintenance of adult tissue homeostasis, and balancing self-renewal and differentiation in progenitor stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Galli and van den Heuvel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gómez-López et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morin and Bellaïche, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Siller and Doe, 2009</xref>).

During metaphase, the yeast spindle moves into the mother bud neck via dynein-dependent sliding of astral MT along the bud cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adames and Cooper, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moore et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yeh et al., 2000</xref>). In the current model, dynein is recruited from the dynamic plus ends of astral MTs to cortical foci containing the attachment molecule Num1; once anchored, dynein uses its minus end-directed motor activity to walk along the MT lattice, generating pulling forces on astral MTs along the bud cortex, thereby moving the connected spindle into the bud neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Markus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sheeman et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the yeast model, studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos and mammalian cells show that cortically anchored dynein is able to mediate spindle movement by pulling on astral MTs in an apparent ‘end-on’ fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guild et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gusnowski and Srayko, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nguyen-Ngoc et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Redemann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schmidt et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, in vitro reconstitution studies using either bead-bound brain dynein or barrier-attached yeast dynein show that dynein can capture dynamic MT plus ends and generate pulling force on the captured MT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hendricks et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Laan et al., 2012</xref>). These experiments suggest that the particular geometry of the interaction between the barrier-attached dynein and the captured MT might promote MT shrinkage due to the barrier effect. Why ‘capture-shrinkage’ mechanism is not observed for Num1-based ‘cortical pulling’ has remained enigmatic. On the one hand, a classic study hinted that dynein pulls on the MT tips by inducing MT catastrophe at the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carminati and Stearns, 1997</xref>); on the other hand, a recent work suggested that dynein destabilizes astral MT plus ends regardless of their cortex interaction and that this activity might not be used for generating force for spindle movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Estrem et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, the MT-cortex interactions described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carminati and Stearns. (1997)</xref> occurred before or after the nuclei moved into the neck, thus it is unknown whether they were mediated by the Num1-based mechanism that moves the spindle <italic>into</italic> the neck. Intriguingly, another study implicated cortical dynein in helping Bud6 (a cortical MT capture protein) and Bim1/EB1 (a plus end tracking protein) to couple shrinking MT plus ends to the cortex during an ‘early’ MT capture-shrinkage pathway mediated by the kinesin Kip3 (a MT plus end depolymerase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ten Hoopen et al., 2012</xref>). This study, however, shows that Num1 is not required for the ‘early’ MT capture-shrinkage pathway, which functions to mediate movement of the spindle pole body (SPB) toward the incipient bud site. Together these data raise the question of whether dynein-mediated MT capture-shrinkage is downregulated during spindle movement into the bud neck.</p><p>Recent work suggests that organelles may also have an important role in regulating dynein function in spindle positioning. For example, mitochondria appear to drive the assembly of a subset of cortical Num1 patches, which in turn serve to anchor the organelle itself as well as dynein to the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kraft and Lackner, 2017</xref>). Num1 also appears to associate with cortical ER through interaction with the conserved ER membrane VAP (vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein), Scs2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lackner et al., 2013</xref>). In yeast, the VAP homologues Scs2 and Scs22 (hereafter abbreviated as Scs2/22) have been implicated in the formation of ER-PM tethering sites at the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Loewen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Manford et al., 2012</xref>) and the ER diffusion barrier at the bud neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chao et al., 2014</xref>). The latter is important for limiting Num1 to the mother cell until M phase, thereby regulating the timing of dynein attachment in the bud compartment. However, the distribution and appearance of Num1 patches associated with ER, mitochondria, and PM appear to be different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heil-Chapdelaine et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klecker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kraft and Lackner, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ping et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tang et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that dynein might be differentially regulated by different pools of Num1. Additionally, despite the identification of the organelles involved in Num1 recruitment, the nature of the MT-cortex interactions and the associated nuclear movements affected by each organelle remain unclear.</p><p>In this study, we set out to determine how changes in cortical Num1 localization alter dynein function, localization, and pulling mechanism in cells lacking the ER tether proteins Scs2/22. Consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chao et al., 2014</xref>), we show that Num1 is concentrated in foci at polarized sites in <italic>scs2/22∆</italic> cells, instead of being distributed throughout the cell cortex. We then show that the population of Num1 at the bud tip appears to be independent of mitochondria and is strikingly sufficient for dynein function in nuclear migration. We report direct observation of Num1- and dynein-dependent MT capture-shrinkage activity at the bud tip, explaining why nuclear migration across the bud neck can proceed as normal (albeit with a decreased efficiency) in the absence of classical dynein-mediated MT sliding along the bud cortex. The observed MT capture-shrinkage events require dynein anchoring at the bud tip and dynein motor activity, as well as MT tethering activity by the CAP-Gly domain of the Nip100/p150<sup>Glued</sup> subunit of dynactin, but not the MT plus end depolymerase activity of kinesin Kip3 or Kar3. Remarkably, defects in MT sliding in <italic>scs2/22∆</italic> are corrected by a CAAX-targeted Num1, which restores lateral Num1 patches along the bud cortex and rescues the frequency of nuclear migration to WT level, highlighting a role for the ER-dependent population of cortical Num1. Our results suggest that, in situations where cortical pulling forces drive cellular positioning processes, spatial distribution of dynein attachment molecule could potentially offer a mechanism to regulate dynein pulling force by influencing the relative activity of lateral versus end-on dynein contacts with MT at the cell cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of Scs2/22 disrupts Num1 localization and reveals a distinct pool of Num1 at the polarized cell ends</title><p>In WT cells, Num1 forms dim and bright patches throughout the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, top) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heil-Chapdelaine et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tang et al., 2009</xref>).

Additionally, although deletion of Scs2/22 resulted in a severe loss of cortical ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Loewen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Manford et al., 2012</xref>), the timing for the accumulation of Num1 at the bud tip appeared to be unaffected compared to WT cells, as evident by imaging of single cells over time during bud growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Conversely, no significant loss in cortical ER was observed in <italic>num1∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>).

Our data suggest that localization of Num1 to polarized bud tips does not require Scs2/22 and mitochondria.</p><p>To assess whether the Num1 population distributed along the cell cortex was associated with ER, we analyzed sedimentation profiles of Num1-13myc in sucrose density gradients and colocalization of Num1-GFP with Scs2-mRuby2. Sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis showed that a pool of Num1-13myc co-fractionated with ER in an Scs2/22-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

However, a minority of Num1-GFP patches (45 out of 200; 22.5%) did not co-localize with Scs2-mRuby2 (Pearson’s correlation coefficient &lt; 0.5). These results, when combined with our analysis of Num1 localization in <italic>scs2/22∆</italic> cells, implicate the existence of distinct populations of Num1 patches at the cell cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A small number of Num1 patches is sufficient for dynein pathway function</title><p>Next, we asked whether the observed change in Num1 localization in <italic>scs2/22∆</italic> affects dynein targeting and function, as would be expected if Num1 functions as a cortical anchor for dynein. In WT cells, Dyn1-3GFP localizes to the SPB, astral MT plus ends, and to cortical foci where it has been offloaded from the MT plus ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sheeman et al., 2003</xref>).

We assessed dynein-dependent spindle movements by assaying for anaphase spindle re-alignment from a misoriented position, hereafter referred to as spindle correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yeh et al., 2000</xref>). Kar9 was deleted to increase the frequency of spindle misalignment and to enhance dynein-dependent spindle movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moore et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yeh et al., 2000</xref>). The mechanism of spindle correction was scored based on time-lapse images of astral MT interaction with the bud cortex (as detailed in Materials and methods). In <italic>kar9∆</italic> cells, spindle correction was predominantly mediated by MT sliding along the bud cortex (86.7%, n = 30 events; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>, top), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adames and Cooper, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yeh et al., 2000</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>scs2/22∆ kar9∆</italic> cells, we observed that spindle correction was primarily mediated by capture-shrinkage of the astral MT plus end at the bud tip (77.8%, n = 63 events; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Two-color movies of mRuby2-Tub1 and Num1-GFP revealed that capture-shrinkage of the astral MT occurred upon ‘end-on’ interaction of the plus end with a Num1 patch at the bud tip (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>, bottom). Notably, the plus end stayed in contact with the Num1 patch while shrinking, pulling the minus-end-attached spindle into the bud, causing spindle correction. In separate experiments, we acquired movies with a larger number of optical sections confirming that the astral MT did not slide over the surface of the bud tip (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>; displayed as XY and XZ frames).

Despite having a prolonged end-on interaction with the bud tip, the astral MTs were never observed to undergo shrinkage that led to a productive spindle movement.

It is possible, however, that dynein’s motor activity is only needed to maintain a dynamic connection between the MT plus end and the cortex at the bud tip, as the work to pull the spindle may be performed entirely by the shrinking MTs themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grishchuk et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kozlowski et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>CAP-Gly domain of Nip100/p150<sup>Glued</sup> is required for dynein-mediated capture-shrinkage of astral MTs</title><p>Next, we examined how dynactin might be required for the observed MT capture-shrinkage events at the bud tip Num1 site.

Interestingly, MT sliding movies from previous studies showed that productive sliding events in WT cells were often initiated along the lateral bud cortex and terminated when the plus end of the sliding MT encountered the bud tip (see Video 1 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2003</xref>). Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yeh et al.

In 16 out of 33 (~49%) spindle correction events that began as sliding, we observed that the astral MT stopped sliding upon reaching the bud tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Video 9</xref>). Significantly, as shown in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video10">Videos 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video11">11</xref>, colocalization with Num1-GFP indicated that stoppage of sliding occurred when the MT plus end encountered a Num1 patch or a cluster of Num1 at the bud tip. In all cases, at the end of sliding, the cortex-plastered astral MT could be seen changing into a straight conformation, with the plus end remaining attached to the bud tip. Because the straightening event did not push the spindle back toward the mother cell, the transition (from a plastered/bent conformation to a straight conformation) suggested that the captured plus end was undergoing depolymerization at the bud tip. We observed that, in majority of the cases (10 out of 16; 63%), the attached MT continued to shorten and shrink, causing the spindle to move closer to the bud tip, further aligning the spindle along the mother-bud axis. In the remaining cases (6 out of 16; 37%), straightening was followed by the immediate release of the astral MT from the bud tip.

When Num1 is restricted to the bud tip, as in the case for <italic>scs2/22∆</italic> cells, dynein generates pulling forces predominantly via the MT capture-shrinkage mechanism. In this configuration, anchored dynein is geometrically limited to interact with the very end of the astral MT. Additionally, our data suggest that, through CAP-Gly domain of Nip100/p150<sup>Glued</sup>, dynactin may act as a cortical linker to maintain the connection between the shrinking MT end and the cortex, enabling transmission of MT depolymerization into pulling force generated by the dynein motor at the bud tip. However, when Num1 is distributed along the bud cortex, as in the case for WT and <italic>NUM1-GFP-CAAX scs2/22∆ kar9∆</italic> cells, dynein generates pulling forces primarily via the MT sliding mechanism. In this configuration, anchored dynein can pull on the spindle by moving laterally along the MT lattice. This type of lateral cortical contact is facilitated by a larger surface for dynein-MT interaction, explaining why lateral Num1 patches are more efficient in promoting spindle movement across the bud neck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). Interestingly, our studies also show how stoppage of MT sliding is coupled with MT capture and shrinkage at the bud tip, providing a mechanism by which dynein-dependent cortical pulling is spatially regulated in the bud. We show that the population of Num1 at the bud tip depends on Bni1. We propose that MT capture-shrinkage at the bud tip functions as a brake for MT sliding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This function may be important to prevent oversliding of MT beyond the bud tip, thereby ensuring that the spindle is correctly positioned across the bud neck.</p><p>Our results suggest that cortical ER has a facilitative role in the dynein pathway. In wild-type yeast cells, the cortical ER is consisted of a network of sheets and tubules that tightly associate with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pichler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Prinz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">West et al., 2011</xref>). The cortical ER and the PM make extensive contacts along the periphery of the cell, forming structures called ER-PM junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Prinz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stefan et al., 2013</xref>), which have been implicated in various cellular processes, including phosphoinositide signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stefan et al., 2011</xref>), sterol lipid transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schulz et al., 2009</xref>), as well as maintenance of ER morphology and regulation of the unfolded protein response in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Manford et al., 2012</xref>). At least three families of integral ER proteins – Scs2/22, Ist2, and Tcb1/2/3 – function to tether the cortical ER to the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eisenberg-Bord et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Manford et al., 2012</xref>). Among them, Scs2/22 appear to be the most important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Loewen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Manford et al., 2012</xref>). They contain a single transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic MSP (major sperm protein) domain that can bind directly to PI lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kagiwada and Hashimoto, 2007</xref>) or a FFAT (diphenylalanine in an acidic tract) motif found in lipid transfer proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Loewen et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, a recent study shows that Num1 has a putative FFAT motif in its N-terminal region that targets Num1 to the cortical ER by binding to the MSP domain of Scs2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chao et al., 2014</xref>). This raises the possibility that cortical ER-PM junctions may play a role in anchoring Num1 (and therefore dynein) for mediating movement of the nucleus into the bud neck. Our study here provides evidence to support a specific role in facilitating MT sliding. First, in WT cells, Num1 localizes to numerous dim patches throughout the cell cortex. In particular, dim patches are observed along the lateral cortex of medium and large buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), where dynein-dependent MT sliding is thought to occur during movement of the nucleus into the bud neck. We speculate that these dim patches represent Num1 molecules that are anchored at the ER-PM contact sites, since loss of Scs2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) or Scs2/22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) resulted in a severe loss of dim patches. Second, the number of MT sliding events that occur along the bud cortex is significantly diminished by loss of Scs2/22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Although some sliding events remained, they appeared to be less effective in moving the spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). It is possible that the remaining sliding events were mediated by Num1 that binds to the PM via its C-terminal PH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yu et al., 2004</xref>) or to specific membrane on the mitochondrial surface via its N-terminal CC domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ping et al., 2016</xref>). However, the reduction in the spindle penetration distance observed in the absence of Scs2/22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>) is consistent with the idea that Num1 attachment to ER-PM junctions can provide a stronger resistive force, which may be needed to firmly anchor dynein for efficient pulling of the spindle from the cell cortex.</p><p>Our study demonstrates for the first time that dynein pulling forces are spatially mediated and regulated by two differential populations of Num1 patches in the WT yeast buds. The first population, namely the Scs2/22-dependent lateral patches (as discussed above), appears to initiate and facilitate MT sliding along the bud cortex. The second population, which localizes to the bud tips, terminates MT sliding by capturing MT plus end and inducing MT catastrophe. Consistent with the idea that dynein pulling activity is tightly regulated, previous work shows that the ER diffusion barrier also functions at the bud neck to confine Num1 to the mother compartment until M phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chao et al., 2014</xref>). The diffusion barrier appears to be important for regulating the start of dynein pulling activity, by preventing premature localization of Num1 into the bud compartment. Our study now provides an additional level of control for modulating dynein pulling activity, which appears to be important for ending the spindle movement once it is started in the bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Intriguingly, we did not observe premature accumulation of Num1 to the tips of small buds in <italic>scs2/22∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), where the ER diffusion barrier is presumably disrupted, suggesting that additional components might be required to recruit Num1 to the bud tip in a timely manner.</p><p>How Num1 switches the dynein motor from a side-on motor to an end-on motor remains an open question at this point. Our data rule out Scs2/22 as being required for motor activity, given that MT sliding can be rescued in the absence of Scs2/22 by a CAAX-targeted Num1. Since the mechanism of membrane attachment for Num1 is likely to be different between the lateral cortex and the bud tip, it will be interesting for future investigations to examine whether cortical stiffness could play a role in regulating the switching of cortical dynein pulling mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

and strain construction</title><p>All strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and were derived from the genetic background of WT strains YWL36 and YWL37 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vorvis et al., 2008</xref>) or the protease-deficient strain BJ5457 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jones, 1990</xref>). Strains were generated by standard genetic crosses or by PCR product-mediated transformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Longtine et al., 1998</xref>). Diploids resulted from each cross were sporulated and tetrad dissected and the progeny were then examined by marker analysis. Transformations were performed using lithium acetate protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Knop et al., 1999</xref>). Transformants were purified twice by streaking to single colonies on selective media plates. Proper deletion or insertion of fluorescent protein tagging cassette at the genomic locus was confirmed by diagnostic PCR and fluorescence microscopy. All fluorescent protein tagging was done at the chromosomal locus and imaging was performed using live cells unless stated otherwise. At least two independent transformants were chosen from each disruption or tagging procedure for subsequent experiments.</p><p>To label MTs, strains were transformed with HindIII-digested <italic>HIS3p::mCherry-TUB1::LEU2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>) or BsaBI-digested <italic>HIS3p:mRuby2-TUB1+3’UTR::URA3</italic> and <italic>HIS3p:mRuby2-TUB1+3’UTR::LEU2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Markus et al., 2015</xref>), or undigested <italic>GFP-TUB1::LEU2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Song and Lee, 2001</xref>). Transformants were screened and selected by fluorescence microscopy. To label endoplasmic reticulum, we constructed a plasmid expressing EGFP-HDEL via Gibson assembly reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gibson et al., 2009</xref>) for integration at the <italic>URA3</italic> locus. Briefly, PCR products containing the <italic>TEF1</italic> promoter (<italic>TEF1p</italic>, 459 bp upstream of <italic>TEF1</italic> start codon), ER-targeting signal sequence (SS, 126 bp of the 5’ end of <italic>KAR2</italic>), 3XGlyAla linker, and EGFP-HDEL sequence (amplified from pFA6a-GFP(S65T)-TRP1 plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Longtine et al., 1998</xref>) with HDEL sequence built into the reverse PCR primer) were assembled together and cloned into BamHI and NotI digested pRS315, a <italic>LEU2</italic>-containing vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sikorski and Hieter, 1989</xref>). Next, we subcloned <italic>TEF1p-SS-3xGlyAla-GFP-HDEL</italic> as a HindIII-SacI fragment into pRS306, a <italic>URA3</italic>-containing vector, generating pRS306-<italic>TEF1p-SS-3xGlyAla-GFP-HDEL::URA3</italic>. Strains were transformed with StuI-linearized pRS306-<italic>TEF1p-SS-3xGlyAla-GFP-HDEL::URA3</italic> for integration into <italic>URA3</italic> locus. Ura<sup>+</sup> transformants were selected, colony purified, and screened by fluorescence microscopy.</p><p>To generate in-frame deletion of the CAP-Gly and basic domain of Nip100 at the endogenous chromosomal locus, we used the two-step approach for constructing unmarked genomic mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gray et al., 2005</xref>). Briefly, the <italic>URA3</italic> marker was amplified from pRS306 with primers containing sequences flanking the targeted region of Nip100 (amino acid 2–103). We verified the substitution of the targeted sequence with <italic>URA3</italic> by diagnostic PCR from the genomic DNA. The resulting strain was transformed with a second PCR product containing an in-frame fusion of the sequences flanking the targeted region (60 bp on one side of the <italic>URA3</italic> insertion and 1209 bp on the other side), amplified from WT genomic DNA, along with a carrier plasmid containing the <italic>LEU2</italic> marker (pRS315). Transformants were replica plated to 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) plates to select for the removal of <italic>URA3</italic>. Deletion of the targeted sequence was confirmed by diagnostic colony PCR and DNA sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Image acquisition and analysis</title><p>Confocal images and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments were acquired using a 1.4 NA 60X oil immersion objective on a Nikon A1R confocal microscope equipped with a LU-NB laser launch system housed in the IALS Nikon Center of Excellence microscopy facility at UMass Amherst. Pinhole size was set to 0.7 airy unit. To FRAP, we bleached for 3 s using 488 nm laser at 5% laser power. After photobleaching, single focal plane images were acquired every 30 s at 0.3% laser power. Wide-field fluorescence images were acquired using either a 1.45 NA 100X objective on a Nikon 80i upright microscope equipped with piezo Z control (Physik Instrumente) and a cooled electron-multiplying charged-coupled device (EMCCD) camera (Cascade II; Photometrics) or a 1.49 NA 100X objective on a Nikon TiE inverted microscope system equipped with a laser launch (405/488/561/640 nm; LUN4; Nikon) and a EMCCD camera (iXon 888; Andor). Filter cube sets (31000 v2, 49002, 49008, and TRF89901; Chroma) were used for imaging DAPI, GFP and mRuby2/mCherry fluorescence. All three microscope systems were controlled by NIS-Elements software (Nikon). Yeast strains were grown to mid-log phase in synthetic-defined media (Sunrise Science Products, CA) at 30°C and mounted on 1.7% agarose pad for imaging. All images were acquired at room temperature. For three-dimensional reconstruction of Num1-GFP localization, we acquired up to 25 optical confocal sections spaced 0.3 µm apart encompassing the entire thickness of cells. Image stacks were deconvolved where indicated using the 3D Deconvolution tool in NIS-Elements software. To minimize phototoxicity to cells and photobleaching during time-lapse imaging, we acquired frames at intervals as indicated in the videos and with up to seven optical sections spaced 0.5 µm apart.</p><p>To quantify the number of cortical Num1 patches per cell, we used the analyze particle tool in ImageJ to determine the number of Num1-GFP foci from maximum intensity projection of confocal Z-stack images. Cortical patches were defined as foci having intensities above the threshold set by the average background intensity measured within the cytoplasmic area. To determine the spatial distribution of Num1 patches, we used the multipoint tool in ImageJ to determine the <italic>x-y</italic> coordinates of individual Num1-GFP patches relative to the bud neck from a maximum intensity projection of Z-stack images. The position of each patch was then normalized along the y-axis, with the distance from the bud neck to the bud tip as 0 to −1, and the distance from the bud neck to the mother apex as 0 to 1 (see diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To measure the intensity of Num1 patches, we used the circle tool in ImageJ to encompass individual Num1-GFP foci from maximum intensity projection of Z-stack images. To subtract the background intensity from each measurement, we moved the circle tool from the patch to a nearby cytoplasmic area within the same cell. To quantify colocalization of Num1-GFP with Scs2-mRuby2, we used the Colocalization tool in NIS-Elements software. Pearson’s correlation coefficients between Num1-GFP and Scs2-mRuby2 were calculated for individual Num1 patches in two-color deconvolved wide-field images of Num1-GFP and Scs2-mRuby2. Time-lapse videos displaying XY and XZ views were generated using XYZ projection tool in ImageJ. Kymographs were generated using the MultipleKymograph plugin for ImageJ. We used the mTrack plugin for ImageJ to track the MT plus end in cells expressing mRuby2-Tub1. The position of the plus end relative to the bud neck was tracked over time in movies acquired with 5 s intervals. The duration of plus end attachment at the bud tip (∆t) was scored as the length of time between the plus end making contact with the bud tip and the time it depolymerizes away from the bud tip.</p><p>For cold spindle misorientation assay, mid-log cultures expressing fluorescently-labeled tubulin were grown in YPD and then shifted to 16<bold>°</bold>C for 15 hr before imaging. For cold nuclear segregation assay, mid-log cultures were grown in YPD and then shifted to 16<bold>°</bold>C for 15 hr, fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with DAPI. For spindle oscillation assay, strains expressing mRuby2-Tub1 were grown to mid-log and arrested with 200 mM hydroxyurea for 1–1.5 hr before imaging, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moore et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tang et al., 2012</xref>). The velocity of spindle movement was defined as ∆D/∆T, in which ∆D was the distance the spindle traveled in a continuous bud-directed movement, and ∆T was the time for the movement. For spindle correction assay, we scored for misoriented anaphase spindles that moved into the bud neck and became aligned along the mother-bud axis during a 10 min movie in the <italic>kar9∆</italic> background. Spindle correction was scored as mediated by ‘sliding mechanism’ if the astral MT displayed lateral association with the bud cortex while the spindle moved into the bud neck during its realignment, and by ‘capture-shrinkage mechanism’ if the astral MT exhibited end-on interaction with the bud tip followed by depolymerization of the astral MT concomitant with spindle movement into the bud neck. MT growth rate, shortening rate, catastrophe frequency, and rescue frequency were measured as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gupta et al., 2006</xref>). The angle of interaction between astral MT and the bud tip was measured using the angle tool in ImageJ. Rose histograms were plotted using MATLAB. For growth assays, strains were grown to mid-log phase in YPD media, then ten-fold serial dilutions were spotted on YPD plates and grown at 30°C for 2 days. To depolymerize F-actin, cells were grown to early log phase, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in synthetic-defined medium containing 200 µM latrunculin A or 0.5% DMSO for 20 min before imaging. To verify loss of F-actin, cells were fixed and stained with rhodamine-phalloidin as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Waddle et al., 1996</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Cell lysis, Western blotting, and sucrose gradient sedimentation</title><p>To immunoblot for Num1-13myc, Dyn1-TAP, Jnm1-13myc, Nip100-13myc, and CAP-Gly∆−13myc, yeast strains were grown overnight in 5 ml of rich media (YPD) at 30<bold>°</bold>C. Cell pellets were resuspended in ice cold lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1.5% Triton X-100, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Millipore Sigma). Equal amount of cells were lysed by bead beating in round-bottom glass tubes for 6 × 30 s with 2 min interval between beatings. Following centrifugation (at 21,130 g for 10 min at 4°C), the resulting supernatants were separated on 8% (for Num1-13myc and Jnm1-13myc) or 6% (for Dyn1-TAP) or 4–15% (for Nip100-13myc and CAP-Gly∆−13myc) SDS-PAGE and then electro-blotted to PVDF or nitrocellulose membrane in 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 0.05% SDS, and 20% methanol for 80 min. Membranes were probed with either mouse 9E10 anti-c-Myc antibody (BioLegend) at 1:250 or 1:500 or 1:1000 dilution, or rabbit IgG antibody (GenScript) at 1:5000 dilution. Goat HRP-conjugated anti-mouse (BioLegend) and anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used at 1:10,000 dilutions. Chemiluminescence signals were acquired and imaged using a ChemiDoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad) or a G:BOX Chemi HR16 (Syngene) equipped with a 16-bit CCD camera (Sony ICX285AL; pixel size of 6.45 x 6.45 µm). Immunoblots were exposed for durations ranging from 3 s to 5 min without saturating the camera’s pixels.</p><p>For sedimentation analysis of Num1-13myc, we poured 10 ml 20–60% sucrose step gradients and allowed them to equilibrate for 9 hr at 4°C before use. Each step of the gradient contained 2 ml of 20, 30, 40, 50, or 60% sucrose in sedimentation buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, and 50 mM NaCl). WT and <italic>scs2/22∆</italic> strains expressing Num1-13myc were grown to mid-log phase in 60 ml of YPD media, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in ice cold lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, and 50 mM NaCl supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail tablet. Cells were then lysed by glass bead beating for 6 times 30 s with 2 min intervals between beatings. Lysates were clarified at 500 g for 10 min at 4<bold>°</bold>C and 0.5 ml of the supernatant was loaded directly onto a 10 ml sucrose gradient prepared as above. Centrifugation was performed in a Beckman SW41 Ti rotor at 36,000 rpm for 17.5 hr at 4°C. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected from the top of each gradient for analysis by Western blot using the mouse 9E10 anti-c-Myc antibody (for Num1-13myc) and the anti-Sac1 antibody (a kind gift from Dr. Charles Barlowe for detection against the ER marker Sac1).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Andrea Musacchio as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Dimitris Liakopoulos (Reviewer #2); Kerry Bloom (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Omer and Lee find that a <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> null mutant for the ER tethers Scs2 and Scs22 dramatically alters the cortical distribution of the dynein receptor Num1 without causing misalignment of anaphase spindles. Cells without Scs2/22 switch their spindle positioning mechanism from predominantly microtubule sliding to predominantly capture-shrinkage, which is mediated by a Num1 patch at the bud tip where dynein is off-loaded. Further experiments show that the capture-shrinkage pathway is not dependent on mitochondria in the bud (which were previously implicated in Num1 patch formation at the cortex), nor on the kinesins Kip3/Kar3, but that it requires dynein motor activity and microtubule binding by the CAP-Gly domain of the dynactin subunit Nip100. Importantly, the authors are able to re-instate the sliding mechanism in Scs2/22 null cells by creating lateral Num1 patches on the cortex via a Num1-CAAX motif fusion. The authors propose an attractive model in which dynein-dependent microtubule sliding and capture-shrinkage are used cooperatively for efficient spindle positioning. The study further illustrates that the spatial distribution of cortical dynein receptors such as Num1 determines the relative contribution of lateral versus end-on cortical microtubule contacts to spindle positioning. This is an elegant and convincing study, executed to a high technical standard.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>a) The existence of different Num1 patches is a major conclusion of the paper, but what makes them different remains unclear. The authors could at least start to address this question by exploring one or more of the following proposed avenues:</p><p>1) Measure localization intensity of other components of the dynein pathway like Jnm1 on the Num1 patches as well as co-localization of the patches in <italic>scs</italic> with other polarized factors (exosome and polarisome) at the bud tip. It could be that the end-on pulling patches are specifically the ones at the tip, at polarisome or exosome sites.</p><p>2) Test whether the Num1 patches in <italic>scs</italic> mutants can support spindle elongation by examining synthetic lethality with <italic>cin8∆</italic> mutants (i.e. are <italic>scs2/22∆ cin8∆</italic> or <italic>kar9∆ scs2/22∆ cin8∆</italic> mutants growth defective?). This may help differentiate between the functions of the different types of patches.</p><p>3) Examine whether all Num1-CAAX patches contain dynein, Jnm1 (or the dynein C-terminal fragment that localizes to Num1 dots) – because in <italic>scs</italic> Num1-CAAX cells there is still a fraction of cells in which MTs interact end-on (Figure 5C).</p><p>4) Overexpress Num1 in <italic>scs</italic> mutants and test, whether the Num1 patch intensity of the dimmer patches as well as the MT sliding phenotype can be restored. This would show that one difference between patches is their Num1 content.</p><p>5) Correlate between the position of the patch at the cortex and the MT behavior (sliding vs. end on pulling), in order to address the dependence of the mechanism of pulling on the geometry of the MT-Num1 patch interaction.</p><p>b) It should be made clearer which experiments are made in a <italic>kar9∆</italic> background; the precise phenotype should be declared on the figures/graphs/images. For example, it is not clear whether the experiments using the dyneinK24224A mutant or the Num1-GFP-CAAX variant are made in a <italic>kar9∆</italic> background (that shouldn't be possible for dyneinK24224A) and thus how to compare this results with the other strains.</p><p>c) In the graph of Figure 1B, the fraction of cells containing 1, 3, 5, 7,… bright cortical foci is plotted.

The authors could at least start to address this question by exploring one or more of the following proposed avenues:</p><p>1) Measure localization intensity of other components of the dynein pathway like Jnm1 on the Num1 patches as well as co-localization of the patches in scs with other polarized factors (exosome and polarisome) at the bud tip. It could be that the end-on pulling patches are specifically the ones at the tip, at polarisome or exosome sites.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now addressed 4 out of 5 of the proposed avenues. First, as suggested, we have measured the localization intensity of Jnm1, which is presented in the new Figure 2D and Figure 2—figure supplement 1B. The results show that, like Dyn1-3GFP, Jnm1-3mCherry was enhanced at the MT plus end and cortex in <italic>scs2/22∆</italic> relative to WT cells. Additionally, as suggested, we have included new experiments to address the localization of Num1 at the bud tip in <italic>scs2/22∆</italic> cells. We discovered that deletion of <italic>BNI1</italic> in <italic>scs2/22∆</italic> cells caused a significant decrease in observing Num1-GFP patches at the bud tip (new Figure 6A and B) resulting in a dramatic spindle misalignment phenotype (new Figure 6C). We also show that disruption of F-actin using latrunculin A did not perturb Num1-GFP patches at the bud tip (new Figure 6D), indicating that the actin nucleation activity of Bni1 is not required for the maintenance of Num1 patches at this site. Furthermore, we show that deletion of <italic>BNI1</italic> in <italic>kar9∆</italic> cells resulted in a significant increase in astral microtubules that slid past the bud tip during spindle correction (new Figure 7B and C). This phenotype lends further support to our model that the population of Num1 that localizes to the bud tip functions as a brake for MT sliding. Importantly, the population of Num1 at the bud tip is different from the Scs2/22-dependent population, whose localization along the cell periphery did not appear to be affected by <italic>BNI1</italic> deletion (new Figure 7A), further strengthening the main conclusion of our paper. We thank the reviewer for the push to get these data. Samuel Greenberg helped us collect and analyze the <italic>bni1∆ kar9∆</italic> data presented in Figure 7B and C, and consequently he has been added as an author to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Test whether the Num1 patches in scs mutants can support spindle elongation by examining synthetic lethality with cin8∆ mutants (i.e. are scs2/22∆ cin8∆ or kar9∆ scs2/22∆ cin8∆ mutants growth defective?). This may help differentiate between the functions of the different types of patches.</p></disp-quote><p>We have explored this avenue by performing tetrad dissection analysis. The results show that <italic>cin8∆ scs2/22∆</italic> triple mutant progeny formed viable colonies that were comparable to <italic>cin8∆</italic> single mutant or <italic>scs2/22∆</italic> double mutant (new Table I). As positive control, <italic>cin8∆ dyn1∆</italic> double mutant progeny were inviable. These data did not help differentiate between the functions of the different types of patches, but they show that Num1 patches in <italic>scs2/22∆</italic> cells can support spindle elongation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Examine whether all Num1-CAAX patches contain dynein, Jnm1 (or the dynein C-terminal fragment that localizes to Num1 dots) – because in scs Num1-CAAX cells there is still a fraction of cells in which MTs interact end-on (Figure 5C).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have now examined dynein and dynactin localization in <italic>scs2/22∆</italic> cells expressing Num1-GFP-CAAX (see new Figure 5—figure supplement 1). The results show that cortical Dyn1-3mCherry and Jnm1-3mCherry foci were found at the polar ends of the cell as well as along the cell perimeter in <italic>NUM1-GFP-CAAX scs2/22∆</italic> cells, compared with only being found at the polar ends of the cell in <italic>NUM1-GFP scs2/22∆</italic> background. However, we did not anticipate finding all Num1-GFP-CAAX patches to contain dynein and dynactin, since we have previously demonstrated that not every single Num1-GFP patches in WT cells contains an offloaded cortical dynein and dynactin patch (see Figure 3A in Markus et al., Curr Biol 2009 and Figure S5 in Markus and Lee, Dev Cell 2011). For this reason, we think that the new results did not help differentiate between the different types of Num1 patches. Nonetheless, they show that cortical dynein and dynactin are restored by Num1-GFP-CAAX along the cortex in <italic>scs2/22∆</italic> cells to an extent similar to that seen in WT cells expressing Num1-GFP, consistent with Num1-GFP-CAAX re-instating the sliding mechanism in <italic>scs2/22∆</italic> cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Overexpress Num1 in scs mutants and test, whether the Num1 patch intensity of the dimmer patches as well as the MT sliding phenotype can be restored. This would show that one difference between patches is their Num1 content.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not pursue this avenue because, in our hands, overexpression (e.g. using a <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter) can often result in a very high variability in the expression levels, making it difficult to compare phenotype from cell to cell. Another pitfall of overexpression is that the localization of the overexpressed protein might not reflect the physiological localization of the endogenous protein. Because of these concerns, we believe that it would be difficult to interpret the change in Num1 intensity and function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Correlate between the position of the patch at the cortex and the MT behavior (sliding vs. end on pulling), in order to address the dependence of the mechanism of pulling on the geometry of the MT-Num1 patch interaction.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we now have correlated the position of the MT-Num1 interaction with the MT behavior observed in the bud. The results show that sliding is correlated with MT interacting with a Num1 patch located within the proximal three quarters of the bud cortex, whereas end-on pulling is correlated with MT interacting with a Num1 patch located within the distal quarter of the bud. These results are presented in the new Figure 5D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) It should be made clearer which experiments are made in a kar9∆ background; the precise phenotype should be declared on the figures/graphs/images. For example, it is not clear whether the experiments using the dyneinK24224A mutant or the Num1-GFP-CAAX variant are made in a kar9∆ background (that shouldn't be possible for dyneinK24224A) and thus how to compare this results with the other strains.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this oversight. In the revised figures, we have now indicated the full genotype on all relevant graphs and images, making it clear which experiments were performed in the <italic>kar9∆</italic> background. We have also made the corresponding changes in the revised text. Thanks for pointing this out to us.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) In the graph of Figure 1B, the fraction of cells containing 1, 3, 5, 7,… bright cortical foci is plotted. Plotting the full distribution (1, 2, 3, 4, 5,.…foci) would correlate better with the description of the results: 'More than 70.0% of scs2/22Δ budded cells displayed ≤ 2 bright patches…'</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have re-plotted the graph to show the full distribution of foci in Figure 1B. Additionally, we have similarly re-plotted the distribution in Figure 1—figure supplement 1D. Thank you for pointing this out to us.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) In Figure 1—figure supplement 5, the authors show that preventing mitochondrial segregation into the bud does not affect the Num1 patch at the bud tip in Scs2/22 null cells. The authors' model is that this Num1 patch is primarily responsible for the capture-shrinkage mechanism that is sufficient for correct spindle positioning. By contrast, recent work from Kraft and Lackner (2017) showed that spindles are mispositioned in mutants that prevent mitochondrial inheritance. Can the authors comment on this apparent discrepancy?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the opportunity to clarify this. We think that the discrepancy might be due to a differential effect of cortical ER and mitochondria on the different populations of Num1 (Scs2/22-dependent, mitochondria-dependent, and Bni1/bud tip-dependent). To clarify, our analysis shows that the Num1 patch at the bud tip was not affected by mitochondrial inheritance (Figure 1—figure supplement 5) <italic>and</italic> was significantly enhanced in the <italic>scs2/22</italic> null background (due to redistribution of Num1 to the bud tip when cortical ER tethering is disrupted) (Figure 1—figure supplement 1F). We also showed that it contains an elevated level of offloaded dynein and dynactin in the <italic>scs2/22</italic> null background (Figure 2C and new Figure 2D). Thus, we speculate that the patch at the bud tip might exert a larger force in <italic>scs2/22</italic> null cells (because the patch contains an enhanced level of Num1 to anchor a higher amount of dynein/dynactin), explaining why it is sufficient for correct spindle positioning. By contrast, the ‘mitochondria-assembled Num1 clusters’ described by Kraft and Lackner (2017) most likely correspond to the bright Num1 patches that we observed along the cell periphery (compare Figure 1A in Kraft and Lackner with Figure 1A and Video 1 in our paper), not the Num1 patch at the bud tip. Their data did not show redistribution of Num1 to the bud tip when mitochondrial inheritance was prevented. Because the patch at the bud tip was not enhanced (and consequently did not contain elevated levels of offloaded dynein and dynactin), it failed to correct spindle positioning in their mutants that were defective in mitochondrial inheritance. Thus, we interpreted that cortical ER and mitochondria may have different effects on Num1 distribution when these organelles are prevented from interacting with the cortex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) Following the analysis of the num1<sup>LL</sup> mutant, which prevents off-loading of dynein (and presumably dynactin) to the cortex, the authors state in the Results (subsection “Dynein mediates spindle movements via capture-shrinkage of astral MTs at the bud tip): 'These results contradict the model in which dynein does not need to attach to the cortex to destabilize MT ends (Estrem et al., 2017).'</p><p>The authors should clarify why they think their results contradict those of Estrem et al.

Therefore, I don't really see the contradiction.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify, our statement referenced above refers to whether dynein needs to attach to the cortex to mediate MT depolymerization. We would like to point out that Estrem et al. (2017) stated that dynein <italic>does not</italic> need to attach to the cortex to depolymerize MT ends (see Estrem et al. (2017) Discussion, subsection “Dynein motor activity destabilizes microtubules”). They found that the duration of plus end interactions at the cortex was shorter-lived in the <italic>num1∆</italic> mutant compared with that in the <italic>dyn1∆</italic> mutant (see Figure 3C in Estrem et al., 2017), which they interpreted as dynein being able to destabilize MT ends in the <italic>num1∆</italic> background, where offloading was prevented. In our opinion, this evidence is in conflict with their proposed model, since, as reasoned by the reviewer above, dynactin would be present at the MT tip together with dynein (because there is no offloading in <italic>num1∆</italic>), and thus the MT would not be destabilized. In our study, we used the <italic>num1<sup>LL</sup></italic> allele to prevent offloading and found that cortical attachment is indeed required for dynein to destabilize MT (Video 4). Thus, we stated that our results contradict the conclusion made by Estrem et al. (2017). Nonetheless, in order to make it clearer, we have now modified our statement to read: “These results contradict a previous study postulating that dynein does not need to attach to the cortex to destabilize MT ends”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f) In Figure 4, the CAP-Gly domain of the dynactin subunit Nip100 is deleted, which results in less capture-shrinkage events. The authors should determine the expression levels of the deletion mutant by western blot to exclude the possibility that the defects are due to an overall reduction in Nip100 levels.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have tagged the CAP-Gly∆ construct with 13myc and assessed its expression levels by western blot. The results are presented in the new Figure 4B and described in the revised text (subsection “CAP-Gly domain of Nip100/p150<sup>Glued</sup> is required for dynein-mediated capture-shrinkage of astral MTs”, first paragraph). The level of the truncated Nip100 protein in <italic>scs2/22∆</italic> cells was similar to that of the full-length Nip100 protein in WT cells, indicating that the observed reduction in capture-shrinkage events could not be due to an overall reduction in protein stability.
