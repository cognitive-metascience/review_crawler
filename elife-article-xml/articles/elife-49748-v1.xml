A common virulence genotype of UPEC strains responsible for UTIs is yet to be defined, due to the large variation of virulence factors observed in UPEC strains. We hypothesized that studying UPEC functional responses in patients might reveal universal UPEC features that enable pathogenesis. Here we identify a transcriptional program shared by genetically diverse UPEC strains isolated from 14 patients during uncomplicated UTIs. Strikingly, this in vivo gene expression program is marked by upregulation of translational machinery, providing a mechanism for the rapid growth within the host. Our analysis indicates that switching to a more specialized catabolism and scavenging lifestyle in the host allows for the increased translational output. Our study identifies a common transcriptional program underlying UTIs and illuminates the molecular underpinnings that likely facilitate the fast growth rate of UPEC in infected patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>UPEC</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>human infection</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DK094777</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sintsova</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name><name><surname>Frick-Cheng</surname><given-names>Arwen E</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Sara</given-names></name><name><surname>Pirani</surname><given-names>Ali</given-names></name><name><surname>Subashchandrabose</surname><given-names>Sargurunathan</given-names></name><name><surname>Snitkin</surname><given-names>Evan S</given-names></name><name><surname>Mobley</surname><given-names>Harry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001466</institution-id><institution>American Urological Association Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Scholar Fellow</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sintsova</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Conserved transcriptomic profile of uropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> in patients identifies an infection-specific metabolic state.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in humans, affecting 150 million people each year worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flores-Mireles et al., 2015</xref>). A high incidence of recurrence and frequent progression to chronic condition exacerbates the negative impact of UTIs on patients’ quality of life and healthcare cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Foxman, 2010</xref>). Despite the magnitude of the problem, treatment remains limited by a strain’s susceptibility to available antibiotics, which are often ineffectual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nickel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sihra et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The major causative agent of uncomplicated UTIs is Uropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (UPEC), which is responsible for upwards of 70% of all cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flores-Mireles et al., 2015</xref>). The majority of our insights into UPEC pathogenesis have been obtained through in vitro assays, cell culture systems, and animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alteri et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alteri and Mobley, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sivick and Mobley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Subashchandrabose and Mobley, 2015</xref>). While these studies have identified virulence and fitness factors that are important for UPEC infection, how these studies translate to human infection is not clear. As a result, we do not yet have a complete understanding of UPEC physiology in the human urinary tract. Moreover, the genetic heterogeneity of UPEC isolates, which carry diverse and functionally redundant virulence systems including iron acquisition, adherence, and toxins, further complicates our understanding of uropathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johnson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Köhler and Dobrindt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schreiber et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takahashi et al., 2006</xref>). The different constellations of virulence factors and diverse genetic backgrounds raise the question of whether different UPEC strains vary in their strategies for pathogenesis.</p><p>Since defining conserved UPEC characteristics have proven elusive to comparative genomics strategies, we hypothesized that comparing functional responses in the context of the host may uncover disease-defining features. To that end, we examined UPEC gene expression directly from 14 patients with documented significant bacteriuria and presenting with uncomplicated UTI and compared it to the gene expression of the identical strains cultured to mid-exponential stage in filter-sterilized pooled human urine. Despite the genetic diversity of the pathogen and the human hosts, we identified a remarkably conserved gene expression program that is specific to human infection and strongly supports previous findings of extremely rapid UPEC growth rate during UTI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bielecki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burnham et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Forsyth et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, we show that this transcriptional program is recapitulated in the mouse model of infection and propose a mechanism by which the fast growth rate can be achieved. Based on extensive analysis, we propose a model where UPEC shut down all non-essential metabolic processes and commit all available resources to rapid growth during human UTI. Critically, our discovery of a common transcriptional program of UPEC in patients significantly expands our understanding of bacterial adaptation to the human host and provides a platform to design universal therapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>To better understand UPEC functional responses to the human host, we isolated and sequenced RNA from the urine (stabilized immediately after collection) from fourteen otherwise healthy women diagnosed with UPEC-associated urinary tract infection.

Remarkably, we also observed a high degree of gene expression correlation for the core genome, but not the accessory genome, across all 14 patient samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This suggested the expression of core genes is conserved during human UTI, while expression of accessory genome might be more reflective of the specific conditions during each infection. Furthermore, the gene expression correlation within urine samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, median correlation 0.92, URINE:URINE), and within patient samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, median correlation 0.91, PATIENT:PATIENT) was considerably higher than the gene expression correlation between in vitro urine and patient samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, median correlation 0.73, URINE:PATIENT). The gene expression correlation between in vitro and patient samples remained low, even when we directly compared identical strains (<italic>i.e.</italic> HM56 cultured in vitro in urine vs. HM56 isolated from the patient) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, median of 0.74, URINE:PATIENT:matched). This analysis suggested that UPEC adopt an infection-specific gene expression program that is distinct from UPEC undergoing exponential growth in urine in vitro. Finally, we independently confirmed this observation using principal component analysis (PCA), which revealed that patient samples form a tight cluster, distinct from in vitro cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), demonstrating the common transcriptional state of UPEC during human UTI.</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><object-id

In conjunction with the previously described role for Crp in resource reallocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">You et al., 2013</xref>), our in vivo findings strongly suggest that catabolite repression plays an important role in bacterial growth rate during UTI. Interestingly, other regulators identified in this analysis (NarL, ModE, MetJ, GadE, YdeO) are known sensors of environmental cues, suggesting that the infection-specific gene expression program may be driven by additional environmental signals. Taken together, we propose a model where simultaneous sensing of multiple environmental cues in the urinary tract leads to the global down-regulation of multiple metabolic regulons during infection. The cellular resources (<italic>e.g</italic>., RNA polymerase) that are freed as a result are then allocated to the transcription of genes (for example, r-proteins), which are required to maintain rapid growth rate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>UPEC causes one of the most prevalent bacterial infections in humans; consequently, the virulence mechanisms of UPEC infection have been well-characterized. However, while we know that these virulence strategies (<italic>e.g.</italic>, iron acquisition, adhesion, immune evasion) are essential for establishing infection, UPEC strains can differ dramatically in the specific factors that are utilized. Additionally, our data indicate that the expression of virulence factors can change from patient to patient, suggesting that the need for a specific factor might vary during the course of the infection.</p><p>In this study, we set out to uncover universal bacterial features during human UTIs, regardless of the stage of the infection or patient history. To do so, we performed transcriptomic analysis on bacterial RNA isolated directly from the urine of 14 patients and compared it to the gene expression of identical strains cultured to mid-exponential phase in sterile urine. Our analysis focused on the core genome as opposed to the more commonly studied accessory genome, which contains the majority of the classical virulence factors. This allowed us to identify a remarkably conserved gene expression signature shared by all 14 UPEC strains during UTI.</p><p>Although frequently overlooked, bacterial metabolism is an essential component of bacterial pathogenesis. Since the core genome is enriched for metabolic genes, we anticipated that our study would illuminate the UPEC metabolic state during human infection. Our data revealed an infection-specific increase in ribosomal protein expression in all 14 UPEC isolates, which was suggestive of bacteria undergoing rapid growth. These data strongly support the previous findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bielecki et al. (2014)</xref>, which found a gene expression profile consistent with rapid growth in elderly patients with UTIs. Furthermore, while we did observe increased r-protein expression in exponentially growing UPEC cultured in LB, these transcripts were dramatically more abundant in the context of infection (human and mouse). Thus, the findings that UPEC maintain a conserved gene expression during UTI and grow faster in the host in comparison to in vitro conditions is consistent across multiple studies and patient cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bielecki et al., 2014</xref>), and supports recent studies that have documented very rapid UPEC growth rate measured directly in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burnham et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Forsyth et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, our analysis reveals how this growth rate can be achieved. We found that regardless of external environment,~50% of total gene expression is allocated to the core genome, consisting of metabolic and replication machinery, which mediate bacterial growth potential. When the infection-specific transcriptome was compared to that of UPEC cultured to mid-exponential phase in urine, we observed that elevated levels of ribosomal transcripts correlated with decreased levels of metabolic gene expression. We propose that this reallocation of resources within the core genome drives the rapid growth rate of UPEC during infection.</p><p>This resource reallocation is equivalent to what has been described as the bacterial ‘growth law’. Based on in vitro studies, the growth law proposes that increases in ribosomal gene expression occurs at the expense of a cell’s metabolic gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Basan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Scott et al., 2010</xref>). Our analysis of UPEC gene expression directly from patients is consistent with this hypothesis. In addition, regulatory network analysis revealed that multiple metabolic regulons exhibit decreased transcript levels in patients suggesting an actively regulated process. In contrast, synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) coordinates the expression of ribosomal proteins by a translational feedback regulation mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jin and Cabrera, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nomura et al., 1984</xref>). rRNA synthesis is proposed to be regulated by the competition of RNA polymerase between transcription of rRNA operons and that of other genes, with some studies suggesting that mid-log growing cells might require almost all RNA polymerase dedicated to rRNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jin and Cabrera, 2006</xref>). Thus, decreased metabolic gene expression could allow the cell to shift its allocation of RNA polymerase towards rRNA synthesis and as a result, ribosomal protein expression. Although we cannot exclude other mechanisms, we propose that the reallocation of RNA polymerase molecules from metabolic genes to rRNA and ribosomal protein genes is a common feature adopted by diverse UPEC to promote rapid growth during UTI.</p><p>Three recent studies have attempted to characterize UPEC gene expression in patients with UTIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bielecki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hagan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Subashchandrabose et al., 2014</xref>). These studies focused on the importance of virulence factor expression in specific strains and have demonstrated changes in gene expression between infection and in vitro cultures. It should be noted that all of these studies, as well as our own, were performed using bacterial RNA isolated from patient urine (that was immediately stabilized upon collection). As a result, we cannot exclude the possibility that gene expression of UPEC residing in the bladder may differ from UPEC isolated from patient urine. However, the fact remains that we and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bielecki et al., 2014</xref>) report that patients with different histories of UTIs all harbored a population of actively dividing bacteria in a remarkably specific metabolic state, which we have also recapitulated in a mouse model of infection in this study.</p><p>These findings raise a number of interesting questions. Firstly, how is rapid growth rate beneficial to UPEC? For example, rapid growth rate could be necessary to avoid the hosts’ innate immune response such as micturition or epithelial cell shedding. Additionally, how does this growth rate influence the tempo and mode of bacterial evolution, especially with regards to genomic integrity and the acquisition of antibiotic resistance? Finally, what are the external cues that launch the infection-specific transcriptional response? It has been noted previously that filtered urine lacks some proteins that are present in unfiltered urine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greene et al., 2015</xref>), thus it would be interesting to see if supplementation of filtered urine with specific proteins/metabolites could recapitulate in vivo phenotype. While our study was not designed to identify infection-specific metabolites, our regulatory network analysis suggests that multiple environmental cues might reinforce the suppression of metabolic gene expression. We suggest that identifying and targeting these environmental cues is a promising approach to limit UPEC growth during UTI and gain the upper hand on this pathogen.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Briefly, a total of 86 female participants, presenting with symptoms of lower UTI at the University of Michigan Health Service Clinic in Ann Arbor, MI in 2012, were enrolled in this study. The participants were compensated with a $10 gift card to a popular retail store. Clean catch midstream urine samples from participants were immediately stabilized with two volumes of RNAprotect (Qiagen) to preserve the in vivo transcriptional profile. De-identified patient samples were assigned unique sample numbers and used in this study. Of the 86 participants, 38 were diagnosed with UPEC-associated UTIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Subashchandrabose et al., 2014</xref>). Of these, 19 samples gave us sufficient RNA yield of satisfactory quality.

Cultures were then treated with bacterial RNAprotect (Qiagen), pellets collected and stored at −80°C. The bacterial pellets were treated with both lysozyme and proteinase K, and then total RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen). Genomic DNA was removed using the Turbo DNA free kit (ThermoFisher). The extracted RNA was then halved. One half was treated using the MICROBEnrich kit (ThermoFisher), which should only remove eukaryotic mRNA and eukaryotic rRNA. The second half of the RNA remained untreated. Both the MICROBEnrich and untreated samples were reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Biorad), with 1 μg RNA as template. Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed in a Quantstudio 3 PCR system (Applied Biosystem) in technical triplicate, using SYBR green (ThermoFisher). Samples were normalized to <italic>gapA</italic> transcript levels, by subtracting the Ct values of <italic>gapA</italic> from the Ct values of monitored genes.

Sequences for each virulence factor gene were extracted from reference UPEC genomes (either CFT073 or UTI89). Presence or absence of each virulence factor within clinical genomes was determined using BLAST (with percent identity ≥80% and percent coverage ≥90%, e-value ≤10<sup>−6</sup>). Hierarchical clustering of strains based on presence or absence of virulence factors was performed using Python’s scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage function with default parameters.

As expected, all of the in vitro samples reached saturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, blue lines). Unfortunately, 6 out of our 14 samples did not reach saturation, which warranted us to investigate further (see Gene expression ranges analysis) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, red lines).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Alexander Westermann (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. All reviewers agreed on the importance of your work on characterising the transcriptional program of strains directly from patients. However, they raised serious technical questions with respect to the different processing of the RNA samples from patients, mice and in vitro, and potential confounding factors that cannot be eliminated without extensive new experiments. If you wished to address all the reviewers' concerns, we would be willing to assess the suitability for publication of an extensively revised version of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript continues a large body of work by Mobley and co-workers to define a UPEC virulence genotype during human UTI. The authors use RNAseq to characterise a transcriptional program shared by a genetically diverse group of 14 UPEC strains harvested directly from the urine of infected patients. This revealed a signature defining upregulation of genes involved in translation, and demonstrating that UPEC grow rapidly during human UTI.</p><p>A major strength of this work is the transcriptome analysis of UPEC growth during human UTI, and comparison of this to growth in vitro and growth in the mouse model of UTI. The conserved transcriptional signature of the core genome during human UTI led to the important discovery that reprogramming occurs, and results in the allocation of cellular resources to support rapid growth during human UTI. It was comforting to see a conserved profile of transcription in humans and mice, an important finding that will be of great value to the field. In a broader context, this work provides new insight into UPEC adaptation to the human urinary tract. The transcriptional program that defines rapid growth during human UTI provides a framework to design novel therapeutics that block this phenotype in UPEC, an urgent need in the context of rapidly increasing antibiotic resistance.</p><p>Overall, I have no substantive concerns regarding the data or major conclusions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In the present study, Sintsova et al. profile expression of the core genome of 14 UPEC isolates right upon their collection from UTI patients and compare it with the corresponding bacterial transcriptome patterns when grown in vitro. In doing so, the authors identify a conserved expression pattern shared among all isolates, which is associated with an increased expression of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and a reduced expression of metabolic genes in the in vivo isolates compared to the in vitro cultures. Based on this finding, the authors conclude that in vivo UPEC reallocates its resources to increase proliferation at the expense of metabolic activity, and consequently, that bacterial growth may be enhanced in the patient's bladder as compared to in vitro conditions. This would imply that one or several elusive host factors (present in the bladder but absent from the sterile-filtered urine) would enhance UPEC growth.</p><p>My major concern is that the study lacks enough data to support this hypothesis. The growth rate is deduced from the number of sequencing reads that map to genes for ribosomal proteins. This measure happens to fit with the growth behavior in vitro, when the authors compare UPEC replication in LB and sterile urine. However, this does not necessarily mean that the same applies in vivo. Given that this is their major finding, the authors may want to further support this speculation by in vivo data, e.g. by determining CFU counts in their mouse model over time of infection. Also, what would speak against their hypothesis is that genes for other cellular functions required for growth (such as DNA replication, cell division, etc.) appear not to be differentially expressed in vivo vs. in vitro.</p><p>Also with respect to the generation and analysis of RNAseq data, I have some comments:</p><p>– It remains unclear if the authors sequenced bacterial total RNA or rRNA-depleted RNA. The MICROBEnrich kit used, depletes polyadenylated transcripts (eukaryotic mRNAs and certain lincRNAs) as well as eukaryotic rRNAs, but does not efficiently deplete bacterial rRNA. Also the Illumina ScriptSeq v2 kit per se, does not deplete ribosomal transcripts. Therefore, it appears unclear why the authors state that &quot;… rRNA-depleted stranded cDNA libraries…&quot; were constructed. By the way, if indeed not actively depleted, reads mapping to bacterial rRNAs should also be increased in the in vivo samples (as are reads mapping to ribosomal proteins). In general, plots or tables that inform about RNA class distributions (% reads mapping to mRNAs, rRNAs, tRNAs, etc.) in the individual samples would be helpful.</p><p>– Why didn't the authors include published datasets in their analysis? This would seem particularly obvious for the data derived from their own previous (pilot) study (Subashchandrabose et al., 2014) that was based on 5 samples taken together with the 14 samples analyzed here.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript &quot;Genetically diverse uropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> adopt a common transcriptional program in patients with urinary tract infections&quot;, by Sintsova et al., presents an RNAseq-driven analysis of UPEC gene expression from 14 UTI patients. The main experiment is to compare the expression of the bacteria directly isolated from the patients to the expression of the bacteria after growth in filter-sterilized, pooled human urine in vitro. The primary result is that bacteria isolated from the urine of patients have high expression of genes encoding proteins involved in DNA and protein synthesis: ribosomal proteins, rRNA and tRNA modification proteins, purine and pyrimidine metabolism.</p><p>The primary result was examined with a few analyses on the patient vs. in vitro urine expression. The analysis was split early between virulence genes/accessory genes and &quot;core&quot; genes that are present in all the strains. The analysis focused relatively quickly on the core genes, which included all the DNA and protein synthesis genes noted above. Further analysis of the core genes resulted in a few other general features that differentiated patient (infection) from in vitro growth: downregulation of amino acid biosynthesis, downregulation of sugar metabolism, downregulation of most sugar transporters, and upregulation of amino acid transporters.</p><p>An important set of validation experiments was then done with one strain, HM43, which was grown in LB (considered a &quot;rich&quot; lab media), a new batch of filter-sterilized urine, and multiple urine samples from mice that had been infected in their bladders with HM43. Using% of reads mapping to genes encoding ribosomal proteins and to genes encoding catabolic enzymes showed that the in vivo mouse infection samples again had a high proportion of ribosomal reads and low catabolic reads, more similar to the human patient expression data and not matched by the LB-grown bacteria. This last comparison was the main test the effect of a faster growth rate per se.</p><p>The authors then conclude that there is an infection-specific transcriptional program which is dedicated to high growth rate in urine. They further noted that the downstream regulated genes for 22 transcriptional factors were differentially expressed between patient infections and in vitro urine growth, and speculate that some environmental cues may be sensed and thereby lead to the observed high expression of DNA and protein synthesis genes.</p><p>I have one primary technical question about the experimental design and a question about the context within the UTI field. First, the authors have had substantial experience with doing RNAseq from patient urines, and take care to attempt to minimize the time between urine sample collection and RNAProtect addition (to be applauded). Also, all samples according to the Materials and methods are also stored in RNAProtect. One remaining issue is that it states that the &quot;bacterial content of patient samples was enriched using MICROBEnrich kit&quot;. This raises a potential confounding variable that seems reasonable for explaining a large scale consistent different between patient samples and in vitro urine samples. For the HM43 mouse experiment, it is stated that &quot;eukaryotic mRNA was depleted using dynabeads covalently linked with oligodT&quot;. This would seem to leave the eukaryotic ribosomal RNA still in the sample, but sequencing and mapping statistics for this experiment (similar to Table 1 for the human samples) are not included to check on this. Therefore, I am wondering whether the in vivo mouse samples were also treated differently than the in vitro LB and urine samples. Regardless, the authors should clarify the methods particularly for whether the MICROBEnrich was used only on the patient samples and explicitly not on the in vitro urine samples, and also they should similarly provide a bit more detail on the processing of the mouse samples.</p><p>In addition, the primary result from this paper has largely been described before. Bielecki et al. (2014) performed RNAseq on 21 strains from human UTI patients, 4 of which were subsequently grown in LB for to get an in vitro RNAseq data set; also of note these authors used MICROBEnrich for host RNA removal on the human patient samples, and they did rRNA depletion with a MICROBExpress kit for the in vitro samples. I suggest that the authors more explicitly acknowledge this previous work and the general observations that have already been made, which will help them to either better differentiate their current study or strengthen the overall result shared by the two papers by providing additional validating data.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Genetically diverse uropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> adopt a common transcriptional program in patients with UTIs&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Additionally, while, in the past, we have measured CFUs during infection, bacterial load cannot be used as a proxy for growth rate, as it will be affected by multiple factors besides bacterial growth rate (such as bacterial clearance by the immune response to the infection).</p><p>2) We apologize that this was not clear from our text, but in fact we do show that other genes required for growth are upregulated during infection (Figure 3B, subsection “UPEC show increased expression of replication and translation machinery during UTI”, first paragraph). In addition to genes mentioned in Figure 3, there are other genes required for growth that are listed in Figure 3—source data 1, such as <italic>fis, dnaG</italic> (DNA replication), <italic>dbpA</italic> (ribosome biogenesis)<italic>, mrcA,</italic> and <italic>mrdA</italic> (peptidoglycan biosynthesis). Additionally, while there are sure to be other genes/proteins that are required for growth that were not significantly upregulated during infection, they might be regulated at a translational/post-translational level, and thus would not be changed in their expression.</p><p>3) Our conclusions about rapid growth rate are not only based on the gene expression profile observed in this study, but are also supported by previous studies that attempt to directly measure UPEC growth rate in patients with UTIs (Burnham et al., 2018; Forsyth et al., 2018). We have tried to make this clear throughout the manuscript (specifically in the last paragraph of the Introduction, the first paragraph of the subsection “UPEC show increased expression of replication and translation machinery during UTI” and in the third paragraph of the Discussion). In this study we show how this rapid growth rate can result from repartitioning of the bacterial transcriptome that is observed both during mouse and human UTI.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also with respect to the generation and analysis of RNAseq data, I have some comments:</p><p>– It remains unclear if the authors sequenced bacterial total RNA or rRNA-depleted RNA.

We have revised our Materials and methods section (subsection “RNA isolation and sequencing”) and added Tables 3 and 4 to address this point. These tables show clear depletion of bacterial rRNA from our samples. Specifically, both eukaryotic and prokaryotic rRNA was depleted from the samples prior to sequencing. Bacterial content of patient samples was enriched using MICROBEnrich kit (Ambion), which depletes the sample of eukaryotic mRNA and rRNA. Library preparation and sequencing was performed by University of Michigan sequencing core. ScriptSeq Complete Kit (Bacteria) library kit (https://www.illumina.com/products/scriptseq-bacteria.html) was used to both deplete samples of bacterial rRNA and to construct stranded cDNA libraries from the rRNA-depleted RNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Why didn't the authors include published datasets in their analysis?

However, we appreciate this comment, which has also been brought up by reviewer #3. We have now analyzed data from Subashchandrabose (2014) and show that it is consistent with our current study, i.e., increase intranscripts dedicated to r-protein production in the patient samples compared to LB or urine. These data have now been added as Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and are discussed in the last paragraph of the subsection “A shift in metabolic gene expression during UTI to optimize growth potential”, and in the subsection “Analysis of RNAseq data from Subashchandrabose et al.” One of the patient samples (HM26) had very few reads that mapped to the bacterial genome (Table 6, 7), which potentially explains the fact that this was the only patient sample that contained very few r-protein reads.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] I have one primary technical question about the experimental design and a question about the context within the UTI field.

We have expanded the Materials and methods section to clearly state that indeed both eukaryotic and prokaryotic rRNA was depleted from all of our samples sequenced in this study (subsection “RNA isolation and sequencing”), and provide additional tables showing numbers of reads that mapped to different types of RNA for each sample, for both clinical, in vitro and mouse samples (Tables 3, 4, 8, and 9).</p><p>2) Additionally, we also failed to clearly explain that for the mouse study described in Figure 5 all samples (in vitroLB and urine cultures, as well as RNA isolated from mice with UTIs) were subjected to the same protocol (i.e., treatment with dynabeads covalently linked to oligo dT) to avoid any potential biases that could result from differential RNA processing. This clarification has now been added in the last paragraph of the subsection “RNA sequencing of HM43 from mouse model of UTI”.</p><p>3) The reviewer brought up a very important point suggesting that treatment of patient samples with MICROBEnrich could result in differential gene expression program we observed in the study. We want to point out that if treatment with MICROBEnrich affected the measurement of gene expression or RNA pool composition, we would expect to see large-scale global difference in gene expression, when in fact less than 500 genes were differentially expressed between the two conditions and were enriched in specific biological processes. However, we have taken this concern very seriously and provide five separate lines of evidence that the gene expression pattern observed in patient population is not due to an RNA processing step. These are summarized above, and are further elucidated below:</p><p>- We have performed an extensive RT-PCR study to show that treatment with MICROBEnrich does not change the levels of gene expression in multiple UPEC strains cultured in urine. Specifically, we isolated RNA from urine cultures of HM86 and HM56, split each of the samples in half, where one half went through MICROBEnrich treatment, and the other was left untreated. We then measured gene expression for a panel of 10 different genes for both treated and untreated samples by RT-PCR and found no differences in gene expression between any of them. This was done in three biological replicates for HM86, and two biological replicates for HM56. This provides strong evidence that treatment with MICROBEnrich alone does not affect measurement of gene expression. These experiments are now explained in the Materials and methods subsection “RT-PCR validation of MICROBEnrich-treated samples” and presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 5, Table 10, and Supplementary file 1.</p><p>- As discussed above, for the mouse UTI experiments, in vitroand in vivo RNA samples were treated exactly the same (yet differently from the original urine and patient samples). Nevertheless, the gene expression during mouse UTI highly resembles that of human UTI. This excludes the possibility of our results being attributable to MICROBEnrich.</p><p>- In the revised Figure 1, we take a closer look at expression of genes that we expect to be similarly highly expressed in urine and patients (i.e., iron acquisition genes). As expected, we see a similar pattern of expression for a number of different virulence factors between in vitroand patient samples, which argues against a MICROBEnrich treatment having an effect on measured gene expression. This data is now presented in Figure 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 3 and is described in the Results subsection “Virulence factor expression is not specific to infection”.</p><p>- One of the main conclusions of the paper (i.e., conserved gene expression program during UTI) does not rely on the comparison between in vitroand patient samples, and therefore the difference in treatment between these two sample groups would have minimal impact on our stated results. In fact, we first observed the conserved gene expression program when we compared gene expression of core genome and accessory genome between patients and observed that the core gene expression is more conserved. We apologize for omitting these data from the original manuscript, it is now included in Figure 2A and 2B and is discussed in the first paragraph of the subsection “The UPEC core genome exhibits a common gene expression program during clinical Infection”.</p><p>- Finally, we believe our original manuscript did not stress enough the importance of previous work on UPEC growth rate during infection. Specifically, Bielecki et al.(2014) have also observed a gene expression pattern consistent with fast growth in patients with UTIs. In addition, two other studies attempt to directly measure UPEC growth rate in patients with UTI and find it to be consistently fast [(Burnham et al., 2018; Forsyth et al., 2018), the latter from our lab]. The fact that multiple studies across different patient cohorts came to similar conclusions argues against our study being affected by differential MICROBEnrich treatment. We have revised the manuscript to highlight the previous work done by us and others throughout the Results and Discussion. Specifically, the following was modified: Introduction, last paragraph; subsection “UPEC show increased expression of replication and translation machinery during UTI”, first paragraph; Discussion, third and sixth paragraphs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the primary result from this paper has largely been described before.

In fact, we think that the fact that the two studies are in close agreement, despite studying different patient cohorts, is remarkable and significantly strengthens the conclusions of both studies. We have revised the text of the manuscript to more explicitly acknowledge this work, specifically the following was modified: Introduction, last paragraph; subsection “UPEC show increased expression of replication and translation machinery during UTI”, first paragraph; Discussion, third and sixth paragraphs. We also want to emphasize that the purpose of our study was also to build on these findings and provide a mechanistic insight into how this growth rate could potentially be achieved. Specifically, we show how differential transcriptome partitioning can facilitate the rapid growth. Moreover, we recapitulate our observations in the mouse model of UTI and characterize <italic>E. coli</italic> regulatory network that is behind the transcriptome partitioning observed during human UTI.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Could you explain how you selected the extra dataset provided in Figure 1—figure supplement 5 that suggests that MICROBEnrich has little effect on bacterial gene expression?
