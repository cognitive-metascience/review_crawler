transports polymeric IgA and IgM across epithelia to mucosal secretions, where the cleaved ectodomain (secretory component; SC) becomes a component of secretory antibodies, or when unliganded, binds and excludes bacteria. Here we report the 2.6Å crystal structure of unliganded human SC (hSC) and comparisons with a 1.7Å structure of teleost fish SC (tSC), an early pIgR ancestor. The hSC structure comprises five immunoglobulin-like domains (D1-D5) arranged as a triangle, with an interface between ligand-binding domains D1 and D5. Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements confirmed the D1-D5 interface in solution and revealed that it breaks upon ligand binding. Together with binding studies of mutant and chimeric SCs, which revealed domain contributions to secretory antibody formation, these results provide detailed models for SC structure, address pIgR evolution, and demonstrate that SC uses multiple conformations to protect mammals from pathogens.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10640.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10640.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10640.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A sticky substance called mucus lines our airways and gut, where it acts as a physical barrier to prevent bacteria and other microbes from entering the body. Mucus also contains proteins called antibodies that can bind to and neutralize molecules from microbes (known as antigens).</p><p>The primary antibody found in mucus is called Immunoglobulin A. This antibody is produced by immune cells within the body and must pass through the “epithelial” cells that line the airway or gut to reach the layer of mucus. These epithelial cells have a receptor protein called the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (plgR) that binds to Immunoglobulin A molecules, transports them across the cell, and then releases them into the mucus layer. The pIgR also releases Immunoglobulin A into breast milk, which protects nursing infants until their own immune system has developed.</p><p>When released into the mucus layer, the Immunoglobulin A antibodies remain attached to a portion of pIgR known as the secretory component. This part of the receptor serves to stabilize and protect the antibodies from being degraded and helps the antibodies to bind to other host and bacterial proteins. Researchers have noted that the secretory component can be released into the mucus even when it is not attached to an antibody. These “free” secretory components have been shown to help prevent bacteria and the toxins they produce from entering the body. Despite the importance of secretory component in immune responses, the three-dimensional structure of the secretory component and how it interacts with antibodies and bacteria remained unknown.</p><p>Here, Stadtmueller et al. use a technique called X-ray crystallography to determine a three-dimensional model of the free form of a secretory component from humans, and compare it to an ancestral secretory component protein found in fish. Further experiments on the human protein revealed how the structure of the secretory component changes when antibodies bind to it. Stadtmueller et al. propose a model for how both forms of the secretory component can protect the body from microbes and other external agents. The next challenge is to develop a three-dimensional model of the secretory component when it is bound to Immunoglobulin A.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10640.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10640.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>polymeric ig receptor (pIgR)</kwd><kwd>secretory component (SC)</kwd><kwd>secretory igA/igM</kwd><kwd>crystal structures</kwd><kwd>double electron-electron resonance</kwd><kwd>surface plasmon resonance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI04123</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stadtmueller</surname><given-names>Beth M</given-names></name><name><surname>Huey-Tubman</surname><given-names>Kathryn E</given-names></name><name><surname>Bjorkman</surname><given-names>Pamela J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000884</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Irving Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stadtmueller</surname><given-names>Beth M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Jules Stein Professorship Endowment</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>López</surname><given-names>Carlos J</given-names></name><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Zhongyu</given-names></name><name><surname>Hubbell</surname><given-names>Wayne L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY005216</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>López</surname><given-names>Carlos J</given-names></name><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Zhongyu</given-names></name><name><surname>Hubbell</surname><given-names>Wayne L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ectodomain of the human polymeric Ig receptor maintains a closed triangular shape that binds and excludes bacteria in mucosa, or opens to bind and transport polymeric Ig ligands across epithelial cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mucosa is fundamental to vertebrate survival, forming an elaborate extracellular environment, in which the immune system mediates host interactions with commensal and pathogenic agents. The human mucosa protects ~400 m<sup>2</sup> of epithelial barriers in the gut, lungs, urogenital tract, and associated tissues such as mammary glands. Protection is conferred largely through the function of the polymeric Immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), which transports and stabilizes secretory antibodies and also functions as an innate immune factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaetzel, 2005</xref>). Human pIgR is a glycosylated type I membrane protein consisting of a 620-residue ectodomain with five tandem immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains, a 23-residue transmembrane domain, and a 103-residue intracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hamburger et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). pIgR is the oldest identifiable Fc receptor, first emerging in teleost (bony) fish. Throughout evolution, the number of Ig-like domains in the pIgR ectodomain increased; typically, bony fish express a two-domain variant, birds, amphibians and reptiles a four-domain variant, and mammals a five-domain variant (D1-D5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akula et al., 2014</xref>). Mammals, including rabbits and cows, express an alternatively-spliced variant containing D1, D4 and D5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deitcher and Mostov, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kulseth et al., 1995</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10640.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure of hSC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of mature human pIgR protein indicating Ig-domain (D1-D5) boundaries.

Similar to other antibody classes, each IgA and IgM monomer contains two Fab arms and one Fc region (a dimer of IgA heavy chain domains Cα2 and Cα3 or IgM domains Cµ2, Cµ3 and Cµ4). Unlike other antibody classes, IgA and IgM monomers can polymerize, producing dimeric IgA (dIgA), pentameric IgM (pIgM), and to a lesser extent, higher order polymers. Adjoining monomers are linked tail-to-tail through heavy chain C-terminal extensions (tailpiece; tp) and a 137-residue protein called joining (J) chain and are stabilized through disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hamburger et al., 2006</xref>). The transport cycle of pIgR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) starts when pIgR at the basolateral membrane binds dIgA or pIgM, and the resulting complex is transcytosed to the apical surface where proteases cleave the pIgR ectodomain (now referred to as secretory component, SC), releasing it into the mucosa as a complex with dIgA or pIgM. These complexes, Secretory IgA (SIgA; the predominant mucosal antibody) and Secretory IgM (SIgM), exclude pathogens from the epithelial barrier and promote host relationships with commensal bacteria through innate and adaptive mechanisms. SC specifically protects secretory Ig from proteolytic degradation and confers innate recognition functions upon SIgA and SIgM, allowing them to bind and exclude bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaetzel, 2005</xref>). Although binding to polymeric Ig stimulates pIgR transcytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Song et al., 1994</xref>), up to 50% of pIgR in humans trafficks to the apical surface and is released as unliganded, or free, SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brandtzaeg, 1971</xref>), which can exclude pathogenic bacteria and bacterial toxins through protein-protein or protein-glycan interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaetzel, 2005</xref>). In humans, SC binds the major <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> surface protein, choline binding protein A (CbpA), using protein-protein interactions, and to pathogenic bacteria such as <italic>H. pylori, E. coli</italic> and <italic>Shigella</italic> spp, using complex carbohydrates attached to one or more of its seven potential <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaetzel, 2005</xref>). SC carbohydrates have also been shown to facilitate binding to host mucus, host protein IL-8, commensal bacteria <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic> and contribute to microbiota homeostasis of the intestinal mucosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaetzel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mathias and Corthesy, 2011</xref>). SC and SIgA interactions with pathogens and commensals are thought to be especially important for nursing infants, who ingest large quantities of maternal free SC and SIgA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hurley and Theil, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rogier et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Understanding the structure(s) of the pIgR ectodomain (hereafter called SC) and how it interacts with ligands and pathogens is of interest because its critical role in immunity requires the protein to accommodate binding, transport and protection of secretory antibodies while also conferring innate protection in both free and liganded forms. High-resolution structural information for SC and the SC interactions with polymeric immunoglobulin (pIg) ligands is limited to a crystal structure of the human SC D1 domain, which adopts an Ig-variable (V)-like fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamburger et al., 2004</xref>). The structures and contributions of D2-D5 to intact SC function are largely unknown. D1 is both necessary and sufficient for binding to pIg Fcs and is also thought to interact with J-chain because pIgR transports only J-chain–containing pIgs, and isolated D1 does not bind monomeric IgA. D1 binding to pIg is partly mediated by three D1 loops that are structurally equivalent to the antigen-binding complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of immunoglobulin variable domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hamburger et al., 2006</xref>). Binding to dIgA can be further stabilized by a disulfide bond between SC D5 and Fcα Cα2; however, this interaction is absent in some SIgA complexes and does not form in SIgM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Almogren et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hamburger et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Here we report the first crystal structures of intact SC proteins, comparing the highly-evolved five-domain human SC (hSC) and a two-domain teleost fish SC (tSC), a relative of the first vertebrate SC ancestor. We characterized the conformation and dynamics of free and liganded hSC in solution, and used structure-based alignments to create mutant and chimeric SCs to determine how individual domains contribute to ligand binding. These results provide a detailed model for SC structure and pIg binding mechanisms, demonstrating that mammalian SC evolved to adopt a compact, closed triangular structure, which opens upon ligand binding, whereas two-domain SC ancestors consist of tandem domains arranged in an elongated conformation. For hSC, we show that each of the five domains adopt distinct associations with each other in unliganded versus liganded forms, and that each contributes uniquely to dIgA and pIgM recognition and secretory antibody formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Crystal structure of hSC</title><p>The crystal structure of hSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) was determined to 2.6Å resolution (R<sub>cryst</sub> = 20.1%; R<sub>free</sub> = 25.4%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The final model (540 ordered residues of 549 total) revealed five Ig-like domains (D1-D5) arranged into a compact triangle (three sides of ~70Å, ~70Å and ~90Å) in which D2-D3 and D4-D5 form two of the sides, and D1 contacts both D2 and D4-D5 to form the third side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The domains lie in a plane such that the triangle thickness is roughly equal to that of a single domain (~40Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). The overall arrangement involves extensive interfaces between all five domains and a small solvent-accessible hole (~14Å diameter) in the center. As defined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, the hSC front face shows all five domains. A 90° clockwise rotation reveals a side face dominated by D2 and D3; another 90° clockwise rotation reveals the back face showing all five domains, and a further 90° rotation reveals a side face comprising D4 and D5. A fifth face is formed at the bottom of the hSC triangle (90° from the front and back faces), which includes D5, D1 and D2, and all domains are visible when viewed from the top. Important SC motifs, including CDRs, some residues implicated in ligand binding, and potential <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation sites, are largely solvent exposed and distributed on all faces of the molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). The D1 CDR1 and CDR3 loops, which contribute to dIgA and pIgM binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaetzel, 2005</xref>), are exposed exclusively on the front face, whereas the D4 CDRs are exposed only on the back face. The D2, D3 and D5 CDRs are exposed on both faces and at least one side, and D5 residues Cys468 and Cys502, which can disulfide bond with the dIgA residue Cys311 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hamburger et al., 2006</xref>), are exposed on the D4-D5 side.</p><p>The D1, D2, D4, and D5 domains of hSC include seven potential <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation sites that anchor carbohydrates involved in hSC interactions with bacterial and host lectins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaetzel, 2005</xref>). We observed partially ordered glycans at four sites (D1 sites Asn65 and Asn72, D2 site Asn168, and D5 site Asn481), which do not contact protein portions of hSC. These observations suggest that carbohydrates are unlikely to stabilize the hSC domain arrangement directly, but are optimally positioned to allow hSC to bind pIg ligands and to facilitate lectin interactions with free hSC and SIgA. At least one <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation site is visible from each orientation; however, six of the seven potential glycosylation sites are clustered on the back and bottom faces of the molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Folding topologies of hSC domains</title><p>Consistent with predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mostov et al., 1984</xref>), each hSC domain adopts an Ig superfamily (IgSF) fold. IgSF domains share a basic folding topology consisting of two β-sheets linked through a conserved disulfide bond. The domains are classified as Variable (V), Intermediate (I) or Constant (C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang, 2013</xref>). D1-D4 each adopt an Ig-V-like fold, which typically contain β-strands A, B, E, D on one sheet and strands A’, G, F, C, C’, C” on the other. As reported for D1, the loops connecting strands B-C, C’-C”, and F-G are similar to IgV CDRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamburger et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast to D1, domains D2-D4 each lack an A strand that would normally pair with the β-sheet containing strands B, E, and D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). The A strand-equivalent residues in these domains instead form the D1-D2, D2-D3 and D3-D4 linkers. In addition to the canonical Ig disulfide bond connecting strands B and F, domains D1, D3, D4 and D5 include a second disulfide that links the C and C’ strands. Despite lacking the C-C’ disulfide, the relative orientation of the C and C’ β-strands in D2 is similar to other SC domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). D5 topology diverges from the canonical IgV fold because, in common with both the IgI and IgC folds, it lacks the C” strand and associated CDR2 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). D5 also diverges from D2-D4 because residues following the D4-D5 linker hydrogen bond to the B strand, providing D5 with a two-residue A strand, a feature found in IgV and IgI but absent in IgC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang, 2013</xref>). Taken together, D5 topology resembles IgI, although it lacks conserved interactions that typically link loops equivalent to CDR1 and CDR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang, 2013</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10640.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Individual hSC domains.</title><p>(<bold>A-E</bold>) Cartoon representations of hSC domains shown in the same orientation.

The position and widths of the distance distribution for distances beyond 70Å are not well-determined, but the data are consistent with movements of more than ~42Å between D1-D5. Despite this remarkable domain separation, the intra-domain distance distribution of D5-455R1/D5-491R1 remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), and the continuous wavelength (CW) EPR spectra did not change for any of the sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>), indicating that the local structure around R1 was unperturbed. The broad distance distributions we observed for hSC in the hSC:dIgA and hSC:pIgM complexes suggest that hSC binding progresses through intermediate states and/or that liganded hSC is highly flexible.

The largest structural differences between tSC and hSC domains are in regions between the C’ and D strands, where tD1 residues at positions similar to the C” strand are disordered and the tD2 C” strand hydrogen bonds to the D strand on the A-B-E-D face rather than to the C’ strand on the A’-G-F-C face (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), similar to other IgSF proteins such as IREMs (immune receptors expressed on myeloid cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marquez et al., 2007</xref>). These differences are coupled with distinct features in tSC CDR2 loops and neighboring residues, which include a patch of negative electrostatic potential on tD2 formed from six negatively charged residues in the CDR2, C”, and D strands. The tSC CDR1 and CDR3 loops also adopt distinct conformations. In contrast to the human D1 CDR1 α-helical turn, both tSC CDR1 loops include a 3<sub>10</sub> helical turn and are structurally similar to human D5 CDR1.

The residues in the CDR3 loops are largely conserved among fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), but differ between tSC domains; the tD1 CDR3 is elongated, extending toward CDR1 and containing a short helical turn, whereas the tD2 CDR3 is shorter, similar to the D5 CDR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). tD2 has a 4-residue DE loop, similar to counterpart loops in human D1-D4 and in contrast to the extended loop and disulfide link to CDR1 found in human D5. The interface between the two tSC domains is formed by residues in the tD1 A’-B and E-F loops and residues in tD2 CDR1 and DE loop, burying a total surface area of 591Å<sup>2</sup>.

Our approach involved evaluating the ability of short hSC variants and human-fish SC chimeric proteins to bind human dIgA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and pIgM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Unless otherwise noted, hSC D5 residues Cys468 and Cys502 were mutated to alanine to prevent covalent binding to dIgA. All hSC variants and human-fish chimeric proteins were monomeric and monodisperse as verified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and/or SEC with in-line multi-angle light scattering (MALS) (data not shown). Although the stoichiometry of hSC to pIg in SIg complexes is reportedly 1:1, binding is thought to occur through a multi-step mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hamburger et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with this model and the demonstration of a ligand binding-induced conformational change in hSC, the binding profiles of our SC variants failed to fit single state kinetic models. Because uncertainties in the binding mechanism precluded accurate selection of a kinetic model, we qualitatively monitored differences in the SPR binding profiles to identify changes in kinetics among protein variants.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10640.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>hSC and chimeric SC binding to dIgA.</title><p>(<bold>A-C</bold>) Sensorgrams showing hSC, D1, and D1-D3 binding to dIgA.

In contrast, and consistent with previously published SPR experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamburger et al., 2004</xref>), D1 association and dissociation were rapid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), demonstrating that D2-D5 contribute to the dIgA binding mechanism even in the absence of covalent interactions mediated by D5 Cys468/Cys502. To investigate potential contributions from other hSC domains, we tested binding of D1-D3, D2-D3, D4-D5, and D2-D5. The D1-D3 variant exhibited rapid association similar to D1 and an initially rapid dissociation that subsequently slowed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), suggesting that D2-D3 either indirectly altered D1 binding to dIgA or contributed additional specific interactions. D2-D3 gave inconsistent results among replicate experiments, with weak binding detected in two experiments and no binding detected in a third experiment (data not shown). We did not detect binding of D4-D5 and D2-D5 even at concentrations above 32 µM (data not shown), supporting reports that D1 is required for binding of SC to dIgA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brandtzaeg, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Differences in binding of hSC D1-D3 versus D1-D5 to dIgA suggested that domains D4 and/or D5 contribute to non-covalent interactions between hSC and dIgA. Hypothesizing that residues near D5 Cys 468/Cys502 are involved, we engineered a series of chimeric proteins (hSC-tCDR1, hSC-tDE and hSC-tCDR1/tDE), in which the human D5 domain contained the CDR1 loop and/or DE loop from counterpart regions of tD2 exhibiting divergent sequence and structure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">(Figures 5</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D)</xref>. We characterized chimeric protein binding to immobilized dIgA by SPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–G</xref>) and calculated equilibrium binding affinities (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>) from maximal binding response values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Binding of hSC (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>~63+/-4nM) and the hSC-tDE chimera (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>~65+/-3nM) were indistinguishable. By contrast, the hSC-tCDR1 chimera exhibited subtle changes during dissociation from dIgA, and the affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>~82+/-1nM) was slightly reduced compared with the hSC D1-D5 affinity. The affinity for dIgA was further reduced (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>~140+/-7nM), and the dissociation phase was shorter when the binding of a double chimera (hSC-tCDR1/tDE) was evaluated (asterisk, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Taken together, these data suggested that D5 mediates direct non-covalent interactions between hSC and dIgA. Since the double chimera exhibited a greater reduction in binding than the hSC-tCDR1 chimeric protein, the D5 DE loop may play a role in stabilizing the position of D5 CDR1, which could be enhanced in the presence of the disulfide that normally links the two motifs (absent in our binding studies). The hSC-tCDR1/tDE did not mimic the binding kinetics of D1 for dIgA, suggesting that additional, as yet unidentified, interfaces contributed to binding affinity and/or that the binding mechanism of D1 was indirectly altered by the presence of D2-D5, perhaps because isolated D1 would not require a conformational change to maximally expose surface area involved in binding. Alternatively, fish motifs found in the chimeric proteins could confer positive binding interactions for dIgA.</p><p>Having shown that hSC binds dIgA non-covalently using its D1 and D5 domains and undergoes a conformational change that separates these domains upon SIgA formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6E–H</xref>), we characterized binding of shorter hSC proteins, in which the distance between D1 and D5 was constrained. For these studies, we created two hSC proteins, one comprising domains D1-D3-D4-D5 (analogous to avian, reptilian, and amphibian SC, which lack a domain homologous to D2) and another comprising D1-D4-D5 (analogous to a naturally-occurring mammalian splice variant) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akula et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deitcher et al., 1986</xref>). Both variants exhibited robust, concentration-dependent binding to dIgA; however, dissociation occurred rapidly, with all of the injected protein dissociating ~200 s into the experiment compared to ~400 s for hSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,I–J</xref>), similar to the binding kinetics of the D1–dIgA interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These results suggest that D2, and possibly D3, contribute to binding by providing direct interactions with ligand and/or by promoting interactions between D5 and dIgA. The latter possibility is attractive, given that chimeric SC with mutations in D5 exhibited similar binding profiles that were characterized by rapid dissociation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–H</xref>).</p><p>We also evaluated the interactions of the hSC variants and chimeras with pIgM and found that D1-D5, D1, D1-D3, D1-D3-D4-D5, and D1-D4-D5 exhibited concentration-dependent binding to pIgM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–C,H,I</xref>). Although qualitative differences in binding among these variants was subtle, the association phase of D1 required a lower starting concentration (16nM) to reach equilibrium compared with the starting concentration required for D1-D5 (256nM), suggesting differences in binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Similar to dIgA binding studies, we detected inconsistent responses for D2-D3 and did not detect binding of D4-D5 and D2-D5 (data not shown). In contrast to the dIgA binding studies, we could not detect differences in pIgM binding between hSC D1-D5 and the hSC-tCDR1, hSC-tDE or hSC-tCDR1/tDE chimeras, suggesting that the D5 CDR1 and DE loop do not play a prominent role in the hSC-pIgM interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Since the discovery of SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tomasi et al., 1965</xref>) and later identification of its membrane-bound form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mostov et al., 1980</xref>), the pIgR has been established as a central component of the vertebrate immune response, transporting and stabilizing secretory antibodies, excluding pathogenic bacteria, providing immune protection at epithelial barriers such as the lungs, gut, urogenital tract, and conferring protection to offspring through breast milk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaetzel, 2005</xref>). Despite its importance, relatively little was known of pIgR/SC structure. Models ranged from schematic representations of elongated tandemly-arranged domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Monteiro and Van De Winkel, 2003</xref>) to solution scattering-based, computational models of J-shaped molecules, in which D1 makes contacts only with D2 (via the D1-D2 linker), and D2-D3 are folded back toward D4-D5, leaving all D1 binding motifs free to interact with ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Almogren et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonner et al., 2007</xref>). Here we present atomic resolution structures that detail how the SC structure has changed over the course of vertebrate evolution, showing that bony fish utilize the two domains of ancestral SC to form an open, elongated structure whereas mammals utilize five domains to form a closed, triangular structure that opens upon ligand binding. These differences are accompanied by domain-specific structural variations and together suggest that SC has evolved into a structurally-plastic molecule that protects mammals by specifically modulating its conformation for its known functions as free SC, SIgA, and SIgM. The mammalian SC might be described as the host immune system’s hand, whose thumb (D1) and four fingers (D2-D5) can form a fist or open to grasp a polymeric antibody in order to fight potential invaders. By contrast, the more primitive two-domain fish SC could be described as a single finger, already in an open conformation for ligand binding and lacking the dexterity of a hand.</p><p>The expansion of SC from two domains to five parallels increasing organism complexity as well as changes in antibody isotypes and species-specific organization of polymeric Igs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akula et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flajnik, 2010</xref>). While parallel evolutionary changes in receptors and their ligands are common, it was unexpected to find that the addition of D2, D3 and D4 domains in mammals was associated with a closed conformation that occluded putative ligand-binding motifs. Burial of ligand-binding motifs hints that the closed conformation provides mammalian SC with advantages that are separate from its binding to polymeric antibodies. For unliganded SC released into the mucosa, the closed conformation could protect SC from proteases by burying susceptible inter-domain linkers and loops, and also promote interactions with commensal and/or pathogenic bacteria. Supporting the notion that the closed conformation is important for unliganded hSC function, our structure suggests that the D1-D5 interface would be stabilized in acidic mucosa because protonation of D1 His32 that occurs at acidic pH would facilitate electrostatic interactions with conserved acidic residues in D5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The hSC structure also provides insight into hSC interactions with the human pathogen <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>. Unliganded hSC and SIgA use residues in D3 and D4 to bind to the major <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> adhesion protein CbpA, and a peptide corresponding to hSC D4 residues 349–375 inhibited <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> adherence to epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaetzel, 2005</xref>). The hSC structure shows that residues 349–375 occupy solvent-exposed regions of D4 CDR1 and the D3-contacting regions of the C-C’ loop, rationalizing why both D3 and D4 are required for the interaction with CbpA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In addition, since SIgA binds CbpA, this suggests that these regions of hSC remain exposed upon binding to dIgA.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10640.015</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for pIgR transcytosis, ligand binding and release of free SC and SIgA.</title><p>Schematic model depicting a mammalian epithelial barrier with membrane-bound SC (pIgR) shown on the basolateral side in its closed, unliganded conformation. The pIgR D1-D5 binding to dIgA is depicted as a three-step mechanism whereas pIgR D1-D4-D5 splice variant binding to dIgA is depicted as a one-step mechanism. pIgR binding to pIgM is not shown but occurs via a mechanism related to dIgA binding.

Of particular significance is the change in the positions of D1 and D5 upon binding to both dIgA and pIgM, as identified in DEER experiments. The large magnitude of this change (more than 40Å), along with evidence for flexible inter-domain linkers, implies that the D1-D5 interface is broken during ligand binding and suggests that the conformational change involves other domains and exposes additional ligand binding motifs on SC (e.g., by enhancing accessibility to D1 binding motifs). Our SPR data demonstrated that during this process, all five domains contribute to binding kinetics and that D5 binds dIgA independent of covalent bond formation. These observations suggest that non-covalent interactions between D5 CDR1 and DE loops can stabilize the complex during the disulfide exchange reaction and also suggest that both D1 and D5 contact dIgA directly in endogenous SIgA that lack covalent interactions with SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Almogren et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lindh and Bjork, 1976</xref>) and in the R1-labeled SC-dIgA complexes used for DEER measurements. In the case of SC binding to IgM, which does not involve covalent bond formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hamburger et al., 2006</xref>), we found that binding also involves a conformational change, which could facilitate ligand binding at secondary sites on SC D1-D5, although such sites do not appear to involve the D5 CDR and DE loops because chimeric SC and hSC exhibited similar binding profiles. The observation that a conformational change occurs even when binding is dominated by D1 supports the hypotheses that the closed SC conformation occludes D1 binding motifs and that increasing D1 accessibility is an important part of the ligand binding mechanism.</p><p>The demonstration that hSC D1-D3-D4-D5 and D1-D4-D5 bound dIgA with kinetics similar to D1 rather than to D1-D5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) also sheds light on specific roles for pIgR D2-D4 during pIgR-dIgA recognition. These results suggest that the gain of the D2 domain in mammalian pIgR resulted in enhanced binding to dIgA, perhaps by providing direct contacts and/or by facilitating interactions between D5 and ligand, and further suggest that binding of mammalian splice variants to pIg ligands are mediated primarily through interactions with D1. This possibility is supported by earlier work demonstrating that D2 and D3 were required for covalent binding of D5 to dIgA in other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crottet and Corthesy, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Solari et al., 1985</xref>), an observation we confirmed with an hSC D1-D4-D5 variant (data not shown).</p><p>When unliganded, short pIgR/SC variants are likely to adopt conformations that differ from the closed conformation of unliganded hSC. The tSC structure reveals an elongated conformation for a two-domain variant, and analysis of the hSC structure indicates that steric constraints would prevent mammalian D1-D4-D5 splice variants from adopting a closed conformation with a D1-D4-D5 interface equivalent to that of hSC. This implies that D2-D3 play a role in stabilizing the closed hSC conformation. The presence of D3 may be sufficient to stabilize a closed conformation because analysis of the hSC structure suggests that D1-D3-D4-D5 variants could adopt a closed conformation with a D1-D4-D5 interface equivalent to that of hSC. While the absence of a closed conformation might enhance ligand accessibility to D1 binding motifs, it is unclear if this would be advantageous because D1-D4-D5 dissociates from dIgA rapidly compared to D1-D5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Mammalian SC splice variants transport dIgA in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kuhn et al., 1983</xref>); however, the utility of these variants may be impaired by altered interactions with ligands and/or in any context in which the closed state is advantageous, whether for ligand binding and/or free SC functions.</p><p>Structural characterization of hSC and SIg complexes using DEER allowed us to capture hSC in both a compact unliganded state and heterogeneous liganded states, information that we could not obtain using crystallography or single particle electron microscopy (unpublished results). While it is notable that SIgA and SIgM appear heterogeneous in structure, predicting how hSC domains are arranged in these complexes is challenging. hSC could bind a single Fc, or bind across the dIgA dimer and contact two Fcs (or more in the case of pIgM). Putative hSC D1 interaction sites on dIgA include Fcα residues 377, 402–411, 413-414, 440–443, and D5 forms a covalent bond with Fcα residue C311 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Woof and Russell, 2011</xref>). Interaction sites are maximally separated by ~50Å when measured between Phe443 and Cys311 in monomeric Fcα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herr et al., 2003</xref>), and likely separated by more than 50Å when measuring between adjacent Fcs in the dIgA dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Although dIgA contains four copies of all Fc residues implicated in binding, SC binds dIgA with 1:1 stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaetzel, 2005</xref>), suggesting either that dimeric IgA formation induces conformational differences in Fcα that alter the binding site environments and/or that a 1:1 stoichiometry is enforced by hSC interactions with J-chain. Solution scattering models suggested that hSC binds along one side of dIgA in an extended conformation that contacts both Fcs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonner et al., 2009</xref>). These results, taken together with our DEER measurements showing that the D1 and D5 CDR1s could be separated by more than 85Å upon hSC binding to dIgA in a SIgA molecule (45Å between D1 and D5 CDR1s in the closed conformation plus &gt;40Å change in positions of D1 and D5 upon ligand binding), favor a model in which hSC contacts both Fcs in dIgA.</p><p>Our results suggest a revised model for pIgR/SC function and ligand binding in mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In this model, unliganded pIgR at the basolateral membrane remains in the closed state until encountering ligand. The closed state, characterized by partially-buried ligand binding motifs including D1 CDR2 and CDR1 residues His32 and Arg34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coyne et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roe et al., 1999</xref>), binds to a single Fcα in dIgA (making additional, potential contacts with J-chain) using exposed motifs in D1 CDR1 and CDR3, facilitating an initial recognition event that disrupts the D1-D4-D5 interface and induces a conformational change. The conformational change frees D5 (and perhaps other domains) to form interactions with the second Fc on dIgA (or another Fc on pIgM) and likely exposes D1 residues such as His32 and Arg34, permitting the ligand to interact with regions previously buried by D4-D5. This incremental binding mechanism, particularly the secondary binding at a previously occluded site, might be necessary or advantageous for binding to a ligand in which binding sites are separated by a long distance (e.g., between adjacent Fcs in dIgA or pIgM) and/or to ensure binding at the correct site(s) if multiple binding sites are exposed on a ligand. Following transcytosis to the apical membrane, the pIgR-pIg complexes are released into the mucosa as SIgA or SIgM, and pIg-associated SC retains an open conformation. In contrast, unliganded pIgR released at the apical membrane as free SC would maintain a stable, closed conformation that promotes SC’s innate immune function to recognize and exclude bacteria.</p><p>In summary, the high-resolution insights on SC structure and mechanism presented here provide a new framework on which to build understanding of mucosal immune evolution and function. Our model for mammalian SC mechanism provides an explanation for how mammalian SC structure evolved to maintain innate functions of unliganded SC while also adapting to bind mammalian pIgs, which are large, complicated molecules. Together with current and forthcoming biological data, these models facilitate insight into normal immune function and disease states while also providing a molecular basis on which to engineer new SC and SIg-based therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Construct design</title><p>The gene fragment encoding the human pIgR signal peptide and residues 1–547 was amplified from cDNA encoding full-length human pIgR (a gift from Roland Strong, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center) and sub-cloned into the pTT5 expression vector (NRC Biotechnology Research Institute) along with a 5’ Kozak sequence and a C-terminal StrepII affinity tag (residues Trp-Ser-His-Pro-Gln-Phe-Glu-Lys).

Successful search strategies resulted in placement of eight of ten possible domains in the asymmetric unit, although only D1 was placed in the same position in both hSC copies. Correct domain assignments were determined by inspection of simulated annealing composite omit maps generated in Phenix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>) and manual building of alternative sequences for D2-D4 using Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>). D5, the most divergent domain, was manually built into resulting difference maps using Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>). The crystallographic asymmetric unit (ASU) contained two structurally-similar copies of SC (room mean square deviation, rmsd, of 0.29Å for all common Cα atoms).</p><p>The final hSC model included residues 2–113, 116–333, 335–426, 432–549 (Chain A), residues 2–256, 260–330, 335–426, 432–549 (Chain B), and <italic>N</italic>-acetyl glucosamine (NAG) residues attached to Asn65, Asn72, Asn168, and Asn481, an α-1,6 fucose on the Asn72 NAG, and two SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> ions. One SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> is bound to D2 at a position between the A’ and B strands; the other is at the interface between D1 and D4, where it contacts the C’ and CDR3 from D1 and CDR2, C” and the C”-D loop in D4. Regions with unresolved main chain density that were not modeled were restricted to the D1-D2 and D3-D4 linkers and the D4 CDR3 loop. The model, including riding hydrogens and water molecules, was refined using Phenix Refine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afonine et al., 2012</xref>) using non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints and individual B-factors and validated using MolProbity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). NCS differences are largely restricted to the linkers between domains and flexible loops. For example, the D1-D2 linker residues 111–117, which form crystal contacts with D2 from a neighboring molecule, follows a different path in each NCS copy. This difference causes a 2–3Å shift of Cα atoms in the neighboring D2 C-C’ loop as well different side chain conformations of several loop residues.</p><p>The structure of tSC was determined by Single Wavelength Anomalous Dispersion (SAD) using iodide ions.

Several side chains of the D5 CDR1 contact a symmetry-related molecule in the crystal; however, these contacts are unlikely to alter the overall D5 CDR1 conformation because the main chain adopts the same conformation as the D2-D4 CDR1 loops. Crystal contacts with the D2 and D3 CDR2 loops involve extensive interactions that might influence the position of side chains. However, the overall conformations of the short, two-residue CDR2 loop in all SC domains appears more likely constrained by its flanking C’-C” strands than by crystal contacts, and the D2 and D3 CDR2 loops adopt the same conformation as the CDR2s in other domains, which are not influenced by crystal contacts.</p><p>NCBI Genbank accession numbers for SC sequences in alignment figures are: DOG (NP_001274081), COW (NP_776568), MOUSE (NP_035212), RAT (NP_036855), POSSUM (AAD41688) BOAR (NP_999324), CHICKEN (AAQ14493.1), FROG (ABK62772), ANOLE (XP_008113873), <italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic> (ADB81776.1), <italic>Salmo salar</italic> (ACX44838.1), <italic>Epinephelus coioides</italic> (ACV91878.1), <italic>Scophthalmus maximus</italic> (AGN54539.1), <italic>Danio rerio</italic> (NP_001289179.1), <italic>Paralichthys olivaceus</italic> (ADK91435.1), <italic>Cyprinus carpio</italic> (ADB97624.1), <italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic> (NP_001266944.1), <italic>Gadus morhua</italic> (AIR74929.1).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Senior and Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Review:</p><p>The manuscript &quot;The Structure and Dynamics of Secretory Component and its Interactions with Polymeric Immunoglobulins&quot; by Stadtmueller et al. presents the crystal structure of the 5 domain human secretory component (hSC) at 2.6 Å resolution. This structure reveals the organization of domains and the location of regions previously implicated in recognition of IgA and IgM, defines folding topology of variable Ig domains, and visualizes domain interfaces and orientations. The authors use DEER spectroscopy to assess solution conformation, heterogeneity and domain flexibility and to reveal a movement of ~40 Å between D1 and D5 domains. These experiments showed that dimeric IgA (dIgA) and polymeric IgM (pIgM) binding caused a conformational change, consistent with the notion that D1 needs to dissociate from the inter-domain interaction with D5 in order to bind ligands. The results from the SPR experiments suggested that Domains 2-5 contribute to ligand binding to various degrees. Based on these results, the authors proposed a model for how pIgR transports dIgA and pIgM and how it may act on its own as an innate immunity receptor.</p><p>Next the authors analyze the structure of the teleost fish secretory component. The structure of tSC reveals a protein with IgSF fold, where tD1 and tD2 correspond to D1 and D5, in hSC respectively. They follow this up with a careful dissection of hSC domain affinities to functional ligands and end with a schematic summarizing findings for pIgR transcytosis, ligand binding and release of free SC and SIgA. Lastly the authors investigate the SC-pIg interactions by SPR and show that D1 is required for ligand binding while other domains contribute to it.</p><p>The experiments presented in the manuscript are well executed and presented in straightforward fashion. Altogether, the manuscript by Stadtmueller et al. is novel and timely, showing for the first time an intact crystal structure of SC proteins of human and teleost origin.</p><p>Major Comments:</p><p>The editor and reviewers recognize that the results that are presented in the manuscript represent a substantial body of work. Nevertheless, the following issues were identified by the reviewers as ones that, if addressed, could improve the impact of the findings. Please respond to these comments using your own judgement. We appreciate that additional experimentation may not by feasible in a timely manner, but the manuscript should be revised in the light of these comments:</p><p>1) The crystal structures are interesting and represent a substantial advance. The DEER experiments do not contribute much beyond demonstrating that a conformational change occurs upon ligand binding. The actual conformation of the ligand bound SC remains unknown. Similarly, the results on the contributions of different domains to ligand binding are suggestive, but the observed effects are subtle and hard to interpret due to the limited combinations of the domains that were tested. These results do not make it clear how and to what degree each domain is involved in ligand binding, either directly or indirectly through controlling the conformation and accessibility of D1.</p><p>2) It is not clear to what extent the inclusion of the fish structure advances understanding. Its inclusion here leaves a number of questions unanswered, such as the degree of conformational reorganization for fish SC function.</p><p>3) One particularly interesting aspect indicated by the structure but not followed up by the authors is that the interface between D1 and D5. The authors speculated that this interaction helps protect SC from proteolysis, or stabilizes the conformation that binds commensal and/or pathogenic bacteria. None of these ideas were explored. Moreover, the authors suggest that the D1/D5 interaction may be modulated by pH changes in mucosa, as the interface involves a Histidine residue. This hypothesis is interesting, and could potentially be tested by the DEER assay as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, through changing the pH of the assay buffer. It might be informative to make some mutations at the interface. Some mutations may enhance binding to dIgA and/or pIgM, and meanwhile disrupt interactions with its bacteria ligands.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10640.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] We appreciate that additional experimentation may not by feasible in a timely manner, but the manuscript should be revised in the light of these comments:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The crystal structures are interesting and represent a substantial advance.

In addition, the significance of the DEER data demonstrating that the closed conformation is the predominant solution conformation should not be underestimated. These data show that hSC is closed (until encountering ligand) rather than existing in equilibrium with alternative states such as intermediates on pathway to ligand binding, and validate the crystal structure, eliminating concern that the observed compact conformation resulted from crystal packing. The DEER data further reveal heterogeneous hSC structures upon ligand binding, indicative of binding intermediates and/or complex flexibility. This type of information is important for understanding SIgA/SIgM complex structure(s) and demonstrate that the complex structures are not accessible to methods such as crystallography or electron microscopy that require rigid and uniform structures. Many structural projects would benefit from a similar combined-methods approach, thus we believe our paper will be useful to others studying systems involving flexible protein complexes.</p><p><italic>Similarly, the results on the contributions of different domains to ligand binding are suggestive, but the observed effects are subtle and hard to interpret due to the limited combinations of the domains that were tested. These results do not make it clear how and to what degree each domain is involved in ligand binding, either directly or indirectly through controlling the conformation and accessibility of D1.</italic></p><p>Interpreting binding data to define precise role(s) for each domain is challenging. This challenge arises largely from the difficulty of identifying accurate kinetic models to describe SPR data as well as the possibility that altering domain arrangement will affect SC conformation in an unpredictable and undetectable manner. While testing additional combinations of domains cannot fully remedy this problem, we have now included new SPR data for the binding of a D1-D3-D4-D5 variant (equivalent to SC from birds, reptiles and amphibians) to dIgA and dIgM. These new data, along with a re-worded Discussion that describes our SPR data in the context of accompanying structural and biophysical data, clarify how individual SC domains participate in the ligand binding mechanism.</p><p><italic>2) It is not clear to what extent the inclusion of the fish structure advances understanding. Its inclusion here leaves a number of questions unanswered, such as the degree of conformational reorganization for fish SC function.</italic></p><p>The fish SC structure, along with the human SC structure, provides a structural basis for understanding evolutionary changes in mucosal immune function, which include but are not limited to demonstrating that a closed conformation of SC is not required for function in early vertebrates. Furthermore, we used the tSC structure to design the chimeric human/fish pIgR molecules, which are used for binding studies in the manuscript. It would be difficult to rationalize the details of the construction of the chimeric pIgR constructs without presenting the fish SC structure.</p><p><italic>3) One particularly interesting aspect indicated by the structure but not followed up by the authors is that the interface between D1 and D5. The authors speculated that this interaction helps protect SC from proteolysis, or stabilizes the conformation that binds commensal and/or pathogenic bacteria. None of these ideas were explored. Moreover, the authors suggest that the D1/D5 interaction may be modulated by pH changes in mucosa, as the interface involves a Histidine residue. This hypothesis is interesting, and could potentially be tested by the DEER assay as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, through changing the pH of the assay buffer. It might be informative to make some mutations at the interface. Some mutations may enhance binding to dIgA and/or pIgM, and meanwhile disrupt interactions with its bacteria ligands.</italic></p><p>Although our data do not fully explore how the closed hSC conformation contributes to specific SC functions, we point out that until now, it was not thought that a closed state of pIgR/SC existed. We anticipate that scientists in other fields will design experiments to address whether the closed SC conformation is important for microbiota homeostasis, whether it prolongs the functional life of SC in the harsh mucosal environment, and whether it promotes the binding of other factors in vivo. However, these questions would require animal studies that are beyond the scope of the present paper.</p><p>Determining how pH modulates the stability of the D1-D5 interface is non-trivial. hSC crystallized at a pH of 5.5 and DEER experiments were conducted at a pH of 7.4 and both revealed a closed hSC conformation. Since hSC is closed at basic pH, DEER would not detect enhanced stability of the closed conformation at a lower pH. Within a pH range of 5.5-7.4, the amount of time that hSC spends in the closed conformation in vitro is likely to be constant. However, in the mucosa where hSC may face destabilizing factors, such as age, degradation, and/or interactions with proteins or bacteria, a salt bridge between D1 and D5 may stabilize the closed conformation. Until such destabilizing factors are identified, it would be difficult to test the importance of the histidine-mediated interaction between D1 and D5 in a meaningful way.</p></body></sub-article></article>
