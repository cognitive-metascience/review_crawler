Here, we show that cAMP enhances the generation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in multiple cell types. 5hmC is converted from 5-methylcytosine (5mC) by Tet methylcytosine dioxygenases, for which Fe(II) is an essential cofactor. The promotion of 5hmC was mediated by a prompt increase of the intracellular labile Fe(II) pool (LIP). cAMP enhanced the acidification of endosomes for Fe(II) release to the LIP likely through RapGEF2. The effect of cAMP on Fe(II) and 5hmC was confirmed by adenylate cyclase activators, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and most notably by stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). The transcriptomic changes caused by cAMP occurred in concert with 5hmC elevation in differentially transcribed genes. Collectively, these data show a previously unrecognized regulation of gene transcription by GPCR-cAMP signaling through augmentation of the intracellular labile Fe(II) pool and DNA hydroxymethylation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cAMP</kwd><kwd>labile Fe(II)</kwd><kwd>5-hydroxymethylcytosine</kwd><kwd>GPCR</kwd><kwd>RapGEF2</kwd><kwd>PKA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21CA191668</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Gaofeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS089525</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Gaofeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM079465</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Christopher J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>cAMP is identified to play a novel role in regulating DNA demethylation and gene transcription by augmenting the intracellular reactive Fe(II) pool.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cyclic AMP (cAMP), the second messenger, converts the binding of ligands with many different G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs, also known as seven-transmembrane domain receptors) into various biological activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sutherland, 1970</xref>). Principally, cAMP exerts its function through three major targets â cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (CNGCs), and exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac). It is well known that cAMP has an impact on gene transcription, which is currently considered to be mediated by the PKA-targeted transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Montminy, 1997</xref>). Three transcription factors, including cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), cAMP response element modulator (CREM), and activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1), can be phosphorylated by PKA and subsequently bind to cAMP response elements (CRE) in gene promoters, generally to activate gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sands and Palmer, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Schwann cells form the myelin sheath of axons within the peripheral nervous system. cAMP is a known instructive signal for Schwann cell differentiation into a myelinating phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jessen et al., 1991</xref>). cAMP directly induces cell cycle arrest along with the expression of a wide variety of myelination-associated genes such as <italic>Egr2/Krox20</italic>, a transcription factor that is considered a master regulator of the myelin program, and myelin protein zero, the main peripheral nerve myelin protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bacallao and Monje, 2015</xref>). However, the mechanism by which cAMP regulates transcription and promotes the differentiation of Schwann cells is not fully understood.</p><p>DNA methylation is one ofÂ theÂ major epigenetic marks that regulates gene transcription. Active DNA demethylation is catalyzed by ten-eleven translocation (Tet) methylcytosine dioxygenases, which oxidize 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tahiliani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kriaucionis and Heintz, 2009</xref>), and further to 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">He et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ito et al., 2011</xref>). 5fC and 5caC are ultimately replaced by unmodified cytosine (5C) to complete cytosine demethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pastor et al., 2013</xref>). It is noteworthy that 5hmC is also a unique epigenetic mark with regulatory capacities in addition to being a DNA demethylation intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shen et al., 2014</xref>). Tet belongs to the iron and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG, alternatively known as Î±-ketoglutarate)-dependent dioxygenase family which utilizes labile Fe(II) as a cofactor and 2OG as a co-substrate. We and others have shown that ascorbate, which has the capacity to reduce the redox-inactive Fe(III)/Fe(IV) to Fe(II), is another cofactor for Tet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Minor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blaschke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dickson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, ascorbate has an impact on DNA demethylation by promoting the availability of redox-active Fe(II) to Tet. 5mC and 5hmC are major epigenetic marks that govern both cell identity and cellular phenotype transformation. Thus, it is plausible that such marks are involved in the transition of Schwann cells from the immature to myelinating phenotype.</p><p>Similar to cAMP, ascorbate was identified as another essential factor for Schwann cells to initiate and promote myelin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bunge et al., 1986</xref>). Intracellular ascorbate deficiency can cause hypomyelination in modeled rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gess et al., 2011</xref>). It is plausible that, by regulating DNA demethylation, ascorbate alters the cellular phenotype of Schwann cells towards a myelinating state. Based on this shared function in enhancing Schwann cell myelination, we reasoned that cAMP, like ascorbate, might also play a role in Tet-mediated DNA demethylation. Here, we investigated the potential role of cAMP in DNA demethylation. We identified that cAMP enhanced the generation of 5hmC in cultured Schwann cells. The effect of cAMP on 5hmC was not limited to Schwann cells but is likely a general effect, as it has been verified in other cell types. cAMP promptly increased the intracellular labile Fe(II) pool (LIP) independently of major cAMP targets but likely through RapGEF2 to enhance the acidification of endosomes and subsequently elevate the LIP, suggesting that an increase in labile Fe(II) over basal levels could mediate the effect of cAMP on 5hmC by activating Tet activity. The effect of cAMP on Fe(II) and 5hmC was mimicked by the addition of AC activators and phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors such as caffeine. Stimulation of Schwann cells with isoproterenol or calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), two ligands known to increase intracellular cAMP through Gs-coupled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 1995</xref>), elevated levels of intracellular labile Fe(II) and 5hmC. Furthermore, stimulation with cAMP caused a genome-wide shift in 5hmC profile, which correlated with a majority of the differentially expressed transcripts in Schwann cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>cAMP promotes 5hmc generation</title><p>In the absence of cAMP treatment, 5hmC was barely detectable by dot blot in primary cultured rat Schwann cells.

Encouraged by this initial observation, we investigated the role of cAMP on 5hmC by immunofluorescence (IF).

An enhanced generation of 5hmC was also verified in other cell types examined, such as HEK-293 cells, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, indicating that the effect of cAMP on 5hmC is not limited to Schwann cells and is likely to be a general effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29750.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>cAMP induces 5hmC in cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dot-blot shows that treatment with ascorbate (50 Î¼M) for 3 days or cAMP (100 Î¼M) for 7 days induced 5hmC in Schwann cells.

Shorter treatments (1â4 hr) with cAMP (10 Î¼M) or forskolin (10 Î¼M) followed by washout also induced 5hmC elevation at levels comparable to continuous treatment for 24 hr in HEK-293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). However, unlike in Schwann cells, 5hmC level appeared to retreat toward the base line at the 72 hr time point in the fast replicating HEK-293 cells. Since 5hmC is not maintained during DNA synthesis, it is thus reasonable that 5hmC could be kept longer in the slowly dividing Schwann cells after termination of cAMP signaling. These experiments suggest that cAMP can produce a persistent increase in 5hmC, which can be detected within a few hours after treatment and last for several days depending on cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>cAMP increases the intracellular labile Fe(II) pool to generate 5hmC</title><p>To understand how cAMP enhances 5hmC generation, we first examined the transcription of <italic>Tet</italic>. mRNA levels of <italic>Tet2</italic> and <italic>Tet3</italic> were decreased, whereas <italic>Tet1</italic> mRNA remained unchanged after treatment with cAMP (100 Î¼M) for 1 day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>), a time point at which cAMP clearly promoted 5hmC generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>).

In healthy cells such as primary cultured Schwann cells, the most plausible rate-limiting factor for Tetâs enzymatic activity is the replenishment of the Fe(II) cofactor rather than 2OG, a relatively abundant intermediate of the Krebs cycle. We thus hypothesized that cAMP may increase access to bioavailable Fe(II), as does ascorbate. To test this hypothesis, we used two different chemical probes for assaying bioavailable Fe(II). The first probe is Trx-Puro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Spangler et al., 2016</xref>), a recently developed reactivity-based probe that is highly specific for redoxâactive labile Fe(II) within the cell. Reaction of Trx-Puro with labile Fe(II) unmasks the aminonucleoside puromycin through a Fenton-type reaction. Released puromycin is incorporated in cellular proteomes, which can be visualized using a convenient IF assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Spangler et al., 2016</xref>). Treatment with cAMP at a dose as low as 1 Î¼M increased intracellular labile Fe(II), which reached even higher levels after treatment with 10â100 Î¼M cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Incubation of the cells with Diox-Puro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Spangler et al., 2016</xref>), a dioxolane control conjugate that is non-peroxidic, showed no IF signal after cAMP treatment indicating the Fe(II) dependence of the signal detected by Trx-Puro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

However, the specific signaling molecules that serve as mediators between environmental variation and epigenomic changes remain largely elusive. On the other hand, GPCRs, the largest and most diverse group of membrane receptors, sense extracellular changes by binding with specific ligands. Signaling of cAMP, one major second messenger of the GPCRs, and its targets has been thoroughly studied and was thought to be well established. Our results show a previously unknown pathway of GPCR-cAMP signaling in promoting the intracellular labile Fe(II) pool, enhancing DNA hydroxymethylation and consequently changing gene transcription.</p><p>The convergence of 5hmC generation and labile Fe(II) concentrations suggests a previously unrecognized role for labile Fe(II) in propagating a signal initiated by cAMP and mediated by the Fe(II)-dependent oxidase activity of Tet. This new role for iron is a plausible one given that cellular iron uptake and the shuttling of iron from storage in ferritin as Fe(III) to its entry into the cytosolic labile pool of Fe(II) is a fundamental aspect of cellular iron metabolism. While this process is clearly involved in maintaining iron homeostasis and the biosynthesis of Fe(II) cofactors, it appears also to have been appropriated for cellular signaling in the particular case of enzymes that employ labile Fe(II) as an essential co-factor, such as the iron and 2OG-dependent Tet and Jumonji C domain-containing histone demethylases. The changes to labile cytosolic Fe(II) measured by Trx-Puro likely also reflect the nuclear Fe(II) pool, since there is a rapid equilibrium between these two Fe(II) pools, presumably via nuclear pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the results described above suggest that cAMP increases the accessibility of Fe(II) to Tet by augmenting labile Fe(II) in the cytosol and nucleus.</p><p>An increase in labile Fe(II) can be induced by cAMP in as little as 2 hr, indicating that no new protein synthesis is required. The molecular mechanism by which cAMP alters labile Fe(II) appears to be related to iron uptake rather than release from storage in ferritin. Cellular iron uptake is a multistep process including internalization of the transferrin-transferrin receptor complex, vesicle formation, endosome acidification, Fe(III) discharge, conversion of Fe(III) to Fe(II), and release of Fe(II) from the endosome to the LIP. cAMP could potentially be involved in each step of iron uptake. Our results suggest that cAMP signaling increases the acidification of endocytotic vesicles, which is essential for Fe(III) discharge from the internalized transferrin. This is consistent with earlier studies showing that cholera and pertussis toxins, by increasing intracellular cAMP, enhance endosome acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Van Dyke, 1997</xref>). It could be that cAMP signaling increased the number and/or activity of V-ATPase to pump H<sup>+</sup> into the endosome to release Fe(II) to the LIP, which subsequently promotes 5hmC generation. Indeed, we showed that inhibitors of V-ATPase largely abolish the effect of cAMP on labile Fe(II) and 5hmC.</p><p>The elevation of labile Fe(II) by cAMP signaling appears independent of the major targets of cAMP including PKA, Epac, and CNGC. We examined the effect of RapGEF2 initially based on its higher expression level in Schwann cells. cAMP failed to induce labile Fe(II) and 5hmC once the expression of RapGEF2 or Rap1 was reduced, suggesting that RapGEF2 and its downstream effector Rap1 could be at least major mediators of cAMP to regulate labile Fe(II) and 5hmC. Thus, it is plausible that RapGEF2, directly or indirectly, affects the number and/or activity of V-ATPase in the endosome. Future studies are warranted to investigate how RapGEF2 and Rap1 regulate the function of V-ATPase.</p><p>Both cAMP and ascorbate appear to enhance the activity of Tet to generate 5hmC. However, the mechanisms of cAMP and ascorbate in promoting the availability of Fe(II) to Tet are likely different. Ascorbate at physiological concentrations has no obvious influence on intracellular labile Fe(II) shown here and before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Spangler et al., 2016</xref>), but is thought to maintain local iron in the active form of Fe(II) for Tet as it does for other hydroxylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mandl et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, cAMP elevates the global intracellular labile Fe(II) pool.</p><p>For the first time, GPCRs via cAMP are directly linked to epigenetic regulation. The first hint of a possible role for cAMP in DNA hydroxymethylation came from studies on Schwann cells. Using Schwann cells as a model, we showed that intracellular cAMP elevation increased the intracellular labile Fe(II) pool, changed genome-wide 5hmC profile, and altered the transcription of many genes. More importantly, activation of different Gs-coupled receptors demonstrated increases in intracellular labile Fe(II) and 5hmC similarly to treatments that elevate intracellular cAMP including membrane permeable cAMP, AC activators, or PDE inhibitors. Coupled with Gs, Gi, or both, GPCRs can raise or decrease the intracellular cAMP, which will further change DNA methylation-demethylation dynamics. Thus GPCRs, via cAMP, transduce microenvironmental cues to epigenetic alterations.</p><p>One recent study showed that cAMP has an impact on DNA methylation by mainly increasing the expression of Tet or DNA methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fang et al., 2015</xref>). This may not be a general effect but more likely a cell-specific effect since we observed a decreased expression of Tet2 and Tet3 in Schwann cells after cAMP treatment.</p><p>In this study, most experiments were conducted in Schwann cells. However, the effect of cAMP on 5hmC is not limited to Schwann cells and is likely a general effect, as it has been verified in other cell types. Studies have shown that 5hmC is not only a demethylation intermediate but also a unique epigenetic mark that regulates transcription by recruiting a different set of binding proteins compared to 5mC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Spruijt et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, altered 5hmC profiles caused by cAMP correlated with a majority of differentially transcribed genes. Thus, cAMP regulates the transcriptome by enhancing DNA demethylation, in addition to the known pathway of PKA-targeted transcription factors. In silico analysis suggests that some differential transcripts correlate with either 5hmC or the three transcription factors, while other transcripts correlate with both or none of them. The focus of this study is to connect the dots from GPCR agonists to cAMP, elevated Fe(II), 5hmC formation, and ultimately transcriptional effects. Future studies can dissect the impact of cAMP on the transcriptome and the contribution of 5hmC and/or the three transcription factors in different cell types.</p><p>In conclusion, our results show a novel function of cAMP signaling in regulating DNA hydroxymethylation by increasing the intracellular labile Fe(II) pool likely via a non-canonical pathway, which consequently promotes the oxidation of 5mC to 5hmC by Fe(II)-dependent Tet. Dynamic intracellular cAMP, regulated by Gs-/Gi-coupled receptors and factors affecting AC/PDE directly, therefore could have a profound impact on the epigenome.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>cAMP [8-(4-Chlorophenylthio) adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate] and AMP (8- Bromoadenosine-5-O-monophosphate) were purchased from Biolog (US distributor, Axxora LLC, San Diego, CA).

Raw read data was first run through quality control metrics using FastQC (http: //www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Reads were trimmed with trim_galore (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/</ext-link>) to remove low-quality bases from reads (scoresÂ &lt;Â 20 in PhredÂ +Â 33 format) and Illumina adapters. After quality control was checked and trimming performed, sequence reads were aligned to the rat transcriptome (Rnor_6.0, Ensembl.org) and quantified using the STAR aligner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>), and normalized using CuffQuant and CuffNorm, which are part of the Tuxedo Suite (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Trapnell et al., 2012</xref>).</italic> All samples had between 37,714,718 and 52,162,956 aligned reads. Statistical significance was determined using three alternative differential expression calculators: edgeR, DESeq2, and CuffDiff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Love et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Trapnell et al., 2012</xref>). To reduce false positives, differentially expressed features were determined by cutoff adjusted <italic>P</italic> values below 0.05 across all three methods (false discovery rate, FDR). DESeq2 called 8589 differential transcripts, edgeR called 8029 differential transcripts, and CuffDiff called 8076 differential transcripts with a total of 7020 transcripts called as differential by all three programs. Of the 7020 transcripts, 3809 transcripts increase in expression and 3211 transcripts decrease after treatment with cAMP. Differential transcripts were visualized using z-scores per transcript where blue represents lower expression and red represents higher expression in the form of a heatmap generated using the heatmap.2 function of gplots (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gplots/index.html">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gplots/index.html</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>hMeDIP-seq</title><p>Genomic DNA was extracted from Schwann cells using QIAamp DNA mini kits from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. A Qubit Fluorometer from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used to quantify the concentration of DNA. A Bioanalyzer 2000 was used to measure the quality of DNA. DNA was submitted for hydroxymethylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (hMeDIP-seq) at the Epigenomics Core at the University of Michigan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mohn et al., 2009</xref>). hMeDIP-seq was performed with three replicates per group to giveÂ ~98% power to detect a 2-fold change between groups and a standard deviation of 19% of the mean. This standard deviation was calculated from actual data used for analysis. Briefly, DNA is sonicated to approximately 100 bp and then ligated with Illumina adaptors. A portion of the DNA was set aside for sequencing as unprecipitated input DNA and the remaining DNA was incubated overnight at 4 ËC with an antibody against 5hmC from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA). The antibodies, along with immunoprecipitated DNA, were then pulled out of solution using Protein G magnetic beads from Invitrogen, (Carlsbad, CA). Magnetic beads were then washed with immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0 with 140 mM NaCl and 0.05% triton x-100). The beads were then resuspended in proteinase K buffer and incubated for 3 hr at 55 ËC to remove the antibodies from the DNA. Unprecipitated input DNA was incubated with proteinase K buffer alongside the precipitated DNA. After proteinase K treatment, DNA was purified using AMPure beads from Beckman Coulter (Brea, California). Efficiency of immunoprecipitation was evaluated using the 5hmC, 5mC, cytosine DNA standard pack from Diagenode (Searing, Belgium). DNA was then sequenced on a HiSeq4000 sequencing system (50 bp single-end reads, three samples per lane; Illumina, San Diego, CA). Immunoprecipitated samples all had between 123,192,512 and 143,992,231 reads and unprecipitated input samples all had between 84,030,758 and 142,427,775 reads.</p><p>Reads were trimmed with trim_galore to remove low quality bases from reads (scoresÂ &lt;Â 20 in PhredÂ +Â 33 format), and Illumina adapters. After quality control was checked sequence reads were aligned to the rat genome (Rnor_6.0, Ensembl.org) using BWA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>). All immunoprecipitated samples had between 117,762,176 and 137,740,430 aligned reads and unprecipitated input samples had between 80,822,191 and 138,629,799 aligned reads. Multimapped reads were removed using Samtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2009b</xref>) and duplicate reads were removed using PicardTools (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/">https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>). All precipitated samples had between 63,471,316 and 78,618,595 uniquely aligned reads and all unprecipitated input samples had between 44,195,649 and 80,394,782. To identify regions of the genome with substantial levels of 5hmC, peaks were called and filtered using the Irreproducible Discovery Rate (IDR) method developed for the ChIP-seq portion of the ENCODE project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, peak calling was performed with MACS2 using the narrow peak mode and a relaxed threshold of 0.001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). The number of peaks called for the control samples were 364,776, 346,424, and 331,841. The number of peaks called for the cAMP samples were 367,389, 356,223, and 351,249. Peaks were ranked from strongest to weakest peaks in each individual sample, and the rank order of common peaks among samples was compared to filter for only peaks with similar strength across all samples using the R-scripts provided for the IDR pipeline with a threshold of 0.02. After filtering for peaks in common, 106,807 peaks remained for the cAMP samples and 120,057 peaks remained for the control samples. The lower number of filtered peaks among the cAMP samples is likely a result of treatment causing higher variability in 5hmC levels in samples. When peaks across sample types were merged, a total of 192,143 peaks remained to be investigated in all samples. Reads within peak regions were quantified using HT-Seq-count (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anders et al., 2015</xref>). Statistical significance was determined using edgeR as was used for RNA-seq, except without using the calcNormFactors function so as to normalize to total read counts rather than counts within peaks. This normalization was necessary to account for a global change in 5hmC levels. Differential expression was also calculated using DESeq2. To minimize false positives, we considered only peaks with a minimum of 2X fold change and below an adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value (false discovery rate, FDR) below 0.05 by both edgeR and DESeq2. By this method, 66,963 peaks were upregulated, and 10,026 peaks were downregulated after treatment with cAMP, and 115,154 peaks remained unchanged.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Sequencing reads visualization</title><p>For each individual sample, coverage at each base in the genome was calculated and normalized to total read count using bedtools genomecov (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/genomecov.html">http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/genomecov.html</ext-link>). Coverage files were converted to bigwig files using the wigToBigWig program from UCSC genome browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/linux.x86_64.v287/">http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/linux.x86_64.v287/</ext-link>). Read density for peaks in each sample was visualized using version 2 of DeepTools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">RamÃ­rez et al., 2016</xref>) and individual bigwig files. Visualization of read density across differential genes was also performed using DeepTools and the merged bigwig files.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Integration of hMeDIP-seq and RNA-seq</title><p>5hmC peaks were assigned to regions of the genome using Region_analysis in the diffReps package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shen et al., 2013</xref>). Peaks whose center was within 3,000 bp of the transcription start site (TSS) of a given gene were considered promoter regions for that gene, and peaks whose center lay in the remainder of the gene or up to 1,000 bp following the transcription end site (TES) were considered gene body for that gene. Peaks outside of gene body regions and gene promoter regions were classified as intergenic. Differential transcripts, with differential peaks assigned to either the promoter region or gene body of that gene, were considered to be potentially regulated by 5hmC. Of the 7020 differential transcripts, 4071 (58%) were found to be potentially regulated by 5hmC. Further, visualization of both RNA-seq and hMeDIP-seq data was done using UCSC genome browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/">https://genome.ucsc.edu/</ext-link>) and bigwig files showing loci of differential transcripts.</p><p>It is known that elevation of cAMP regulates the activity of three different transcription factors: CREB1, CREM and ATF1. The Maâayan laboratory has posted analyzed data online from both the ChEA and ENCODE projects (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/X2K/#downloads">http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/X2K/#downloads</ext-link>). To find genes potentially regulated by these three transcription factors, we used the ENCODE 2015 and ChEA 2015 databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yip et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lachmann et al., 2010</xref>). Experiments using rat cells are uncommon in these databases, so we combined the lists of genes found regulated by all experiments of a given transcription factor from human, mouse, or rat experiments. ATF1 was found to regulate 2000 genes across a variety of human cells in the ENCODE projects, of which 1996 genes were found to have a rat homolog in the Jackson Labs Complete Homology Class report (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/homology.shtml">http://www.informatics.jax.org/homology.shtml</ext-link>). CREM was found to regulate 5776 genes in mouse testicular cells (GC1-SPG) in the ChEA project, of which 5773 were found to have a rat homolog in the Jackson Labs Complete Homology Class report. CREB1 was found to regulate 4040 genes across human leukemia (K562) and adenocarcinoma (A549) cells in the ENCODE project, as well as 957 genes in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells in the ChEA project. CREB1 was also found to regulate 2393 genes in rat hippocampus and 3057 genes in mouse testicular cells (GC1-SPG) in the ChEA project. Combining data from all CREB1 experiments in both ChEA and ENCODE gave 6997 rat genes potentially regulated by CREB1. Combining results from all experiments of all three transcription factors, 9767 genes have been found to potentially be regulated by at least one of these three transcription factors. Of the 7020 differential transcripts, 3965 (56.5%) were included in the list of genes potentially regulated by one of the three transcription factors that is activated by cAMP/PKA. Differences in transcription can be possibly attributed to both transcription factors and changes in 5hmC for 2372 (33.8%) of the 7020 transcripts and 1356 (19.3%) are not likely regulated by either transcription factor or 5hmC.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work is supported by NIH grants (R01NS089525, R21CA191668 to GW and GM079465 to CJC) and a Craig H Neilsen Foundation grant (M1501061 to PVM).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. One of the reviewers, Yehia Daaka, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, Camarena et al. examine the contribution of extracellular cues to the regulation of epigenetic modifications, focusing on GPCR-based regulation of the Tet DNA demethylase. The authors delineate a mechanism by which GPCR signaling via cAMP induces endosome acidification, leading to the release of iron, which serves as a cofactor for Tet enzymes. This pathway operates independently of classical cAMP effectors, but requires RapGEF2 for endosome acidification. This work highlights an unappreciated role for GPCR signaling in regulating DNA methylation and gene expression.</p><p>The reviewers generally agree that this work is likely to be of significant interest to the community. Because of the potential of this work to be paradigm-shifting in the cAMP and DNA methylation fields, it is important that the authors further solidify their conclusions. The reviewers raised some major concerns which should be successfully addressed before the manuscript can be considered for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors have not adequately entertained alternative hypotheses, nor tested all assumptions regarding their own model. Specifically, the reviewers suggested that GPCR signaling might affect nuclear import of iron, and/ or processing of 5hmC to 5-formylcytosine or 5-carboxycytosine. Furthermore, the authors have not demonstrated that free iron (and endosome acidification) are limiting for Tet activity. The alternative hypotheses should be ruled out, and the idea that endosome acidification and iron availability are limiting demonstrated (reviewer #1 has suggestions on addressing these issues).</p><p>2) There are serious concerns from multiple reviewers regarding the dosage and duration of different treatments. Particularly concerning were the experiments done after 7 days of cAMP treatment, as physiological GPCR signaling is rapid and transient, and cells are likely to lose viability after 7 days of treatment. Questions regarding the type of cAMP analog used and its concentration, as well as the effects of the various activators/ inhibitors on cAMP, Fe++, and 5hmC levels at different timepoints, should be fully addressed.</p><p>3) Along the same lines, termination of the cAMP response has not been addressed. It would be important to show downregulation of the response by conducting a timecourse of Fe++ and 5hmC levels after forskolin washout. A similar timecourse experiment in the presence of cAMP should be done to show any sensitization effects, which are hinted at in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-D</xref>.</p><p>4) Additional mechanistic insight into RapGEF2 function should be provided. The authors should address whether the endosome acidification and LIP are mediated by Rap, and if so, which isoform. Secondly, the authors should address how RapGEF2 is affected by cAMP, e.g. by checking expression levels and subcellular localization.</p><p>5) The sequencing analysis should be done more thoroughly. The data should be collected at 48-72 hrs after cAMP treatment, and compared to the data collected at 7 days. Sequencing should consider methylation of promoters, enhancers, and gene bodies separately.</p><p>6) To increase confidence in the results, the authors should use complementary approaches (ideally something other than microscopy-based assays) whenever possible. Reviewer #3 has given suggestions on how to accomplish this.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting manuscript that describes enhanced DNA 5hmC modification induced by cAMP. The authors showed that cAMP promotes iron uptake through enhanced acidification of endosomes. The increase cellular labile iron(II) promotes TET activity on 5mC oxidation. There are two major weaknesses need to be addressed:</p><p>1) &quot;In healthy cells such as primary cultured Schwann 125 cells, the most plausible rate-limiting factor for Tet's enzymatic activity is the replenishment of the Fe(II) cofactor rather than 2OG, a relatively abundant intermediate of the Krebs cycle.&quot;</p><p>I agree 2OG may not be limiting factor but iron(II) is quite abundant as well. The abundance of nuclear iron(II) has not been adequately studied as iron(II) needs to be transported into nucleus in order to supply TET. This is maybe something the authors should really look into with the cAMP signaling. The authors should really isolate the nuclear fraction and use ICP-MS to study total iron level instead of whole cell. Or at least perform imaging of labile iron within nucleus. The technique I recommend is the synchrotron based X-ray fluorescence metal imaging.</p><p>The acidification of endosome is a good mechanism but I doubt it is the only one or the one that matters. Under different cellular signaling iron enriches in nucleus. cAMP might influence that pathway, which explains less effect observed with ferritin KD. If simply for the level of cytoplasmic iron level ferritin should have a major role.</p><p>2) The studies of 5hmC with gene expression changes are shallow. The authors mixed different effects here. Gene body 5hmC levels should correlate with mRNA level changes. Promoter 5hmC levels could go either way. Another place to really check is enhancer 5hmC level changes. More in depth analysis would help.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Camarena and colleagues examines contribution of extracellular cues to epigenetic modifications and the mechanisms involved using the specific case of Gs-coupled GPCR-regulated activation of 5hmC. Using genetic, biochemical, and cellular approaches, the authors delineate a signaling pathway showing increased intracellular cAMP levels lead to increased LIP through endosome acidification and RapGEF2. Based on experimental results, the authors conclude that augmented cAMP levels (including by Gs-coupled receptors) increase LIP and DNA demethylation. Although conclusions of this interesting report are supported by experimental results, few issues need to be addressed:</p><p>What is the effect of cAMP accumulation on 5hmC expression at early time points (say 1-24 hrs)?</p><p>Chemical reagents concentrations used (cAMP and inhibitors) are noticeably high (up to 100 microM); why? Also, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> the cAMP concentrations needed for (presumably maximal effects on) MEFs are lower than for other cell types. Any explanation?</p><p>The authors suggest that RapGEF2 regulates LIP in a mechanism that is dependent upon cAMP. What is the evidence for this conclusion? Also, does RapGEF2 promote activation of Rap? Other small GTPases? If Rap is the effector of RapGEF2, it would be interesting to identify what isoform of Rap is involved in the cAMP-induced LIP, and whether this effect is through endosome acidification?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In their study Camarena et al. investigate the role of cAMP in DNA methylation. Using mainly imaging approaches the authors conclude that cAMP enhances the generation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) (an indicator of DNA methylation/demethylation status) which results in significant changes in the programs of gene transcription of Schwann cells. The authors provide evidence suggesting that the increase in 5hmC levels in response to cAMP elevations may be a generalised event (Schwann; HEK; MEF and SYSH5 cells). The effects of cAMP on 5hmC levels seen independent of the classical cAMP effectors (PKA; EPACs etc.) and the ten-eleven translocation (Tet) proteins. On the contrary, the authors propose that cAMP enhances endosome acidification via RapGEF2 resulting in an increase in the levels of Fe(II) and essential cofactor of the Tet enzymes.</p><p>This is an interesting and thought provoking article that would be of interest in the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. However, at its present state the article presents a major issue: the timing and intensity of the cAMP (or cAMP triggering) treatments used, are not well defined and are far from being physiological, undermining the core hypothesis of the existence of a GPCR-cAMP-RapGEF2 axis.</p><p>1) cAMP treatments:</p><p>First of all the authors use the cell &quot;permeant&quot; cAMP analog 8-CPT-cAMP in a range from 1ÂµM to 250 ÂµM. Since it is not specified the type of 8-CPT-cAMP used (Na<sup>+</sup> salt Vs AM-ester) it is very difficult to understand the levels of the messenger at the cellular level. For instance if they used Na<sup>+</sup> salt in concentrations of low ÂµM the cellular levels of 8-CPT cAMP would be too low to activate any effector, on the contrary at 1ÂµM of the AM-ester the levels of cellular 8-CPT-cAMP would reach saturating values making difficult to reconcile the dose response data observed by the authors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>Secondly in addition to 8-CPT-cAMP the authors use other means to increase cellular cAMP levels. The concentration of FSK (100ÂµM) is far too much (saturating doses go from 10 to 25ÂµM) and the effect observed is basically the same as the treatments with IBMX (100ÂµM) to block PDEs, caffeine to block a subset of PDEs (and release Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the stores) and Bicarbonate (50mM) to activate only the soluble adenylyl cyclase that would produce a fraction (if any) of the FSK increases in cellular cAMP. The authors should measure the cellular levels of cAMP reached with these treatments (elisa or FRET-based assays).</p><p>2) Timing:cAMP signals are physiologically produced by GPCRs and are meant to be fast and transient. On the contrary here the authors treat their cells with 100ÂµM 8-CPT-cAMP from 1 to 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). The max effect on 5hmC levels is reached after 24h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and is maintained for 7 days. These data are not well matched to the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref> showing that the levels of Fe(II) peaked after 4h trending to decrease after that (what is the level of Fe(II) after 7days?). This is an important point since the authors for their RNA-seq experiments choose to treat their cells for 7 days with 100ÂµM 8CPT-cAMP.</p><p>3) Termination/feedback</p><p>In order to be conceived as a signalling cascade the GPCR-cAMP-RapGEF2 axis should undergo termination as well. This is something that is not suggested by the experiments on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref> where the levels of 5hmC remain high for the whole period of the treatment. On the contrary the trent of the Fe(II) levels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref> would suggest a negative feedback. The authors should perform a series of experiments addressing this point. For instance they could treat cells for 2-4 hours with FSK and then follow the levels of 5hmC and Fe(II) for a period of time (up to 24-48 hours) would be suggested. This is also relevant for the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> where treatment with extremely high doses of isoproterenol induces Fe(II) and 5hmC increases after 2 days. This is somewhat surprising since Î² receptors would most likely be internalised and desensitised with prolong treatments with saturating (1-2ÂµM) doses of Isoproterenol. This is a crucial point, as it is not conceivable that once activated this pathway cannot be turned off.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;cAMP Signaling Regulates DNA Demethylation by Augmenting the Intracellular Labile Ferrous Iron Pool&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Kevin Struhl (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The authors have shown intriguing new results that termination of GPCR signaling does not restore 5hmC levels to their basal state. The authors should solidify this finding by repeating the forskolin washout experiment in HEK293 cells, and assaying 5hmC levels at 72 hours. Based on the outcome of this experiment, the authors should provide a commentary as to the role of GPCR signaling in establishment vs. maintenance of 5hmC in different cell types.</p><p>2) In light of the above finding, the title should be made more accurate by referring to &quot;5hmC&quot; rather than &quot;demethylation,&quot; as the authors have not demonstrated full removal of the methyl mark in this system. Something like &quot;cAMP signaling regulates DNA 5hmC by augmenting the intracellular labile ferrous iron pool&quot; would more accurately reflect the results.</p><p>3) The authors write that the timepoints for sequencing analysis were chosen to allow analysis of the effects of GPCR signaling on myelinating genes. However, they mention only 2 individual genes involved in this process. The authors should use the sequencing data to provide a global analysis of myelinating genes, and any others involved in Schwann cell differentiation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29750.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Essential revisions:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The authors have not adequately entertained alternative hypotheses, nor tested all assumptions regarding their own model.

The hydroxylation of 5mC to 5hmC requires the following: the enzyme Tet methylcytosine dioxygenases (expressed in the cell), the substrate 5mC (abundant in the genome), the co-substrate 2OG, the cofactor Fe(II), and oxygen. If the limiting factor is not Fe(II), the alternative hypothesis could be that this chemical reaction is limited by 2OG and oxygen. However, under cell culture conditions, 2OG, which is a relatively abundant intermediate in the Krebs cycle, and oxygen are available to Tet. Despite their abundance, 5hmC was barely detectable in untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), suggesting that the halted hydroxylation catalyzed by Tet is not limited by 2OG or oxygen.</p><p>We and others have shown that ascorbate promotes the conversion of 5mC to 5hmC (Minor EM et al., JBC2013; Yin R et al., Blaschke K et al., Nature 2013; J Am Chem Soc 2013; Chen J et al., Nat Genet. 2013; Dickson KM et al., BBRC 2013). While 5hmC was nearly undetectable in untreated cells, ascorbate induced a strong increase of 5hmC in Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-B</xref>). Ascorbate has the capacity of reducing the catalytically inactive Fe(III)/Fe(IV) to Fe(II), which underlies the 5hmC increase, just as it does for collagen hydroxylases. These results suggest that Fe(II) is likely the limiting factor for 5hmC generation.</p><p>To further test whether Fe(II) is the limiting factor for 5hmC generation, we treated Schwann cells with Fe(II). Schwann cells cultured in media containing Fe(III) showed low basal levels of 5hmC. Addition of Fe(II) to the media induced 5hmC generation in the cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). These results suggest that Fe(II) is likely the limiting factor for 5hmC generation.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29750.030</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-29750-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>Robust 5hmC signal could be detected after cells were treated with cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The affinity of Tet for Fe(II) (KD) is about 0.41 Â± 0.05 Î¼M (Hore TA et al., PNAS 2016). TRX-puro probe detects labile Fe(II) in 0.1 ~ 1 Î¼M range (Spangler et al.,Nat Chem Biol. 2016), which corresponds to intracellular Fe(II) levels (Epsztejn S., et al. Blood1999). Using TRX-puro probe, we have detected obvious increases of labile Fe(II) by cAMP treatment, suggesting that an increase in labile Fe(II) over basal levels could mediate the effect of cAMP on 5hmC by activating Tet activity.</p><p>Furthermore, this effect of cAMP on 5hmC was largely abolished by treatment with two different iron chelators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-E</xref>), suggesting that the promotion of 5hmC by cAMP is dependent on iron. Endosome acidification is one key step for iron uptake. We showed that cAMP increased endosome acidification and that inhibition of V-ATPase diminished the effect of cAMP on labile Fe(II) and 5hmC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that labile Fe(II) is one key limiting factor for Tet activity.</p><p>While total iron could be abundant in the cells, labile Fe(II) must be tightly controlled due to its active redox activity, especially its ability to produce free radicals through the Fenton reaction (Dunn LL, et al., Trends Cell Biol. 2007). Currently, measuring labile Fe(II) in the cell still remains an experimental challenge. Even with these difficulties, we managed to show that cAMP elevated the total labile Fe(II) using Trx-Puro probes in the cell. To further confirm these results, we now show an obvious increase of labile Fe(II) in HEK-293 cells after cAMP treatment using another newly developed labile Fe(II) probe FIP-1 (Aron AT, et al., J Am ChemSoc.2016) in collaboration with Christopher Chang (UC Berkeley/HHMI). This new data is now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p>Little is known how labile Fe(II) enters the nucleus. It is generally accepted that there is a rapid equilibrium between the cytoplasmic labile pool and the nuclear labile Fe(II) pool, presumably via nuclear pores (Ma Y et al., Metallomics 2015), suggesting that cAMP could potentially elevate labile Fe(II) in the nucleus. Following the reviewerâs suggestion, we assessed total iron in the fractionated nuclear and cytoplasm extracts from HEK-293 cells treated with or without cAMP by ICP-MS. This experiment was completed by Christopher Changâs team. The results indicate that there is no significant change in total cellular iron after treatment with cAMP. It is noteworthy that the labile iron pool is only a very small part (0.2 ~0.3%) of total iron in the cell (Petrat F et al., Biol Chem. 2002). Therefore, it is reasonable that cAMP elevates labile Fe(II) but might not exert a detectable change in the total iron.</p><p>Labile Fe(II) is a cofactor for Tet methylcytosine dioxygenases, which can further oxidize 5hmC to 5fC and 5caC. Due to the fact that 5fC/5caC are rare in the genome and are relatively difficult to be accurately evaluated, we focused on 5hmC in the study. Because the principle of these Tet-mediated oxidation reactions is similar, it is plausible that cAMP promotes the conversion of 5mC to 5hmC, and further to 5fC and 5caC as well, which will be examined in our future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There are serious concerns from multiple reviewers regarding the dosage and duration of different treatments. Particularly concerning were the experiments done after 7 days of cAMP treatment, as physiological GPCR signaling is rapid and transient, and cells are likely to lose viability after 7 days of treatment. Questions regarding the type of cAMP analog used and its concentration, as well as the effects of the various activators/ inhibitors on cAMP, Fe++, and 5hmC levels at different timepoints, should be fully addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>Activation of Gs-coupled receptors elevates intracellular cAMP principally from these three steps: (1) activation of membrane bound AC; (2) GÎ²Î³ subunit activation of certain AC isoforms; (3) Continuous production of cAMP by Gs and AC in the endosome after receptor internalization.

Furthermore, in our initial experiments, Schwann cells had been treated with cAMP for up to 15 days and remained healthy as observed by Incucyte video and images.</p><p>The cAMP analog used was 8-CPT-cAMP (sodium salt), which is cell permeable and mimics the action of cAMP in the cell as do other cAMP analogues such as 8-CPT-cAMP-AM. We thank the reviewerâs insightful comments about membrane permeability of 8-CPT-cAMP (sodium salt). It is now clear to us that the permeability of 8-CPT-cAMP is only about 22% of what is applied extracellularly (Wener K et al., Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol. 2011). Even with this less-than-ideal permeability, 1 Î¼M 8-CPT-cAMP still caused an obvious elevation of labile Fe(II). By examining the dose-dependent effect of 8-CPT-cAMP on labile Fe(II) and 5hmC, we showed that 8-CPT-cAMP at 100 Î¼M induced robust increases in both labile Fe(II) and 5hmC. Since 8-CPT-cAMP at 100 Î¼M promotes cultured Schwann cells into a promyelinating phenotype (Monje PV et al., Glia. 2009), we then selected this treatment for high-throughput sequencing.</p><p>Forskolin treatment was initially carried out at 100 Î¼M because forskolin at 100 Î¼M produces a maximal increase of intracellular cAMP in Schwann cells (Yoshimura T et al., Neurochemical Research 1994). Following the reviewerâs suggestion, we have replicated the effect of forskolin at much lower concentrations (5 and 10 Î¼M) on 5hmC (now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>) and on labile Fe(II) (now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Bicarbonate was used at 50 Î¼M which was shown to induce a maximal effect on cAMP (Chen Y et al., Science 2000). Caffeine and IBMX concentrations were chosen at 100 Î¼M to inhibit phosphodiesterases based on previous publications (Fredholm BB et al., Pharmacological Reviews 1999). The effect of cAMP was further verified by stimulation of Gs-coupled receptors.</p><p>We also include new data showing that short term treatment (such as 1 h) and lower concentrations of cAMP (10 Î¼M) and forskolin (5 or 10 Î¼M) elevated 5hmC in the cell (now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). These data suggest that the effect of cAMP on Fe(II) is likely rapid and is responsible for activating Tet to produce 5hmC. However, our ability to observe changes in the LIP at very early time points (&lt; 2 h) is limited with TRX-puro. This is because the rate-limiting step in puromycin release is a Î²-elimination reaction that occurs subsequent to reaction of TRX-puro with Fe(II) (see Spangler et al., Nat Chem Biol. 2016). We believe that the delay in peak Fe(II) signal compared to 5hmC signal is significantly a result of puromycin release kinetics rather than a delayed mobilization of Fe(II).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Along the same lines, termination of the cAMP response has not been addressed. It would be important to show downregulation of the response by conducting a timecourse of Fe++ and 5hmC levels after forskolin washout.

This is also relevant for the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> where treatment with extremely high doses of isoproterenol induces Fe(II) and 5hmC increases after 2 days. This is somewhat surprising since Î² receptors would most likely be internalised and desensitised with prolong treatments with saturating (1-2ÂµM) doses of Isoproterenol. This is a crucial point, as it is not conceivable that once activated this pathway cannot be turned off.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to Essential revisions #3.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The authors have shown intriguing new results that termination of GPCR signaling does not restore 5hmC levels to their basal state. The authors should solidify this finding by repeating the forskolin washout experiment in HEK293 cells, and assaying 5hmC levels at 72 hours. Based on the outcome of this experiment, the authors should provide a commentary as to the role of GPCR signaling in establishment vs. maintenance of 5hmC in different cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replicated the forskolin washout experiment in HEK-293 cells. The results showed that forskolin treatment (24 hours) followed by washout induced 5hmC elevation at levels comparable to continuous treatment (72 hours) in HEK-293 cells. In contrast, 5hmC levels largely retreated to the base line in shorter forskolin treatments (4, 12 hours) followed by washout. A parallel experiment showed that forskolin treatment (4 hours) followed by washout induced 5hmC elevation at levels comparable to continuous treatment (24 hours) in HEK-293 cells. Compared to Schwann cells, we observed that after treatment of HEK-293 cells followed by washout and assessed at 72 hours, 5hmC levels retreated toward the base line. It is known that 5hmC is not maintained in DNA synthesis and HEK-293 cells replicate much faster than the slowly-dividing primary Schwann cells. Taken together, these results suggest that high levels of 5hmC in cells could be established by cAMP signaling. However, the long-term maintenance of 5hmC requires continuous cAMP signaling. These data are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In light of the above finding, the title should be made more accurate by referring to &quot;5hmC&quot; rather than &quot;demethylation,&quot; as the authors have not demonstrated full removal of the methyl mark in this system. Something like &quot;cAMP signaling regulates DNA 5hmC by augmenting the intracellular labile ferrous iron pool&quot; would more accurately reflect the results.</p></disp-quote><p>The title is now changed to âcAMP Signaling Regulates DNA hydroxymethylation by Augmenting the Intracellular Labile Ferrous Iron Poolâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors write that the timepoints for sequencing analysis were chosen to allow analysis of the effects of GPCR signaling on myelinating genes. However, they mention only 2 individual genes involved in this process. The authors should use the sequencing data to provide a global analysis of myelinating genes, and any others involved in Schwann cell differentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We included a global analysis of GPCR signaling on myelinating genes or genes involved in Schwann cell differentiation. Our analysis showed that the transcription of 19 genes with known functions in regulating Schwann cell myelination was affected by cAMP treatment. Overall, 13 pro-myelinating genes were upregulated and 6 anti-myelinating genes were downregulated by cAMP treatment. Furthermore, we observed obvious 5hmC peak changes in 10 genes, suggesting the transcription of these genes could be correlated with cAMP-induced DNA hydroxymethylation. For the other 9 genes, their transcription could be regulated by PKA-targeted transcription factors. An alternative explanation could be due to the limitation of hMeDIP-seq by sequencing 5hmC enriched genomic regions using anti-5hmC antibody.
