pathways must function under conditions with which they did not coevolve. If newly-acquired genes burden the host, their utility will depend on further evolutionary refinement of the recombinant strain. We used laboratory evolution to recapitulate this process of transfer and refinement, demonstrating that effective use of an introduced dichloromethane degradation pathway required one of several mutations to the bacterial host that are predicted to increase chloride efflux. We then used this knowledge to identify parallel, beneficial mutations that independently evolved in two natural dichloromethane-degrading strains. Finally, we constructed a synthetic mobile genetic element carrying both the degradation pathway and a chloride exporter, which preempted the adaptive process and directly enabled effective dichloromethane degradation across diverse <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> environmental isolates.

Most often the characteristics that develop via evolution result from individuals inheriting new combinations of genes from their parents. However, many species can also acquire new genes through a process called horizontal gene transfer, where organisms that share an environment exchange potentially useful genes. The ability of bacteria to acquire genes by horizontal gene transfer is thought to be the main reason for the rapid evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as MRSA.</p><p>A horizontally transferred gene rarely works efficiently when first transferred, and may even cause problems for its new host. The host organism must therefore evolve further after receiving a new gene, but it is difficult to trace how this occurs.</p><p>A toxic chemical called dichloromethane (or DCM) has been used in many industries since World War II, and has caused widespread contamination to the environment. Strains from several microbial genera have been identified that have adapted to break down DCM and use it as their sole energy source. Moreover, a gene responsible for breaking down DCM appears to have been shared between different species by horizontal gene transfer.</p><p>In work that was presented earlier in 2014, researchers introduced this gene into several bacterial strains from the genus <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> that had not been previously exposed to DCM. However, the resulting new strains of bacteria still had difficulties growing on DCM. There were diverse ways that the bacteria could have been prevented from growing—for example, multiple by-products generated when DCM is broken down are highly toxic.</p><p>Now Michener et al.—including the researchers that performed the 2014 work—have experimentally evolved five of the modified strains of <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> to discover how they adapt over time to living on DCM. Examining the DNA sequences of these bacteria showed several mutations that both improved the ability of the bacteria to survive on DCM and helped the bacteria to more efficiently remove chloride ions from their systems. Chloride ions accumulate as DCM is broken down; therefore, Michener et al. suggest that being exposed to too much chloride prevented the bacteria in previous experiments from growing well. This idea is further supported by mutations found in previously isolated bacteria that live on DCM. These mutations increase the bacteria's ability to excrete chloride ions from their cells, and when Michener et al. removed these mutations, the bacteria no longer grew well on DCM.</p><p>Understanding how bacteria adapt once they have acquired the DCM-degrading gene could make it easier to help bacteria to mop up DCM and other contaminants in the environment.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04279.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04279.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>Methylobacterium</italic></kwd><kwd>horizontal gene transfer</kwd><kwd>experimental evolution</kwd><kwd>dichloromethane</kwd><kwd>bioremediation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 GM106629</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Michener</surname><given-names>Joshua K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001807</institution-id><institution>São Paulo Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paolo</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Camargo Neves</surname><given-names>Aline A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002322</institution-id><institution>Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Camargo Neves</surname><given-names>Aline A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Adapting bacteria to use an introduced metabolic pathway recapitulates natural mutations and offers a novel bioremediation strategy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microbes frequently acquire genetic material from organisms that are distant evolutionary relatives but close ecological neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ochman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gogarten et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smillie et al., 2011</xref>). These horizontally-transferred genes and pathways play important roles in processes ranging from the spread of antibiotic resistance to ecological differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Forsberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shapiro et al., 2012</xref>). When, for example, a new environmental niche opens up through the introduction of a xenobiotic compound, horizontal gene transfer (HGT) can speed the assembly and dissemination of a corresponding catabolic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Springael and Top, 2004</xref>). However, newly-acquired abilities may be costly for the host until they are carefully integrated into existing metabolic and regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim and Copley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yadid et al., 2013</xref>). The challenges associated with such adaptations are highlighted by many examples from metabolic engineering, where productively transferring genes and pathways into new hosts often requires significant post–transfer refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Michener et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Observing this process of transfer and refinement in nature is challenging, but we can recreate the same process in the laboratory using a combination of genetic engineering and experimental evolution. Laboratory evolution has been used extensively to study natural evolutionary processes. Recent experiments have highlighted the mechanisms by which evolution can optimize existing traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elena and Lenski, 2003</xref>), select for the emergence of a novel ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blount et al., 2012</xref>), and refine a rudimentary pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Quandt et al., 2014</xref>). Laboratory studies focusing on genetic exchanges between microbes have described the recombination of mutations within an evolving population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Winkler and Kao, 2012</xref>) or the replacement of an endogenous metabolic pathway with an alternative route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chou et al., 2011</xref>). Meanwhile, metabolic engineers have used adaptive evolution as an engineering tool, including the evolution of highly modified strains, but under conditions that do not reproduce HGT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trinh and Srienc, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee and Palsson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). In this work, we combined these approaches to study how microbes evolve following the acquisition through horizontal gene transfer of a novel metabolic ability by deliberately transferring a mobile metabolic pathway into a new host and then using experimental evolution to select for its efficient use.</p><p>We investigated this process of HGT followed by evolutionary refinement using dichloromethane (DCM) catabolism in <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> strains as an example. Dichloromethane became an important industrial solvent during World War II and is still the most prevalent chlorinated solvent today (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eurochlor.org">www.eurochlor.org</ext-link>). Following widespread environmental contamination by DCM, several microbial strains have been isolated based on their ability to grow on DCM as the sole source of carbon and energy. Most notably, <italic>Methylobacterium extorquens</italic> DM4, a methylotrophic Alphaproteobacterium, has served as a reference model to elucidate the details of bacterial growth with DCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gälli and Leisinger, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Muller et al., 2011a</xref>). <italic>M. extorquens</italic> DM4 expresses a dehalogenase, DcmA, whose gene shows clear signs of horizontal transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schmid-Appert et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vuilleumier et al., 2009</xref>) and whose product, formaldehyde, feeds directly into central methylotrophic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chistoserdova, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Past efforts to understand the genetics of growth on DCM used gene knockouts to uncover DCM-specific genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Muller et al., 2011b</xref>). We complemented these efforts using a synthetic approach involving conjugal transfer of the <italic>dcmA</italic> gene into several naïve <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kayser et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Michener et al., 2014</xref>). These <italic>dcmA</italic> transconjugants showed DCM dehalogenase activity but grew poorly on DCM, and we previously investigated factors that might explain their limited growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Michener et al., 2014</xref>). Growing on DCM using the <italic>dcmA</italic> catabolic pathway is very challenging for the host, as its products and intermediates include formaldehyde, hydrochloric acid, and the alkylating agent <italic>S</italic>-chloromethylglutathione (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kayser et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kayser and Vuilleumier, 2001</xref>). As DCM dehalogenase activity was generally high in transconjugant strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Michener et al., 2014</xref>), we hypothesized that one or more of these stresses was limiting growth in the transconjugants and thus required post–transfer evolutionary refinement of the host to produce highly active DCM-degrading strains.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04279.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental evolution recapitulates post–transfer optimization of a challenging catabolic pathway.</title><p>The natural isolate, DM4, grows well on dichloromethane.

Beginning from these ancestral transconjugants, we evolved replicate populations with DCM as the sole source of carbon and energy and obtained evolved isolates with substantially higher fitness on DCM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We sequenced the genomes of these evolved strains to identify the mutations that increased fitness on DCM and then reconstructed these mutations in isogenic backgrounds to measure their effect on fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Based on these mutations, we could infer both the primary limiting stress that the pathway placed on its host as well as the biochemical mechanisms that the cells used to overcome this stress. Finally, we used this knowledge to uncover naturally-occurring refining mutations in two DCM-degrading environmental isolates and to design an improved gene cassette that enhances DCM bioremediation by preempting the need for post–transfer refinement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental evolution selected for increased fitness on DCM</title><p>We previously transferred the DCM dehalogenase <italic>dcmA</italic> into three strains of <italic>M. extorquens</italic> as well as three other species of <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Michener et al., 2014</xref>).

In contrast, we evolved five different <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> strains, each of which carried the same horizontally-transferred metabolic pathway for DCM catabolism. By sequencing the evolved isolates, we identified mutations across diverse backgrounds that improve the ability to grow on DCM. Working backward from these mutations allowed us to determine that chloride accumulation appears to be the most critical factor limiting growth, and to identify multiple mechanisms that alleviate this stress. We found parallel responses at both the genetic and physiological level, indicating that the different strains faced similar challenges when forced to use their new metabolic capability and overcame these challenges in similar ways. Horizontal transfer of <italic>dcmA</italic> is not sufficient for efficient growth on DCM and, in both the laboratory and the environment, microbes must also acquire refining mutations to optimize the newly-acquired pathway.</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that chloride export was the key limiting factor during growth on DCM. First, the observed mutations in <italic>secY</italic> are predicted to turn the protein translocase into a leaky chloride channel, as demonstrated previously in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dalal and Duong, 2009</xref>). Our growth rate measurements confirm that <italic>secY</italic> mutants are more sensitive to extracellular chloride, as we would expect if the mutant SecY facilitates chloride diffusion across the cell membrane. Second, mutations to the promoter of <italic>clcA</italic> increase <italic>clcA</italic> expression. The in vivo pH measurements upon DCM addition establish that ClcA imports protons, with a necessary concomitant export of chloride, and that increased ClcA expression leads to increased proton import and chloride export. Similarly, the <italic>E. coli</italic> response to extreme acid stress uses ClcA to export chloride, with other mechanisms used for proton export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Accardi and Miller, 2004</xref>). Third, BesA is predicted to be a chloride channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sun et al., 2002</xref>) and while we cannot yet explain the mechanism by which the identified mutation would affect its function, we hypothesize that the mutation may also allow increased chloride export. Finally, we observed that double mutants are no more fit than the best single mutant, suggesting that all the mutations we detected are addressing the same physiological limitation. Previous experiments found that mutations affecting the same pathway were less beneficial when combined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chou et al., 2011</xref>), in some cases to the point of being collectively deleterious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kvitek and Sherlock, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rokyta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chou et al., 2014</xref>). Due to the antagonism of <italic>edgA</italic><sup>E3</sup> with <italic>clcA</italic><sup>E1</sup>, it is likely that EdgA is also involved in chloride export.</p><p>While chloride export is not an unexpected stress during growth on DCM, there was no a priori reason to expect that chloride export was the major limiting stress across all of the strains that we tested. Multiple other stresses could have been dominant, including sensitivity to internal acidification, the solvent effects of DCM, changes in formaldehyde fluxes perturbing the native host metabolism, or the mutagenic effects of glutathione-conjugated DCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kayser and Vuilleumier, 2001</xref>). Indeed, our previous efforts to find a single physiological difference that explained the varied fitness of the ancestral <italic>dcmA</italic> transconjugants on DCM did not identify chloride sensitivity as a predictive phenotype for fitness during growth on DCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Michener et al., 2014</xref>). There was no reason to expect that chloride was more toxic than protons, but using ClcA to export the chloride, even at the cost of importing yet more protons, was highly beneficial. It appears that excess intracellular chloride is either more toxic or less effectively managed than excess intracellular protons.</p><p>The apparent linkage between <italic>besA</italic> and chloride export may offer insights into a human disease. Mutations to human bestrophin homologs can lead to vitelliform macular dystrophy, but little is known about these proteins aside from their roles as chloride channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sun et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsunenari et al., 2003</xref>). Bacterial homologs of the bestrophin family are similarly uncharacterized. Select bacterial homologs have been shown to affect swarming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Inoue et al., 2007</xref>) and sporulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rahn-Lee et al., 2009</xref>), but these systems have not explicitly replicated the role of the human homolog as a chloride channel. However, our <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> system may offer an opportunity to characterize the chloride transporter function of this protein family in a tractable host with a strong linkage between BesA function and fitness.</p><p>By design, our analysis has focused on mutations with very large fitness effects. Mutations that alleviate stresses imposed during growth on DCM had the potential to dramatically increase fitness, and restricting our evolution experiment to 150 generations predominantly selected these mutations. Our populations undoubtedly sampled mutations that would be generally beneficial during growth in our media and laboratory conditions, as has been seen in earlier experiments with <italic>M. extorquens</italic> AM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2009</xref>), but the fitness effects of these mutations appear to have been minor compared to the DCM-specific mutations. For example, isolate N1 lost an entire 458 kbp plasmid, which was likely due to selection but with a small fitness benefit as compared to acquiring a <italic>secY</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee and Marx, 2012</xref>). The rarity of mutations generically beneficial during laboratory growth greatly simplified our analysis of the evolved isolates.</p><p>We expect that multiple lineages within a population independently arrived at solutions to increase chloride efflux. However, the size of the fitness effects produced evolutionary dynamics that resembled periodic selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atwood et al., 1951</xref>), in which the first large effect mutation to arise in the population rapidly fixed. Combinations of mutations were generally no more beneficial than the best single mutation, so we predominantly observed the result of a single selective sweep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Population E2 is the exception, where the <italic>clcA</italic><sup>E2</sup> mutation fixed first, followed by the <italic>besA</italic><sup>E2</sup> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). The <italic>clcA</italic><sup>E2</sup> mutant has a fitness of 0.6 as compared to 0.8 for <italic>besA</italic><sup>E2</sup> or the <italic>besA</italic><sup>E2</sup>/<italic>clcA</italic><sup>E2</sup> double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, while the double mutant is no more fit than the <italic>besA</italic><sup>E2</sup> single mutant, the <italic>besA</italic><sup>E2</sup> mutation is still highly beneficial in the <italic>clcA</italic><sup>E2</sup> background.</p><p>Experimental populations of <italic>M. radiotolerans</italic> did not increase in fitness over 150 generations of growth on DCM. When we tested this strain with the dual-expression <italic>clcA</italic>/<italic>dcmA</italic> plasmid, the fitness increased but the increase was smaller than for other strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). We hypothesize that our inability to find improved isolates of <italic>M. radiotolerans</italic> stems from a combination of fewer accessible beneficial mutations, smaller fitness effects of the beneficial mutations, and a decreased sensitivity to the mutagenic effects of growing on DCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Perez-Pantoja et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Experimental evolution is increasingly used to simulate natural evolutionary processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawecki et al., 2012</xref>); however, there are few examples where mutations that arise during laboratory evolution can also be identified in natural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Traverse et al., 2013</xref>). We have shown that mutations to <italic>clcA</italic> can be highly beneficial during laboratory growth, and that parallel mutations to <italic>clcA</italic> have arisen in two independent DCM-degrading environmental isolates of <italic>M. extorquens</italic>. In the reference environmental isolate <italic>M. extorquens</italic> DM4, we can directly link nucleotide mutations in the <italic>clcA</italic> promoter to <italic>clcA</italic> overexpression and increased organismal fitness during growth on DCM. Demonstrating linkages between evolutionary processes observed in the laboratory and in nature will be increasingly important for the further development and application of experimental evolution.</p><p>Having identified <italic>clcA</italic> overexpression as a beneficial evolutionary refinement following acquisition of <italic>dcmA</italic>, we used this knowledge to develop a novel bioremediation strategy and designed new expression cassettes for bioremediation that are less dependent on subsequent adaptation for effective function. Rather than introducing an exogenous microbe into a contaminated site, we propose to introduce a genetic cassette to the indigenous microflora, an approach known as genetic bioaugmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Top et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ikuma and Gunsch, 2013</xref>). Our experiments clearly demonstrated that simply introducing the degradation pathway for a contaminant can be inefficient, as the recipients may be unprepared for the stresses produced by the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kayser et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Michener et al., 2014</xref>). Instead, we propose to identify these stresses in the laboratory and then provide both the catabolic pathway and solutions to the most common limitations. In our example of DCM degradation, transconjugants that received both the catabolic gene <italic>dcmA</italic> and the chloride exporter gene <italic>clcA</italic> were more efficient at degrading DCM than those that received <italic>dcmA</italic> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our results highlight the important role of evolutionary refinement in the horizontal transfer of a challenging catabolic pathway. Dichloromethane degradation led to chloride accumulation and required modifications to the recipient to export the chloride. Based on recent examples from metabolic engineering, we expect that these types of host–pathway interactions are common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kizer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Verwaal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Michener et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernhardt and Urlacher, 2014</xref>) and, consequently, that post–transfer refinement of microbial hosts is also widespread in nature. Our approach of deliberate horizontal transfer in the laboratory followed by experimental evolution offers an opportunity to identify both the limiting stresses and the mutations that can overcome these stresses. As screens and selections for complex microbial phenotypes are further developed, we expect that this approach will find many applications, both in the analysis of natural microbial isolates and in the optimization of genetically engineered microbes and mobile genetic elements.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and cultivation</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> cultures were grown in LB containing 10 g/l NaCl except for cultures containing the <italic>dcmA</italic>/<italic>clcA</italic> dual expression plasmid (pJM83), which were salt-sensitive and instead were grown in LB containing 0.5 g/l NaCl.

These amplicons included a ∼500 bp upstream homology region amplified from the recipient chromosome, a small region containing the desired mutation amplified from the donor chromosome, and a second ∼500 bp downstream homology region amplified from the recipient chromosome.

Samples were gated for forward scatter, side scatter, and mCherry fluorescence. After determining the population fluorescence, DCM was added to a final concentration of 10 mM. The culture was quickly vortexed and returned to the flow cytometer, leading to an approximately 20 s delay between DCM addition and consistent fluorescence measurements.

Buffers used were MES pH 5.1, MES pH 5.3, MES pH 5.5, MES pH 5.7, MES pH 6.1, PIPES pH 6.5, PIPES pH 6.9, and PIPES pH 7.3. The population mean fluorescence ratio (pHluorin fluorescence divided by mCherry fluorescence) was measured for each combination of strain and pH, then fit to a modified Henderson–Hasselbalch equation. The internal pH of the experimental samples was calculated by finding the fluorescence ratio of each cell, dividing the timecourse into 5 s intervals, calculating the population mean of the fluorescence ratio for each interval, and comparing that ratio to the standard curve to calculate the internal pH.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>qRT-PCR measurements</title><p>For qRT-PCR measurements, cultures were grown to saturation in M-PIPES plus succinate, and then diluted into the indicated media conditions.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor), Michael Laub (Reviewing editor), and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We all generally liked this manuscript and felt that it reported an interesting story with conclusions well-justified by the data shown. There were a few issues with regard to the writing that need attention in a revised manuscript. There were also a couple of issues raised in the reviews and during our subsequent discussion that need to be addressed experimentally. These primary issues are summarized here and, with one possible exception, are straightforward experiments to add:</p><p>1) We each had questions about the nature of the naturally occurring mutations in clcA in DM4 and DM17. You should provide stronger evidence that these mutations have the anticipated effects/consequences on clcA expression levels.</p><p>2) What are the fitness costs of dcmA and refinement alleles under non-DCM selective conditions?</p><p>3) Can you include FreqSeq data or at least some sampling of intermediates from the evolved lines to probe temporal dynamics of accumulated mutations?</p><p>4) One final item that came up is whether the clcA mutations identified actually make the transporter leaky, as predicted, leading to better chloride ion export. It was not clear to us how involved this type of experiment would be, but if it's reasonably straightforward it would be good to add this as well. You reference a chloride ion transport study in your paper and perhaps the approach taken previously could be implemented to solidify your conclusions about the clcA mutants.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04279.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) We each had questions about the nature of the naturally occurring mutations in clcA in DM4 and DM17. You should provide stronger evidence that these mutations have the anticipated effects/consequences on clcA expression levels</italic>.</p><p>We have revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> to include new qRT-PCR data showing the clcA expression in DM17 and in the promoter exchange strains. We can now show that both of the natural isolates, DM4 and DM17, have high clcA expression. Additionally, the promoter exchange mutants have the expected trend in clcA expression.</p><p><italic>2) What are the fitness costs of dcmA and refinement alleles under non-DCM selective conditions?</italic></p><p>We have added a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>) and explanatory sentence describing the fitness effects of these mutations during growth on succinate. In short, none of the mutations have major fitness effects during growth on succinate compared to large effects on DCM.</p><p><italic>3) Can you include FreqSeq data or at least some sampling of intermediates from the evolved lines to probe temporal dynamics of accumulated mutations?</italic></p><p>We have added two new supplementary figures, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3–figure supplement 4</xref>, to show the allele frequency dynamics of selected populations. Of note, we can connect changes in allele frequency of the <italic>M. nodulans</italic> isolates to changes in bulk properties of the evolving population, such as the yield on DCM. Additionally, we include allele frequency measurements for the single isolate, E2, in which we find two highly beneficial mutations (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The remaining populations have less informative allele frequency dynamics, as we only observe a single mutation rapidly sweeping to fixation.</p><p><italic>4) One final item that came up is whether the clcA mutations identified actually make the transporter leaky, as predicted, leading to better chloride ion export. It was not clear to us how involved this type of experiment would be, but if it's reasonably straightforward it would be good to add this as well. You reference a chloride ion transport study in your paper and perhaps the approach taken previously could be implemented to solidify your conclusions about the clcA mutants</italic>.</p><p>We assume that the reviewers were referencing the mutations to secY that we propose yield a leaky anion channel. While we agree that directly measuring the chloride permeability of inverted membrane vesicles containing the various SecY mutants would strengthen our hypothesis, running the necessary experiments would be quite challenging. We estimate that it would take an additional collaborator and a year’s work from a PhD student to run these experiments as there is no precedent for doing any of this work with inverted vesicles in Methylobacterium, or indeed for many organisms outside of <italic>E. coli</italic>. Instead, we direct the reviewers’ attention to our in vivo experiments where we demonstrate increased sensitivity to external NaCl as an alternative demonstration of facilitated chloride diffusion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
