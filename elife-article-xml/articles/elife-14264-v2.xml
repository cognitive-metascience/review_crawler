proteins (RBPs) control multiple aspects of post-transcriptional gene regulation and function during various biological processes in the nervous system. To further reveal the functional significance of RBPs during neural development, we carried out an in vivo RNAi screen in the dorsal spinal cord interneurons, including the commissural neurons. We found that the NOVA family of RBPs play a key role in neuronal migration, axon outgrowth, and axon guidance. Interestingly, <italic>Nova</italic> mutants display similar defects as the knockout of the <italic>Dcc</italic> transmembrane receptor. We show here that <italic>Nova</italic> deficiency disrupts the alternative splicing of <italic>Dcc</italic>, and that restoring <italic>Dcc</italic> splicing in <italic>Nova</italic> knockouts is able to rescue the defects.

This RNA molecule can often be processed to create several different “messenger” RNAs (mRNAs), each of which are used to produce a different protein by a process known as alternative splicing. A class of proteins that bind to RNA molecules controls alternative splicing. These “splicing factors” ensure that the right protein variant is produced at the right time and in the right place to carry out the appropriate activity.</p><p>Many genes that play important roles in the nervous system have been reported to undergo alternative splicing to generate different protein variants. However, it is unclear whether alternative splicing is important for controlling how the nervous system develops, during which time the neurons connect to the cells that they will communicate with. Forming these connections involves part of the neuron, called the axon, growing along a precise path through the nervous system to reach its destination. If alternative splicing is important for this process, it is also important to ask: which splicing factors are relevant and which genes do these splicing factors regulate?</p><p>Through genetic and molecular studies using mouse embryos, Leggere et al. found that the NOVA family of splicing factors are essential for the development of the nervous system. In particular, the NOVA splicing factors control the alternative splicing of a gene called <italic>Dcc.</italic> This gene produces proteins that play a number of roles, including helping axons to grow and guiding the axons to the correct location in the developing nervous system. A related study by Saito et al. showed that two forms of NOVA splicing factors – called NOVA1 and NOVA2 – have different roles in the nervous system, and describes the role of NOVA2 in more detail.</p><p>Leggere et al. will now carry out additional studies to determine the unique role of each protein variant produced from the <italic>Dcc</italic> gene. Future research will also investigate how NOVA proteins help generate these variants at the right time and in the right place.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14264.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14264.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>axon guidance</kwd><kwd>neuronal migration</kwd><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>RNA binding proteins</kwd><kwd>NOVA</kwd><kwd>DCC</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship for Research Abroad</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saito</surname><given-names>Yuhki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH R01 NS34389</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darnell</surname><given-names>Robert B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS069473</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darnell</surname><given-names>Robert B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS081706</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darnell</surname><given-names>Robert B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darnell</surname><given-names>Robert B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY024261</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Junge</surname><given-names>Harald J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005508</institution-id><institution>Boettcher Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>New Investigator Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Zhe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005508</institution-id><institution>Boettcher Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OCG5499B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Zhe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Alternative splicing of the <italic>Dcc</italic> gene, which is controlled by the NOVA RNA-binding proteins, is crucial during neuronal migration and axon guidance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alternative splicing generates gene function complexity in many neural developmental processes, including neuronal differentiation, neuronal migration, axon growth and guidance, and synapse formation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grabowski and Black, 2001</xref>;

Within the spinal cord commissural neurons, DCC is required for Netrin-stimulated axon outgrowth and for attracting the axons to the Netrin-secreting midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dickson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dickson and Zou, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Evans and Bashaw, 2010</xref>). Mammalian <italic>Dcc</italic> undergoes alternative splicing to generate two isoforms that differ in the extracellular domain, in the linker sequence between the fourth and fifth fibronectin repeats (FN4 and FN5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reale et al., 1994</xref>). This alternative splicing was first reported in neuroblastoma cells and was found to be disrupted in these tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reale et al., 1994</xref>), but its physiological significance was completely unknown. We refer to the splice variants hereafter as DCC<sub>long</sub> and DCC<sub>short</sub>, with DCC<sub>long</sub> containing extra 20 amino acids in the FN4-FN5 linker. Interestingly, a recent structure study shows that the two isoforms bind Netrin-1 with comparable affinities, but are likely to adopt distinct conformations upon ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To reveal the factors that control the alternative splicing of axon guidance genes including <italic>Dcc</italic>, we carried out an in vivo RNAi screen against candidate RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in cultured mouse embryos, and found that <italic>Nova1</italic> and <italic>Nova2</italic> knockdown leads to severe defects in the dorsal spinal cord interneurons, including the commissural interneurons. The NOVA (neuro-oncological ventral antigen) proteins were first identified as the autoimmune antigens in the neurodegenerative disease POMA (paraneoplastic opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Darnell, 1996</xref>). NOVA1/2 are neural-specific KH (hnRNP K homology)-type of RBPs that can directly regulate alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buckanovich et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lewis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ule et al., 2006</xref>). Genome-wide studies have identified many potential NOVA targets that are involved in various neural developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Licatalosi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ule et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>).

We selected RBPs that have neural-specific expression and have been implicated in alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The list of candidates is not exhaustive, and the screening against additional RBPs is ongoing. Some of the RBPs, including NOVA, FOX, and PTBP2/nPTB, directly regulate splicing by recognizing specific sequences in pre-mRNAs and controlling spliceosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agnès and Perron, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2007</xref>).

We used PAX3/7 antibodies to label the dorsal interneuron progenitors that give rise to different populations of commissural and ipsilateral neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caspary and Anderson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helms and Johnson, 2003</xref>). <italic>Pax3</italic> and <italic>Pax7</italic> are required to specify the majority of commissural neurons, as their double knockout greatly reduces the ventral commissure formed by commissural axons crossing the midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mansouri and Gruss, 1998</xref>). We labeled differentiated interneurons with antibodies against BARHL2 and LHX5, two transcription factors among many others that are expressed by post-mitotic interneurons. Combinations of these transcription factors define the different lineages of commissural and ipsilateral neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caspary and Anderson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helms and Johnson, 2003</xref>). We also labeled commissural axons specifically with anti-ROBO3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sabatier et al., 2004</xref>). Our studies show that the GFP+ neurons within the VZ are dorsal interneuron progenitors and the ones at the lateral spinal cord are differentiated interneurons. In addition, the GFP+ axons that fail to project to the midline are commissural axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Furthermore, using fluorescent in situ hybridization, we found that the GFP+ neuroprogenitors and interneurons also express <italic>Dcc</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with previous reports that <italic>Dcc</italic> is expressed in these neuronal populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Keino-Masu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Phan et al., 2011</xref>).

In contrast, when the intron 16 cluster was mutated, NOVA1 or NOVA2 could no longer promote <italic>Dcc<sub>long</sub></italic>, indicating that these sites are essential NOVA binding sites.

However, NOVA1 or NOVA2 could still increase <italic>Dcc<sub>long</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).

Alternative splicing has been increasingly implicated as an important means to generate temporal and spatial specific functions for guidance molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Park and Graveley, 2007</xref>). To further understand the functional significance of alternative splicing, it is important to identify the relevant splicing factors and their targets. Through an in vivo RNAi screen against RBPs, we discovered that <italic>Nova1/2</italic> are key regulators of both neuronal and axonal migration in the spinal cord interneurons.</p><p>We found that <italic>Nova</italic> deficiency reduces the migration of mitotic progenitors and differentiated interneurons in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>).

The phenotypic similarity between <italic>Nova</italic> and <italic>Dcc</italic> KOs strongly suggests that <italic>Dcc</italic> activity is affected by <italic>Nova</italic> dKO. Indeed, this is confirmed by the observations that <italic>Dcc</italic> alternative splicing is disrupted by <italic>Nova</italic> dKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), that <italic>Nova</italic> dKO defects can be largely rescued in vitro and in vivo by restoring <italic>Dcc<sub>long </sub></italic>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), and that NOVA controls <italic>Dcc</italic> alternative splicing in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Also importantly, our results show that disrupting <italic>Dcc</italic> alternative splicing without affecting the total <italic>Dcc</italic> level leads to as severe defects as <italic>Dcc</italic> KO, underscoring the importance of alternative splicing for the gene function.</p><p>The defects in neuronal migration, axon outgrowth, and axon guidance in <italic>Nova</italic> and <italic>Dcc</italic> KOs appear to share a common feature, which is a temporal delay. The migration is slowed but not completely blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The axon outgrowth is initially defective but becomes normal after an extended culture period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The axon guidance defect also appears to be somewhat alleviated at E12.5 compared to earlier stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This delay could be due to an incomplete loss of the gene function in the KOs. Alternatively, NOVA proteins have been shown to regulate many target genes including <italic>Dcc</italic> in a temporal specific manner, generating different ratios of splice variants at different developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yano et al., 2010</xref>; also see accompanying paper by Saito et al.) As <italic>Nova</italic> deficiency changes the ratio between DCC variants, it may alter the developmental state of the neurons. Consequently, this leads to abnormal responsiveness of the neurons to the extracelluar environment and thus defects in neuronal and axonal migration.</p><p>The fact that the loss of <italic>Dcc<sub>long</sub></italic> in <italic>Nova</italic> dKOs cannot be compensated by the increase in <italic>Dcc<sub>short </sub></italic>demonstrates that the two isoforms are functionally distinct. The two DCC isoforms differ in the FN4-FN5 linker, with both FN4 and FN5 domains interacting with Netrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). A structure study of Netrin in complex with the DCC or NEO1 receptor found that DCC variants can bind to Netrin-1 with comparable affinities, but are likely to adopt distinct conformations in the ligand-receptor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). Netrin and DCC<sub>short</sub> form a continuous liand:receptor complex, whereas DCC<sub>long</sub> is likely to form a 2:2 ligand:receptor complex with Netrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). Whether the presence of both isoforms and at different ratios can produce additional conformations of the ligand-receptor complex is completely unknown. How the architecturally distinct complexes can lead to different intracellular signaling also remains an intriguing question.</p><p>The defects seen in <italic>Nova</italic> dKOs could result from the loss in <italic>Dcc<sub>long</sub></italic>, the increase in <italic>Dcc<sub>short</sub></italic>, or the combination of both. We cannot yet distinguish between these possibilities. The rescue of <italic>Nova</italic> dKOs by DCC<sub>long</sub>, but not by DCC<sub>short</sub>, can also be interpreted in different ways. One possibility is that DCC<sub>long</sub> is fully responsible for the gene function, whereas DCC<sub>short</sub> has no activity. Another is that both isoforms are required and each has its specific activity. Only DCC<sub>long</sub> can rescue <italic>Nova</italic> KOs because it is reduced in the mutants, while DCC<sub>short</sub> is still present. Since the two <italic>Dcc</italic> isoforms are normally expressed at comparable levels in commissural axons at E11.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), it is likely that each isoform has its unique activity during neuronal migration and axon guidance.</p><p><italic>Dcc</italic> alternative splicing was first identified using human neuroblastoma cells IMR32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reale et al., 1994</xref>). Compared with normal mouse brain tissues, IMR32 expresses a decreased level of <italic>Dcc<sub>long </sub></italic>and an elevated level of <italic>Dcc<sub>short </sub></italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reale et al., 1994</xref>). These changes are in the same pattern as those in <italic>Nova</italic> dKOs. Thus, altered <italic>Dcc</italic> alternative splicing may also contribute to tumor development.

For FISH, HRP (horse radish peroxidase)-conjugated anti-DIG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) was used and the signal was visualized using the TSA (tyramide signal amplication) system (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Dorsal spinal cord neuron culture</title><p>To confirm exogenous protein expression, DSC neurons electroporated with <italic>Dcc</italic> or <italic>Robo3</italic> cDNA and <italic>gfp</italic> were microdissected, dissociated (0.05% trypsin, 0.5 mM EDTA), and cultured for 24 hrs in PDL (poly-D-Lysine, 100 μg/ml) coated culture dish in the culture medium (Neurobasal, 1x B27, 50 U/ml Pen/Strep, and 250 ng/ml Netrin-1).

Cells were cultured for 48 hr and the total RNA was collected using Trizol (Thermo Fisher). Reverse transcription was carried out from a T7 promoter (present in pDEST26) using SMARTScribe reverse transcriptase (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), and semi-quantitative PCR was performed to amplify multiple isoforms. Point mutations were introduced by PCR reactions using Pfu polymerase (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), and were confirmed by DNA sequencing. A V5 tag at the C-terminus of NOVA1, NOVA2, and PTBP2 was used to confirm protein expression using western blotting.</p><table-wrap position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="4" valign="top"><bold>Primers used for quantitative PCR</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene</td><td valign="top">Amplicon</td><td valign="top">Forward primer</td><td valign="top">Reverse primer</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>Dcc</italic></td><td valign="top"><italic>Dcc<sub>long</sub></italic></td><td valign="top">tctcattatgtaatctccttaaaagc</td><td valign="top">gggaaatcatcaagcaaaggataataa</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><italic>Dcc<sub>short</sub></italic></td><td valign="top">tctcattatgtaatctccttaaaagc</td><td valign="top">ggtggagacatctgttatggaacga</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Total <italic>Dcc</italic> (common region)</td><td valign="top">tctcattatgtaatctccttaaaagc</td><td valign="top">ctgttatggaacgagtggtggc</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>Neo1</italic></td><td valign="top"><italic>Neo1<sub>long</sub></italic></td><td valign="top">tgttattaatgctccatacactccag</td><td valign="top">ccaggtaatccttatggtgtcgt</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><italic>Neo1<sub>short</sub></italic></td><td valign="top">cagacctcacacagtgccagatccc</td><td valign="top">ccaggtaatccttatggtgtcgt</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Total <italic>Neo1</italic> (common region)</td><td valign="top">tgccagatcccactcccat</td><td valign="top">ccaggtaatccttatggtgtcgt</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>Robo3</italic></td><td valign="top"><italic>Robo3<sub>A</sub></italic></td><td valign="top">tggaggggcttacggctccc</td><td valign="top">tagcgcagcatagcgcagcc</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><italic>Robo3<sub>B</sub></italic></td><td valign="top">acctggtcttcccccagttgct</td><td valign="top">gctcgcccctggaaaccacc</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><italic>Robo3<sub>.1</sub></italic></td><td valign="top">ccaccacccttgccaccacc</td><td valign="top">ccaggcctcttccgcagcac</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><italic>Robo3<sub>.2</sub></italic></td><td valign="top">ccaccacccttgccaccacc</td><td valign="top">gcaagcctccagtcccctccc</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><italic>Robo3</italic> intron 19</td><td valign="top">cctagtccctgcccctgacca</td><td valign="top">gagggactccgaggtgggtgg</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><italic>Robo3</italic> intron 20</td><td valign="top">ttggccctgctgcctacccat</td><td valign="top">tgccccaggaagctgacgga</td></tr></tbody></table><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="4" valign="top"><bold>Primers used for semi-quantitative PCR (amplifying multiple isoforms)</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene</td><td valign="top">Amplicon</td><td valign="top">Forward primer</td><td valign="top">Reverse primer</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Dcc</td><td valign="top"><italic>Dcc</italic> common</td><td valign="top">tctcattatgtaatctccttaaaagc</td><td valign="top">tcacagcctcatgggtaagag</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Neo1</td><td valign="top"><italic>Neo1</italic> common</td><td valign="top">ttggcgaaggcatccccc</td><td valign="top">ccaggtaatccttatggtgtcgt</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grants: Boettcher Foundation (to ZC); National Institutes of Health (NIH) R01EY024261 (to HJJ); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) postdoctoral fellowship for research abroad (to YS); NIH R01 NS34389, NS069473, NS081706 and Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) (to RBD).

Your manuscript has now been evaluated by three reviewers, one of whom is a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors and it has also been evaluated by a Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you will see from the reviews, the reviewers found the paper to be interesting but identified some weaknesses that you must address before we can consider publication of the work. Some of the issues require better data analyses while others require revision of the text to consider additional interpretations. We also suggest that you read the comments on the accompanying paper from the Darnell Lab to consider some of text revisions. The separate reviews are also included at the end of this summary:</p><p>There is a main weakness that we hope you can address: If you can enhance the characterization of the anatomical phenotypes, we believe the manuscript would benefit tremendously. Currently you use fairly coarse read-outs to characterize the anatomical phenotypes. Many assessments are semi-quantitative and do not allow for an estimate of what fraction of the manipulated cells are affected. There is no doubt that the phenotypes exist and are rescued by the overexpression of the long DCC splice isoform but it remains unknown how severe the phenotypes are and whether they persist at later stages of development. Please attempt to provide more quantitative analyses and report if the phenotypes persist at later stages.</p><p>The following are additional comments that should be addressed by editing the text.</p><p>1) The abstract of the manuscript focuses almost entirely on alternative splicing yet this aspect of the work does not begin to be addressed until late in the manuscript – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and subsection “<italic>Nova</italic> dKO disrupts <italic>Dcc</italic> alternative splicing”. The authors should consider how to balance better the content of the abstract to reflect the full body of the manuscript. Perhaps some of the data, particularly the cell migration results, can be reduced.</p><p>2) <italic>Nova</italic> KO delays cell migration in the dorsal spinal cord, as does the DCC KO. It seems possible that this delay in cell migration may underlie the later-arising axon defect. For example, if axons grow out later in development they would appear to be shorter in vivo (as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and potentially defective due to growing in an abnormally mature spinal cord. A delay in axon outgrowth could also provide a simple explanation for the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> where the <italic>Nova</italic> 1/2 dKO shows no neurite outgrowth at 24 hr defect. The authors should address this point in the manuscript.</p><p>3) ROBO3 was examined for changes in alternative splicing in the <italic>Nova</italic> 1/2 KO mutant and no differences were found. But is ROBO3 a known target of <italic>Nova</italic>? It would be informative to include data from another receptor that is a known <italic>Nova</italic> target, other than DCC, to investigate here.</p><p>4) The data can be interpreted in several different ways. The authors conclude that DCC long is required for ventral migration. An alternative view, would be that DCC<sub>short</sub> antagonizes ventral migration. By inhibiting splicing the ratio of DCC<sub>short</sub> to DCC<sub>long</sub> increases. The data do not rule out the possibility that migration phenotype could reflect reduction in DCC<sub>long</sub>, an increase in DCC<sub>short</sub> or both. Furthermore, normal ventral migration may require both. That is DCC<sub>long</sub> and DCC<sub>short</sub> may form a heterodimer and this heterodimer, and a certain level of it, may be essential for normal migration. The discussion in the other manuscript that considers the relationship between different forms of DCC and its function should be incorporated into this manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript investigates the function of the RNA-binding protein, <italic>Nova</italic>, in neuronal development in the spinal cord and reports that loss of function leads to defects in cell migration and axon guidance. The commissural neurons in the dorsal spinal cord exhibit defects in midline crossing similar to that described previously for DCC knockouts. Evidence is presented to show that <italic>Nova</italic> controls the splicing of DCC isoforms and that when <italic>Nova</italic> is knocked out, the long isoform is decreased. Expression of the long, but not the short, DCC isoform rescues the <italic>Nova</italic>-/- cell migration defect and the axon phenotype in vivo and in vitro. The authors conclude that splicing of DCC is important for its function in commissural neurons and that <italic>Nova</italic> controls this alternative splicing.</p><p>This is an interesting study that provides quite robust evidence showing that <italic>Nova</italic> proteins control splicing of DCC and demonstrates a key role of the long DCC isoform in controlling cell migration in the dorsal spinal cord and axon growth to the midline. Overall, the study has been well executed and the results are mostly convincing. It is perhaps surprising that alternative splicing of just one target, DCC, is identified as the key mediator of the phenotype given that <italic>Nova</italic> has been shown previously to have many target mRNAs. However, the evidence showing the rescue of the migration and axon phenotypes with DCC<sub>long</sub> but not DCC<sub>short</sub> is quite persuasive. [Minor comments not shown.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors report cell migration and axon guidance phenotypes of spinal dorsal interneurons in rodent loss of function models. They conclude that the RNA binding proteins <italic>Nova</italic> 1 and 2 contribute to the alternative splicing regulation of the cell surface receptor DCC. Loss of <italic>Nova1/2</italic> or DCC result in altered migration and axon trajectory patterns of commissural interneurons. These defects can be rescued by overexpression of one DCC alternative splice variant but not by overexpression of a DCC alternative splice variant that persists in the <italic>Nova1/2</italic> KO embryo.</p><p>Overall, the work is interesting as it links a specific alternative splicing event in an axon guidance receptor, an RNA binding protein and potential phenotypes in a fairly intact system (embryo culture). The two main weaknesses of the study are:</p><p>1) The authors use fairly coarse read-outs to characterize the anatomical phenotypes. Many assessments are semi-quantitative and do not allow for an estimate of what fraction of the manipulated cells are affected. There is no doubt that the phenotypes exist and are rescued by the overexpression of the long DCC splice isoform but it remains unknown how severe the phenotypes are and whether they persist at later stages of development.</p><p>2) The other major (and probably more severe) weakness is the lack of mechanistic insight. The authors attempt to test whether the long and short DCC splice variants might differ in stability, expression, or localization and do not observe changes for ectopically expressed forms. However, it remains unclear whether the long variant indeed engages in some specific protein complexes at the cell surface. I should be noted that the authors openly discuss this issue in the manuscript and I feel that the work is an important contribution, even if the mechanism remains unclear.</p><p>[Minor comments not shown.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this paper, Leggere and colleagues explore the role of NOVA proteins, splicing factors highly enriched in the CNS, in regulating development of commissural neurons in the mouse spinal cord. Commissural neurons are born in the dorsal spinal cord, migrate laterally, and then ventrally to populate regions in the dorsal half of the spinal cord. These neurons send axons ventrally across the floor plate to the contralateral side of the spinal cord. Removal of both NOVA1 and NOVA2, first shown using RNAi and then through traditional mutations, disrupts the development of these neurons. Data are presented that these neurons differentiate normally, as assessed by various markers, but they show abnormalities in cell migration (both laterally and ventrally) and in axon guidance to the ventral midline. As these phenotypes are similar to DCC loss-of-function mutations, the authors sought to explore the relationship between NOVA1/2 and DCC function. DCC is a receptor for netrin; netrin is expressed in the ventral half of the spinal cord and plays an important role in regulating the ventral migration of commissural neurons and the guidance of the growth cones to the floor plate.</p><p>The authors demonstrate that NOVA1/2 regulates alternative splicing of DCC. In the DCC pre-mRNA there are two alternative acceptor sites downstream of exon 16. The use of 5'-site generates a protein with an insert of 20AA longer than the protein in the downstream site. These are referred to as DCC<sub>long</sub> and DCC<sub>short</sub>, respectively. The authors demonstrate that the NOVA1/2 phenotype can be rescued by expression of DCC<sub>long</sub> but not DCC<sub>short</sub>. Using a cell-culture based splicing assay, they showed that NOVA1/2 regulates this splice and does so through specific interactions with YCAY sites (canonical NOVA1/2 recognition sequences) within the intron separating exon 15 and 16.</p><p>The paper is clearly written and the data in the figures are easy to follow. The data can be interpreted in several different ways. The authors conclude that DCC long is required for ventral migration. An alternative view, would be that DCC<sub>short</sub> antagonizes ventral migration. By inhibiting splicing the ratio of DCC<sub>short</sub> to DCC<sub>long</sub> increases. The data do not rule out the possibility that migration phenotype could reflect reduction in DCC<sub>long</sub>, an increase in DCC<sub>short</sub> or both. Furthermore, normal ventral migration may require both. That is DCC<sub>long</sub> and DCC<sub>short</sub> may form a heterodimer and this heterodimer, and a certain level of it, may be essential for normal migration.

The phenotypic analyses and quantifications of knockout embryos and of neuronal explants were carried out using previously published methods. It is technically challenging to assess the phenotypes in cultured embryos labeled with <italic>Actb-gfp (βactin-gfp</italic>). The GFP is expressed throughout the cell bodies and the neurites and the neurons are closely positioned, making it difficult to discern individual neurons. We thus compared the overall signal from the ventricular zone with that from the lateral spinal cord to assess neuronal migration. It is also difficult to count GFP+ axons as they form bundles, and to measure the axon length as the cell bodies are positioned at different dorsoventral level. With that said, we have performed the following quantifications to improve our data.</p><p>1) We have now quantified the ventral projection of the commissural axons using embryos labeled with the Atoh1-gfp (Math1-gfp) marker. Atoh1 is expressed by neurons born at the dorsal margin of the spinal cord, whose axons extend across the whole spinal cord to the ventral midline. We measured the distance from the dorsal margin of the spinal cord to the ventral most GFP+ axons and the total height of the spinal cord. The ratio between the two represents the portion of the spinal cord that the leading axons have traversed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with the quantification using Actb-gfp, both Nova and Dcc KOs display a significant decrease in the ventral axon projection toward the midline. And Dcc<sub>long</sub> is able to restore the ventral projection in Nova KOs (quantification now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>2) We have also included the number of embryos and sections analyzed and the fraction of sections where we observed the phenotypes in neuronal migration and axon guidance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). We would like to emphasize that in all phenotypic analyses, the defects are consistently seen in all embryos examined. The severity of defects is comparable between animals and between different sections of the same embryo. Representative images are shown in all figures.</p><p>To address if the phenotypes persist at later stages, we have performed the following experiments.</p><p>1) We were able to culture some mouse embryos until the equivalent stage of E12 (half a day older than those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). It is technically difficult to grow the embryos any longer due to reduced survival. In the older embryos, the cell migration defect appeared to be slightly improved in <italic>Nova</italic> KOs, but there are still fewer axons than in controls . We did not include the data in the manuscript as we feel that the data using the KO embryos is more quantitative (see below).</p><p>2) Using knockout embryos, we examined axon guidance at a later stage and the data is incorporated into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> (ROBO3 staining at E12.5). We found that at E12.5, the axon guidance defect in both <italic>Nova</italic> and <italic>Dcc</italic> KOs is still present, but is somewhat weaker than at earlier stages. Examination of even later stages is difficult, as the ROBO3 and TAG-1 markers become downregulated after E12.5 and E11.5, respectively. We have also provided further discussion on the temporal profile of the defects in the manuscript.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14264.025</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14264.025">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14264.025</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-14264-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>In a previous study where we used the embryo culture to determine the function of different Robo3 receptor isoforms (Chen et al., Neuron, 2008), we assessed what fraction of the manipulated cells is affected. We found that the exogenously expressed ROBO3<sub>A.1</sub> protein mostly overlaps with the GFP marker and ROBO3<sub>A.1</sub> expression is able to rescue the midline crossing defect in Robo3 KOs to a large extent. We estimated that around 80% of Robo3 KO axons that express Robo3<sub>A.1</sub> are able to cross the midline, whereas no axon expressing GFP alone can cross.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14264.026</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14264.026">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14264.026</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-14264-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig></p><p>Using the same approach, we attempted to assess what fraction of neurons that exogenously express DCC is affected in this study. However, due to the presence of endogenous DCC in <italic>Nova</italic> KOs, we were unable to specifically detect the exogenous protein using anti-DCC. The exogenous DCC is tagged with HA at the C-terminus. Although we could detect the HA tag in dissociated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>), we were unable to detect any signal in tissue sections. However, given that the rescue of <italic>Nova</italic> dKO by <italic>Dcc</italic><sub>long</sub> is observed in all animals and in all sections examined, and that the rescue is to a large degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), we think most manipulated cells are affected, similar to what we have observed before in the Robo3 study.</p><p><italic>The following are additional comments that should be addressed by editing the text.</italic></p><p><italic>1) The abstract of the manuscript focuses almost entirely on alternative splicing yet this aspect of the work does not begin to be addressed until late in the manuscript – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and subsection “Nova dKO disrupts Dcc alternative splicing”.

It seems possible that this delay in cell migration may underlie the later-arising axon defect.

A delay in axon outgrowth could also provide a simple explanation for the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> where the Nova 1/2 dKO shows no neurite outgrowth at 24 hr defect. The authors should address this point in the manuscript.</italic></p><p>We agree that the cell migration and axon outgrowth/guidance defects seen in <italic>Nova</italic> and <italic>Dcc</italic> KOs may share a common underlying mechanism, which is a temporal delay. Per reviewer 2’ suggestion, we have now included axon guidance data from a later stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, ROBO3 staining at E12.5). We found that at E12.5, the axon guidance defect in both <italic>Nova</italic> and <italic>Dcc</italic> KOs is still present, but is somewhat weaker than at earlier stages. Together, these data suggest that a temporal delay may underlie the defects in both cell migration and axon guidance. We have now included further discussion to address this point.</p><p><italic>3) ROBO3 was examined for changes in alternative splicing in the Nova 1/2 KO mutant and no differences were found. But is ROBO3 a known target of Nova? It would be informative to include data from another receptor that is a known Nova target, other than DCC, to investigate here.</italic></p><p>Robo3 has not been shown to be a NOVA target. A previous transcriptome-wide HITS-CLIP from the Darnell group did not identify any candidate NOVA binding sites within Robo3 (Zhang et al., Science, 2010). However, due to the low expression level of Robo3 in the examined tissue (P0 brain), the result does not rule out Robo3 as a potential target (personal communication with R.B. Darnell). We examined Robo3 as it functions as a coreceptor with <italic>Dcc</italic> and is known to undergo alternative splicing.</p><p>Besides <italic>Dcc</italic> and Robo3, we also examined <italic>Neo1</italic>, which is a <italic>Dcc</italic> homolog and a known NOVA target. We have edited the text to make this point clear. We found that its alternative splicing at exons 18 and 27 was not significantly altered by <italic>Nova</italic> KO in the dorsal spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>).</p><p>To further address the reviewer’s question, we have now examined the <italic>Epha5</italic> receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3C</xref>). <italic>Epha5</italic> is a known NOVA target but has not been shown to play a role in the development of the spinal interneurons. We found no change in <italic>Epha5</italic> alternative splicing at exon 7 in the dorsal spinal cord.</p><p>Interestingly, the accompanying paper by Saito et al. shows that the alternative splicing of <italic>Neo1</italic> exon 27 and <italic>Epha5</italic> exon 7 is significantly altered in E18.5 <italic>Nova2</italic> KO cortex. The distinct observations between E11.5 dorsal spinal cord and E18.5 cortex show that NOVA functions in a temporospatial specific manner.</p><p><italic>4) The data can be interpreted in several different ways. The authors conclude that DCC<sub>long</sub> is required for ventral migration. An alternative view, would be that DCC<sub>short</sub> antagonizes ventral migration. By inhibiting splicing the ratio of DCC<sub>short</sub> to DCC<sub>long</sub> increases. The data do not rule out the possibility that migration phenotype could reflect reduction in DCC<sub>long</sub>, an increase in DCC<sub>short</sub> or both. Furthermore, normal ventral migration may require both. That is DCC<sub>long</sub> and DCC<sub>short</sub> may form a heterodimer and this heterodimer, and a certain level of it, may be essential for normal migration. The discussion in the other manuscript that considers the relationship between different forms of DCC and its function should be incorporated into this manuscript.</italic></p><p>We fully agree that there are several alternative models on DCC isoform functions.

The GFP is expressed throughout the cell bodies and the neurites and the neurons are closely positioned, making it difficult to discern individual neurons. We thus compared the overall signal from the ventricular zone with that from the lateral spinal cord to assess neuronal migration. It is also difficult to count GFP+ axons as they form bundles, and to measure the axon length as the cell bodies are positioned at different dorsoventral level. With that said, we have performed the following quantifications to improve our data.</p><p>1) We have now quantified the ventral projection of the commissural axons using embryos labeled with the <italic>Atoh1-gfp (Math1-gfp</italic>) marker. <italic>Atoh1</italic> is expressed by neurons born at the dorsal margin of the spinal cord, whose axons extend across the whole spinal cord to the ventral midline. We measured the distance from the dorsal margin of the spinal cord to the ventral most GFP+ axons and the total height of the spinal cord. The ratio between the two represents the portion of the spinal cord that the leading axons have traversed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with the quantification using <italic>Actb-gfp</italic>, both <italic>Nova</italic> and <italic>Dcc</italic> KOs display a significant decrease in the ventral axon projection toward the midline. And <italic>Dcc</italic><sub>long</sub> is able to restore the ventral projection in <italic>Nova</italic> KOs (quantification now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>2) We have also included the number of embryos and sections analyzed and the fraction of sections where we observed the phenotypes in neuronal migration and axon guidance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). We would like to emphasize that in all phenotypic analyses, the defects are consistently seen in all embryos examined. The severity of defects is comparable between animals and between different sections of the same embryo. Representative images are shown in all figures.</p><p>To address if the phenotypes persist at later stages, we have performed the following experiments.</p><p>1) We were able to culture some mouse embryos until the equivalent stage of E12 (half a day older than those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). It is technically difficult to grow the embryos any longer due to reduced survival. In the older embryos, the cell migration defect appeared to be slightly improved in <italic>Nova</italic> KOs, but there are still fewer axons than in controls. We did not include the data in the manuscript as we feel that the data using the KO embryos is more quantitative (see below).</p><p>2) Using knockout embryos, we examined axon guidance at a later stage and the data is incorporated into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> (ROBO3 staining at E12.5). We found that at E12.5, the axon guidance defect in both <italic>Nova</italic> and <italic>Dcc</italic> KOs is still present, but is somewhat weaker than at earlier stages. Examination of even later stages is difficult, as the ROBO3 and TAG-1 markers become downregulated after E12.5 and E11.5, respectively. We have also provided further discussion on the temporal profile of the defects in the manuscript.</p><p>In a previous study where we used the embryo culture to determine the function of different Robo3 receptor isoforms (Chen et al., Neuron, 2008), we assessed what fraction of the manipulated cells is affected. We found that the exogenously expressed ROBO3<sub>A.1</sub> protein mostly overlaps with the GFP marker and ROBO3<sub>A.1</sub> expression is able to rescue the midline crossing defect in Robo3 KOs to a large extent. We estimated that around 80% of Robo3 KO axons that express Robo3<sub>A.1</sub> are able to cross the midline, whereas no axon expressing GFP alone can cross.</p><p>Using the same approach, we attempted to assess what fraction of neurons that exogenously express DCC is affected in this study. However, due to the presence of endogenous DCC in <italic>Nova</italic> KOs, we were unable to specifically detect the exogenous protein using anti-DCC. The exogenous DCC is tagged with HA at the C-terminus. Although we could detect the HA tag in dissociated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>), we were unable to detect any signal in tissue sections. However, given that the rescue of <italic>Nova</italic> dKO by <italic>Dcc</italic><sub>long</sub> is observed in all animals and in all sections examined, and that the rescue is to a large degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), we think most manipulated cells are affected, similar to what we have observed before in the Robo3 study.</p><p><italic>2) The other major (and probably more severe) weakness is the lack of mechanistic insight. The authors attempt to test whether the long and short DCC splice variants might differ in stability, expression, or localization and do not observe changes for ectopically expressed forms. However, it remains unclear whether the long variant indeed engages in some specific protein complexes at the cell surface. I should be noted that the authors openly discuss this issue in the manuscript and I feel that the work is an important contribution, even if the mechanism remains unclear.</italic></p><p>We agree that our study does not yet address the mechanism underlying the distinct activities of DCC isoforms. There are many possibilities to be examined. This study revealed the functional importance of <italic>Dcc</italic> alternative splicing and identified the relevant splicing factor, which would be the first step in determining how each DCC variant contributes to the gene function during cell migration and axon guidance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>[…] The paper is clearly written and the data in the figures are easy to follow. The data can be interpreted in several different ways. The authors conclude that DCC long is required for ventral migration. An alternative view, would be that DCC<sub>short</sub> antagonizes ventral migration. By inhibiting splicing the ratio of DCC<sub>short</sub> to DCC<sub>long</sub> increases. The data do not rule out the possibility that migration phenotype could reflect reduction in DCC<sub>long</sub>, an increase in DCC<sub>short</sub> or both. Furthermore, normal ventral migration may require both. That is DCC<sub>long</sub> and DCC<sub>short</sub> may form a heterodimer and this heterodimer, and a certain level of it, may be essential for normal migration. The discussion in the other manuscript that considers the relationship between different forms of DCC and its function should be incorporated into this manuscript.</italic></p><p><italic>The paper is appropriate for eLife.</italic></p><p>We fully agree that there are several alternative models on DCC isoform functions. Our data does not yet allow us to distinguish between the different possibilities outlined by the reviewer. We have now included more thorough discussion on the possible interpretations of our results.</p></body></sub-article></article>
