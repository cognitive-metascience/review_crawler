These are mediated by the Wnt enhanceosome, a multiprotein complex binding to the Pygo chromatin reader and acting through TCF/LEF-responsive enhancers. Pygo renders this complex Wnt-responsive, by capturing β-catenin via the Legless/BCL9 adaptor. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering of <italic>Drosophila legless (lgs)</italic> and human <italic>BCL9</italic> and <italic>B9L</italic> to show that the C-terminus downstream of their adaptor elements is crucial for Wnt responses. BioID proximity labeling revealed that BCL9 and B9L, like PYGO2, are constitutive components of the Wnt enhanceosome. Wnt-dependent docking of β-catenin to the enhanceosome apparently causes a rearrangement that apposes the BCL9/B9L C-terminus to TCF. This C-terminus binds to the Groucho/TLE co-repressor, and also to the Chip/LDB1-SSDP enhanceosome core complex via an evolutionary conserved element. An unexpected link between BCL9/B9L, PYGO2 and nuclear co-receptor complexes suggests that these β-catenin co-factors may coordinate Wnt and nuclear hormone responses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20882.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20882.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20882.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In every animal, different cells must be able to communicate with each other to make sure that the body is correctly formed and maintained. Animal cells have many ways of communicating, but one important and well-studied mechanism involves a signaling molecule called Wnt that is released by some cells and received by others. The Wnt molecule and its effects are similar in all animals, and over-active Wnt signaling in humans contributes to a number of diseases including various cancers.</p><p>The Wnt signal is carried from the surface of the receiving cell to the DNA in its nucleus via a protein called β-catenin. The β-catenin protein then helps to switch on a large number of genes. However, to do this β-catenin must interact with an assembly of other proteins collectively called the Wnt enhanceosome. There are still many unknowns about how exactly β-catenin cooperates with the enhanceosome.</p><p>Now, van Tienen et al. investigated one component of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway called BCL9/B9L: a large protein that contains a number of flexible regions. First, a biochemical technique called BioID was used with human embryonic kidney cells to determine the proteins that BCL9/B9L encounters during a 12-hour period. This technique can detect when two proteins come close together, even if the interaction is weak or does not last very long.</p><p>The BioID experiments showed that BCL9/B9L is close to two proteins in the Wnt enhanceosome in addition to β-catenin, and other techniques were used to confirm that one of these proteins contacts BCL9/B9L directly. The experiments also showed that BCL9/B9L acted as a tether to bring β-catenin close to the protein within the enhanceosome that binds to the DNA. Importantly, BCL9/B9L interacted with the enhanceosome both in the presence and absence of Wnt, indicating that the assembly is ready to switch genes on as soon as β-catenin reaches the DNA.</p><p>Next, van Tienen et al. confirmed that the parts of BCL9/B9L that bind to the enhanceosome are important for its activity by using a gene-editing technology called CRISPR/Cas9 to essentially delete them both in the human cells and in fruit flies.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the BioID experiments also revealed that BCL9/B9L binds to proteins that transmit signals from molecules other than Wnt, in particular from hormones such as estrogen and androgen. Future experiments could explore if, and how, BCL9/B9L integrates these signals from hormones with the signal from Wnt. A better understanding of this process might have important implications for the treatment of certain cancers, such as breast and prostate cancers that can be driven by over-active hormone signals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20882.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20882.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>BCL9/Legless</kwd><kwd>Wnt signalling pathway</kwd><kwd>Wnt enhanceosome complex</kwd><kwd>nuclear co-receptor complex</kwd><kwd>Osa/ARID1A</kwd><kwd>Groucho/TLE</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U105192713</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bienz</surname><given-names>Mariann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C7379/A8709</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bienz</surname><given-names>Mariann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C7379/A15291</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bienz</surname><given-names>Mariann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>BCL9/Legless is an integral component of the Wnt enhanceosome, harboring binding sites in its conserved C-terminus for multiple core components of this complex including ChiLS and Groucho/TLE.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade is an ancient cell communication pathway that operates context-dependent transcriptional switches to control animal development and tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cadigan and Nusse, 1997</xref>). Deregulation of the pathway in adult tissues can lead to many different cancers, most notably colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</xref>). Wnt-induced transcription is mediated by T cell factors (TCF1/3/4, LEF1) bound to Wnt-responsive enhancers, but their activity depends on the co-activator β-catenin (Armadillo in <italic>Drosophila</italic>), which is rapidly degraded in unstimulated cells. Absence of β-catenin thus defines the OFF state of these enhancers, which are silenced by Groucho/TLE co-repressors bound to TCF via their Q domain. This domain tetramerizes to promote transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chodaparambil et al., 2014</xref>), which leads to chromatin compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sekiya and Zaret, 2007</xref>) apparently assisted by the interaction between Groucho/TLE and histone deacetylases (HDACs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jennings et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Turki-Judeh and Courey, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Wnt signaling relieves this repression by blocking the degradation of β-catenin, which thus accumulates and binds to TCF, converting the Wnt-responsive enhancers into the ON state. This involves the binding of β-catenin to various transcriptional co-activators via its C-terminus, most notably to the CREB-binding protein (CBP) histone acetyltransferase or its p300 paralog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mosimann et al., 2009</xref>), resulting in the transcription of the linked Wnt target genes. Subsequent reversion to the OFF state (for example, by negative feedback from high Wnt signaling levels near Wnt-producing cells, or upon cessation of signaling) involves Groucho/TLE-dependent silencing, but also requires the Osa/ARID1 subunit of the BAF (also known as SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins and Treisman, 2000</xref>) which binds to β-catenin through its BRG/BRM subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barker et al., 2001</xref>). Cancer genome sequencing has uncovered a widespread tumor suppressor role of the BAF complex, which guards against numerous cancers including colorectal cancer, with &gt;20% of all cancers exhibiting at least one inactivating mutation in one of its subunits, most notably in ARID1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kadoch and Crabtree, 2015</xref>). Thus, it appears that failure of Wnt-inducible enhancers to respond to negative feedback imposed by the BAF complex strongly predisposes to cancer.</p><p>How β-catenin overcomes Groucho/TLE-dependent repression remains unclear, especially since β-catenin and TLE bind to TCF simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chodaparambil et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the simplest model envisaging competition between β-catenin and TLE cannot explain this switch, which implies that co-factors are required. One of these is Pygo, a chromatin reader binding to histone H3 tail methylated at lysine 4 (H3K4m) via its C-terminal PHD finger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fiedler et al., 2008</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> where Pygo was discovered as an essential co-factor for activated Armadillo, its main function appears to be to assist Armadillo in overcoming Groucho-dependent repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mieszczanek et al., 2008</xref>). We recently discovered that Pygo associates with TCF enhancers via its highly conserved N-terminal NPF motif that binds directly to the ChiLS complex, composed of a dimer of Chip/LDB (LIM domain-binding protein) and a tetramer of SSDP (single-stranded DNA-binding protein, also known as SSBP). Notably, ChiLS also binds to other enhancer-bound NPF factors such as Osa/ARID1 and RUNX, and to the C-terminal WD40 domain of Groucho/TLE, and thus forms the core module of a multiprotein complex termed ‘Wnt enhanceosome’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fiedler et al., 2015</xref>). We proposed that Pygo renders this complex Wnt-responsive by capturing Armadillo/β-catenin through the Legless adaptor (whose orthologs in humans are BCL9 and B9L, also known as BCL9-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kramps et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Städeli and Basler, 2005</xref>). The salient feature of our model is that the Wnt enhanceosome keeps TCF target genes repressed prior to Wnt signaling while at the same time priming them for subsequent Wnt induction, and for timely shut-down via negative feedback depending on Osa/ARID1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fiedler et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we assess the function of Legless and BCL9/B9L within the Wnt enhanceosome. Using a proximity-labeling proteomics approach (called BioID; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roux et al., 2012</xref>) in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, we uncovered a compelling association between BCL9/B9L and the core Wnt enhanceosome components, regardless of Wnt signaling. Co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) and in vitro binding assays based on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) revealed that BCL9 and B9L associate with TLE3 through their C-termini, and that they bind directly to ChiLS via their evolutionary conserved homology domain 3 (HD3). These elements are outside the sequences mediating the adaptor function between Pygo and Armadillo/β-catenin, but they are similarly important for Wnt responses during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development and in human cells, as we show by CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing. Our results consolidate and refine the Wnt enhanceosome model, indicating a constitutive scaffolding function of BCL9/B9L within this complex. Our evidence further suggests that BCL9/B9L but not Pygo undergoes a β-catenin-dependent rearrangement within the enhanceosome upon Wnt signaling, gaining proximity to TCF, which might trigger enhanceosome switching.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The C-terminus of Legless is required for Wingless signaling during fly development</title><p>Legless and BCL9/B9L paralogs (collectively referred to as Legless/BCL9 below) bind to Pygo and Armadillo/β-catenin via their conserved N-terminal homology domains 1 and 2 (HD1, HD2), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Previous evidence suggested that the sole function of Legless during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development is to link Pygo to Armadillo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kramps et al., 2002</xref>). However, C-terminal truncations of BCL9/B9L behave as dominant-negatives regarding Wnt responses in mammalian cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de la Roche et al., 2008</xref>), which suggested that their C-termini harbor functionally relevant elements. Indeed, these elements are missing in a Legless truncation encoded by a known <italic>lgs</italic> mutation (<italic>lgs<sup>7I</sup></italic>), owing to a stop codon downstream of HD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kramps et al., 2002</xref>), yet this truncation should be fully competent to link Pygo to Armadillo. Consistent with the notion of functional elements downstream of HD2, the C-termini of Legless/BCL9 exhibit several conserved sequence blocks, in particular HD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) which is found in all orthologs from the most primitive animals to humans.

Identical phenotypes were observed in homozygotes bearing an equivalent truncation allele isolated independently (<italic>lgs<sup>1-5</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), ruling them out as off-target effects of the CRISPR/Cas9 engineering process. Thus, the sequences downstream of HD2 are essential for <italic>Drosophila</italic> development, and appear to participate in Wg signaling responses.</p><p>To confirm this, we examined a Wg-responsive transcriptional enhancer from <italic>dpp</italic> (<italic>dpp.lacZ</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blackman et al., 1991</xref>), which is repressed by high levels of Wg signaling emanating from the Wg source in ventral compartments of leg discs via a homeodomain protein called Brinker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Theisen et al., 2007</xref>).

This was also true for wing discs (dissected from of pupating larvae, to ensure matched developmental timing between mutants and wild-type, wt): these discs exhibit much reduced expression of <italic>Senseless</italic> (<italic>Sens</italic>) (n = 50 discs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>), a Wg target gene that specifies bristles along the wing margin and whose expression is abolished in <italic>pygo</italic> mutant clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fiedler et al., 2008</xref>).

However, the C-terminal truncation mutants of B9L (△C, △HD3△C) failed to do so (despite elevated expression levels in the case of △HD3△C), and the HD3 deletion provided only partial rescue activity, similarly to a deletion mutant lacking the HD1 Pygo-binding element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This demonstrates the crucial role of the B9L C-terminus for the Wnt response of these cells, and it indicates a functional contribution of HD3 to this response. Restoration of Wnt-responsiveness is also provided by re-expressed BCL9 tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP-BCL9) albeit not by its C-terminal truncation, but we did not analyze this paralog further since its transcriptional activation potential is not as strong as that of the nuclear B9L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de la Roche et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>B9L and BCL9 are constitutively associated with the Wnt enhanceosome</title><p>Given the requirement of the BCL9/B9L C-terminus for the Wnt response, we set out to identify its ligands that confer this function. Since previous attempts based on tandem-affinity pull-down experiments were unsuccessful (M Graeb, PhD thesis), we adopted a proximity-labeling approach called BioID, tagging B9L and BCL9 with BirA* (a promiscuous version of the biotin ligase BirA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roux et al., 2012</xref>) and using these as baits to probe the proteome associated with BCL9/B9L in cells. This method is capable of identifying transient low-affinity ligands of the bait as well as indirect bystanders (that is, indirect interactors and ‘vicinal’ proteins), provided these are within range of the BirA* tag: in the case of Lamin A, ~50% of the hits were estimated to be within 20–30 nm of its BirA* tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roux et al., 2012</xref>). The upper limit appears to be &lt;100 nm, according to BioID studies with Cep250, an extended coiled-coil protein that spans ~100 nm within the centrosomal complex (as determined by super-resolution microscopy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sonnen et al., 2012</xref>): the C-terminal ligand of Cep250 was only labeled by its C-terminal but not its N-terminal BirA* tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Firat-Karalar et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the BioID approach can provide insight into the position and reach of a bait’s BirA* tag within a protein complex. Note that BCL9/B9L is presumed to be an extended protein, with &gt;90% of its sequence predicted to be intrinsically unstructured.</p><p>To keep the expression of our BCL9 and B9L baits near endogenous levels, we chose a tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activation system based on T-REx-293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Jassar et al., 2017</xref>), isolating clonal T-REx-293 cell lines that express B9L-BirA* and BCL9-BirA* integrated at a specific genomic locus. Cells were labeled with biotin for 12 hr, with or without stimulation by Wnt3A-conditioned media or 50 mM LiCl (to inhibit glycogen synthase kinase 3, which causes activation of β-catenin, and thus mimics Wnt stimulation). Lysates were prepared for one-step biotin-avidin affinity purification and subsequent analysis by LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry. Recall that the probability of identifying a hit by this approach (reflected by the total number of unweighted spectral counts derived from this hit) is primarily determined by its proximity to the bait, but is also affected by the strength and duration of their interaction during the labeling period, and by other factors including size and cellular abundance of interactors and suitably exposed biotin-acceptor sites (primary amines).</p><p>We first conducted several experiments with B9L-BirA* as a bait since the B9L paralog is predominantly nuclear, and thus likely dedicated to the transcriptional Wnt response, while BCL9 is distributed throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de la Roche et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), possibly carrying out additional functions in the cytoplasm such as chaperoning β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de la Roche et al., 2012</xref>). Strikingly, each experiment identified known components of the Wnt enhanceosome, even in the absence of Wnt stimulation: we consistently found ARID1A and ARID1B as the top hits, followed closely by TLE3, TLE1, TLE4, LDB1 and PYGO2 and, further down the list, TCF factors, β-catenin and SSBP3/4 (initially named SSDP1/2; the peptides obtained do not distinguish between these closely related paralogs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We also found nine additional subunits of the BAF complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kadoch and Crabtree, 2015</xref>) on our list, topped by BRG-1/SMARCA4, with only BAF155/SMARCC1, BAF47/SMARCB1, SS18 and BCL7 missing (the latter three likely for technical reasons; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This indicates that the fully assembled BAF complex is tethered to the Wnt enhanceosome, presumably through its enhancer-binding Osa/ARID1 subunit which also binds to ChiLS (see Introduction). Furthermore, we found the CBP co-activator and its p300 paralog, as well as DNA-binding proteins of the LHX and GATA families known to tether ChiLS to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Love et al., 2014</xref>). Essentially the same set of proteins were found with BCL9-BirA* as a bait, albeit with lower efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), possibly because of its largely cytoplasmic localization. Indeed, we found several cytoplasmic proteins specifically associated with BCL9 but not B9L, including α-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20882.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>BCL9/B9L and PYGO2 are constitutively associated with the Wnt enhanceosome, and nuclear co-receptor complexes.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) List of BioID hits for (<bold>A</bold>) B9L-BirA* and (<bold>B</bold>) BCL9-BirA*±10–12 hr of WCM; names above the dotted line refer to the top hits, while names below this line refer to hits selected on relevance to Wnt (blue) or nuclear co-receptors (green); only specific hits with a &gt; 5 spectral count ratio relative to the BirA* control are shown; numbers represent unweighted spectral counts (&gt;95% probability).

This method relies on limited crosslinking of proteins in live cells followed by mass spectrometry of peptides cross-linked to the affinity-purified bait, and is thus capable of identifying direct ligands of the bait. It has been extensively validated for hit lists from immunoprecipitation-based approaches obtained for nuclear hormone receptors (for example, estrogen receptor) and other DNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mohammed et al., 2016</xref>). These RIME experiments identified only five specific hits; these proteins associated with B9L-BirA* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) include PYGO2, its only known direct ligand in the absence of Wnt. This short list also contained LDB1, which we shall identify below as another direct B9L ligand. It was topped by TLE3, suggesting that TLE3 may also be a direct ligand of B9L.</p><p>Importantly, the majority of the hits identified by B9L-BirA* or BCL9-BirA* hardly change after Wnt stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). This implies that BCL9/B9L is associated with the Wnt enhanceosome prior to Wnt stimulation and independently of β-catenin. We note however that the spectral counts of many hits tend to be slightly increased upon Wnt signaling, a trend that is also apparent for TLE1 and TLE3 whose labeling by B9L-BirA* was increased 2-3x upon Wnt stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Similarly, the labeling of GSE1 by B9L-BirA* is increased 3-5x in stimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>): GSE1 is a subunit of the BRAF-HDAC complex (also known as BHC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hakimi et al., 2003</xref>), which might interact with Groucho/TLE through its HDAC subunit, potentially explaining the Wnt-dependent increase in the labeling of GSE1. In any case, TLE1/3 behaves like the LDB1 core component of the Wnt enhanceosome in remaining associated with Wnt-responsive enhancers even when these are active, consistent with recent findings that TLE1 and β-catenin can bind simultaneously to TCF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chodaparambil et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>β-catenin triggers a Wnt-dependent apposition of the BCL9/B9L C-terminus to TCF</title><p>Association of β-catenin with BCL9/B9L is undetectable prior to Wnt stimulation, as expected from its low abundance in the absence of signaling. This may also explain why the labeling of CBP and p300 by B9L-BirA* is stimulated ~4–6x upon Wnt stimulation, given that these histone acetyltransferases are known ligands of β-catenin. However, both proteins exhibit a significant level of labeling even without Wnt signaling, suggesting a constitutive association with the Wnt enhanceosome, consistent with the identification of CBP by RIME as a putative direct ligand of B9L. It thus appears that the binding of CBP and p300 to β-catenin upon its docking to the Wnt enhanceosome increases their proximity to the C-terminus of BCL9/B9L, which bears the BirA* tag.</p><p>Three other factors exhibit a striking increase in labeling after Wnt stimulation, namely the TCF factors, APC and SSBP3/4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). TCF4 is the only TCF paralog labeled prior to Wnt signaling, albeit at very low levels (also by the BirA* control), but its labeling by B9L-BirA* or BCL9-BirA* is Wnt-inducible by 13x or 2.5x, respectively. For TCF1/3 and LEF1, no labeling is detectable in unstimulated cells, whereas each of these factors is labeled efficiently upon Wnt signaling (&gt;19–30x). The same is true for the APC tumor suppressor (&gt;29x), a BCL9-specific hit that is recruited to TCF target genes upon Wnt signaling by β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sierra et al., 2006</xref>), owing to direct high-affinity binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 2006</xref>). Finally, the labeling of SSBP3/4 by B9L-BirA* is moderately increased (&gt;6x) in Wnt-stimulated cells; as in the case of CBP/p300, SSBP3/4 is also detectable prior to Wnt signaling, albeit close to background levels. As far as we know, the expression levels of APC, SSBP3/4 and TCF factors do not change after Wnt stimulation, except for LEF1 whose levels increase ~2x in Wnt-stimulated HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de la Roche et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, a likely explanation for the Wnt-inducible labeling of these factors is that Wnt signaling, or β-catenin, induces their proximity to the C-terminus of BCL9/B9L. We note that TCF factors are bound constitutively to their cognate enhancers (for example, TCF4 in unstimulated HEK293 cells; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frietze et al., 2012</xref>) although, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the association of dTCF with Wg-responsive enhancers appears to be strengthened by Wg signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parker et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>To obtain independent evidence for the constitutive association between BCL9/B9L and TCF, we conducted coIP assays in HEK293T cells co-expressing FLAG-B9L and GFP-TCF4. As expected, the two proteins coIP with similar efficiency in cells with or without Wnt stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).

This underscores our notion that the Wnt-inducible labeling of TCF factors by B9L-BirA* and BCL9-BirA* reflects β-catenin-dependent apposition of the C-terminus of BCL9/B9L to TCF, rather than β-catenin-dependent recruitment of Legless/BCL9 to TCF (as initially envisaged; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kramps et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Städeli and Basler, 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The proximity of PYGO2 to TCF factors does not change during Wnt signaling</title><p>Strong independent support for this notion came from BioID experiments with PYGO-BirA*, which we expressed in T-REx-293 cells under identical conditions as the BCL9 and B9L baits; Wnt stimulation was confirmed by Western blotting against ABC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Given our evidence from RIME, this link is also likely to be direct although, for technical reasons, we have not been able to prove this. The function of the C-terminus of Legless/BCL9 for transducing Wnt signals was revealed by the <italic>wg</italic>-like phenotypes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae and flies and by their defective transcriptional Wg responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 and 2</xref>), and by the loss of transcriptional Wnt responses in BCL9/B9L-deleted human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Our evidence indicates that Legless/BCL9 undergoes three separate functionally relevant interactions with distinct components of the Wnt enhanceosome—with Pygo, ChiLS and Groucho/TLE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Importantly, BioID revealed that these interactions are constitutive, preceding Wnt signaling, and that they hardly change upon Wnt stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Taken together with its multivalent interactions with the Wnt enhanceosome, this is consistent with Legless/BCL9 being a core component of this complex, providing a scaffolding function that facilitates its assembly and/or maintains its cohesion.</p><p>Following Wnt stimulation, Legless/BCL9 undergoes an additional physiologically relevant interaction, by binding to (stabilized) Armadillo/β-catenin via HD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kramps et al., 2002</xref>). Legless/BCL9 thus confers Wnt-responsiveness on the Wnt enhanceosome through its ability to capture Armadillo/β-catenin. In other words, in addition to scaffolding the enhanceosome, Legless/BCL9 also earmarks this complex for Wnt responses. Intriguingly, our BioID data indicated that the capture of β-catenin by Legless/BCL9 triggers its rearrangement within the complex, apposing its C-terminus to TCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This apparent β-catenin-dependent apposition is consistent with structural data showing that BCL9/B9L HD2 is closely apposed to TCF when in a ternary complex with β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sampietro et al., 2006</xref>). Our evidence support the notion of Legless/BCL9 acting as an ‘Armadillo loading factor’, facilitating access of Armadillo/β-catenin to TCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de la Roche and Bienz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Townsley et al., 2004</xref>), but argues against the original co-activator hypothesis which posited that Legless/BCL9 is recruited to TCF by Armadillo/β-catenin exclusively in Wnt-stimulated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kramps et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Städeli and Basler, 2005</xref>). Whatever the case, the β-catenin-dependent apposition of the Legless/BCL9 C-terminus to TCF is likely to trigger Wnt enhanceosome switching from OFF to ON, resulting in the relief of Groucho/TLE-dependent repression and culminating in the Wnt-dependent transcriptional activation of linked target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>This transition of the Wnt enhanceosome from OFF to ON is accompanied by a proximity gain between Legless/BCL9 and CBP/p300 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), likely to reflect at least in part its de novo binding to Armadillo/β-catenin. However, our evidence indicates that CBP/p300 is associated with the Wnt enhanceosome prior to Wnt signaling, possibly via direct binding to B9L as suggested by RIME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), and that the docking of Armadillo/β-catenin to the Wnt enhanceosome strengthens its association with CBP/p300, and/or directs the histone acetyltransferase activity of CBP/p300 towards its substrates, primarily the histone tails. By acetylating these tails, CBP/p300 appears to promote Wnt-dependent transcription in flies and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, CBP-dependent histone acetylation has been observed at Wg target enhancers in <italic>Drosophila</italic> although, interestingly, this preceded transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parker et al., 2008</xref>). This is consistent with our BioID data, indicating constitutive association of CBP/p300 with the Wnt enhanceosome.</p><p>It seems plausible that histone acetylation at Wnt target enhancers is instrumental in antagonizing the compaction of their chromatin imposed by Groucho/TLE, which depends on its tetramerization via its Q domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chodaparambil et al., 2014</xref>) as well as its binding to HDACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jennings et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Turki-Judeh and Courey, 2012</xref>). Indeed, we found HDACs near the bottom of our BioID lists, and one of the top hits identified by B9L was GSE1, a subunit of the BRAF-HDAC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hakimi et al., 2003</xref>). However, CBP/p300 also has non-histone substrates within the Wnt enhanceosome, including dTCF in <italic>Drosophila</italic> whose Armadillo-binding site can be acetylated by dCBP, which thus blocks the binding between the two proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Waltzer and Bienz, 1998</xref>) and antagonizes Wg responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2007</xref>). It thus regulates Wnt-dependent transcription positively as well as negatively, similarly to Groucho/TLE which not only silences Wnt target genes but also earmarks them for Wnt inducibility, as a core component of the Wnt enhanceosome. It is intriguing that both bimodal regulators are associated constitutively with this complex. A corollary is that the docking of Armadillo/β-catenin to the Wnt enhanceosome changes their substrate specificities and/or activities.</p><p>An important refinement of our initial enhanceosome model is with regard to the BAF complex, which appears to be a constitutive component of the Wnt enhanceosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), as indicated by our BioID data. This complex is highly conserved from yeast to humans, and it contains 15 subunits in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kadoch and Crabtree, 2015</xref>), including the DNA-binding Osa/ARID1 subunit. A wealth of evidence from studies in flies and mammals indicates that this complex primarily antagonizes Polycomb-mediated silencing of genes, most notably of the <italic>INK4A</italic> locus which encodes an anti-proliferative factor, which could explain why the BAF complex functions as a tumor suppressor in many tissues. However, recall that this complex also specifically antagonizes Armadillo/β-catenin-mediated transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins and Treisman, 2000</xref>), likely via its BRG/BRM subunit which directly binds to β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barker et al., 2001</xref>). Evidence from studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> of Wg-responsive enhancers suggests that this complex mediates a negative feedback from high Wg signaling levels near Wg-producing cells which results in re-repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins and Treisman, 2000</xref>), imposed by the Brinker homeodomain repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Waltzer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Theisen et al., 2007</xref>) and its Armadillo-binding Teashirt co-repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gallet et al., 1999</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The same factors may also instal silencing on Wnt-responsive enhancers upon cessation of Wnt signaling. Notably, mammals do not have a Brinker ortholog, which could explain some of the apparent functional differences between flies and mammals with regard to the BAF complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kadoch and Crabtree, 2015</xref>). However, the closest mammalian relatives of Teashirt are the Homothorax/MEIS proteins, a family of homeodomain proteins whose expression can be Wnt-inducible (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wernet et al., 2014</xref>). They are thus candidates for Wnt-induced repressors that confer BAF-dependent feedback inhibition.</p><p>Notably, none of our BioID lists contained RUNX proteins. Based on our functional evidence from <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut enhancers, we proposed that these proteins (which bind to both enhancers and Groucho/TLE) are pivotal for initial assembly of the Wnt enhanceosome at Wnt-responsive enhancers during early embryonic development, or in uncommitted progenitor cells of specific cell lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fiedler et al., 2015</xref>). However, HEK293 cells are epithelial cells and may thus not express any RUNX factors. In any case, our negative BioID results suggest that RUNX factors function in a hit-and-run fashion. Evidently, the Wnt enhanceosome complex, once assembled at Wnt-responsive enhancers, can switch between ON and OFF states without RUNX.</p><p>In summary, we have uncovered a fundamental role to Legless/BCL9 as a scaffold of the Wnt enhanceosome, far beyond its role in linking Armadillo/β-catenin to Pygo. Indeed, the function of Legless/BCL9 may extend beyond transcriptional Wnt responses, as indicated by the unexpected discovery of its strong association with nuclear co-receptor complexes. Potentially, these associations underlie the observed cross-talk between Wnt/β-catenin and nuclear hormone receptor signaling, documented extensively in the literature (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beildeck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mulholland et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>), including evidence for direct activation of the androgen receptor by β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kypta and Waxman, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, a strong association between TLE1 and the estrogen receptor has been discovered in breast cancer cells, where TLE1 assists the estrogen receptor in its interaction with chromatin and its proliferation-promoting function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holmes et al., 2012</xref>). This is reminiscent of the role of Groucho/TLE as a cornerstone of the Wnt enhanceosome, proposed to earmark TCF enhancers for subsequent β-catenin docking and transcriptional Wnt responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fiedler et al., 2015</xref>). It will be interesting to test experimentally the putative roles of BCL9/B9L and Pygo in enabling cross-talk between β-catenin and nuclear hormone receptor signaling, both during normal development and in cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids, antibodies and resins</title><p>The following plasmids have been described: LDB1-FLAG, SSDP-FLAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fiedler et al., 2015</xref>); murine FLAG-B9L, FLAG-ΔC (called FLAG-ΔCter), GFP-B9L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2004</xref>); GFP-Lgs, GFP-TCF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Townsley et al., 2004</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Robb Krumlauf as Reviewing Editor and Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper presents interesting data that has the potential to help to resolve the mechanism of transcriptional activation of Wnt target genes. The manuscript addresses an important mechanistic detail of the TCF/b-catenin complex, concerning the addition of the ChiLS complex and how the Wnt &quot;enhanceosome&quot; may be assembled. The dominant model on TCF/b-catenin mediated transcription is the &quot;chain of co-activator&quot; model, which posits that TCF recruits β-catenin that in turn recruits the BCL9 and Pygo complex and other co-activators. The authors have challenged this model through a series studies, including the <italic>eLife</italic> 2015 paper, and they have argued that the BCL9, Pygo and the new ChiLS complex is preassembled on Wnt enhanceosome to recruit β-catenin. Understanding the mechanism concerning TCF/β-catenin is of general interest and important so the paper in principle is worthy of publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, there are a number of aspects of the work which need to be strengthened to make a compelling case. A few additional experiments should allow the authors to provide the supporting evidence to solidify this model and the authors need to modify the text and discussion around their model where the data are inconsistent. We realize it may take time to conduct the two main experiments suggested but we are willing to allow that time to strengthen this story.</p><p>The specific points to be addressed are:</p><p>1) The authors do not discuss some inconsistencies of their data with current models of Wnt signaling. They need to provide a more comprehensive interpretation of their data and how it might be reconciled with their previous studies. If the C-terminal region of Bcl9 proteins functions by binding the repressor TLE, one would expect deleting this region to enhance basal expression of Wnt target genes, rather than reducing their activation by Wnt. Analysis of Wg target gene expression in the <italic>lgs<sup>2-8</sup></italic> mutant might help to clarify this issue.</p><p>It is also not clear why the Chip heterozygous phenotype, which looks like a loss of wg function, should be suppressed by removing positively acting components of the complex such as <italic>arm</italic> and <italic>lgs</italic>, as well as the negatively acting component gro.</p><p>The absence of any Runx protein in the BCL9 and B9L biotinylation assays argues against such a protein being a central part of the Wnt enhanceosome as proposed by Fiedler et al.</p><p>The observation that Wnt signaling is necessary for the interaction of Lgs with β-catenin and TCF proteins and does not reduce its association with TLE proteins does not support a model in which the enhanceosome is present at TCF-bound enhancers in the absence of Wnt signaling.</p><p>2) The Authors employed BioID (using BirA*) followed by mass spectrometry to identify BCL9 (and the related B9L) binding partners (TLE, ChiLS, and nuclear receptor co-activators). They went one step further and combined BioID and spectral counting as a (semi) quantitative measurement for determination of protein interactions with and without Wnt. It is not clear to me whether these methods offer reliable quantification. For example, spectral counts for LDB1 and SSDP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> appear to contradict the IP results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, in particular with regard to the HD1 deletion mutant. It would be highly desirable that additional approaches can back up these arguments (derived from BioID). One of the key arguments of the authors' model is that Pygo/BCL9 and associated ChiLS are preassembled on chromatin prior to Wnt stimulation and recruits b-catenin to TCF upon Wnt signaling. The authors should demonstrate this important issue using other techniques, such as CHIP.</p><p>3) The NMR results showed that HD3 directly interacts with LDB1/SSDP, and HD3 deletion and W472A mutants reduced BCL9-LDB1 coIP. But HD1 appeared to have a more critical role as its deletion completely abolished BCL9-LDB1 coIP. The authors suggested, reasonably, that HD1 binding to Pygo, which interacts with LDB1, has a critical role in this multivalent interaction. The authors should be able to demonstrate this point directly using Pygo knockdown or knockout (via CRISPR).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20882.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Summary:</italic> </p><p><italic>This paper presents interesting data that has the potential to help to resolve the mechanism of transcriptional activation of Wnt target genes.

In a nutshell, our additional work includes (1) in-depth analysis of transcriptional Wg responses in imaginal discs from larvae bearing our <italic>lgs</italic> truncation allele, (2) comparative BioID for PYGO2 as well as PYGO2 knock-out by CRISPR/Cas9, and (3) coIP assays to complement our evidence from BioID. We believe that our new results provide compelling support for the enhanceosome model. They also strengthen our insights into the general components of the Wnt enhanceosome that are not dedicated to Wnt signaling, such as Groucho/TLE, CBP/p300 and the subunits of the BAF complex (in particular Osa/ARID1), which broadens the interest of our study.</p><p>Inevitably though, our additional work (3 new main figures, with 11 panels total; plus 6 new supplemental figures, with 12 panels total) nearly doubled the data described in our manuscript, and we were thus compelled to recast it as a Research Article. This also allowed us more space to explain more clearly the rationales underlying our approaches, and to outline how our results advance and revise current models of Wnt-dependent transcription switches (including our own; see below). Neither of this was possible in our original submission as a Research Update, because of length restrictions. We hope the referees will agree with us that the new format is appropriate for our revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>The specific points to be addressed are:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors do not discuss some inconsistencies of their data with current models of Wnt signaling. They need to provide a more comprehensive interpretation of their data and how it might be reconciled with their previous studies. If the C-terminal region of Bcl9 proteins functions by binding the repressor TLE, one would expect deleting this region to enhance basal expression of Wnt target genes, rather than reducing their activation by Wnt. Analysis of Wg target gene expression in the lgs<sup>2-8</sup> mutant might help to clarify this issue.</italic> </p><p>In our revised manuscript, we discuss our data in the context of current views of Wnt-dependent transcription switches, adding several references to refer to results published by others on this topic, much of which is consistent with our new evidence (or might be re-interpreted in the light of it). For example, we explain that Groucho/TLE is a bimodal regulator, not only conferring silence on the enhanceosome in the absence of signaling, but also earmarking it (together with other core components) for subsequent Wnt induction (Discussion, fifth paragraph): owing to its multivalent interactions with TCF, ChiLS and the Legless/BCL9 C- terminus, Groucho/TLE assumes the role of a cornerstone within the enhanceosome (see our refined model in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). As such, it may well be crucial for enhanceosome function (presumably by contributing to assembly and/or cohesion of the complex). It seems plausible that removing one of these interactions (e.g. by deleting its binding site in the Legless/BCL9 C-terminus) would compromise enhanceosome function and attenuate Wnt responses. We also point out in our revised manuscript (Discussion, last paragraph) that this positive role of Groucho/TLE within the Wnt enhanceosome is similar to its positive role in estrogen receptor signaling, as recently discovered by the Carroll group (Holmes et al., 2012): these authors showed that TLE1 promotes the interaction of estrogen receptor with chromatin and facilitates its function in stimulating proliferation of breast cancer cells.</p><p>Furthermore, we describe our BioID evidence (subsection “β-catenin triggers a Wnt-dependent apposition of the BCL9/B9L C-terminus to TCF”) that the CBP/p300 co-activator associates with the Wnt enhanceosome prior to Wnt signaling (revised Figure 4AB, D), possibly via direct interaction with Legless/BCL9, as indicated by RIME (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>Although we have not mapped this interaction, the best candidate for the CBP/p300 binding site in Legless/BCL9 is its C-terminus (given that this C-terminus contains three additional conserved sequence blocks, HD4-6, whose putative ligands have yet to be discovered). If so, this would further explain the positive role of this C-terminus, given that CBP/p300 is a well-established co-activator of transcription.</p><p>Interestingly, like Groucho/TLE, CBP/p300 is a bimodal regulator, acting activating or repressive depending on context, as shown by the Cadigan group and ourselves (Waltzer et al., 1998; Li et al., 2007). Furthermore, our BioID data indicated that both bimodal regulators are constitutively associated with the enhanceosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Indeed, CBP has been found to be active in the absence of Wnt signaling, e.g. towards dTCF (Waltzer et al., 1998), or towards histones, as shown by the Cadigan group (Parker et al., 2008) who detected dCBP-dependent histone acetylation associated with Wg-responsive enhancers prior to Wg-dependent transcription (cited in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion).</p><p>Importantly, we have extended our phenotypic analysis of <italic>lgs2-8</italic> mutant larvae and flies (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref>; new Figure 2—figure supplement 2C), and we have analyzed multiple Wg target genes in different imaginal discs of these mutants, including a Wg-responsive leg enhancer from <italic>dpp (dpp.lacZ</italic>) (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-D, G</xref>; new Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, B). This additional work provides compelling evidence that the deletion of the C-terminus of Legless invariably produces <italic>wg</italic>-like effects (also mimicking attenuated <italic>pygo</italic> function). This supports our conclusion that the C-terminal portion of the protein, downstream of its Pygo-Armadillo adaptor sequences, is essential for promoting transcriptional Wg responses during fly development.</p><p><italic>It is also not clear why the Chip heterozygous phenotype, which looks like a loss of wg function, should be suppressed by removing positively acting components of the complex such as arm and lgs, as well as the negatively acting component gro.</italic> </p><p>Genetic interactions caused by heterozygosity of genes (which reduces their expression levels by half, at least in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) are notoriously difficult to interpret. This gets worse if the proteins in question are components of a multiprotein complex, because it is hard to predict how reducing the expression levels of individual components will affect complex assembly, especially if the structure of this complex and its stoichiometry are poorly defined.</p><p>Nevertheless, in the revised figure legendof <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>, we provide what we consider a plausible explanation for the observed genetic interactions. Namely, it is well-established that the wing margin defects caused by halving the dose of <italic>chip</italic> means that this protein is severely limiting in wing discs (as discussed, and also exploited, extensively by the Dale, Cohen and Segal groups and others; see Fiedler et al., 2015).</p><p>This haploinsufficiency phenotype caused by <italic>chip</italic>/+ should therefore be exacerbated by lowering expression of its obligatory partner SSDP. It might be ameliorated by lowering the dose of enhanceosome components that, at their normal expression level, potentially sequester the limiting amounts of Chip by direct binding (e.g. Groucho, Pygo and Legless).</p><p><italic>The absence of any Runx protein in the BCL9 and B9L biotinylation assays argues against such a protein being a central part of the Wnt enhanceosome as proposed by Fiedler et al.</italic> </p><p>Absolutely, and we now state this explicitly (Discussion, seventh paragraph). We offer the following (in our view plausible) explanation for this finding: namely, the role of RUNX in promoting Wnt enhanceosome function in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo (as uncovered by our study of Wg-responsive embryonic midgut enhancers; Fiedler et al., 2015) is reminiscent of its pioneering functions in other uncommitted cell lineages, e.g. in the hematopoietic system. However, HEK293 cells are epithelial cells, and our data from BioID and Wnt reporter assays clearly show that the Wnt enhanceosome is fully functional in these cells without RUNX (indeed, we could not find any evidence for RUNX protein expression in these cells). A corollary is that RUNX functions in a hit-and-run fashion, to help set up the Wnt enhanceosome on Wnt-responsive enhancers in uncommitted cell lineages; however, once assembled (e.g. in epithelial cells), RUNX is no longer required for enhanceosome- mediated ON/OFF switching. Hit-and-run is a well-established concept in other contexts of transcriptional control during development, e.g. in setting up Polycomb-repressive complexes in the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo.</p><p><italic>The observation that Wnt signaling is necessary for the interaction of Lgs with β-catenin and TCF proteins and does not reduce its association with TLE proteins does not support a model in which the enhanceosome is present at TCF-bound enhancers in the absence of Wnt signaling.</italic> </p><p>This was our most intriguing BioID result – namely the Wnt-inducible labeling of TCF factors by both BCL9-BirA* and B9L-BirA*. We proposed in our initial submission that this reflects a β-catenin-dependent increase in proximity between TCF and the BCL9/B9L C- terminus (which bears the BirA* tag; see also below, point 3). We now provide two new strands of evidence to support this notion: firstly, we use coIP assays to show that the association of BCL9/B9L with TCF is similarly stable before and after Wnt stimulation, like its association with Pygo, while its association with β-catenin depends on Wnt stimulation (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>). Secondly, we have conducted BioID with PYGO2-BirA* under identical conditions (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which revealed no new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> significant change in the labeling of TCF factors by this bait (), in contrast to the labeling of TCF factors by the BCL9/B9L baits which is strongly Wnt- inducible, especially in the case of B9L-BirA* (13-30x; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>). Apart from these factors, the hits identified by PYGO2-BirA* are remarkably similar to those identified by the BCL9/B9L baits (summarized in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>), showing constitutive labeling of virtually all enhanceosome components. Notable exceptions are β-catenin and CBP/p300 whose labeling is Wnt-dependent or Wnt-stimulated, respectively, as in the case of the BCL9/B9L baits (see above).</p><p>As in the case of the BCL9/B9L baits, the list of constitutively labeled components by PYGO2-BirA* includes TLE3 and TLE1, underscoring our conclusion that these co- repressors remain associated with the Wnt enhanceosome even during Wnt signaling. Although this is against the prevailing view of Groucho/TLE detaching from TCF factors as a result of their binding to β-catenin, but to our knowledge, this has never been explicitly tested (e.g. by ChIP). Unfortunately, the Groucho antiserum previously used for ChIP (e.g. by the Jennings group) and initially produced by Kharchenko et al. (2011) is no longer available. However, this notion of competition between Groucho/TLE and Armadillo/β-catenin was seriously challenged recently by the discovery of Weis and Waterman and co-workers that TLE and β-catenin can bind to TCF simultaneously (Chodaparambil et al., 2014), as we point out in our Introduction.</p><p>PYGO2-BirA* also labels the nuclear co-receptor components, like BCL9-BirA* and B9L- BirA*. This strengthens the link between the Wnt enhanceosome and nuclear hormone receptor signaling, as discussed in the last paragraph of the Discussion. In this paragraph, we also cite work by the Carroll group who found a strong association of TLE1 with estrogen receptor-occupied loci in breast cancer cells, and a positive role of TLE1 in promoting the function of this nuclear hormone receptor (Holmes et al., 2012). As mentioned above, this is reminiscent of its role in promoting Wnt enhanceosome function and Wnt responses.</p><p>Finally, in the second paragraph of the subsection “β-catenin triggers a Wnt-dependent apposition of the BCL9/B9L C-terminus to TCF”, we refer to work by Parker et al. (2002) who provided ChIP-based evidence that, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the association of dTCF with target enhancers is increased by Wg signaling. This is not inconsistent with out BioID data from the BCL9/B9L baits which show slightly increased labeling of most Wnt enhanceosome components, although this increase is not seen with the PYGO2 bait. In any case, TCF factors clearly associate with target enhancers in the absence of Wnt signaling in HEK293 cells, as shown by Frietze et al. (2012) (cited in the aforementioned paragraph). Whether or not the binding of β-catenin to Legless/BCL9 and/or TCF results in a stabilization of these interactions will require future testing.</p><p><italic>2) The Authors employed BioID (using BirA*) followed by mass spectrometry to identify BCL9 (and the related B9L) binding partners (TLE, ChiLS, and nuclear receptor co-activators). They went one step further and combined BioID and spectral counting as a (semi) quantitative measurement for determination of protein interactions with and without Wnt. It is not clear to me whether these methods offer reliable quantification. For example, spectral counts for LDB1 and SSDP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> appear to contradict the IP results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, in particular with regard to the HD1 deletion mutant. It would be highly desirable that additional approaches can back up these arguments (derived from BioID).</italic> </p><p>In the revised manuscript, we state more clearly that coIP assays assess (relatively stable) associations between proteins, while BioID assesses primarily their proximity (even if this reflects weak binding affinities). We have added an introductory paragraph on BioID (subsection “B9L and BCL9 are constitutively associated with the Wnt enhanceosome”, first paragraph), explaining how the spectral counts obtained by this approach can be taken as (semi)quantitative measurements of proximity, which can provide insight into the spatial organization of large protein complexes. This was demonstrated in the original Roux et al. (2012) paper by comparing biotin labeling efficiencies of interactors of Laminin A tagged with N-terminal or C-terminal BirA*. Proximity-dependent labeling efficiencies have since been documented by others, and we cite a compelling example of BioID data obtained by the Stearns group on components of the human centrosomal complex (Firat-Karalar et al., 2014). In the same paragraph, we also mention other factors that can affect the efficiency of biotin labeling by the bait, but these are less relevant for the comparison of hits obtained under different conditions (with or without Wnt), or of hits labeled by different baits under the same conditions (BCL9/B9L versus PYGO2).</p><p>Finally, as mentioned above, we have complemented our evidence from BioID with coIP assays, which revealed a relatively stable association between TCF4 and B9L in unstimulated cells, which is only slightly increased upon stimulation (see above; new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>).</p><p><italic>One of the key arguments of the authors' model is that Pygo/BCL9 and associated ChiLS are preassembled on chromatin prior to Wnt stimulation and recruits b-catenin to TCF upon Wnt signaling. The authors should demonstrate this important issue using other techniques, such as CHIP.</italic> </p><p>We are unable to conduct ChIP experiments since ChIP-grade antisera for these proteins are not (or no longer) available. Instead, we have conducted coIP experiments, and also comparative BioID labeling by PYGO2-BirA*, to complement and consolidate our conclusions based on the BCL9/B9L BioID baits (as detailed above).</p><p><italic>3) The NMR results showed that HD3 directly interacts with LDB1/SSDP, and HD3 deletion and W472A mutants reduced BCL9-LDB1 coIP. But HD1 appeared to have a more critical role as its deletion completely abolished BCL9-LDB1 coIP. The authors suggested, reasonably, that HD1 binding to Pygo, which interacts with LDB1, has a critical role in this multivalent interaction. The authors should be able to demonstrate this point directly using Pygo knockdown or knockout (via CRISPR).</italic> </p><p>We have done this, by knocking out PYGO2 by CRISPR/Cas9 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The results (shown in new =Figure 5—figure supplement 3) support our notion of Pygo’s critical role in promoting the interaction between LDB1 and BCL9/B9L.</p></body></sub-article></article>
