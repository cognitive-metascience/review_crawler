However, the molecular mechanisms mediating this relationship remain elusive. We therefore determined the dynamic, stimulus-dependent transcriptional regulation of germ-free (GF) and GF mice colonised post weaning (exGF) in the amygdala, a brain region critically involved in regulating social interaction. In GF mice the dynamic response seen in controls was attenuated and replaced by a marked increase in expression of splicing factors and alternative exon usage in GF mice upon stimulation, which was even more pronounced in exGF mice. In conclusion, we demonstrate a molecular basis for how the host microbiome is crucial for a normal behavioural response during social interaction. Our data further suggest that social behaviour is correlated with the gene-expression response in the amygdala, established during neurodevelopment as a result of host-microbe interactions. Our findings may help toward understanding neurodevelopmental events leading to social behaviour dysregulation, such as those found in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33070.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In our bodies, there are at least as many microbial cells as human cells. These microbes, known collectively as the microbiome, influence the activity of our brain and also our behaviour. Studies in species from insects to primates have shown that the microbiome affects social behaviour in particular. For example, germ-free mice, which grow up in a sterile environment and thus have no bacteria in or on their bodies, are less sociable than normal mice.</p><p>For animals to show behaviours such as social interaction, cells in specific regions of the brain must change the activity of their genes. These brain regions include the amygdala, which is part of the brain’s emotion processing network, and also contributes to fear and anxiety responses. Stilling et al. set out to determine whether gene activity in the amygdala during social interaction differs between germ-free mice and those with a normal microbiome.</p><p>Stilling et al. placed each mouse into a box with three chambers. One chamber contained an unfamiliar mouse while another contained an inanimate object. Germ-free mice were less sociable and spent less time than control animals interacting with the unfamiliar mouse. Before entering either test chamber, the germ-free animals showed signs of excessive activity in the amygdala. During social interaction, they displayed a strikingly different pattern of gene activity in this brain region compared to controls. In particular, they had increased levels of a process called alternative splicing. This process enables cells to produce many different proteins from a single gene.</p><p>These results reveal one of the steps leading from absence of bacteria during brain development to reduced sociability in adulthood in mice. Increases in gene activity in the amygdala may provide clues to the processes underlying reduced sociability in people with autism spectrum disorders. This new study thus deepens our understanding of the link between the microbiome and brain health.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Social behaviour</kwd><kwd>neurodevelopment</kwd><kwd>microbiome</kwd><kwd>amygdala</kwd><kwd>activity-dependent transcription</kwd><kwd>autism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001602</institution-id><institution>Science Foundation Ireland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12/RC/2273</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shanahan</surname><given-names>Fergus</given-names></name><name><surname>Clarke</surname><given-names>Gerard</given-names></name><name><surname>Claesson</surname><given-names>Marcus J</given-names></name><name><surname>Dinan</surname><given-names>Timothy G</given-names></name><name><surname>Cryan</surname><given-names>John F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002081</institution-id><institution>Irish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GOIPD/2014/355</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stilling</surname><given-names>Roman M</given-names></name><name><surname>Cryan</surname><given-names>John F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Irish Health Board</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dinan</surname><given-names>Timothy G</given-names></name><name><surname>Cryan</surname><given-names>John F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009670</institution-id><institution>National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20771</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clarke</surname><given-names>Gerard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Social-interaction impairment in germ-free mice is associated with a markedly altered transcriptional response to social novelty in the amygdala, as characterised by replacement of upregulation of common stimulus-induced pathways with upregulation of the splicing machinery.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The tight association that animals have with the trillions of microbes that colonise them is the result of a long evolutionary history.

Importantly, a growing body of data in healthy volunteers and patient populations is emerging, indicating microbial influences also translate to human emotional behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tillisch et al., 2013</xref>) and have been suggested to play a role in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stilling et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hsiao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mayer et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Strati et al., 2017</xref>) and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dinan et al., 2014</xref>).

It is, however, still largely unclear how and where the microbiota influence brain function and which mechanisms mediate changes in behaviour.</p><p>While the amygdala is critically involved in anxiety and fear-related behaviours and memory, it is also a well-established key emotional brain centre for evaluating and responding to social stimuli in humans and other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allsop et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amaral, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kliemann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Noonan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Phelps and LeDoux, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sabatini et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sallet et al., 2011</xref>). As such, neuropsychiatric disorders characterised by social deficits (including autism spectrum and anxiety disorders) are associated with structural and functional changes in the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amaral and Corbett, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Baron-Cohen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Monk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schultz, 2005</xref>).

By colonising GF mice at weaning age (exGF), developmental effects can be distinguished from dynamic, reversible effects of a functional microbiota. Previous studies, focussed on the ability of post-weaning colonisation of formerly GF rodents to reverse behavioural deficits, have produced mixed results with some phenotypes being reversible while others seemed to be developmentally programmed (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stilling et al., 2014b</xref>) for review). Thus, the mechanistic underpinnings of behavioural changes in GF mice and how they are controlled by early colonisation during development are still elusive.</p><p>We here provide evidence that the microbiota is a critical regulator of social interaction-induced gene expression in the amygdala. Using an unbiased, genome-wide approach to determine gene expression in the amygdala by paired-end, stranded, ribodepleted RNA-sequencing together with a comprehensive downstream analysis pipeline, we studied alterations in the amygdala transcriptome in response to a social interaction stimulus. We find a unique transcriptional response in GF mice that involves upregulation of the splicing machinery, which is able to partially compensate for impairments in neuronal plasticity signalling during social interaction in these animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Germ-free mice display impaired sociability behaviour with high inter-individual variability</title><p>Mice lacking any interaction with microorganisms throughout development have a range of behavioural phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Luczynski et al., 2016</xref>), including memory impairments and altered anxiety behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoban et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gareau et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Here, we subjected conventional mice (CON-SI), germ-free mice (GF-SI), and germ-free mice colonized after weaning (exGF-SI) to a social stimulus (the three-chamber social interaction test (3CSIT), based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nadler et al., 2004</xref>) and measured the time during which the test mice interacted with a conventional conspecific male mouse or a non-social object (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, experimental design and workflow).

Thus we sought to identify potential molecular pathways involved in mediating microbiome-to-brain signalling by systematically comparing gene expression patterns in the amygdala of mice that were exposed to social environmental stimulation (social interaction, SI) mice. To this end, we retrieved RNA from naïve animals and 1 hr after the social experience for CON, GF and exGF animals and performed a highly comprehensive type of RNA-sequencing, using paired-end RNA libraries that retains information on which DNA strand was transcribed and includes also non-polyadenylated RNA species. This way our analysis incorporated gene expression changes at baseline and in response to stimulus-induced transcription of both, mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that lack a poly-A tail.</p><p>In a first step, we performed analysis of differential gene expression on all meaningful pairwise comparisons (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). When comparing the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs, both up- and downregulated) between naïve animals of different colonisation status, we find the highest number of DEGs in the CON-GF comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), as we have previously reported in an independent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stilling et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, when comparing naïve vs. stimulated animals the response in terms of number of DEGs was strongest in GF animals by far, providing evidence for the amygdalar transcriptomes to diverge between the three groups upon environmental stimulation by social interaction. Transcriptional divergence driven by neuronal activity is further supported by the number of DEGs when comparing the SI groups among each other, as these numbers are substantially (4–9 times) higher than DEG numbers for naïve comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Because meaningful Venn diagrams are limited to four or five comparisons, to identify groups of genes that are regulated in multiple comparisons, we plotted the presence or absence for each of the 4522 non-redundant genes found in any of the comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). As expected, there were multiple overlapping clusters between SI comparisons, demonstrating a core cluster of genes that are induced 1 hr after social novelty, independent of colonisation status. However, multiple clusters of genes showed differential regulation only in a particular group, suggesting differences in the transcriptomic response of the individual groups. We identified a cluster of genes that was differentially regulated in both GF naïve animals and upon social interaction stimulation in conventional animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This overlap was highly significant and made up large proportions of all genes up- or downregulated in naive GF animals compared to CON controls (38% and 26%, respectively). This cluster was not differentially regulated in GF animals upon stimulation by social interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In fact, there was a counter directional overlap (e.g. genes upregulated in CON vs. GF but downregulated in GF upon stimulation). Together, these data suggest that several genes typically induced in the amygdala of conventional controls upon social interaction are already elevated in GF mice, pointing towards amygdalar hyperactivity in these animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stilling et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To identify pathways and biological functions that are induced in the amygdala by social interaction under the different colonisation conditions, we next analysed the dataset for functional enrichment. To this end, we tested upregulated genes in each group for enrichment of biological functions using the gene ontology (GO) database and compared resulting p-values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We found a wide-range of biological functions to be enriched in the three conditions. While overall the groups differed substantially, we identified one cluster that showed good agreement between comparisons. For all three groups significant enrichment was found for processes such as protein modification and folding as well as regulation of gene expression. This is in good agreement with the fact that there is a core cluster of genes overlapping (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, large differences were seen in processes that are associated with intracellular signalling such as protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, which was enriched in the CON-SI comparison, but not in GF-SI or exGF-SI. The second striking difference was dramatic enrichment of processes associated with RNA splicing, most prominently in the GF-SI but also the exGF-SI group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Using gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA), which does not rely on cut-offs for p-value or fold-change, we find similar differences in functional enrichment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>We also analysed the dataset for enrichment of genes associated with specific cellular pathways using the KEGG pathways database. As expected, in the CON-SI group the MAP kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway was the dominant pathway enriched due to social interaction treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). This pathway, which is well established to be induced upon neuronal activity, was also enriched in GF-SI and exGI-SI groups, albeit to a much lesser degree. In fact, under more stringent analysis parameters enrichment failed to reach significance in these groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). For the GF-SI group we found a highly significant enrichment of genes associated with the spliceosome that was also significantly enriched, to a lesser extent, in the exGF-SI group and almost completely absent from the CON-SI group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To elucidate the differences in gene regulation in response to social interaction between CON and GF mice we analysed genes exclusively induced in either of the groups for further functional enrichment. In line with GO Term and KEGG pathway analysis we found that DEGs exclusively upregulated in CON-SI mice, were highly enriched in genes involved in intracellular signalling, especially the MAPK pathway, while DEGs exclusively upregulated in GF-SI mice were strongly enriched in genes associated with RNA processing, that is splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The core of genes that are induced independent of colonisation status is characterised by enrichment of genes involved in protein folding and, to a lesser degree, both, spliceosome and MAPK signalling pathway. Genes falling into these two KEGG categories made up relatively large proportions of all DEGs in the CON-SI and the GF-SI group, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Genes associated with the GO Term ‘RNA processing’ made up 4.4% of all DEGs in the GF-SI group (111/2510), which represents 15% of all mouse genes in this category (111/741). Comparing response-induced fold changes of these 111 genes between colonisation statuses, further highlighted that expression of this group of genes is highly distinctive in GF-SI animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This unique pattern was also evident when we plotted a comparison of these genes, where the individual gene identity was maintained across groups and where mean expression values for the remaining 630, not statistically significant mouse genes in the ‘RNA processing’ GO category for each group were included (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33070.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Loss of normal induction of MAP-K pathway is accompanied by upregulation of splicing pathways.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of enrichment of MAP-K pathway-associated genes and spliceosome-related genes among DEGs between groups.

In line with reduced activation of the MAPK pathway in GF-SI mice, we find several of these genes, including <italic>Egr3</italic>, <italic>Fos</italic>, and <italic>Ier5</italic> not to be upregulated in this group, possibly due to elevated expression levels at baseline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Together these data suggest that GF animals show a unique response signature toward environmental stimulation by social interaction. The transcriptional response is characterised by a marked upregulation of the genes involved in RNA processing and the splicing machinery, accompanied by an arrested upregulation of typical response genes, especially in those involved in MAPK signalling. Analysis of differential gene expression between naïve GF animals and controls also revealed that this lack of induction may be due to upregulation of several genes involved in these processes already at baseline.

While conventionally colonised controls exposed to social interaction showed comparatively little alternative exon usage, we found a dramatically increased number of DSGs in the GF-SI group, and noticed an even higher number of SI-induced DSGs in exGF animals. This was surprising since enrichment of splicing-associated genes among DEGs was highest in the GF-SI comparison, albeit significantly present also in the exGF-SI group.</p><p>As with the previous finding for DEGs, DSGs of the three comparisons also shared a ‘core’ set of genes that were alternatively spliced in response to social interaction, independent of colonisation status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This core was slightly enriched in genes associated with functional categories that are involved in neuronal function such as long-term potentiation (p<sub>adj</sub>=1.5e-02) and synaptic transmission (p<sub>adj</sub>=1.9e-4). In fact, the high degree of overlap between all three groups together with the high number of DSGs in GF-SI and exGF-SI groups suggests that, in addition to the conventional response, these two groups show supplementary cellular responses towards activation of the amygdala by social interaction. Interestingly, this additional response is even more pronounced in the exGF-SI group and is characterised by a high number of DSGs highly enriched in genes involved in mainly four principal functional categories: splicing/RNA processing, protein turnover, neuronal functions, and intracellular signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we ranked all expressed genes in our dataset by correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient) between expression level and time spent in active social interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). In order to identify functions that are associated with positively or negatively correlated genes we used the <italic>Gene Set Enrichment Analysis</italic> (GSEA) algorithm that assigns one or multiple functions to each gene in the list based on the GO Term or KEGG Pathway databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>). The algorithm then calculates an enrichment score for each function based on the rank of genes associated with this function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>).

There was no significant gene set enrichment for negative correlations between sociability behaviour and gene expression. These data suggest direct involvement of splicing and protein turnover pathways in the amygdala with behavioural performance.

Social behaviour appears to be among the behaviours most intimately connected to a functional microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Arentsen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Desbonnet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gacias et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lewin-Epstein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Theis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hsiao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buffington et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arentsen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Koch and Schmid-Hempel, 2011</xref>). However, the mechanistic underpinnings of this influence are only beginning to be resolved. Here we show, for what is to our knowledge the first time, that absence of the microbiome results in dysregulation of unique transcriptional-response pathways in the amygdala.</p><p>In line with previous reports, we show that microbes are necessary for development of appropriate sociability behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Arentsen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Desbonnet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buffington et al., 2016</xref>). In agreement with these studies we show reduced sociability behaviour of GF mice in the three-chamber social interaction task, rescued by post-weaning colonisation with a conventional microbiome. However, we do not observe a lack of preference of the conspecific mouse over an inanimate novel object in GF mice. Interestingly, while on average the group of GF mice spent significantly less time interacting with a conspecific than conventionally raised animals, some individual mice of this group performed at control level. This finding suggests, that the underlying networks controlling sociability behaviour are subject to a dynamic regulation, possibly associated with differences in intracellular and extracellular neuronal signalling pathways due to subtle differences accumulating during individual development. However, the fact that exGF mice, colonised with a conventional microbiota at weaning age, spent an intermediate amount of time in social interaction with more control-like variability within the group, argues that this development is highly susceptible to influence by symbiotic signals from the microbiota. Also in several analyses of gene expression regulation in response to social interaction exGF mice resemble an intermediate phenotype, bearing features of both CON and GF mice. As such, exGF mice show high enrichment of genes involved in ‘regulation of gene expression’ (most prominently enriched among CON-SI upregulated genes) as well as ‘RNA processing’ (most prominently enriched among GF-SI upregulated genes). This intermediate gene expression phenotype is also evident from the visualized functional enrichment using colour-coded functional GO-Terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>To characterize real transcriptome-wide changes in gene expression, in this study we used stranded, ribodepleted as opposed to poly-A enriched libraries for RNA-sequencing. In result, we describe dynamic regulation of several previously undescribed pathways in response to environmental stimulation. As such, we see regulation of RNA-processing non-coding RNAs, several of which are found in subnuclear Cajal bodies, that are particularly prominent in neurons - especially, when transcriptionally active - and are crucially involved in splicing regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lafarga et al., 2017</xref>). Our RNA-seq experiment thus offers exclusive and comprehensive insight into gene regulation in response to a social stimulus in the amygdala. Interestingly, induction of gene expression in this brain region shows similarities with the hippocampal transcriptional response to environmental novelty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stilling et al., 2014c</xref>). This overlap is very likely due to a ubiquitous, though highly specific transcriptional response in neurons towards neuronal activity, which includes induction of several well established immediate early genes such as <italic>Fos</italic> or <italic>Arc</italic>, the MAP-K pathway, and neurotrophic signalling via <italic>Bdnf</italic>. Moreover, we find upregulation of complement components, which have lately been established to be necessary for synaptic rearrangements and plasticity upon neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schafer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stephan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stevens et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, innate immune system genes together with neuronal activity-dependent genes have recently been shown to be dysregulated in autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gupta et al., 2014</xref>). Induction of complement genes upon social interaction was not seen in GF mice, possibly due to upregulation of <italic>C1q</italic> already under naïve conditions as compared to CON mice. Indeed, we find that a highly significant share of genes upregulated upon social interaction stimulation in CON mice is already upregulated in naïve GF mice. In perfect agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoban et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stilling et al., 2015</xref>), this finding suggests baseline hyperactivity of neurons in the amygdala in GF mice. Together, these findings confirm that the expected response of the control group serves as a positive control and provide internal validation that the methodology of this study is able to detect relevant changes in transcriptional regulation between groups.</p><p>Our data further shows that altered splicing activity is a normal process in neurons of the amygdala in response to social interaction in conventionally raised mice. Indeed, it is now well established, that neuronal activity induces alternative splicing patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ding et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hermey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Iijima et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schor et al., 2009</xref>), a dysfunction of which has been associated with changes seen in autism and autistic-like behaviour in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Quesnel-Vallières et al., 2016</xref>). Surprisingly, the regulation of genes involved in splicing, including Cajal body-associated genes, as well as alternative splicing activity is extremely exaggerated in GF mice, which possibly reflects a compensatory mechanism for already elevated activity-induced signalling at baseline. The finding that increased splicing activity is even more amplified in exGF mice, which display a largely normalized behavioural response, together with a positive correlation between expression of splicing-associated genes and behavioural performance suggests that in fact upregulation of the splicing machinery supports an adequate amygdalar response towards a social interaction environmental stimulus. In fact, previous research shows that post-weaning colonization (exGF) does not rescue impairments in social cognition, seen in GF mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Desbonnet et al., 2014</xref>). This is likely a reflection of an incomplete rescue of the molecular underpinnings of social behaviour investigated here. Although beyond the scope of the current study and technically challenging, future investigations should focus on untangling the network and pathways that drive the observed RNA processing changes and derive molecular consequences from altered mRNA/protein amino acid sequences.</p><p>In summary, our data is fully congruent with and offers a molecular basis for previous data on alterations in social cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Desbonnet et al., 2014</xref>), amygdala volume and dendrite complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Luczynski et al., 2016a</xref>), and increased transcription of activity-associated gene expression in the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoban et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stilling et al., 2015</xref>) in microbiome-deficient mice. We here show for what is to our knowledge the first time that the microbiota is necessary for regulation of core biological processes on the molecular and cellular level in the brain, which makes a strong case for a causal involvement of the microbiota in the molecular mechanisms leading to the observed impairments in sociability behaviour and the aetiology of neurodevelopmental diseases, which opens the possibility for new therapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Male F<sub>1</sub>-generation offspring from germ-free (GF) and conventionally-raised (CON) Swiss Webster breeding pairs previously obtained from Taconic (Germantown, New York, USA) were used in all experiments as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Desbonnet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stilling et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clarke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">O'Tuathaigh et al., 2007</xref>). GF mice were housed in groups of two-four per cage in flexible-film gnotobiotic isolators at a 12 hr light/dark cycle. Ex-germ-free (exGF) mice were removed from the GF unit after weaning on postnatal day p21, and housed on CON-used bedding next to CON mice in the standard animal unit to allow colonization of microbes present in the facility environment. CON mice were similarly housed two–five per cage under controlled conditions (temperature 20–21°C, 55–60% humidity) on the same 12 hr light/dark cycle. All groups received the same autoclaved, pelleted diet (Special Diet Services, product code 801010). Age at tissue extraction for all groups and experiments was 10 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>3-chamber social interaction test (3CSIT)</title><p>The 3CSIT was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Desbonnet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stilling et al., 2015</xref>). In brief, mice were habituated to the test room for half an hour and then habituated to a white plastic arena (40 × 20×20 cm), divided into three chambers by separators with small circular openings and lined with fresh bedding, for 10 min. The left and right chamber contained empty wire-mesh cages. These were then used to display an age- and sex-matched conventionally-raised mouse (chamber 1) or a mouse-sized and –coloured (white) non-social object during the test phase (porcelain egg cup). Exploration of the three chambers by the test mouse was recorded on video for 10 min and time spent in active interaction with the conspecific or object was measured by an experimenter, blinded to colonization status of the test mice. Group size for behaviour was n = 12 for GF-SI mice and n = 11 per group for CON-SI and exGF-SI groups, after removing outliers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>RNA extraction and sequencing</title><p>The amygdala from the left brain hemisphere was rapidly dissected on ice from fresh brain tissue as adapted from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zapala et al., 2005</xref>), stored in RNA<italic>later</italic> RNA Stabilization Reagent (Qiagen, Netherlands) at 4°C for 24 hr and then transferred to −80°C.

The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Stilling et al. uses transcriptomic analyses to identify differential changes in gene expression in amygdala of conventionally colonized vs germ-free mice after social stimulation. The study premise is of significant interest; however, there are concerns regarding the quality and robustness of the dataset that the reviewers hope the authors are able to address and resolve. Specifically, there is concern that the changes in gene expression are moderate relative to the large variation between replicates. Additional methodological controls are absolutely necessary and several textual revisions are needed to support the primary findings:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Molecular validation of key differentially expressed genes identified by transcriptomic analysis. Reviewers raised the concern that the manuscript is highly descriptive and lacks qPCR validation of key differentially expressed genes.</p><p>2) Examination of within-group gene expression changes relative to behavioral performance (e.g., comparison between germ-free mice that demonstrated social interaction behaviours similar to controls and those that clearly showed a deficit).</p><p>3) Examination of data relative to effect size of differential expression.</p><p>4) Comment on disagreement between behavioral phenotype reported in this study as compared to previous report in Desbonnet et al., 2014. The reviewers raised the concern that the germ free mice do not show impairment in social behavior in this study, as compared to previous findings from the same group.</p><p>5) Discussion of specific splicing factors in the context of existing literature and broader implications, and comment on whether changes in any splicing factors can explain the changes in exon usage.</p><p>6) Additional methodological details of quality controls for sequencing, such as RIN number of the RNA samples, sequencing depth, mapping rate, the number of exonic reads, 3' bias, etc. are needed to evaluate the quality of the data. Also there is question as to whether the analytical software used considers whether alternative splicing occurs using exon junction reads. Consideration of how many of the reported exons are alternative exons based on existing annotations is needed.</p><p>7) More nuanced discussion of the implications of findings. The reviewers request a more focused discussion of conclusions that can be drawn from the provided data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Stilling et al. employed transcriptomics to determine the influence of the gut microbiome on social-interaction-induced changes in gene expression in the amygdala. By comparing naïve vs. socially stimulated mice, both control and germ-free (GF) mice, the authors found that social interaction triggers a differential change in gene expression in GF mice compared to control mice. Changes in the transcriptional landscape and GF social deficits were partially reversed by colonization at weaning. The authors identified significant overlap in a core population of genes that were differentially expressed in both naïve GF animals and socially stimulated controls. Among these, genes encoding elements of the MAPK pathway, which regulates neural plasticity, were upregulated in naïve GF animals, but only after social stimulation in conventionally colonized controls. Moreover, social stimulation markedly upregulated genes involved in RNA processing and splicing in GF animals, which was not observed in either control or GF animals colonised at weaning. Finally, the authors determined that the extent of alternative splicing observed in the amygdala of an individual correlated with the severity of the behavioral deficit observed in the animal.</p><p>I find the paper by Stilling et al. to be an interesting piece of work. However, as it stands, the paper suffers from several deficiencies. First, the work is primarily descriptive and there is no molecular validation of the bioinformatic results. Second, and perhaps more problematic, the GF mice do not show impairment in social behavior. Briefly, GF mice spent more time interacting with a mouse vs. an inanimate object, which is inconsistent with previous findings from the same group. Finally, it is not clear why the study focuses exclusively on the amygdala. A more thorough study comparing gene expression pattern from brain regions involved in social behaviors will strengthen this study. My specific comments are below:</p><p>1) The data presented in Figures 1B and C are inconsistent with a previous study from this group (Desbonnet et al., 2014) in which GF animals preferred interaction with an empty cup over interaction with a mouse in the 3-chamber task. This inconsistency should be addressed and the data in panels B and C should be combined into a single panel with accompanying statistical data from both intra- and inter-group two-way ANOVAs.</p><p>2) The authors should validate the top 10-25 transcripts reported in Figure 2 by qPCR or Western blotting and provide these data in the figure. In the same line, MAPK pathway activity is readily accessible for analysis by Western blotting. Can the authors provide molecular validation of the MAPK pathway data-baseline upregulation in GF animals and post-interaction upregulation in controls?</p><p>3) It's unlikely that the alternative splicing events in GF animals are restricted to the amygdala. Other structures including those in the mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system, specifically the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area, are emerging as regions critically involved in regulating social behavior. Did the authors perform similar transcriptomic analysis on tissue isolated from other brain regions following the interaction? This data would bolster the authors' claim that colonization-state dependent alterations in RNA splicing and processing exerts meaningful influence over social behavior.</p><p>4) The lengthy Discussion presents an interesting theory unifying neuroimmune interaction data with findings from the microbiome and behavior field; however, this is completely outside of the scope of the conclusions that can be drawn from the provided data and, in my view, the implications of this study should be toned down.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This article explores the potential underlying molecular mechanisms of impaired social behaviour in Germ-Free (GF) mice. A key finding is that following an established social interaction test, GF animals exhibited an increased expression of genes encoding splicing factors in the amygdala, relative to controls. Although GF mice that were colonised with microbiota after weaning demonstrated similar molecular changes, they were greater than in GF mice. Overall the manuscript documents extremely important observations that not only lend further support for the involvement of the microbiome in sociability, but also provides essential, novel data that can be interrogated more extensively to decipher how microbial communities might influence host central function. This report is well written, the figures are excellent and the state-of-the-art methodologies and statistical analyses used were entirely appropriate. My comments are:</p><p>1) Not sure if comparisons with behaviour naïve and tested mice really add to the study, and perhaps can be moved to supplementary data?.…The work is not addressed in the Discussion anyway – what key information can the reader glean from these associations?</p><p>What really would have been interesting to see are comparisons between the GF mice that demonstrated social interaction behaviours similar to controls (&gt;300 sec), with those that clearly showed a deficit (&lt;200sec) in Figure 1B i.e. what are the molecular profiles within the GF-SI cohorts?.…The authors did mention variability amongst these animals, so are these variabilities reflected at the molecular level?.…Obviously a meaningful analysis might be under-powered, but even a cursory inspection would be valuable.</p><p>2) Subsection “Social interaction induces highly distinct gene expression patterns in the amygdala of germ-free mice”, first paragraph: results should be presented immediately, perhaps with an introductory sentence – the preceding detailed paragraph with references is too excessive – – this should be moved to Materials and methods or Introduction –.…but ideally, as mentioned above, these comparisons should be hidden in the shadows so the reader can focus on the main findings between CON-SI, GF-SI &amp; exGF-SI!</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Stilling et al. hypothesized that social behavior can be modulated by host-associated microbiota. To test this hypothesis, the authors compared control mice, germ-free mice and GF mice colonized post weaning by RNA-seq analysis of amygdala upon exposure to social interaction. The authors found significant gene expression changes between groups. In particular, GF mice with SI exposure showed increased expression of splicing factors, as well as differential splicing of a large number of exons. While the hypothesis is potentially interesting, this reviewer is concerned whether the analysis has properly controlled and reproducible to make the claims. Overall, the work is also quite descriptive in general.</p><p>1) The authors judge the difference of two conditions by the number of differentially expressed genes. This is problematic because the number of differentially expressed genes is largely affected by the number of replicates and sequence depth, which is directly related to the statistical power. Without controlling these confounding factors, the number of differentially expressed genes is not that informative.</p><p>2) Related to point #1 above, the authors did not filter differentially expressed genes based on fold change (i.e., effect size), except in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A (the cut off FDR&lt;0.1 is also not very stringent). By comparing Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, it seems that the vast majority of genes have quite moderate changes (|log2(fold change|&lt;0.1). Given the large variation between replicates (e.g., for the GF-SI group as mentioned by the authors), the robustness of the results is questionable.</p><p>3) In particular, since changes in splicing factor expression is a central point of the paper, this reviewer is surprised that no specific splicing factors were discussed in any detail or even mentioned. At least some of these should be validated using independent samples by qRT-PCR and western blots.</p><p>4) The authors reported a large number of changes in exon usage. This reviewer noticed that DEXSeq was used for this analysis and I assume the software does not explicitly consider whether alternative splicing really occurs using exon junction reads. How many of the reported exons are really alternative exons (e.g., based on existing annotations)? Again, RT-PCR validation using independent samples will be necessary to support the claim.</p><p>5) Does the changes of any splicing factors explain the changes in exon usage? If yes, that will be helpful to argue for bona fide, causative changes.</p><p>6) The authors did not provide sufficient details on quality controls about the RNA-seq data, e.g., RIN number of the RNA samples, sequencing depth, mapping rate, the number of exonic reads, 3' bias, etc. These metrics are important to judge the quality of the data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33070.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Essential revisions:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Molecular validation of key differentially expressed genes identified by transcriptomic analysis.

In addition as stated in the manuscript already, we find several non-coding RNAs involved in these processes such as the constituents of Caja bodies or paraspeckles, which are sites of active RNA processing.

However, some of the other essential revisions required extending some parts of the Discussion (see above).</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Stilling et al. employed transcriptomics to determine the influence of the gut microbiome on social-interaction-induced changes in gene expression in the amygdala. By comparing naïve vs. socially stimulated mice, both control and germ-free (GF) mice, the authors found that social interaction triggers a differential change in gene expression in GF mice compared to control mice. Changes in the transcriptional landscape and GF social deficits were partially reversed by colonization at weaning. The authors identified significant overlap in a core population of genes that were differentially expressed in both naïve GF animals and socially stimulated controls. Among these, genes encoding elements of the MAPK pathway, which regulates neural plasticity, were upregulated in naïve GF animals, but only after social stimulation in conventionally colonized controls. Moreover, social stimulation markedly upregulated genes involved in RNA processing and splicing in GF animals, which was not observed in either control or GF animals colonised at weaning. Finally, the authors determined that the extent of alternative splicing observed in the amygdala of an individual correlated with the severity of the behavioral deficit observed in the animal.</p><p>I find the paper by Stilling et al. to be an interesting piece of work. However, as it stands, the paper suffers from several deficiencies. First, the work is primarily descriptive and there is no molecular validation of the bioinformatic results.</p></disp-quote><p>While our study design does provide an intervention that contributes to causal inference (gene expression changes in the amygdala caused by social interaction), we agree that our work is primarily descriptive. We have now provided additional molecular validation of the bioinformatic results (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). In addition we want to point out the fact that we do find exactly the expected regulations in the control group (CON-SI), which is internal validation of the behavioural stimulation protocol, the methods and the sequencing pipeline. Also we do find very similar results for the naïve comparisons as in our previous, independent report (Stilling et al., 2015, BBI). We therefore agree with this reviewer that this issue is less problematic (see next point below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, and perhaps more problematic, the GF mice do not show impairment in social behavior. Briefly, GF mice spent more time interacting with a mouse vs. an inanimate object, which is inconsistent with previous findings from the same group.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now commented on the differences between this study and Desbonnet et al., 2014 and extended the Discussion also on differences to other similar findings.</p><p>In short, our results are not in disagreement with our labs previous report (Desbonnet et al., 2014).

Also see response to essential revisions above. We now include a discussion to clarify to what extend our data matches previous reports.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, it is not clear why the study focuses exclusively on the amygdala. A more thorough study comparing gene expression pattern from brain regions involved in social behaviors will strengthen this study. My specific comments are below:</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to the justification already mentioned in the paper, we have now rephrased the respective section in the Introduction and added specific references to justify our choice. We certainly do not imply that this is the only relevant region in this context, as we have previously studied also, e.g., the prefrontal cortex and have made similar observations with regard to a potential neuronal hyperactivity (Hoban et al. 2016, Transl. Psych.).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The data presented in Figures 1B and C are inconsistent with a previous study from this group (Desbonnet et al., 2014) in which GF animals preferred interaction with an empty cup over interaction with a mouse in the 3-chamber task. This inconsistency should be addressed and the data in panels B and C should be combined into a single panel with accompanying statistical data from both intra- and inter-group two-way ANOVAs.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to general comment above. Figure 1B-C has been revised to reflect this recommendation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should validate the top 10-25 transcripts reported in Figure 2 by qPCR or Western blotting and provide these data in the figure. In the same line, MAPK pathway activity is readily accessible for analysis by Western blotting. Can the authors provide molecular validation of the MAPK pathway data-baseline upregulation in GF animals and post-interaction upregulation in controls?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added validation results for key differentially expressed genes by qPCR, also several genes involved in MAP-K signalling. These data confirm that we observe increased baseline activity of several markers of neuronal activity. We also have to stress the point that we do see increased expression of MAP-K-related genes in the GF group albeit enrichment of these genes in response to stimulation is far less prominent as compared to the control group.</p><p>In addition, we have now added a few words to discuss the fact that we do find exactly the expected regulations in the control group, which serves as a positive control and is internal validation of the behavioural stimulation protocol and the sequencing/bioinformatic analysis pipeline, i.e. the methodology of this paper. Also we want to highlight the fact we here find very similar results for the naïve comparisons as in our previous, independent report (Stilling et al., 2015).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It's unlikely that the alternative splicing events in GF animals are restricted to the amygdala. Other structures including those in the mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system, specifically the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area, are emerging as regions critically involved in regulating social behavior. Did the authors perform similar transcriptomic analysis on tissue isolated from other brain regions following the interaction? This data would bolster the authors' claim that colonization-state dependent alterations in RNA splicing and processing exerts meaningful influence over social behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer that more data from other brain regions would further advance the field. In fact, we do provide gene expression data in GF mice also in the prefrontal cortex in another published study (Hoban et al. 2016, Transl. Psych). Unfortunately, in this study we had to focus on a particular brain region that is a critical node in microbiome to brain signalling (see Cowan et al. Bioessays 2018 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bies.201700172/abstract) and thus we feel that repeating this study in multiple other brain regions is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The lengthy Discussion presents an interesting theory unifying neuroimmune interaction data with findings from the microbiome and behavior field; however, this is completely outside of the scope of the conclusions that can be drawn from the provided data and, in my view, the implications of this study should be toned down.</p></disp-quote><p>While we do feel that this work needs to be put into a greater context, and provides a coherent mechanistic understanding of the processes described that has – to our knowledge – not been presented before, we have now focussed the Discussion, restricted to the direct implications of the presented data.

Only a rough description of the sequencing conditions has remained as we believe this is important information for readers.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Stilling et al. hypothesized that social behavior can be modulated by host-associated microbiota. To test this hypothesis, the authors compared control mice, germ-free mice and GF mice colonized post weaning by RNA-seq analysis of amygdala upon exposure to social interaction. The authors found significant gene expression changes between groups. In particular, GF mice with SI exposure showed increased expression of splicing factors, as well as differential splicing of a large number of exons. While the hypothesis is potentially interesting, this reviewer is concerned whether the analysis has properly controlled and reproducible to make the claims. Overall, the work is also quite descriptive in general.</p><p>1) The authors judge the difference of two conditions by the number of differentially expressed genes. This is problematic because the number of differentially expressed genes is largely affected by the number of replicates and sequence depth, which is directly related to the statistical power. Without controlling these confounding factors, the number of differentially expressed genes is not that informative.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now provided gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA), which is not affected by potentially biased cut-offs for p-value and fold-change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to point #1 above, the authors did not filter differentially expressed genes based on fold change (i.e., effect size), except in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A (the cut off FDR&lt;0.1 is also not very stringent). By comparing Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, it seems that the vast majority of genes have quite moderate changes (|log2(fold change|&lt;0.1). Given the large variation between replicates (e.g., for the GF-SI group as mentioned by the authors), the robustness of the results is questionable.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now provided gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA), which is not affected by potentially biased cut-offs for p-value and fold-change.

At least some of these should be validated using independent samples by qRT-PCR and western blots.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to essential revision #5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors reported a large number of changes in exon usage. This reviewer noticed that DEXSeq was used for this analysis and I assume the software does not explicitly consider whether alternative splicing really occurs using exon junction reads. How many of the reported exons are really alternative exons (e.g., based on existing annotations)? Again, RT-PCR validation using independent samples will be necessary to support the claim.</p></disp-quote><p>We have extensive experience with using the described pipeline and are confident that our methods adhere to the highest standards. In fact, the number of differentially spliced genes was exceptionally high in the GF-SI and exGF-SI comparisons based on many previous datasets generated and analysed by the authors of this paper.</p><p>Regarding using exon junction reads, the DEXSeq publication states:</p><p>“Junction reads are reads whose genomic alignment contains a gap because they start in one exon, end in another exon, and “jump” over the intron in between and possibly over skipped exons. In DEXSeq, such reads are counted for each counting bin with which they overlap, i.e., they appear multiple times in the count table. However, because we test for each exon separately, this does not affect the validity of the test. […] Furthermore, junction reads give evidence for connections between counting bins and thus are crucial for isoform deconvolution tools such as Cufflinks and MMSeq. For our exon-by-exon test, however, leveraging this information is not essential, and also not straightforward. In the method presented, we essentially consider for each sample the ratio of the number of reads overlapping with an exon to the number of reads falling onto the whole gene.”</p><p>In addition for most genes the dominant isoform is not determined and may be different in different cell types or tissues. Therefore the definition of what is an “alternative exon” is not straight forward and we feel that it can thus not feasibly be included in this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Does the changes of any splicing factors explain the changes in exon usage?
