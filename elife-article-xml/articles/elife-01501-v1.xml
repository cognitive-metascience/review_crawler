in the bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> that operates without the involvement of a dedicated RNA or protein. Certain serine codons, the four TCN codons, in the gene for the biofilm repressor SinR caused a lowering of SinR levels under biofilm-inducing conditions. Synonymous substitutions of these TCN codons with AGC or AGT impaired biofilm formation and gene expression. Conversely, switching AGC or AGT to TCN codons upregulated biofilm formation. Genome-wide ribosome profiling showed that ribosome density was higher at UCN codons than at AGC or AGU during biofilm formation. Serine starvation recapitulated the effect of biofilm-inducing conditions on ribosome occupancy and SinR production. As serine is one of the first amino acids to be exhausted at the end of exponential phase growth, reduced translation speed at serine codons may be exploited by other microbes in adapting to stationary phase.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01501.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01501.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01501.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Bacteria use several different mechanisms to recognize and respond to changes in their environment. Protein sensors, for example, relay signals from the cell surface to target molecules within the cell. Additionally, RNA sensors can respond to internal levels of chemicals by regulating the expression of genes. Now, Subramaniam et al. have discovered a sensing mechanism in bacteria that does not rely on either protein sensors or RNA sensors.</p><p>Bacteria normally live as free swimming cells in water. But sometimes, in response to certain environmental conditions, they form a multicellular community called a biofilm. In this biofilm, bacteria encase themselves with layers of carbohydrates and proteins, which then protect the bacteria from adverse chemicals such as antibiotics.</p><p>A protein known as SinR plays a key role during biofilm formation in the model bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. SinR normally prevents the formation of the carbohydrates and proteins that make up the biofilm. Upon the decision to form a biofilm, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> counters the effect of SinR by producing an anti-SinR protein called SinI.</p><p>Now Subramaniam et al. have found that as well as producing the SinI protein, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> use an additional mechanism to promote biofilm formation. This mechanism relies on codons, the elements within genes that correspond to specific amino acids. Six different codons correspond to the amino acid serine, and the gene for the SinR protein contains above average numbers of four of them. These four codons are highly sensitive to serine levels, and they decrease the levels of the SinR protein when there is less serine in the environment, as happens to be the case in biofilms. And since SinR prevents the production of the carbohydrates and proteins that make up the biofilms, a decrease in the levels of SinR leads to an increase in the production of biofilms.</p><p>Since the serine codons at the heart of the sensing mechanism discovered by Subramaniam et al. are present in all forms of life, from viruses to humans, it is possible that similar sensing mechanisms might be found in contexts other than bacterial biofilms, such as in viral infection and cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01501.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01501.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>codon usage</kwd><kwd>ribosome pausing</kwd><kwd>starvation</kwd><kwd>biofilm</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM18568</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Losick</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O’Shea</surname><given-names>Erin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Northeastern University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chai</surname><given-names>Yunrong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1K99 GM107113</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Subramaniam</surname><given-names>Arvind R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biofilm formation by Bacillus subtilis relies on a sensing mechanism for the amino acid serine that does not depend on a dedicated protein or RNA.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacteria constantly monitor their environment and internal physiological state so that they can adapt to changing conditions. A wide variety of sensing mechanisms are deployed for this purpose, including dedicated protein sensors, such as histidine kinases, which mediate changes in gene expression by controlling the phosphorylation of cognate response regulators in response to environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">West and Stock, 2001</xref>). Bacteria also sense changes in their environment and physiology by means of dedicated RNAs, such as the highly structured, leader RNA for the tryptophan operon, which controls the transcription of downstream genes in the operon by a mechanism involving ribosome stalling at tryptophan codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Henkin and Yanofsky, 2002</xref>). Here we report the discovery of an unusually simple mechanism of environmental sensing involved in the process of biofilm formation by the bacterium <italic>B. subtilis</italic> that does not require a dedicated RNA or protein.</p><p>Biofilm formation involves a switch from planktonic growth as individual cells to the formation of complex, multicellular communities in response to environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kolter and Greenberg, 2006</xref>). In <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, these communities are embedded in a self-produced matrix consisting of polysaccharide and an amyloid-like protein, which are specified by the <italic>epsA-O</italic> and the <italic>tapA-sipW-tasA</italic> operons, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Branda et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kearns et al., 2005</xref>). The transition to multicellularity is governed in part by four histidine kinases (KinA, KinB, KinC and KinD) that control the phosphorylation of the response regulator, Spo0A, a master regulator of post-exponential phase gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vlamakis et al., 2013</xref>). Recent studies suggest that KinA and KinB respond to impaired respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kolodkin-Gal et al., 2013</xref>), whereas KinC responds to membrane perturbations and KinD to unknown chemical signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">López et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shemesh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beauregard et al., 2013</xref>). Once phosphorylated, Spo0A turns on <italic>sinI</italic>, a gene encoding a small protein antagonist of the biofilm-specific regulatory protein SinR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Molle et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kearns et al., 2005</xref>). SinR, which is produced constitutively, is a repressor of the matrix operons, <italic>epsA-O</italic> and the <italic>tapA-sipW-tasA</italic>, as well as other biofilm-related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kearns et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chai et al., 2009</xref>). SinR is also a repressor of the gene for SlrR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chu et al., 2008</xref>), which together with SinR sets up a self-reinforcing, double-negative feedback loop for matrix gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Norman et al., 2013</xref>). A special feature of SinR of relevance to this investigation is that the expression of matrix genes is hypersensitive to small perturbations in the level of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chai et al., 2011</xref>). This hypersensitivity is attributed to molecular titration of SinR by SinI and cooperativity among SinR molecules bound to tandem target sequences at regulatory sites for the matrix operons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chai et al., 2008</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01501.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Switching synonymous serine codons in <italic>sinR</italic> affects biofilm formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Regulatory circuit controlling biofilm formation in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>.

Rather than relying on regulation by a dedicated RNA or protein, the translation speed of ribosomes decreases at certain serine codons, resulting in lower SinR levels, which as a consequence, contributes to derepression of SinR-controlled genes. We propose that specific serine codons in the <italic>sinR</italic> mRNA act as a simple sensor for monitoring, and triggering a response to, serine depletion under biofilm-inducing conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Switching synonymous serine codons in <italic>sinR</italic> affects biofilm formation</title><p>In a genetic screen to identify suppressor mutations that rescued the biofilm-defective phenotype of a <italic>B. subtilis</italic> mutant (‘Materials and methods’), we unexpectedly recovered a variant that contained a ‘silent’ mutation that resulted in a switch from one serine codon to a synonymous codon in <italic>sinR</italic>. This observation prompted us to ask whether switching other serine codons might also influence biofilm formation. Serine is specified by six codons: AGC, AGT, TCA, TCC, TCG and TCT (where T is U in the mRNA). We noticed that the <italic>sinR</italic> coding sequence has a slightly higher frequency of the four TCN serine codons as compared to the average frequency of TCN codons in the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, p=0.22, N = 12). To test whether this bias towards TCN codons has an effect on biofilm formation, we systematically replaced the three TCA codons in <italic>sinR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) with each of the other five serine codons. Replacing the TCA codons with AGT or AGC resulted in flat, featureless colonies on solid biofilm-inducing medium, indicating severely impaired biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, replacing the TCA codons with either TCC or TCT had little or no effect on colony morphology whereas switching to TCG increased the wrinkled appearance of the colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), which is indicative of robust biofilm formation.</p><p>Next, we asked whether switching serine codons was altering the level of SinR protein in liquid biofilm-inducing medium. Immunoblot analysis with anti-SinR antibodies revealed slightly yet consistently higher SinR levels in the strain with the AGT variant of <italic>sinR</italic> when compared to either the wild-type strain with three TCA codons or the TCG variant of <italic>sinR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>).</p><p>SinR is highly similar (85% identity) to SlrR, which also plays a critical role in biofilm formation and whose gene (<italic>slrR</italic>) is under the direct negative control of SinR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chu et al., 2008</xref>). Because SlrR cross reacts with the anti-SinR antibodies, we were also able to detect SlrR in our immunoblot analysis. Strikingly, the levels of SlrR were almost perfectly anti-correlated with those of SinR, with the differences in the SlrR protein levels among the <italic>sinR</italic> synonymous variants being much higher than the corresponding differences in SinR protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Because repression by SinR is ultrasensitive to SinR levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chai et al., 2011</xref>), small differences in SinR protein levels among <italic>sinR</italic> synonymous variants might be sufficient to cause large differences in the levels of expression of SinR-repressed genes such as <italic>slrR</italic>. Consistent with this idea, an <italic>eps-lacZ</italic> transcriptional fusion reporter for the SinR-repressed <italic>epsA-O</italic> matrix operon showed that the four TCN <italic>sinR</italic> variants had 3- to 19-fold higher <italic>β</italic>-galactosidase activity than the AGT and AGC variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>To test the generality of the observed hierarchy between the synonymous variants of <italic>sinR</italic>, we generated an additional set of eleven <italic>sinR</italic> synonymous variants in which we replaced either three TCC codons or two AGC/AGT codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) with their synonymous counterparts. Eight of these variants conformed to the hierarchy described above, namely, the four TCN variants behaved oppositely to the two AGC/AGT variants in colony morphology and in <italic>eps-lacZ</italic> reporter expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The three variants that did not conform to the hierarchy could potentially reflect alterations to the mRNA sequence context near the mutation rather than the effect of a synonymous substitution per se. Taken together, the above results suggest that serine synonymous codons in the <italic>sinR</italic> coding sequence have a stereotypical effect on biofilm formation that is primarily determined by the differential usage of the four TCN and the two AGC/AGT codons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Entry into biofilm formation is accompanied by codon-specific increase in ribosome density</title><p>What is the mechanism by which serine codon usage affects SinR protein levels and biofilm formation? Synonymous codon changes can alter the synthesis of the encoded protein through changes in the translation initiation rate, mRNA levels or the ribosome elongation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Plotkin and Kudla, 2010</xref>). However, the effect of synonymous codon usage on the initiation rate and mRNA levels is context-specific; only codons near the AUG start site affect translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kudla et al., 2009</xref>), whereas only codons that are located in certain regions of secondary structure or at ribonuclease cleavage sites affect mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernstein et al., 2002</xref>). Our observation that synonymous codon replacements at multiple locations along <italic>sinR</italic> have a stereotypical effect on biofilm formation argues against such context-specific mechanisms (except for the three exceptional cases noted above).</p><p>To test the alternative hypothesis that serine codon usage might alter the ribosome elongation rate, and given that the ribosome elongation rate at a codon varies inversely with the average ribosome density at that codon, we measured ribosome density on mRNAs at single-codon resolution using the ribosome profiling method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ingolia et al., 2012</xref>). We grew <italic>B. subtilis</italic> in liquid biofilm-inducing medium, harvested cells either during exponential phase growth (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0<italic>.</italic>6) or during stationary phase when biofilm formation is induced (OD<sub>600</sub> = 1<italic>.</italic>4), and performed deep-sequencing of ribosome protected mRNA fragments and size-matched total mRNA fragments. Ribosome profiling yielded 3.75 and 2.55 million sequencing reads aligning to annotated protein-coding sequences for the exponential phase sample and the biofilm entry sample, respectively. The number of reads aligning to a single codon on individual mRNAs was too low for accurate quantification of ribosome density, and was not sufficient to directly detect increased ribosome density on the <italic>sinR</italic> transcript. However, we reasoned that the global pattern of ribosome density at codons across all mRNAs should reflect the ribosome density on individual transcripts such as <italic>sinR</italic>. Therefore, we calculated the median ribosome density at each of the 61 sense codons across the 1556 protein-coding sequences in the exponential phase sample and the 1148 sequences in the biofilm entry sample that had an average coverage greater than one sequencing read per codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, ‘Materials and methods’). This analysis reproduced the previous observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2012</xref>) of increased ribosome density 8 to 11 nt downstream of Shine-Dalgarno-like trinucleotide sequences both during exponential phase and during biofilm entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>During exponential phase, median ribosome density varied over a twofold range, with no systematic difference between serine codons and the remaining codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). By contrast, during biofilm entry, median ribosome density was significantly higher at serine and cysteine codons as compared to the remaining codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that the translation speed of ribosomes is selectively reduced at these codons during biofilm entry. Notably, the ribosome density at serine codons was not uniform: the four UCN codons had 1.9 to 2.1-fold higher ribosome density whereas the AGC and AGU codons had only 1.1 and 1.3-fold higher ribosome density respectively, relative to the median value across 61 sense codons. Further, this difference in ribosome density between UCN codons and the AGC/AGU codons was essentially identical when computed separately for codons located in the first half or in the second half of each gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), a finding that underscores the statistical robustness and the context independence of the observed difference.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01501.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Entry into biofilm formation is accompanied by codon-specific increase in ribosome density.</title><p>Genome-wide median ribosome density and total mRNA density at 61 sense codons (excluding start and stop codons) (<bold>A</bold>) during exponential phase growth (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.6), and (<bold>B</bold>) during stationary phase when biofilm formation is induced (OD<sub>600</sub> = 1.4).

Our hypothesis is also supported by the previous observation that synonymous codon usage can have a starvation-specific effect on protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Subramaniam et al., 2013</xref>). Further, serine is a precursor metabolite for the biosynthesis of cysteine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gagnon et al., 1994</xref>); hence cysteine depletion was likely the result of a decrease in intracellular serine concentration. Consistent with this hypothesis, we also observed an increase in ribosome density at both serine and cysteine codons during serine starvation of a <italic>B. subtilis</italic> serine-auxotrophic mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Importantly, serine starvation resulted in an increase in ribosome density at only the four UCN serine codons but not at the AGC and AGU codons, matching the hierarchy seen during biofilm entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Serine starvation also resulted in differential levels of production of SinR-YFP protein fusions bearing different synonymous serine codons, whereas serine-rich growth resulted in identical levels of fusion protein production from these variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Finally, the addition of excess serine or cysteine (but not any of the other 18 amino acids) blocked biofilm formation in wild type cells as judged after 48 hr of growth in biofilm-inducing medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, and data not shown).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01501.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Serine starvation reduces translation speed and inhibits SinR synthesis in a codon-specific manner.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Three <italic>sinR</italic> synonymous variants were synthesized with 10 serine codons switched to AGC, TCA or TCG.

results with the serine auxotroph support the inference that ribosome stalling observed during biofilm formation is due to a drop in intracellular serine levels. Our efforts to measure intracellular serine levels directly during growth in minimal, biofilm-inducing medium (MSgg) have been unsuccessful. Hence, we cannot rule out the less likely possibilities that biofilm entry causes serine and cysteine to be sequestered away from protein synthesis or that aminoacylation rate of the corresponding tRNAs decreases without changes in the intracellular serine and cysteine pools.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Serine codon bias in biofilm-regulated genes reflects their expression during serine starvation</title><p>Here we found that the translation speed of ribosomes decreases at UCN serine codons and thereby modulates production of SinR and entry into biofilm formation. Based on our genome-wide measurements of ribosome density, we expect that the translation speed of ribosomes should decrease during biofilm entry not only on the <italic>sinR</italic> mRNA, but also on other mRNAs that are enriched for any of the four UCN codons. For example, we found that the four TCN codons are over-represented in two nucleotide biosynthesis genes, <italic>pyrAA</italic> and <italic>purB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These two genes are also transcriptionally down regulated during biofilm entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). A high frequency of TCN codons in these genes might serve to reinforce their transcriptional down regulation by reducing translation speed. Conversely, TCN codons are under-represented in the genes encoding lactate dehydrogenase, <italic>ldh</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Cruz Ramos et al., 2000</xref>) and a master regulator of post-exponential phase gene expression, <italic>spo0A</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Molle et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The two genes are transcriptionally up regulated upon biofilm entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The low frequency of TCN codons in these genes might represent a mechanism for optimizing the production of their protein products by minimizing the slowing down of translation during biofilm entry. Consistent with this idea, replacement of AGC/AGT codons by TCN codons in <italic>spo0A</italic>, whose protein product positively regulates biofilm entry (by turning on the synthesis of the SinR antagonist SinI), resulted in defective biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) in contrast to the stimulatory effect of replacing AGC/AGT codons with TCN codons in <italic>sinR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01501.013</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Serine codon bias of biofilm-regulated genes reflects their expression under serine starvation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Relative serine codon fraction in genes for nucleotide biosynthesis (<italic>pyrAA</italic>, <italic>purB</italic>), lactate dehydrogenase (<italic>ldh</italic>) and a sporulation regulator (<italic>spo0A</italic>).

Serine depletion is sensed through a remarkably simple mechanism based on reduced translation speed at UCN serine codons in the mRNA for a regulatory protein, SinR, whose repressive effects are highly sensitive to small changes in the level of the protein. We presume that UCN codons lower SinR levels simply by slowing the rate of ribosome movement along the mRNA (elongation). However, it is possible that the reduced translation speed at UCN codons during biofilm entry could be followed by downstream events such as ribosome rescue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Keiler et al., 1996</xref>) or mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hayes and Sauer, 2003</xref>) that might also contribute to lowering the levels of the SinR protein.</p><p>The serine sensing mechanism uncovered here operates through over-representation of the TCN serine codons in the <italic>sinR</italic> gene without the necessity for any other dedicated protein or RNA for sensing serine depletion. By contrast, transcriptional attenuation, a widespread mechanism among bacteria for sensing amino acids that also relies on changes in translation speed, involves a translation-transcription coupling mechanism that is mediated by highly structured mRNAs and leader peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Henkin and Yanofsky, 2002</xref>).</p><p>We note that the biased usage of the four TCN serine codons, which act as starvation sensors during biofilm formation, is not evident from widely-used phenomenological measures of codon bias such as the codon adaptation index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), which primarily reflects codon preferences during exponential growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sharp and Li, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson and Kurland, 1990</xref>). The difference in translation speed between the four UCN codons and the two AGC/AGU codons under biofilm-inducing conditions is likely mediated by differences in concentration of the corresponding aminoacylated tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elf et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dittmar et al., 2005</xref>), as was recently observed in serine-starved <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Subramaniam et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, the hierarchy between UCN codons and AGC/AGU codons in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> during serine starvation is similar to the one in <italic>E. coli</italic> even though copy numbers of the corresponding tRNA genes have diverged significantly between these two organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lowe and Eddy, 1997</xref>). Despite different tRNA gene copy numbers, it is possible that the relative abundances of the serine tRNA isoacceptors are similar between the two organisms or that their relative abundances might be regulated in the same manner in response to nutrient deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doi et al., 1966</xref>).</p><p>Serine is one of the first amino acids to be completely consumed from the culture medium when either <italic>B. subtilis</italic> or <italic>E. coli</italic> cells are grown in complex rich medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liebs et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Prüss et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sezanov et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, increased ribosome density has been observed at serine codons during growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> in Luria-Bertani broth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Thus the role of synonymous serine codons as starvation sensors discovered here in the specific context of biofilm formation might be a general regulatory strategy in microbes for adapting to nutrient depletion at the end of exponential phase growth. It is noteworthy that depletion of specific amino acids affects developmental transitions in several eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marin, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sundrud et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2009</xref>).

Three aliquots of 150 µl from each culture was pipetted into three wells of three 96-well plates (3799, Costar, Corning, NY). Wallac Victor2 plate reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) was used to monitor cell density (absorbance at 600 nm) and YFP expression (fluorescence, excitation 504 nm and emission 540 nm). Each plate was read every 15 min using a robotic system (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA) and shaken at 1000 rpm in between readings (Variomag Teleshake shaker, Daytona Beach, FL). 30°C and 60% relative humidity was maintained throughout the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Ribosome profiling and mRNA quantification</title><p>Ribosome profiling protocol was adapted from published literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ingolia et al., 2012</xref>) with minor modifications as described below. Briefly, 200 ml of bacterial culture was harvested by filtration. The filter was immediately inserted into a 50 ml conical tube, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C until further processing. Frozen cells were re-suspended in 8 ml of polysome resuspension buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, and 100 µg ml<sup>−1</sup> Chloramphenicol). Re-suspended cells were pelleted by centrifugation (3000 g, 4°C, 5 min) and the supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was re-suspended in 500 µl of polysome lysis buffer (1X polysome resuspension buffer, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.4% TritonX-100, 0.1% NP-40, and 100 U/ml RNase-free DNase [04716728001; Roche]), and transferred to an ice-cold 1.5 ml tube containing 500 µl of 0.2–0.3 µm acid-washed glass beads (G1277; Sigma). Cells were lysed by vortexing at maximum speed on a vortexer in a 4°C room (Vortex Genie 2, 10 × 30 s with 1 min cooling on ice in between). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation (20,000 g, 4°C, 10 min) and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh 1.5 ml tube. 500 µg of total RNA (A<sub>260</sub> units) was digested (25°C, 1400 rpm, 60 min, 150 µl vol) with 2 U/µg of Micrococcal nuclease (LS004797; Worthington, Lakewood, NJ). The digestion was quenched with 1.5 µl of 0.5 M EGTA, loaded on top of a 10–50% sucrose gradient and ultra-centrifuged in a SW41 rotor (35000 rpm, 4°C, 150 min). Monosomes collected by gradient fractionation (Biocomp Instruments, Canada).</p><p>For total RNA extraction, 100 µl of polysome lysate was mixed with 400 µl of RNA extraction buffer (0.3 M sodium acetate, 10 mM EDTA, pH 4.5) and the aqueous phase was extracted twice with phenol-chloroform and once with chloroform. RNA was precipitated with an equal volume of isopropanol. The pellet was washed with 70% ice-cold ethanol and re-suspended in 100 µl of 10 mM Tris pH 7.0. 10 µg of total RNA was DNase-treated and mRNA enriched using the Microbe Express kit (Invitrogen). mRNA was fragmented by heating at 95°C with a bicarbonate buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>) for 20 min.</p><p>Collected monosome fractions were purified using the same phenol-chloroform method as used for total RNA extraction above. Monosomes and fragmented mRNA were then used for small RNA sequencing library preparation. Size selection, dephosphorylation, polyadenylation, reverse-transcription, circularization and PCR amplification were performed using the same protocol as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>). An rRNA subtraction step was carried out between the circularization and PCR amplification steps using the same protocol as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oh et al., 2011</xref>). Typically, several samples were multiplexed for sequencing in an Illumina HiSeq sequencer such that at least 1 million reads were obtained for each sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Deep-sequencing data analysis</title><p>Deep-sequencing data analysis was carried out in Bash and Python programming languages, and performed on the Harvard research computing Odyssey cluster.

The median value of this log2 fold-change across all genes that received a minimum of 100 reads in at least one of the two samples was then subtracted from the fold-change value for each gene. This median-subtracted log2 fold change in reported throughout this work. We note that the average ribosome density on any gene is directly proportional to the corresponding mRNA level in the absence of specific translational regulation. Hence fold-changes in ribosome density (such as the one shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) primarily reflect fold-changes in mRNA level.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To calculate the ribosome and mRNA density at individual codons,</p><list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>The start codon was treated as a single separate codon irrespective of its identity.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Only genes with average ribosome density of at least 1 read per codon were considered.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The ribosome density at the first nucleotide of each codon was assigned as the ribosome density at that codon. For each of the 64 codons and the start codon, read density at the first nucleotide of the codon was averaged across all occurrences of that codon in a single gene and then normalized by the average ribosome density for that gene. Hence a codon without over- or under- representation of ribosome or mRNA density will have a density value equal to 1.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Genome-wide ribosome and mRNA density was calculated as the median of the individual gene read density from Step (3) across all genes that pass the threshold of Step (2).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ribosome profiling measurement resulted in a high ribosome density at start and stop codons.

Hence these codons were excluded from the ribosome density plots shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figure 2A,B and 3C</xref>. However, the increased ribosome density at these codons resulted in a concomitant decrease in ribosome density at the remaining codons due to normalization by the average ribosome density for each gene (which included the start and stop codons).</p></list-item></list></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Codon usage analysis</title><p>Codon Adpatiaton Index (CAI) was calculated according to the original prescription of Sharp and Li (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sharp and Li, 1987</xref>). For this calculation, 68 genes that had an annotation as ‘ribosomal’ were used as the reference set of highly expressed genes. The annotations file used for this analysis was downloaded from NCBI (NC_000964.ptt). The p value for the higher frequency of TCN codons in <italic>sinR</italic> was calculated by assuming a binomial distribution of TCN and AGC/AGT codons. The p value represents the binomial probability that there are 10 or more TCN codons in the <italic>sinR</italic> gene (12 serine codons total) given the genome-wide frequency of serine codons (0.66 for TCN codons and 0.34 for AGC/AGT codons).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank P Cluzel, AL Sonenshein, T Norman, and J Weissman for valuable comments during manuscript preparation, T Gao for performing some experiments, and B Burton for use of sucrose-gradient fractionator.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by two reviewers and one member of the Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All agree that the study presents an exciting novel mechanism for the regulation of the transition to biofilm formation by <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. In this mechanism, the cells sense the decrease in serine and cysteine abundance through changes in the speed of translation of genes that contain certain serine codons. It is noteworthy that these codons are not correlated with the usual codon usage, indicating a possible change in the tRNA levels or in the abundance of codons using them. The manuscript raises intriguing questions about the use of similar mechanisms by other organisms for developmental transitions or when cells are confronted with reductions in the availability of specific amino acids. However, the study would be strengthened if the authors addressed the following comments:</p><p>1) The conclusion that slow ribosome elongation at UCN codons reduces production of SinR protein to elicit biofilm formation is strongly implicated but not demonstrated. The authors should show ribosome profiles of genes with both types of codons, before and after Ser starvation or biofilm formation. The reviewers appreciate that expression of some genes might be low, but pausing in specific transcripts can be detected, and pausing at low abundance transcripts such as <italic>sinR</italic> should be detected by increasing sequencing coverage.</p><p>2) The data are largely compelling regarding the effect of different serine codons on SinR level. However the authors should discuss why certain codon substitutions behave in a non-stereotypical manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). While the hypothesis that ribosome pausing at these codons decreases translation elongation rate and thus SinR protein levels is the more intriguing possibility, an alternative hypothesis that pausing decreases <italic>sinR</italic> transcription via an attenuation-like mechanism has not been ruled out. The main analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> involves replacing TCA codons with synonymous mutations. These three codons are toward the 5' end of the transcript where translation may affect transcription. The TCC codons are closer to the 3' end, and replacing them with AGC yields a result opposite to the one expected. Does surrounding mRNA sequence or structure have an impact?</p><p>3) The authors note that changes in expression of genes do not correlate with the codon usage of the specific Ser codons in ribosomal proteins. To understand how this is possible, the authors should determine if the codon usage in the total mRNA sample (based on the abundance of each codon in the total mRNA) changes during biofilm formation or during Ser starvation.</p><p>4) A major conclusion is that the UCN codons act as a sensor for serine starvation that is essential for biofilm formation. How is intracellular serine concentration regulated during biofilm formation? Do cells down-regulate serine biosynthesis during the transition to stationary phase? Do the authors see any transcriptional down-regulation of serine biosynthesis genes? This should be clarified. In addition, the authors mention that serine is among the first amino acids exhausted from the laboratory medium during exponential growth in complex medium. How does that apply to bacteria in non-laboratory conditions, where the presumed mechanism evolved?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01501.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The conclusion that slow ribosome elongation at UCN codons reduces production of SinR protein to elicit biofilm formation is strongly implicated but not demonstrated.

To avoid misinterpretation by the reader, we now clearly state this limitation in our revised text. Our ribosome profiling measurement did not allow us to robustly infer ribosome pausing at UCN codons on any individual transcript. At best, the selective ribosome pausing at UCN codons was evident only after calculating the median over the 10 transcripts with the highest ribosome density, while the median over the 3 transcripts with the highest ribosome density was significantly affected by noise (see Author response image 1 below). In our ribosome profiling measurement, averaging over the top 10 transcripts resulted in an average read density of ∼1500 reads per codon. By comparison, the average read density for the <italic>sinR</italic> transcript was ∼3 reads per codon. Therefore, we estimate that a ∼500X higher coverage (implying ∼2 billion total sequencing reads) is required to robustly detect ribosome pausing on the <italic>sinR</italic> transcript, which will be a prohibitively expensive experiment. Nevertheless, we are not aware of any experimental evidence or plausible mechanism by which the ribosome pausing at UCN codons that is inferred from a genome-wide median, is likely to be invalid at the level of individual mRNAs such as the <italic>sinR</italic> transcript. The magnitude of the specific ribosome pauses identified in Ref. 26 relative to the serine-starvation induced pauses observed here is uncertain, making a direct quantitative comparison difficult.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>Sequencing read density around six serine codons, calculated as a median over the 3 genes with the highest ribosome density (left) or the 10 genes with the highest ribosome density (right).

Does surrounding mRNA sequence or structure have an impact</italic>?</p><p>If an attenuation-like mechanism underlies the observed decrease in SinR protein levels due to UCN codons, such a mechanism is expected to also decrease levels of the <italic>sinR</italic> mRNA. On the contrary, in our genome-wide mRNA measurements, we observed that <italic>sinR</italic> mRNA levels increased slightly upon biofilm formation (median-normalized fold-change: 1.33). This result is also consistent with earlier observation that expression of <italic>sinR</italic> mRNA is almost constant [Gaur et al. J Bacteriol 170, 1046 (1988)]. Further, in addition to a ribosome pause site, transcriptional attenuation typically requires a leader peptide, and an anti-terminator RNA structure, neither of which are known to be present in the <italic>sinR</italic> transcript.</p><p>Introducing synonymous substitutions can affect expression levels of the encoded protein by several mechanisms including changes in mRNA stability or secondary structure. We agree with the reviewers that the local mRNA sequence is a possible determinant of the anomalous result observed with the TCC&gt;AGC <italic>sinR</italic> variant as well as the two other <italic>sinR</italic> variants. We have now indicated this possibility in the main text. Based on our experience, such context-specific effects in a few variants are unavoidable when a large number of synonymous variants of a gene are systematically interrogated.</p><p><italic>3) The authors note that changes in expression of genes do not correlate with the codon usage of the specific Ser codons in ribosomal proteins. To understand how this is possible, the authors should determine if the codon usage in the total mRNA sample (based on the abundance of each codon in the total mRNA) changes during biofilm formation or during Ser starvation</italic>.</p><p>Usage of the six serine codons in the total mRNA pool differed less than 20% between exponential phase and biofilm entry. Further, this change was not specific to the four serine-sensitive TCN codons. More generally, protein expression level does not correlate with codon usage even under nutrient-rich conditions. We expect that protein expression during amino acid limitation is determined by the aminoacylated fraction of tRNA isoacceptors cognate to the limiting amino acid. It is worth noting that the aminoacylated fraction of tRNA isoacceptors during amino acid limitation might even be inversely correlated with codon usage. The exact value of this aminoacylated fraction has been hypothesized to depend on the balance between supply and demand for aminoacylated tRNA isoacceptors during protein synthesis.</p><p><italic>4) A major conclusion is that the UCN codons act as a sensor for serine starvation that is essential for biofilm formation. How is intracellular serine concentration regulated during biofilm formation? Do cells down-regulate serine biosynthesis during the transition to stationary phase? Do the authors see any transcriptional down-regulation of serine biosynthesis genes? This should be clarified. In addition, the authors mention that serine is among the first amino acids exhausted from the laboratory medium during exponential growth in complex medium. How does that apply to bacteria in non-laboratory conditions, where the presumed mechanism evolved</italic>?</p><p>Our RNA-Seq measurements did not reveal an obvious smoking gun for how serine levels might be regulated during biofilm formation. Specifically, we did not observe decreased transcription of serine biosynthesis genes. Serine also serves as a substrate for a wide range of cellular processes such as for purine biosynthesis, biosynthesis of several amino acids and phospholipid biosynthesis. However, none of these processes were transcriptionally up-regulated upon biofilm entry. In addition, conversion of serine to pyruvate is known to be catalyzed by the SdaA/B enzymes in <italic>E. coli</italic> upon oxygen limitation. Nevertheless, the homologous <italic>B. subtilis</italic> enzymes SdaAA/AB were not transcriptionally induced upon biofilm entry. Serine levels are likely regulated by an unidentified metabolic switch that accompanies biofilm entry. Future studies using metabolic labeling with stable isotope tracers could potentially shed light on this metabolic switch. For the sake of clarity, we have added a sentence to our main text that our inability to directly measure intracellular serine levels prevents us from ruling out unlikely possibilities, such as serine sequestration or changes in serine tRNA aminoacylation, which could theoretically occur in the absence of serine starvation.</p><p>We speculate on two plausible natural environments that could underlie the evolution of a codon-based serine-sensing mechanism in bacteria. In the case of enteric bacteria such as <italic>E. coli</italic>, alternating conditions of feast and famine could result in periodic depletion of extracellular serine, similar to that observed in laboratory complex media. In the case of free-living bacteria such as <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, intracellular serine levels could fluctuate as a result of alternating planktonic and biofilm lifestyles without changes in the extracellular serine levels.</p></body></sub-article></article>
