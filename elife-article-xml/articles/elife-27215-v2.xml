histocompatibility complex ligands is essential for the survival of naive CD4 T cells. We have previously shown that the resulting tonic TCR signaling also influences their fate upon activation by increasing their ability to differentiate into induced/peripheral regulatory T cells. To decipher the molecular mechanisms governing this process, we here focus on the TCR signaling cascade and demonstrate that a rise in intracellular calcium levels is sufficient to modulate the phenotype of mouse naive CD4 T cells and to increase their sensitivity to regulatory T-cell polarization signals, both processes relying on calcineurin activation. Accordingly, in vivo calcineurin inhibition leads the most self-reactive naive CD4 T cells to adopt the phenotype of their less self-reactive cell-counterparts. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that calcium-mediated activation of the calcineurin pathway acts as a rheostat to shape both the phenotype and effector potential of naive CD4 T cells in the steady-state.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27215.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To help protect the body from disease, small immune cells called T lymphocytes move rapidly, searching for signs of infection. These signs are antigens – processed pieces of proteins from invading microbes – that are displayed on the surface of so-called antigen-presenting cells.Before it encounters its specific antigen, a T cell is called naive. After encountering its antigen, the naive T cell activates and then develops into a variety of immune cells, each with a specific activity. These immune cells include so-called peripherally induced regulatory T cells (or “pTreg cells” for short), which, as the name suggests, help to regulate the immune response.</p><p>In addition to foreign antigens from microbes, antigen-presenting cells display fragments of the body’s own proteins too. All naive T cells recognize some “Self-antigens”, but not as strongly as they recognize foreign antigens. As a naive T cell travels around the body, it repeatedly interacts with antigen-presenting cells that display Self-antigens, which triggers a low level of signaling in the T cell. While this background signaling was known to help the T cell survive, in 2013, researchers reported that: it also makes the T cell more responsive to foreign antigens; and it shapes how these cells will respond when activated. For example, the naive T cells that respond the most to Self-antigens were seen to be much more likely to become pTreg cells when activated than other T cells.</p><p>Guichard et al. – who include several of the researchers involved in the 2013 work – set out to understand why the most Self-reactive T cells show this bias toward becoming pTreg cells. The experiments used a range of approaches with T cells both in the laboratory and in mice. By looking at which genes were active in the most Self-reactive T cells, Guichard et al. narrowed in on a signaling pathway that involves calcium ions and an enzyme called Calcineurin. Blocking this pathway caused the most Self-reactive T cells to lose their bias, and instead develop in the same way as the least Self-reactive T cells.</p><p>Guichard et al. propose that the continuous interactions with Self-antigens trigger waves of calcium ions in a naive T cell that shapes its behavior and future development. In a related study, Dong, Othy et al. also conclude that contact with antigen-presenting cells causes calcium signals that shape how the T cells behave.</p><p>In addition to providing more detail about the inner workings of immune cells, these findings may also have implications in a clinical setting. Calcineurin inhibitors are often used to suppress the immune system in transplant patients to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ. However, it has proved difficult to safely interrupt these therapies even after many years. These new findings may provide a possible explanation for this, by suggesting that the inhibitors may also interfere with the generation of pTreg cells. Without these cells’ regulatory influence, the immune system is unlikely to ever become tolerant of the transplant.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Naive CD4 T cells</kwd><kwd>induced regulatory T cells</kwd><kwd>differentiation</kwd><kwd>calcium signaling</kwd><kwd>self-reactivity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001677</institution-id><institution>Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bonilla</surname><given-names>Nelly</given-names></name><name><surname>Audemard-Verger</surname><given-names>Alexandra</given-names></name><name><surname>Guilbert</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name><name><surname>Lucas</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name><name><surname>Auffray</surname><given-names>Cédric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-15-CE15-0009-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Auffray</surname><given-names>Cédric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lucas</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004099</institution-id><institution>Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Audemard-Verger</surname><given-names>Alexandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Calcium-calcineurin signaling cascade drives the acquisition of both the phenotype of the most self-reactive naive CD4 T cells and their enhanced cell-intrinsic ability to commit into induced regulatory T cells upon activation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>T-cell precursors originate in the bone-marrow and are educated in the thymus through processes called positive and negative selections, which result in MHC-restriction and self-tolerance, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stritesky et al., 2012</xref>). Only those T cells that bear an αβT-cell receptor (TCR) recognizing self-MHC with a relatively low affinity will differentiate and exit into the systemic circulation as self-MHC restricted T cells. T cells carrying an αβ TCR that reacts with self-MHC with very low affinity die by neglect, whereas those recognizing self-MHC with high affinity are mostly deleted by apoptosis or differentiate into regulatory T cells called ‘natural’ or thymically derived (tTreg) in order to prevent autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bautista et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leung et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, self-MHC and the associated self-reactivity of T cells influence both T-cell production and phenotype in the thymus.</p><p>In the periphery, the pre-immune repertoire of T cells is composed of almost 70% of naive T cells. The remaining 30% are divided between recent thymic emigrants with a comparable phenotype, regulatory T cells (Foxp3<sup>+</sup>) and cells with an activated/memory phenotype. Naive T cells are kept alive through continuous TCR interactions with MHC molecules complexed with various self-peptides. Such TCR/MHC interactions plus contacts with IL-7 cause low-level signaling, which promotes long-term survival of naive T cells in interphase through the synthesis of anti-apoptotic molecules such as Bcl-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Takada and Jameson, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The degree of TCR self-reactivity of a given T-cell clone has been correlated with its expression of CD5 and Nur77 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azzam et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moran et al., 2011</xref>). We have recently identified the cell surface GPI-anchored protein, Ly-6C, as an additional and complementary sensor of T-cell self-reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, we have shown that, in contrast to CD5 and Nur77 which expression directly correlates with self-reactivity, the expression of Ly-6C by peripheral naive CD4 T cells (CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells) inversely correlates with their ability to interact with self-MHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin et al., 2013</xref>). Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells were therefore identified as more self-reactive than their Ly-6C<sup>+</sup>-cell counterparts.</p><p>In the absence of foreign antigen, peripheral naive T cells continuously recirculate between lymphoid organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gowans, 1959</xref>), in which they migrate along the fibroblastic reticular cells network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bajénoff et al., 2006</xref>) and interact frequently and briefly with dendritic cells (DC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bajénoff et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mempel et al., 2004</xref>). It is generally accepted that these frequent DC-T-cell interactions increase the probability of contacts between very rare antigen-specific naive T cells and the few DCs presenting their cognate antigen during the initial course of an infection. Experimental evidences indicate that self-MHC recognition in the periphery is also required to maintain T cells in a state of responsiveness toward foreign antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Persaud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stefanová et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wülfing et al., 2002</xref>), suggesting a crucial role for self-MHC mediated ‘education’ and TCR self-reactivity in determining the intrinsic functional attributes of CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells. Altogether, this steady-state tonic TCR signaling was shown to influence CD4 T<sub>N</sub>-cell effector fate by increasing the magnitude of their response toward their cognate antigens.</p><p>Following activation by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the periphery, the bulk of CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells can differentiate into a variety of well documented T-helper (T<sub>H</sub>) cell subsets, such as T<sub>H</sub>1, T<sub>H</sub>2, T<sub>H</sub>17 or peripherally induced regulatory T cells (pTreg cells), characterized by their cytokine production profiles, specific effector functions and lineage-specific transcription factors (T-bet for T<sub>H</sub>1 cells, GATA-3 for T<sub>H</sub>2 cells, RORγt/RORα for T<sub>H</sub>17 cells and Foxp3 for pTreg cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bilate and Lafaille, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fontenot et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hori et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ivanov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mosmann et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Szabo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ye et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zheng and Flavell, 1997</xref>). Among these effector CD4 T cells, pTreg cells produce TGF-β and share phenotypic and functional characteristics with tTreg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bilate and Lafaille, 2012</xref>). The immunological context in which CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells are immersed at the time of their activation is known to drive lineage commitment. The strength of the activating TCR signals received by a CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cell also influences its subsequent polarization toward particular differentiation pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corse et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, in weakly polarizing conditions, low TCR signals favor T<sub>H</sub>2- and pTreg-cell differentiation, whereas T<sub>H</sub>1- and T<sub>FH</sub>-cell differentiation arises from stronger signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gottschalk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rogers and Croft, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Turner et al., 2009</xref>). Most of these data were obtained in vitro by modulating signal strength with graded dose of peptide-MHC ligands of varying potency. However, only relatively high-affinity TCR–MHC interactions were shown to facilitate the induction of persistent Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gottschalk et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Our recent work has reinforced the link between the tonic TCR signaling received by CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells in the steady-state and their fate in the effector phase. Indeed, we have demonstrated that TCR/self-MHC interactions not only increase quantitatively but also shape qualitatively the response of CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells to their cognate antigens in the effector phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin et al., 2013</xref>). More precisely, by taking advantage of our data showing that Ly-6C expression can be considered as a new sensor of CD4 T<sub>N</sub>-cell self-reactivity, we have demonstrated that CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells with the highest avidity for self-MHC (Ly-6C<sup>-</sup>) have a biased commitment toward the iTreg/pTreg-cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The binding of antigen/MHC complexes to the TCR triggers the recruitment of a series of signaling molecules and adaptors to the TCR/CD3 complex that ultimately results in the phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase C-γ (PLCγ). PLCγ then cleaves the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) in the plasma membrane to generate diacylglycerol, which activates protein kinase C (PKC) and Ras-dependent pathways, as well as 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>), which induces the release of calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) from intracellular stores (the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)). This Ca<sup>2+</sup> store release only transiently elevates intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations but this transient rise induces in turn a massive and sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry from the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hogan et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>With the aim of deciphering the molecular mechanisms involved in the tonic TCR-signaling-mediated shaping of the CD4 T<sub>N</sub>-cell compartment, we have focused on the TCR signaling cascade. By using transcriptomic and phenotypic approaches as well as in vitro and in vivo assays, we have identified the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway as key for the acquisition of both the phenotype of the most self-reactive CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells and their enhanced cell-intrinsic ability to commit into regulatory T cells upon activation in vitro (iTreg) and in vivo (pTreg).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cell-intrinsic enhanced ability of Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells to commit into iTreg cells</title><p>We have recently shown that CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells with the highest avidity for self-MHC (Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells) have a biased commitment toward the iTreg/pTreg-cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin et al., 2013</xref>). As T<sub>H</sub>1- and T<sub>H</sub>2-cell-derived cytokines are known to inhibit iTreg-cell induction in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Henderson et al., 2015</xref>), we first wondered whether Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> and Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells had the same ability to produce such cytokines after stimulation. Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> and Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells were thus stimulated with αCD3- and αCD28-coated antibodies in the presence or absence of TGFβ. Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukins (IL) -4, -17 and -10 were assayed in the supernatants collected 24 hr after the beginning of the culture. We found that, whatever the presence or absence of TGFβ in the culture medium, Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> and Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells produced similar amounts of these cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). To further characterize the enhanced ability of Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells to commit into iTregs in vitro, we asked whether this feature was cell-intrinsic. To this end, Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> and Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells were isolated from peripheral LNs of C57BL/6 Foxp3-GFP mice by flow cytometry sorting, barcoded with CTv or CTv and CTfr proliferation dyes, and stimulated with αCD3- and αCD28-coated antibodies in the presence of graded doses of TGFβ. These cells were cultured separately or together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). The percentages of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells among the progeny of both naive cell-subsets were assessed on day 4. For suboptimal doses of exogenous TGFβ,Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells gave rise to a twofold higher proportion of iTreg cells than their Ly-6C<sup>+</sup>-cell counterparts in both culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). The concentration of TGFβ needed to obtain 50% of the maximal percentage of iTreg cells (effective concentration, EC50) was calculated by fitting the dose-response curves of both CD4 T<sub>N</sub>-cell subsets in the different culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). EC50 values for TGFβ were statistically different between the 2 CD4 T<sub>N</sub>-cell subsets whether they were cultured separately or together. Of note, and in line with their similar ability to produce T<sub>H</sub>1- and T<sub>H</sub>2-cell-derived cytokines, blocking IFN-γ and IL-4 during in vitro iTreg-cell polarization did not abolish the difference in the ability of Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> and Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells to differentiate into iTreg cells. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). These results suggest strongly that the greater sensibility of Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells to iTreg-cell polarization signals is cell-intrinsic.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27215.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cell-intrinsic enhanced ability of Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells to commit into iTreg cells.</title><p>(<bold>A–E</bold>) Flow-cytometry sorted Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> and Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells from C57BL/6 Foxp3-GFP mice were stained with CTv (Ly-6C<sup>-</sup>) or CTv and CTfr (Ly-6C<sup>+</sup>) and stimulated separately or together for 4 days with coated αCD3 and αCD28 Abs (4 µg/mL), in the presence of graded doses of TGFβ1.

Comparison of the 6CSign with these cell signatures revealed that the differences in gene expression observed between Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> and Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells correlated significantly with the in-vitro-induced Treg-cell signature, and to a lesser extent with the T<sub>H</sub>17 one but not with the T<sub>H</sub>1 or T<sub>H</sub>2 transcriptional signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>Similarities were also observed between the transcriptional profiles of Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells and ex vivo purified peripheral Treg cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wei et al., 2009</xref>). One common characteristic shared by Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells and CD4 Treg cells is their high degree of self-reactivity. Recent studies have highlighted a continuous requirement of self-MHC recognition and of the associated TCR-mediated signaling for maintaining both the function and transcriptional signature of CD4 Treg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delpoux et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Levine et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vahl et al., 2014</xref>). Whereas self-deprivation or TCR-ablation did not impair the expression of the transcription factor Foxp3, they induced major transcriptional changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delpoux et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Levine et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vahl et al., 2014</xref>).

More precisely, most genes upregulated in Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells when compared to their Ly-6C<sup>+</sup>-cell counterparts were positively regulated by steady-state TCR signaling in CD4 Treg cells (such as <italic>Cd5</italic>, <italic>Cd200</italic>, <italic>Il2rb</italic>, <italic>Itih5</italic>, <italic>Maf</italic> and <italic>Myb</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Conversely, an important proportion of the genes downregulated in Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells were also down-regulated by steady-state interactions with self-MHC in CD4 Treg cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Altogether, these data point to a role for the TCR signaling pathway in the installation and maintenance of the 6CSign.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub>-cell phenotype relies on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway in vitro</title><p>The transcriptional signature of Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells revealed some similarities between these cells and αCD3-stimulated CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells. We therefore decided to analyze the effect of TCR signaling on Ly-6C expression. Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells were isolated from peripheral LNs of C57BL/6 Foxp3-GFP mice by flow cytometry sorting and incubated with various stimulating agents mimicking all or part of TCR-induced signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). As expected from our transcriptomic analysis and previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin et al., 2013</xref>), Ly-6C expression was clearly downregulated when cells were stimulated with αCD3 and αCD28-coated antibodies for 5 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). To decipher which TCR-induced signals led to Ly-6C down-regulation, we roughly dichotomized the TCR signaling cascade into its two main components, for example the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway that can be elicited by Thapsigargin (TG) and the PKC and ERK signaling pathways activated by PMA. When combined, PMA and TG, induced complete Ly-6C down-regulation, whereas, when separated, each drug had an opposite effect on Ly-6C expression. Indeed, whereas PMA alone upregulated Ly-6C expression, TG alone induced a near-complete disappearance of Ly-6C protein at the surface of Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells. Interestingly, while in all other conditions, CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells were proliferating, this phenotypic conversion of Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells into Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells induced by TG alone occurred without any proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Importantly, to avoid TG-induced cell death, a sub-optimal dose (4 nM) was used in these culture conditions. 4 nM TG induced a reproducible increase in intracellular calcium levels, although to a lesser extent than the classical dose of 200 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Accordingly, by analyzing basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> contents at the end of the culture period (5 days), we observed that 4 nM TG treated Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells exhibited higher cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels than control cells cultured in IL-7 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). To further characterize the long-term effect of this low-dose TG, subcellular localization of the nuclear factor of activated T-cell protein 1 (NFAT1) was assessed in Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells in the presence or absence of 4 nM TG at various time points along the culture. Indeed, increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels result in the activation of calcineurin that dephosphorylates members of the NFAT family, leading to their translocation into the nucleus. NFAT1 localization was quantified by high-resolution imaging flow-cytometry using the ImageStreamX technology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In line with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase induced by 4 nM TG treatment, NFAT was translocated into the nucleus of Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells in the presence of TG while it remained cytoplasmic in its absence. NFAT translocation into the nucleus peaked on day 1 and remained significantly higher in TG-treated cells than in control cells throughout the culture.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27215.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub>-cell phenotype relies upon calcium signaling pathway in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Flow-cytometry sorted Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells from C57BL/6 Foxp3-GFP mice were labelled with CTv and cultured in IL-7 (10 ng/ml) in the presence of either coated αCD3/28 (4µg/ml), PMA and TG (1.25 ng/ml and 4 nM, respectively), PMA alone (1.25 ng/ml) or TG (4 nM).

We then studied the kinetic aspect of the TG-mediated conversion of Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells into Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells and found that it occurred in 3–4 days of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, our results suggest that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway is sufficient to induce Ly-6C down-regulation on CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells in vitro. We therefore hypothesized that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway might be involved as part of the self-mediated tonic TCR signaling in the generation/maintenance of Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells in the periphery of a normal mouse in the steady-state. To evaluate the activation status of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway within Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> and Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells in vivo in the steady-state, we analyzed NFAT1 subcellular localization in both cell types. To this aim, LN cells were directly fixed after recovery and NFAT1 or NFAT2 localization was imaged by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>) and quantified by high-resolution imaging flow-cytometry using the ImageStreamX technology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). In line with our hypothesis, NFAT localization is more nuclear in Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells than in their Ly-6C<sup>+</sup>-cell counterparts. As a control, CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells were rested in vitro for 30 min before fixation and staining. As expected, differences in NFAT localization between Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> and Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells were abolished in these conditions. 200 nM TG treatment induced the nuclear translocation of NFAT in both CD4 T<sub>N</sub>-cell subsets.

To this aim, Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells were isolated from peripheral LNs of C57BL/6 Foxp3-GFP mice by flow cytometry sorting and cultured with IL-7 in the presence or absence of TG and calcineurin-inhibitors (Cyclosporin A, CsA and Tacrolimus, FK506, FK). Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells cultured in IL-7 were added as control.

For all these proteins, TG induced changes in their expression at the cell surface of Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells.

We then wondered whether a longer treatment with this calcineurin inhibitor would affect the phenotype of CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells in vivo.To this aim, C57BL/6 Foxp3-GFP mice were injected daily with FK506 or PBS for 2 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). After 14 days, CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells from peripheral LNs and the spleen were analyzed for their expression of Ly-6C, Izumo1r and CD200. In line with our in vitro experiments, both the percentage of Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> cells among CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells and the MFI of Ly-6C at the cell surface of Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells increased in treated mice when compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>). Moreover, FK506 induced significant decreases of Izumo1r and CD200 surface levels in CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,F</xref>). Such changes in the phenotype of the bulk of CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells could result from either the conversion of Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells into Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells or the disappearance of the Ly-6C<sup>-</sup>-cell subset.

Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> and Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells were recovered from C57BL/6 Foxp3-GFP mice and cultured in vitro with or without TG. After 5 days of culture, viable cells were FACS-sorted and stimulated with αCD3- and αCD28-coated antibodies in the presence of graded doses of TGFβ for 4 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Such contacts with self-MHC are required for the long-term survival of peripheral naive T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martin et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stritesky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanchot et al., 1997</xref>). The signals derived from the recognition of self-MHC by TCRs also allow maintaining naive T cells in a state of greater sensitivity for responses to foreign antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dorfman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stefanová et al., 2002</xref>). The seminal work of Štefanová <italic>et al</italic>. showed a rapid decline in the ability of CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells to respond to their cognate antigen once contacts with self-MHC were disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stefanová et al., 2002</xref>). These findings were confirmed by several groups using various elegant experimental models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hochweller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mandl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Persaud et al., 2014</xref>). Beside these works, we have recently demonstrated that CD4 T<sub>N</sub>-cell self-reactivity not only increases quantitatively but also shapes qualitatively their response toward their cognate antigens in the effector phase by increasing their ability to commit toward the iTreg/pTreg-cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin et al., 2013</xref>). In the present paper, we first wondered whether the enhanced ability of the most self-reactive CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells to convert into iTreg/pTreg cells upon appropriate stimulation was a cell-intrinsic property. The unchanged ability of both Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> and Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells to polarize into Foxp3-expressing iTreg cells in vitro whether they were cultured together or separately demonstrate that the biased commitment of the most self-reactive CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells toward the iTreg-cell lineage is cell-intrinsic.</p><p>We have recently described the cell surface GPI-anchored protein, Ly-6C, as an additional and complementary sensor of T-cell self-reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin et al., 2013</xref>). However, significant differences may be noticed between CD5 and Ly-6C. First, whereas CD5 surface levels directly correlate with self-reactivity, Ly-6C expression by peripheral CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells inversely correlates with their ability to interact with self-MHC. Second, in contrast to CD5, Ly-6C expression at the cell surface of CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells is stable over time in homeostatic conditions as its up-regulation after self-MHC deprivation takes several days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin et al., 2013</xref>). Notwithstanding these differences, Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells express higher protein and mRNA levels of CD5 than their Ly-6C<sup>+</sup>-cell counterparts. Two recent papers by the group of Daniel Hawiger have highlighted a crucial role of CD5 in promoting the conversion of CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells into iTreg/pTreg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Henderson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jones et al., 2016</xref>). CD5 would block the activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and would allow activated CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells to resist to the inhibition of iTreg-cell induction induced by T<sub>H</sub>1- and T<sub>H</sub>2-cell-derived cytokines. Accordingly, in the absence of effector-differentiating cytokines, CD5<sup>hi</sup> and CD5<sup>lo</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells were shown to differentiate with a similar efficiency into iTreg/pTreg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Henderson et al., 2015</xref>). Such a phenomenon is unlikely to account for the greater ability of Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells to commit to the iTreg/pTreg-cell lineage. Indeed, Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> and Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells produced similar amounts of these cytokines after stimulation and Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells still differentiated more efficiently than their Ly-6C<sup>+</sup>-cell counterparts into iTreg cells in vitro in the presence of anti-cytokine (IL-4 and IFN-γ) blocking antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). Moreover, whereas rapamycin drastically diminished the difference in the ability of CD5<sup>hi</sup> and CD5<sup>lo</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells to convert to iTreg/pTreg cells in the presence of cytokines known as restraining this effector fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Henderson et al., 2015</xref>), this mTOR inhibitor similarly enhanced the generation of iTreg cells from both Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> and Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells and thus preserved the difference between these two cell subsets (data not shown).</p><p>In the present study, we have identified the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway as sufficient to induce Ly-6C down-regulation at the cell surface of CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells in vitro. Indeed, incubation of Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells with the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin, led to multiple phenotypic changes including not only Ly-6C down-regulation but also variations in the expression of many other genes of the 6CSign (such as CD5, CD73, CD122, CD200 and Izumo1r). This phenotypic conversion of Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells into Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells takes four days to occur in vitro and relies on the activity of Calcineurin, as shown by its complete blocking in the presence of Cyclosporin A or FK506. Interestingly, calcium- and PKC/Ras-dependent signaling pathways had divergent effects on the expression of Ly-6C. Indeed, whereas TG induced Ly-6C down-regulation, PMA led to its upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In line with this observation, the 6CSign does not correlate with the changes in gene expression induced by PMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These opposite effects of TG and PMA may reflect the well-documented and complex interplay between the PKC and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways. For example, PKC translocation to the plasma membrane is strictly Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reither et al., 2006</xref>) and calcineurin is phosphorylated and inhibited by PKC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hashimoto and Soderling, 1989</xref>). Altogether, our results suggest that interactions with self-MHC in the steady-state result in a dominant Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (when compared to PKC and Ras-dependent pathways) leading to down-regulation of Ly-6C expression. This hypothesis is consistent with our results showing that in vivo Calcineurin inhibition leads to an increase in Ly-6C expression at even higher levels than those observed at the cell surface of Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells from untreated mice. This hypothesis is reinforced by the work of Dong et al. (Dong TX et al., co-published with the present article) showing that Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes can be measured in mouse total lymph node T cells in the steady-state and that anti-MHC blocking antibodies significantly reduced their frequency. Continuous interactions with self-MHC in the steady-state may thus induce calcium waves that shape both the phenotype of CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells and their behavior in the effector phase by favoring their differentiation into pTreg cells.</p><p>tTreg and pTreg cells have complementary roles in immune-mediated tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haribhai et al., 2011</xref>). An attractive hypothesis would be that tTreg cells would be responsible for tolerance to self-antigens, whereas pTreg cells would be in charge of restraining deleterious immune responses to non-self-antigens. In particular, pTreg cells are involved in the control of the responses to non-self-antigens leading to allergy and asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Josefowicz et al., 2012</xref>) as well as to commensal organism- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lathrop et al., 2011</xref>) and food-derived antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mucida et al., 2005</xref>) in the gut. Foetus-derived and allograft-derived antigens represent other obvious examples of acute exposure to non-self-antigens arising in the adults and requiring the establishment of a tolerance. In both cases, pTreg cells are generated against non-self antigens (either conceptus-male-derived [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Samstein et al., 2012</xref>] or allograft-derived [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Francis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wood et al., 2012</xref>]). These cells are needed to establish an efficient tolerance toward the foetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Samstein et al., 2012</xref>). However, there is still a lack of evidence to definitely implicate pTreg cells in the induction of an efficient tolerance toward allograft, in part because of the difficulties to achieve such a state. We have previously demonstrated that self-reactivity in the steady-state increases the ability of CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells to differentiate into iTreg/pTreg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin et al., 2013</xref>). Accordingly, the most self-reactive CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells (i.e. Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells) should contribute predominantly to the pTreg-cell pool generated under physiologic and pathologic conditions. In the present study, our data suggest strongly that this tonic TCR-signaling-mediated shaping of the CD4 T<sub>N</sub>-cell compartment is calcineurin-dependent. In particular, chronic treatment with a calcineurin inhibitor leads to the disappearance of Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells. Cyclosporin A and Tacrolimus treatments could thus interfere with the neoconversion of CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells into pTreg cells and limit the development of tolerance in transplant patients. This may explain the difficulty to safely interrupt these immunosuppressive therapies even after years. Thus, besides their obvious clinical utility, calcineurin inhibitors may have potentially harmful side effects that should be studied to better assess and adapt their use.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>B6.Cg-Foxp3tm1Mal/J</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al.

Cells were stained either in HBSS (for ex-vivo-purified CD4 T cells) or directly in the culture medium (cultured cells). Thereafter, ex-vivo-purified CD4 T cells were stained for surface markers and kept on ice. Before acquisition, cell aliquots were allowed to equilibrate to 37°C for 5 min and then were analyzed by flow cytometry. After acquisition of background intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations for 2 min, cells were stimulated with Thapsigargin (at a concentration of 4 or 200 nM).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Cell culture and in vitro polarization assays</title><p>Flow-cytometry sorted Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> and Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells from LNs of C57BL/6 Foxp3-GFP mice were stained with CellTrace Violet (CTv; 5 µM; Life Technologies) and cultured with IL-7 (10 ng/ml) alone or in combination with Thapsigargin (TG; 4 nM), Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 1.25 ng/ml), PMA +TG (1.25 ng/ml and 4 nM, respectively) and immobilized anti-CD3 (clone 145.2C11; 4 µg/ml; obtained from hybridoma supernatants) and anti-CD28 (clone 37.51; eBioscience; 4 µg/ml) Abs. For in vitro polarization assays Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells were additionally stained with CellTrace Far Red (CTfr; 1.25 µM; Life Technologies). Cells were then stimulated separately or together for 4 days with coated anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 Abs, in the presence of graded concentrations of exogenous recombinant human TGFβ1 (Invitrogen). In some experiments, anti-IFN-γ (clone R4-6A2; 10 µg/mL) and anti-IL-4 (clone 11B11; 10 µg/mL) blocking antibodies were added in the culture.</p><p>The concentration of TGFβ needed to obtain 50% of the maximal percentage of iTreg cells (Effective Concentration, EC50) was calculated by fitting the dose-response curves of CD4 T<sub>N</sub>-cell subsets in the different culture conditions. To this end, the means of 3 to 5 independent experiments were used to build dose response curves using nonlinear least-squares regression to the Hill equation. The model used for this function was Y=[B+(T–B)] / [1 + 10<sup>([LogEC50-X]*HillSlope)</sup>], where ‘Y’ represents Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells as a percentage among CD4<sup>+</sup> cells, ‘T’ and ‘B’ represent the plateaus at the beginning and end of the curve, respectively, and ‘X’ represents the concentration of TGFβ added at the beginning of the culture. The absolute EC50 was calculated to interpolate X at 50% with 95% confidence intervals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Cytokine multiplex assay</title><p>Flow-cytometry sorted Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> and Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells from LNs of C57BL/6 Foxp3-GFP mice were stimulated as described above with immobilized anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 Abs in the presence or absence of exogenous recombinant human TGFβ1 (Invitrogen, 4 µg/mL). Supernatants were recovered 24 hr later and cytokines were quantified by MSD multi-array U-PLEX assays (IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-17A/F and IL-10; Meso Scale Discovery, Rockville, MD) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Imaging flow cytometry</title><p>LNs cells of C57BL/6 mice were harvested and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, immediately or after 30 min of resting or stimulation with 200 nM of Thapsigargin in RPMI 1640 Glutamax (Gibco).

Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Courtaboeuf, France). RNA quality was validated with Bioanalyzer 2100 (using Agilent RNA6000 nano chip kit). Experimental and analytical part of the microarray analysis was performed according to the MIAME standards. Amplified, fragmented and biotinylated sense-strand DNA targets were synthesized from 50 ng total RNA according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Ovation PicoSL WTA System V2 and Encore Biotin Module kit (Nugen, Leek, The Netherlands)) and hybridized to a mouse gene 2.0 ST array (Affymetrix, Paris, France). The stained chips were read and analysed with a GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G and Expression Console software (Affymetrix). Raw data (.cel files) were then processed and normalized using the quantile normalization method in RMA with R package (Bioconductor). Statistical analysis was then performed with Partek Genomics Suite software (Partek). Gene expression was z-transformed, for visualization, using the following formula: z=(X-μ)/τ, with X = normalized intensity, μ = mean of the normalized intensity across replicates and τ = s.d. of mean of the normalized intensity across replicates. Experimental and analytical part of the microarray was performed on the Cochin Genomic facility.

For each datasets the values mean of Probset with the same Gene-id was performed to generate a file (.xlsx) with a unique value per Gene-id for each sample. These files were then statistical analyzed as described above. The newly created public GEO Datasets were then aligned with our microarray data by keeping only the commons Gene-id. Finally, these alignment files were filtered on our data for a p-value&lt;0.05 and a fold change &gt;1.3 and the differential expression of genes was compared between our and public GEO microarray.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We greatly acknowledge E Maillard, K Labroquère and M Andrieu from the Cochin Cytometry and Immunobiology (CYBIO) facility, S Jacques and F Letourneur from the Cochin Genomic (GENOM’IC) facility and P Bourdoncle and B Durel from the Cochin Imaging (IMAG’IC) facility.

You were contacted about this opportunity and agreed to exchange information with the authors of that paper after receiving the three individual reviews for each. The following is a consensus review among three of the reviewers who agreed to oversee a co-revision. The intention is to help you prioritise the revision and also to clarify the opportunity for coordination from our perspective.</p><p>The two papers deal with different consequences of calcium mobilization in vivo. Auffray et al., focuses on transcriptional changes that are brought about in the most self reactive naïve T cells in mice that lead to loss of Ly6C expression and a tendency to differentiate into peripheral Treg upon activation. This state could be mimicked by treatments that may chronically enhance cytoplasmic calcium, but the evidence for any effects on cytoplasmic calcium ion levels by self pMHC in vivo or low concentrations of thapsigargin in vitro are lacking, which is a major gap. There are also mechanistic aspects related to cytokine production in the Ly6C positive population that could be explored.</p><p>Cahalan et al. focuses on the role of CRAC channel activation in T cell trafficking and interstitial migration in the T cell zone of lymph nodes. A unique aspect of the paper is that they focus entirely on human T cells in profoundly immunodeficient mice. CRAC is eliminated through expression of a dominant negative Orai, which is well established to eliminate sustained calcium increases. The authors developed a new calcium reporter based on fusing GCaMP6f to tdTomato to make a ratiometric reporter called Salsa6f, which is sufficient sensitive to detect calcium spikes in intact lymph nodes. The main points are that CRAC channel function is needed for efficient lymph node entry and that cell-autonomous calcium fluxes result in slowing of T cell migration. The weakness in this paper is that the actual mechanism of the calcium fluxes is not established and objective statistical tests supporting a relationship are not provided. The trigger for the calcium fluxes observed in not clear.</p><p>The editors felt that there is strong possibility that addressing issues in Cahalan et al., may provide key supporting data for Auffray.et al. And reciprocally, data in Auffray et al. provides further physiological significance for data in Cahalan.et al. The authors may therefore benefit from coordinating on the revisions and the authors have agreed to exchange information. The editors have prepared the following joint consensus review following provision of the individual reviews.</p><p>1) The main concern with Auffray et al. is that there is no data on the impact of pharmacological manipulations on cytoplasmic calcium levels in the naïve mouse T cells. The authors of Cahalan et al. are experts in this area. It will be important for the authors to use in vitro calcium studies to determine the impact of chronic exposure to 4 nM thapsigargin in different time windows- does this result in sustained cytoplasmic calcium elevation capable to inducing NFAT translocation. This may require a highly sensitive method and advice from authors of Cahalan et al. should be helpful to address this concern in a 2 month time frame. But this concern needs to be addressed.</p><p>2) The main concern with Cahalan et al. is that the mechanism triggering the calcium fluxes in vitro and in vivo is not clear. T cell migrating on flat substrates didn't display the calcium fluxes, but movement in PDMS channels and within lymph nodes did. The authors attention was called to recent studies that suggest that surface interactions could trigger calcium signals related to formation of close contacts that exclude CD45. Thus, some cellular confinement in the PDMS channels may trigger signals. The in vivo situation is of greatest interest. The use of the human-mouse system is a complication as its not entirely clear self pMHC is supplied by human monocyte derived DC or mouse xeno-MHC, which can trigger T cell responses. In murine systems, particularly on H2-b haplotype, it is relatively easy to eliminate self pMHC signals in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells acutely by blocking I-Ab with an antibody (e.g. Stefanova I, Dorfman JR, Germain RN. Self-recognition promotes the foreign antigen sensitivity of naive T lymphocytes. Nature. 2002;420(6914):429-34.) or by transferring CD4 T cells in to I-Ab deficient mice. Thus, while the human mouse system has some utility as a preclinical model, it's a relatively weak tool to study basic mechanisms in this case as even if only human pMHC is recognized, there are multiple possible class I and class II genes that would need to be blocked to eliminate all possible recognition. The author should repeat a key experiment in a mouse model system where a role of self-pMHC in the in vivo calcium fluxes could be supported or ruled out. Introduction of the Salsa6f reporter into naïve T cells would be helpful in this context. If the authors happen to have generated a transgenic model with Salsa6f or have the ability to introduce it by RNA electroporation then this could be combined with antibody blocking to test a role for self-pMHC in the calcium activity independent of the DN Orai construct, which is not necessarily needed to ask this question. The result of this experiment would also provide key information for Auffray.et al.</p><p>Additional points:</p><p>1) Are the Ly6C negative naïve T cell poor producers of cytokines that would prevent Treg induction in vitro? This could be tested with a number of systems to evaluate cytokine production.</p><p>2) The oral tolerance studies should be performed at different antigen doses to be convincing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27215.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The main concern with Auffray et al. is that there is no data on the impact of pharmacological manipulations on cytoplasmic calcium levels in the naïve mouse T cells.

Calcium mobilization induced by 4nM thapsigargin has been compared to the one induced by the classical dose of 200nM. In the revised version of our manuscript, we are showing that 4nM TG induce a moderate but significant increase in intracellular calcium levels, although to a lesser extent than the 200nM dose. We have added these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (panel C) and described them in the Results section of our manuscript:</p><p>“Importantly, to avoid TG induced cell death, a sub-optimal dose (4nM) was used in these culture conditions. 4nM TG induced a reproducible increase in intracellular calcium levels, although to a lesser extent than the classical dose of 200nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).”</p><p>To better characterize the long-term effect of 4nM TG during the culturing period, baseline calcium cytoplasmic levels were assessed after 5 days of culture. Cells cultured in IL-7 alone were used as control. We observed that, even at this late time point, 4nM TG treated Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells still exhibited higher cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels than control cells. To strengthen this result, and as requested by the reviewers, we have also analyzed NFAT subcellular localization at various time points throughout the culture. NFAT was translocated into the nucleus of 4nM thapsigargin treated cells as soon as 1 day after the beginning of the culture. More precisely, NFAT translocation into the nucleus peaked on day 1 and remained significantly higher in TG treated cells than in control cells throughout the culture. We have now added these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (panels D-F) and described them in the Results section of our manuscript:</p><p>“After 5 days of culture, 4nM TG treated Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells still exhibited higher cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels than control cells cultured in IL-7 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). To further characterize the long-term effect of this low dose TG, subcellular localization of the nuclear factor of activated T cell protein 1 (NFAT1) was assessed in Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells in the presence or absence of 4nM TG at various time points along the culture. Indeed, increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels result in the activation of Calcineurin that dephosphorylates members of the NFAT family, leading to their translocation into the nucleus. NFAT1 localization was quantified by high-resolution imaging flow-cytometry using the ImageStreamX technology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In line with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase induced by 4nM TG treatment, NFAT was translocated into the nucleus of Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells in the presence of TG while it remained cytoplasmic in its absence. NFAT translocation into the nucleus peaked on day 1 and remained significantly higher in TG treated cells than in control cells throughout the culture.”</p><p>Furthermore, our data demonstrating that the in vivo inhibition of Calcineurin activity led to the conversion of Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> to Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells were reinforced by imaging flow cytometry data showing that such a treatment also led to the rapid exclusion of NFAT from the nucleus of Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells. Of note, a short-term exposure (18 hours) to FK506 was used in this experiment to prevent the phenotypic conversion of Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> to Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells. We have added these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and described them in the Results section of our manuscript:</p><p>“We first confirmed that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Calcineurin signaling cascade was active in vivo in Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells by showing that blocking Calcineurin activation for 18 hours with FK506 was sufficient to abrogate the nuclear localization of NFAT in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then wondered whether a longer treatment with this Calcineurin inhibitor would affect the phenotype of CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells in vivo.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional points:</p><p>1) Are the Ly6C negative naïve T cell poor producers of cytokines that would prevent Treg induction in vitro? This could be tested with a number of systems to evaluate cytokine production.</p></disp-quote><p>Such an hypothesis is consistent with the literature showing that the high levels of CD5 expressed by CD5<sup>high</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells counteract the inhibitory effect of T<sub>H</sub>1- and T<sub>H</sub>2-cell derived cytokines on iTreg-cell induction (J.G. Henderson et al., Immunity 2015, PMID: 25786177). As Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells exhibit higher levels of CD5 than Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells, it could have been thus consistent with our data showing that when co-cultured with Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells, Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells still differentiated more efficiently than their Ly-6C<sup>+</sup>-cell counterparts into iTreg cells in vitro.</p><p>We are now showing that Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> and Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells, stimulated for 24 hours with αCD3- and αCD28-coated antibodies in the presence or absence of TGFβ, produce similar amounts of IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). We have added these data in a new figure supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>) and described them in the Results and Discussion sections of our manuscript:</p><p>“As T<sub>H</sub>1- and T<sub>H</sub>2-cell derived cytokines are known to inhibit iTreg-cell induction in vitro (références), we first wondered whether Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> and Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells had the same ability to produce such cytokines after stimulation. Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> and Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells were thus stimulated with αCD3- and αCD28-coated antibodies in the presence or absence of TGFβ. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukins (IL) -4, -17 and -10 were assayed in the supernatants collected 24 hours after the beginning of the culture. We found that, whatever the presence or absence of TGFβ in the culture medium, Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> and Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells produced similar amounts of these cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).”</p><p>“Indeed, Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> and Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells produced similar amounts of these cytokines after stimulation and Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells still differentiated more efficiently than their Ly-6C<sup>+</sup>-cell counterparts into iTreg cells in vitro in the presence of anti-cytokine (IL-4 and IFN-γ) blocking antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C-E</xref>).”</p><p>Moreover, we have supplemented these data with an in vitro polarization experiment comparing the ability of Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> and Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells to convert into iTreg cells in the presence of anti-IFN-γ and anti-IL-4 blocking mAbs. In line with our cytokine assay, adding these blocking mAbs in the culture medium does not abolish the difference in the ability of Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> and Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells to differentiate into iTreg cells. The result of this experiment was previously quoted in the Discussion section, as data not shown, and is now included both in the Results and the Discussion sections of our revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C-E</xref> and in the text):</p><p>“Of note, and in line with their similar ability to produce T<sub>H</sub>1- and T<sub>H</sub>2-cell derived cytokines, blocking IFN-γ and IL-4 during in vitro iTreg-cell polarization did not abolish the difference in the ability of Ly-6C<sup>-</sup> and Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells to differentiate into iTreg cells.

Indeed, in this model, OVA was continuously given in the drinking water (1.5% (w/v)). This point was already specified in the Material and methods section as well as in the figure legend of the first version of our manuscript. To strengthen this part of our results, instead of testing different antigen doses in our initial protocol (Such an experiment would have of course considerably strengthen our results but would have required important numbers of C57BL/6 Foxp3-GFP OT-II mice), we have chosen to use a second well-defined protocol of oral administration of OVA. More precisely, in this setting, 50 mg OVA were given by gavage (4 and 24 hours after the transfer of OT-II cells). Moreover, in this setting, “Ca<sup>2+</sup>-converted” and control OT-II CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells were co-transferred in order to compare their ability to convert into pTreg cells in the same recipient mice. 10 days after transfer (instead of 7 in the first mouse model), we demonstrated that “Ca<sup>2+</sup>-converted” OT-II CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells gave rise to greater absolute numbers of Foxp3-expressing cells than control OT-II CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells. We have added these data in a new figure supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) and described them in the Results section of our manuscript:</p><p>“These latter results were confirmed by using a second protocol of oral administration of OVA. In this setting, “Ca<sup>2+</sup>-converted” OT-II CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells were co-transferred with OT-II CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells cultured in IL-7 alone in order to compare their ability to convert into pTreg in the same recipient mice. FACS-sorted CD45. 2<sup>+</sup> and CD45.1/2<sup>+</sup> OT-II CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells were first cultured in IL-7 in the absence or presence of TG respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). After 5 days of culture, living cells were FACS-sorted, mixed at a 1:1 ratio and 1.10<sup>6</sup> cells were adoptively transferred into CD45.1 Foxp3-GFP mice. Finally, recipient mice were fed with OVA by gavage (4 and 24 hours after the transfer of OT-II cells). Nine days later, secondary lymphoid organs were recovered and the phenotype of donor-derived OT-II T cells was analyzed. In this setting, “Ca<sup>2+</sup>-converted” OT-II CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells were also giving rise to greater absolute numbers of Foxp3-expressing cells than OT-II CD4 T<sub>N</sub> cells cultured with IL-7 alone prior to injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). More precisely, more than three quarters of the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> OT-II cells arising in these conditions derived from “Ca<sup>2+</sup>-converted” cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
