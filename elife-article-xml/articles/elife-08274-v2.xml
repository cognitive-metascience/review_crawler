Fear reinstatement can cause relapse in spite of successful fear reduction through extinction-based exposure therapy. By utilising a contextual fear-conditioning task in mice, we found that reinstatement was accompanied by decreased c-Fos expression in the infralimbic cortex (IL) with reduction of synaptic input and enhanced c-Fos expression in the medial subdivision of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeM). Moreover, we found that IL dopamine plays a key role in reinstatement. A reinstatement-inducing reminder shock induced c-Fos expression in the IL-projecting dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area, and the blocking of IL D1 signalling prevented reduction of synaptic input, CeM c-Fos expression, and fear reinstatement. These findings demonstrate that a dopamine-dependent inactivation of extinction circuits underlies fear reinstatement and may explain the comorbidity of substance use disorders and anxiety disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08274.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08274.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08274.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Anxiety disorders affect millions of people worldwide. While many people with anxiety disorders can recover with appropriate treatment, about 40% of these individuals will encounter a relapse of their condition.</p><p>Researchers can investigate the causes of relapses by creating animal models of the processes involved. For example, if a mouse receives a small shock every time it enters a particular cage, it will learn to associate that cage with the shock. Once this association has been created, it can be ‘undone’ using a procedure called extinction. In the cage example, this may be performed by placing the mouse in the cage for a long time, but without giving it any shocks. Over time, the animal learns that the cage is no longer linked to an unpleasant outcome. However, if a mouse is given a reminder shock after extinction has occurred, the original association between the cage and the shock is re-established. This is known as fear reinstatement and is similar to a relapse.</p><p>A number of brain regions are thought to be involved in fear reinstatement. One such region, the amygdala, is heavily involved in fear responses. It is thought that another part of the brain, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), can suppress the amygdala's responses, consequently reducing the animal's anxiety. While we have a good idea of which parts of the brain are involved in fear processing, we don't yet know how they work together to create a relapse.</p><p>Hitora-Imamura et al. used the aforementioned method of selectively giving mice small shocks when they entered cages to induce fear, extinction, and fear reinstatement and examined how this affected the mice's brain activity. As expected, fear could be linked to activity in the amygdala. During extinction, high levels of activity in the medial prefrontal cortex suppressed the amygdala's response. When the mice experienced the reminder shock, a chemical called dopamine was released. When dopamine entered the medial prefrontal cortex, the region's activity was reduced, removing the ‘brakes’ from the amygdala and reinstating the mice's fear.</p><p>The finding that dopamine is involved in fear reinstatement is particularly important, as many commonly abused drugs are known to increase levels of dopamine in the brain. Dopamine's role in fear reinstatement may explain why substance abuse is so closely linked to anxiety disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08274.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08274.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>fear conditioning</kwd><kwd>fear extinction</kwd><kwd>reinstatement</kwd><kwd>infralimbic cortex</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12J09784</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hitora-Imamura</surname><given-names>Natsuko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>25830002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nomura</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>23115101</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nomura</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26119507</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nomura</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26115509</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nomura</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>25119004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ikegaya</surname><given-names>Yuji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Prefrontal dopamine regulates inhibition of fear extinction circuits in the infralimbic cortex and disinhibition of fear expression circuits in the amygdala, leading to fear reinstatement.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Anxiety disorders are often treated with cognitive-behavioural interventions such as exposure therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McNally, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vervliet et al., 2013</xref>). Fear conditioning and extinction are used in animal models of anxiety disorders and their treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davis, 2002</xref>). In extinction, conditioned responses can be reduced by prolonged presentations of conditional stimuli (CS) without the associated unconditional stimuli (US) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">LeDoux, 2000</xref>). Many studies have shown that the infralimbic cortex (IL) is a critical brain region for extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Herry et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sotres-Bayon and Quirk, 2010</xref>). Extinction is suppressed by pharmacological inactivation of the IL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laurent and Westbrook, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011</xref>) as well as by local injection of <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burgos-Robles et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sotres-Bayon et al., 2009</xref>) or cannabinoid antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lin et al., 2009</xref>) into the IL. The IL inhibits the medial subdivision of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeM), a key region for fear expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wilensky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ciocchi et al., 2010</xref>), partly through intercalated amygdala neurons (ITCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Likhtik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amano et al., 2010</xref>), which are also necessary for extinction.</p><p>Relapse is common in anxiety disorders. About 40% of patients in remission experience a relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruce et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ansell et al., 2011</xref>). While clinical observations have limitations on experimental control, relapse studies in the laboratory provide more information because of the greater potential for experimental manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vervliet et al., 2013</xref>). In experimental animals, fear can be reinstated by one or more US-only presentations after successful extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rescorla and Heth, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertotto et al., 2006</xref>). We previously reported that fear reinstatement occurs through NMDAR- and protein synthesis-dependent neural plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shen et al., 2013</xref>). It has also been reported that fear reinstatement requires β-adrenergic receptor activation, gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor endocytosis, and actin rearrangement in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Motanis and Maroun, 2012</xref>). However, neural circuit mechanisms responsible for fear reinstatement are poorly understood. Interestingly, the BLA–medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) pathway is potentiated following fear extinction and depotentiated following reinstatement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vouimba and Maroun, 2011</xref>). Therefore, the mPFC could be a key region mediating fear reinstatement. Nevertheless, little is known about activity changes of the mPFC and its downstream brain regions during fear reinstatement, synaptic modifications within the mPFC, and potential molecular regulation of such modifications.</p><p>To identify brain regions involved in processing fear reinstatement, we mapped the regional expression of the inducible immediate early gene (c-Fos). We focused on the mPFC, amygdala, and hippocampus because they are important in fear modulation and have reciprocal connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Quirk and Mueller, 2008</xref>). In addition, we used in vitro patch-clamp recording to explore synaptic modifications within the mPFC. Building on our results from the c-Fos and electrophysiology experiments, we hypothesised that prefrontal dopamine plays a key role in reinstatement and tested this hypothesis pharmacologically. Together, these data suggest that a dopamine-dependent inactivation of extinction circuits underlies fear reinstatement.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reinstatement is associated with low c-Fos expression in the IL</title><p>To examine the neural circuits for fear reinstatement, we utilised a contextual fear-conditioning task, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shen et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Mice learned an association between CS (chamber A) and US (foot shocks) on Day 1. On Day 2, they received a prolonged CS presentation without any US (extinction training), then their freezing time gradually decreased. On Day 3, they were re-exposed to CS to confirm retention of extinction (test 1). To reinstate the conditioned fear, they immediately received a weak US (reminder shock) in chamber B on Day 4, and they were exposed to CS again on Day 5 (test 2). The mice showed higher freezing time in test 2 than they did in test 1, suggesting successful reinstatement. Freezing time was comparable between tests 1 and 2 if mice were exposed to chamber B without a reminder shock on Day 4 (39.5 ± 4.2% in test 1 and 32.6 ± 5.3% in test 2, n = 4). When we gave the reminder shock to naive mice, the reminder shock alone did not induce high fear responses (6.0 ± 2.1%, n = 5), indicating that the reminder shock-induced increase in freezing was derived from the original conditioned fear, not from new learning.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08274.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Reinstatement is associated with low IL activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A reminder shock reinstated extinguished fear (n = 10 mice; paired <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>t</italic><sub>(9)</sub> = 3.6, p = 0.0059).

Mice were exposed to the CS one day after reminder shock (Reinstatement group). The Fear and Extinction groups were exposed to the CS one day after conditioning and one day after extinction training, respectively. The freezing time of the Reinstatement group was higher than it was in the Extinction group and comparable to that of the Fear group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Brains were removed 90 min later and subjected to c-Fos immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The density of c-Fos<sup>+</sup> cells in the IL in the Reinstatement group was lower than it was in the Extinction group and comparable to that in the Fear group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), which was not affected by thresholding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Given that the IL inhibits the CeM partly through the ITC, the reduced IL activity could result in low ITC and high CeM activities. Consistent with this idea, the density of c-Fos<sup>+</sup> cells in the ventral ITC and CeM decreased and increased, respectively, in the Reinstatement group compared to the Extinction group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). There were no significant differences between the Extinction and Reinstatement groups in other sub-regions of the mPFC, amygdala, or hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Fear reinstatement can cause relapse after exposure therapy. Accordingly, we investigated the neural circuit mechanism of fear reinstatement. We found that a reminder shock decreased IL and ventral ITC activity and increased CeM activity as indexed by c-Fos expression. Reinstatement was accompanied by presynaptic depression of transmitter release onto IL neurons. Moreover, we found that a reminder shock activated IL-projecting dopaminergic neurons in the VTA, and the blocking of IL D1R signalling prevented reduction of synaptic inputs, activity changes of ventral ITC and CeM, as well as fear reinstatement. These findings suggest that a dopamine-dependent inactivation of extinction circuits underlies fear reinstatement.</p><p>We compared c-Fos expression induced by an exposure to the experimental context before and after a reminder shock (Extinction group and Reinstatement group) in order to identify brain regions involved in processing fear reinstatement. Activity mapping with c-Fos is a well-established and often used method to identify brain regions that are involved in processing motivation behaviour, social behaviour, learning and memory, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang and Kelley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tronel and Sara, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frankland et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Veening et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Makino et al., 2015</xref>). Other studies reporting that neuronal activation patterns detected by c-Fos expression and by functional magnetic resonance imaging correlate well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lazovic et al., 2005</xref>) also support the utility of c-Fos immunohistochemistry to determine changes in neuronal activity. It is important to note, however, that c-Fos expression is not the same as neuronal firing activity. Because c-Fos expression is dependent on an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lerea et al., 1992</xref>), firing activity does not always result in c-Fos elevation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clayton, 2000</xref>). Further studies using in vivo electrophysiological recordings (such as local field potential) are needed to directly reveal the neuronal firing activity during reinstatement.</p><p>We found a remarkable decrease in c-Fos expression followed by reinstatement in the IL but not in the PL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Both the IL and PL of the mPFC have important roles in fear regulation. The PL promotes fear responses. As indicated by our data and previous reports, neuronal activity of the PL, which is elevated during fear retrieval, is not elevated (or lowered) during extinction retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burgos-Robles et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sotres-Bayon et al., 2012</xref>). On the other hand, the IL increases its activity during extinction retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Milad and Quirk, 2002</xref>), suggesting the negative control of fear expression by the IL. In this study, we found that c-Fos expression in the Reinstatement group, compared with the Extinction group, was not changed in the PL, and it was lowered in the IL. Our findings suggest that fear reinstatement is regulated by downregulation of extinction circuits.</p><p>Low IL activity may cause ITC downregulation and CeM upregulation to reinstate fear. We found that reinstatement was accompanied by low IL and ventral ITC c-Fos expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Local injection of muscimol into the IL resulted in higher freezing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating that IL inactivation is sufficient for reappearance of extinguished fear. The IL has direct projections to the ITC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho et al., 2013</xref>), which is critically involved in fear extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Likhtik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Busti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mańko et al., 2011</xref>). The ITC provides feedforward inhibition of output neurons in the CeM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Royer et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, low activity of the IL and ITC could result in disinhibition of the CeM. Accordingly, we found that reinstatement was accompanied by elevated c-Fos expression in the CeM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The CeM projects to brain structures controlling conditioned fear responses, including the periaqueductal grey and the ventromedial and lateral hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hopkins and Holstege, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Veening et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cassell et al., 1986</xref>), and CeM activity is necessary and sufficient for expression of freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wilensky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ciocchi et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, disinhibition of the CeM by downregulation of IL–ITC pathway may underlie fear reinstatement. Another possible pathway is through the lateral subdivision of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeL), which also receives projections from the IL and contains two functionally distinct subpopulations of neurons (CEl<sub>on</sub> or somatostatin-expressing neurons, and CEl<sub>off</sub> or protein kinase C-δ-expressing neurons) forming local inhibitory circuits to inhibit CeM activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ciocchi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haubensak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Although we did not find a significant difference between the Extinction and Reinstatement groups in the CeL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), further analysis with a distinction between those two populations might reveal the activation of CEl<sub>on</sub> neurons, which suppress CEl<sub>off</sub> neurons and lead to disinhibition of the CeM.</p><p>Our results provide a novel insight into the prefrontal dopaminergic modulation of an aversive memory. Many studies have shown that dopamine neurons are activated in response to appetitive stimuli, and that dopamine signalling affects reward-related behaviour and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schultz, 1997</xref>). Although it has also been reported that aversive stimuli activate midbrain dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brischoux et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</xref>), the exact role of dopamine released in aversive situations is poorly understood. We found that reinstatement-inducing stimuli elevated c-Fos expression in the dopaminergic VTA neurons projecting to the IL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Moreover, blocking dopamine signalling in the IL prevented fear reinstatement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting the critical role of dopamine in reviving the aversive memory.</p><p>Further studies are required to identify how VTA dopaminergic neurons may be recruited by a reminder shock. Anatomically, VTA dopaminergic neurons that receive innervations from the lateral habenula preferentially project to the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lammel et al., 2012</xref>). The habenula receives input from limbic system and this circuit is implicated in aversive information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hikosaka, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Okamoto et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, it is possible that a reminder shock activates the habenula–VTA circuit and subsequent dopaminergic signalling in the IL.</p><p>We found that reinstatement was accompanied by dopamine D1R-dependent reduction of synaptic input in the IL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). mEPSC frequency was low and paired-pulse ratio was high in the IL neurons of the Reinstatement group, and IL D1R blockage reversed the low mEPSC frequency. An additional experiment using minimal stimulation would be helpful to examine changes in release probability upon fear reinstatement. Previous in vitro studies also revealed the inhibitory effects of prefrontal D1Rs by pharmacological and genetic manipulations. Dopamine attenuates excitatory synaptic transmission in prefrontal neurons in a D1R-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mair and Kauer, 2007</xref>). Application of dopamine, combined with electrical stimulation, can induce long-term synaptic depression in the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Law-Tho et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2004</xref>); however, the phenomenon is not observed in heterozygous D1R knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2004</xref>). The signalling mechanisms underlying dopamine-mediated presynaptic depression remain to be determined. One possible mechanism is that dopamine triggers adenosine release and subsequently activates presynaptic adenosine A1 receptors. D1Rs and adenosine-mediated presynaptic depression have also been reported in the VTA of guinea pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonci and Williams, 1996</xref>) and in the basal ganglia of zebra finches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The present findings suggest a possible dopaminergic mechanism of fear reinstatement as follows: a reminder shock activates VTA dopaminergic neurons projecting to the IL, and dopamine D1R signalling lowers IL activity with presynaptic depression, which could result in low activity of the ventral ITC, thereby disinhibiting CeM and reinstating a once extinguished fear. Previous studies have shown that drugs of abuse increase dopamine release in both animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Di Chiara and Imperato, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 1990</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laruelle et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Volkow et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Drevets et al., 2001</xref>).

For contextual fear conditioning, after a 150-s acclimation period in transparent rectangular conditioning chamber A (18 cm wide, 15 cm deep, 27 cm high) with white light and a stainless steel grid floor, 3 shocks (1 mA, 2 s) were delivered through a shock scrambler (SGS-003DX; Muromachi Kikai, Tokyo, Japan) with a 150-s interval between shocks. Mice were left in the chamber for an additional 60 s and then returned to their home cages. The entire duration of this session was 510 s. For extinction training and testing, mice were placed in chamber A without any shocks for 40 min and 5 min, respectively. A reminder shock (0.6 mA, 2 s) was given immediately after the mice were placed in white triangular chamber B (22 cm wide, 19 cm deep, 27 cm high) with red light and a stainless steel grid floor. The mice then returned to their home cages. Unless otherwise mentioned, testing sessions were 5 min.</p><p>Mice in the Fear group underwent contextual fear conditioning on Day 1 and testing on Day 2. Mice in the Extinction group underwent contextual fear conditioning on Day 1, extinction training on Day 2, and testing on Day 3. Mice in the Extinction group of the PPR experiment underwent contextual fear conditioning on Day 1, extinction training on Day 2, testing on Day 3, exposure to chamber B on Day 4, and testing in chamber A on Day 5. Mice in the Reinstatement group underwent contextual fear conditioning on Day 1, extinction training on Day 2, testing on Day 3, a reminder shock on Day 4, and testing on Day 5. Each session was video recorded for automatic scoring of freezing according to a previously described method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nomura and Matsuki, 2008</xref>). Freezing was defined as the absence of all movement except those related to breathing. Naive mice were kept in their home cages and were not exposed to the conditioning apparatus. The numbers of mice used in the c-Fos immunohistochemistry are as follows: (naive, Fear, Extinction, Reinstatement) = (9, 11, 11, 9) in PL and IL; (8, 10, 11, 8) in the lateral and basal nuclei of the amygdala, CeM and CeL; (8, 11, 11, 8) in dorsal ITC; (8, 11, 10, 8) in ventral ITC; and (8, 8, 9, 8) in CA1, CA2, CA3, and dentate gyrus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Immunohistochemistry and microscopy</title><p>Mice were perfused intracardially with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde 90 min after behavioural tests. Brains were removed and stored in the same fixative for 8 hr at 4°C and subsequently immersed in 20% and 30% sucrose for 24 hr and 48 hr at 4°C. The immunocytochemical staining was performed on 40-μm thick free-floating sections that were prepared using a cryostat (HM520; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).</p><p>For c-Fos staining with diaminobenzidine (DAB), the sections were incubated in 0.2% Triton-X-100 for 15 min and 0.03% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 30 min.

The sections were mounted on slides, air-dried, dehydrated in ethanol solutions and xylene, and cover slipped with marinol. Images of the mPFC (bregma 2.2 to 1.5 mm), amygdala (bregma −1.2 to −1.8 mm), and hippocampus (bregma −1.5 to −2.0 mm) were acquired using a microscope (Leica AF6000, 10× objective lens [NA, 0.3], Leica, Germany). All cell counting experiments were conducted blind to experimental group. The quantification of c-Fos-positive cells was performed with ImageJ software (Scion, Frederick, MD, United States). c-Fos immunoreactive cells were counted bilaterally using at least three sections for each area. Sub-regions of the mPFC, amygdala, and hippocampus were outlined as a region of interest (ROI) according to the Paxinos and Franklin atlas. c-Fos-positive nuclei were counted relative to a counting threshold based on staining intensity and target size. The parameters of the counting threshold were set based on a standard control slide from each staining run. The mean density in each structure for each animal was divided by the mean density in that region for the naive control group in order to generate a normalized density for each animal. These normalized data were expressed as a percentage, and these percentages were averaged across mice in order to produce the mean of each group.</p><p>For fluorescence immunohistochemistry, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies, including a polyclonal anti-c-Fos antibody (1:1000) and mouse anti-tyrosine hydroxylase antibody (MAB318, 1:500; Millipore, MA, United States), for 24 hr at 4°C, and secondary antibodies, including a goat anti-rabbit biotinylated antibody (BA-1000, 1:500; Vector Laboratories) and Alexa Fluor 405 goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (A31553, 1:400; Life Technologies, CA, United States) for 2 hr, VECTASTAIN ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories) for 1.5 hr, and TSA-Cyanine 3 (SAT704A001EA, 1:1000; Perkin–Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) for 1 hr.

Images of the VTA (bregma −2.9 to −3.4 mm) were acquired using a confocal microscope (CV1000, 40× objective lens (NA, 1.3); Yokogawa, Tokyo, Japan). All cell counting experiments were conducted blind to experimental group. The quantification of c-Fos-positive cells was performed with ImageJ software (Scion). CTB positive and TH and c-Fos immunoreactive cells were counted bilaterally using at least five sections (374 cells from 13 mice). The VTA were outlined as an ROI according to the Paxinos and Franklin atlas. The number of c-Fos-positive cells in the CTB<sup>+</sup> and TH<sup>+</sup> cells was calculated by thresholding c-Fos immunoreactivity above background levels.

Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed with glass microelectrodes (3–6 MΩ) filled with internal solution (120 K-gluconate, 5 KCl, 10 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 phosphocreatine-Na<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgATP, 0.1 Na<sub>2</sub>GTP, 0.2 ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, pH 7.2–7.3, 280–295 mOsm). For electrical stimulation, a pipette with a large tip (∼3 μm) was filled with ACSF and placed in layer 2/3. Brief current pulses (50 μs, 1–40 μA) were delivered with a stimulation-isolation unit (Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan). Paired stimuli were given with an interstimulus interval of 50 ms, and the ratio between the amplitude of the second and first EPSCs was calculated. mEPSCs were recorded at a holding potential of −70 mV in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 µM). mEPSCs were detected using an in-house MATLAB programme and were defined as inward currents with amplitudes greater than 7 pA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miura et al., 2012</xref>). To examine the intrinsic excitability, IL neurons were injected with 800-ms depolarizing current pulses ranging from 40 pA to 400 pA at 40-pA increments. The number of action potentials evoked by each current intensity was counted. The amplitude of fast afterhyperpolarization was calculated as the difference between the minimum potential after the second evoked spike within the 800-ms pulse and the spike threshold. To measure the medium afterhyperpolarization (mAHP), cells were held at −70 mV, and the 800-ms pulse, which evoked two action potentials, was injected. The amplitude of mAHP was calculated as the difference between the negative peak of the potential after the end of the 800-ms pulse and the resting membrane potential (−70 mV). To measure the voltage sag, a hyperpolarizing current pulse of 200 pA was injected in current-clamp mode. The voltage sag was calculated by subtracting the average steady-state voltage during a 100-ms period beginning 645 ms after the beginning of the hyperpolarizing step minus the peak of the hyperpolarization. Input resistance was calculated by current response to a 10-mV, 30-ms depolarizing pulse in voltage-clamp mode. Data were sampled at 20 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz using an Axopatch 700B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster, CA, United States), Digidata 1440A (Axon Instruments), and pClamp 10.2 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, United States). All data were acquired, stored, and analysed using Clampex 10, Clampfit, and MATLAB.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data analysis</title><p>All values are reported as mean ±SEM.

Indeed, both felt that this study contains some highly novel findings that should be published. However, they also felt that additional data analysis is needed and/or a better explanation on the methods used, to clarify how c-Fos cells were quantified in the infralimbic area (see individual responses for details below). Images on the quality of c-Fos labelling are required as well as information on the success of retrograde tracing of dopaminergic fibers. Reviewer 1 was questioning how reliable c-Fos labelling can be correlated with discharge activity and therefore asked for LFP recordings in the infralimbic cortex. If electrophysiological data are available then we would propose to include them in the existing manuscript. However, if they are not present than the authors should mention in the Discussion section of the manuscript the limits of the interpretation of c-Fos labelling data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>The manuscript by Hitora-Imamura et al examines the neuronal mechanisms underlying the reinstatement of fear by a combination of behavioral studies with c-Fos labeling and ex vivo electrophysiological recordings. They find that upon reinstatement of fear c-Fos labeling is reduced in the infralimbic cortex (IL) and the connected ITC but increased in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CEM), which is a key nucleus of fear expression. Ex vivo investigations show further that this behavior is accompanied by a reduced mEPSC frequency in Pyramidal cells (PCs) recorded in the IL and paired pulse depression of evoked EPSCs indicating. The authors argue that presynaptic depression in release probability may cause the reduced recruitment of IL pyramidal cells and thus underlie the observed reinstatement of fear. Finally, they find that c-Fos labeling is enhanced in the VTA, specifically in cells projecting to the IL as revealed by retrograde tracers, and show that infusion of a D1 receptor antagonist into IL reduces freezing in reinstatement test. Moreover, they observe in ex vivo whole cell recordings an enhanced mEPSC frequency and c-Fos labelling in PCs of the IL. Thus blocking D1 receptors may be an important mechanism for reinstating freezing.</p><p>1) The entire study is based on the interpretation of c-Fos labeling being enhanced upon enhanced discharge activity. Since c-Fos expression is Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent, I do have my doubts whether this is always the case and would like to see at least some electrophysiological evidence (if available) such as local field potential (LFP) recordings in the IL and VTA or CEM to support this interpretation. If true than we should see a reduced power of the LFP signal in the IL upon reinstatement and enhanced LFP power in the VTA and CEM. This experiment would be very helpful (if available) to support the interpretation of the presented c-Fos data. Alternatively, discuss possible difficulties in the correlation between c-Fos labeling and neuronal discharge activity.</p><p>2) I did not find information in the Materials and Methods section on how the % change in c-Fos labeled cells was quantified. This is critical because the results and the combined interpretations depend on this analysis. Did the authors count c-Fos positive cells in a given area of brain regions? What is the number of cells and slices in which cells were counted? A double blind approach would also be important. Labeling intensity can vary among slices as well as animals. Which thresholds have been defined and how are the data dependent on thresholding? Moreover, it would be important to show c-Fos labeling in the three brain regions in the manuscript (specifically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: I am surprised about the low number of recorded cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> is based on 8 recordings from 6 mice (1.3 recordings per mouse) for the reinstatement group and 8 neurons from 4 mice (2 recordings per mouse) in the control group. Do we indeed see in D and G only 6 and 5 data points, respectively? The data are highly significant considering the low number of recorded cells and moderate number of mice. However, in order to support the finding on changes in release probability upon reinstatement, further data on failures of transmission (1st EPSC vs 2nd EPSC) and the size of the 1st EPSC (minimal stimulation; control vs reinstatement group) would be helpful. Moreover, why did the authors not test the paired pulse ratio in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> upon blocking D1 receptors?</p><p>4) It remains unclear how VTA cells may be recruited during reinstatement of fear. Direct connections exist between the IL and the VTA but also other connections from the habenula may play a role. Thus, the Discussion should include a chapter in which possible circuit mechanisms in VTA recruitment during reinstatement should be discussed.</p><p>5) During fear, extinction activity in the prefrontal cortex is reduced. In a recent publication by Sotres-Bayon et al. (Neuron 2012) it was shown that upon fear, extinction activity of PCs in the medial prefrontal activity was reduced. It would be important to discuss whether the authors believe that these are the same or different PC populations controlling extinction and reinstatement of fear or different populations. This is therefore critical because the Title of the presented study states that ‘reinstatement of fear is regulated by down regulation of fear extinction circuits’ and proposes that this is the same circuitry. This was unclear from the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Overall, this is a nice set of experiments exploring the role of the infralimbic cortex in fear reinstatement. The integration of behavior, electrophysiology, and immunohistological data provide convincing evidence that IL suppression through D1 activity is necessary for reinstatement.</p><p>1) My primary concern is that there is insufficient methodological detail for the quantification of c-Fos<sup>+</sup> cells. How many sections per animal were used? Was any kind of unbiased stereology used to identify brain structure borders? Were cell counts averaged per animal? The numbers are expressed in the figures as % of naïve animals, but it is impossible to know what these numbers really mean without more information. Moreover, no micrographs are shown.</p><p>2) Additionally, it would be useful to know how successful the retrograde tracer was in labeling dopaminergic projections to the IL. Setting aside the question of c-Fos activation, what % of CTB<sup>+</sup> cells were also TH<sup>+fM</sup>?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08274.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer#1:</p><p><italic>1) The entire study is based on the interpretation of c-Fos labeling being enhanced upon enhanced discharge activity.

In accordance with the reviewer’s wishes, we have now added a paragraph in the Discussion section about technical limitation of c-Fos mapping as follows: “We compared c-Fos expression induced by an exposure to the experimental context before and after a reminder shock (Extinction group and Reinstatement group) in order to identify brain regions involved in processing fear reinstatement [...] Further studies using in vivo electrophysiological recordings (such as local field potential) are needed to directly reveal the neuronal firing activity during reinstatement.”. Also, we replaced the word “activation” and “activity” with “c-Fos expression” in the revised results.</p><p><italic>2) I did not find information in the Materials and Methods section on how the % change in c-Fos labeled cells was quantified.

Moreover, it would be important to show c-Fos labeling in the three brain regions in the manuscript (specifically in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>).</italic></p><p>We have added an explanation for c-Fos labeling to the Material and Method section (the subsection ‘Immunohistochemistry and microscopy’) as follows: “All cell counting experiments were conducted blind to experimental group. The quantification of c-Fos-positive cells was performed with ImageJ software (Scion, Frederick, MD). c-Fos immunoreactive cells were counted bilaterally using at least three sections for each area […] These normalized data were expressed as a percentage, and these percentages were averaged across mice in order to produce the mean of each group.” Additionally, we analyzed our data with a strict threshold and got similar pattern of c-Fos<sup>+</sup> expression as our previous analysis shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 C</xref> (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Also, we added representative images of c-Fos labeling in the IL, ITC and CeM in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>.</p><p><italic>3)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>: I am surprised about the low number of recorded cells.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2B</italic></xref> <italic>is based on 8 recordings from 6 mice (1.3 recordings per mouse) for the reinstatement group and 8 neurons from 4 mice (2 recordings per mouse) in the control group. Do we indeed see in D and G only 6 and 5 data points, respectively? The data are highly significant considering the low number of recorded cells and moderate number of mice. However, in order to support the finding on changes in release probability upon reinstatement, further data on failures of transmission (1st EPSC vs 2nd EPSC) and the size of the 1st EPSC (minimal stimulation; control vs reinstatement group) would be helpful. Moreover, why did the authors not test the paired pulse ratio in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref> <italic>upon blocking D1 receptors?</italic></p><p>The experimental procedure and freezing behavior of the Vehicle group in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> were almost comparable to those of the reinstatement group in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. Because the mEPSC frequency of the Vehicle group in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> was almost same as that of the reinstatement group in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, the low mEPSC frequency by fear reinstatement is highly reproducible. But, we added the discussion about minimal stimulation in the revised Discussion.</p><p>The numbers of data points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and G</xref> are 6 and 5, respectively.</p><p>The purpose of the experiment for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is to test whether activation of D1 receptors is involved in fear reinstatement and its associated changes. Because testing whether fear reinstatement is associated with presynaptic depression was done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the detailed analysis measuring the paired pulse ratio was not performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. But, we toned down the conclusion of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and described that D1R signaling in the IL is necessary for “reduction of synaptic inputs”, which was originally “presynaptic depression”.</p><p><italic>4) It remains unclear how VTA cells may be recruited during reinstatement of fear. Direct connections exists between the IL and the VTA but also other connections from the habenula may play a role. Thus, the Discussion should include a chapter in which possible circuit mechanisms in VTA recruitment during reinstatement should be discussed.</italic></p><p>We added a Discussion chapter about possible circuit mechanisms in VTA recruitment by a reminder shock as follows: “Further studies are required to identify how VTA dopaminergic neurons may be recruited by a reminder shock. Anatomically, VTA dopaminergic neurons that receive innervations from the lateral habenula preferentially project to the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lammel et al., 2012</xref>). The habenula receives input from limbic system and this circuit is implicated in aversive information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Okamoto et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hikosaka, 2010</xref>). Thus, it is possible that a reminder shock activates the habenula–VTA circuit and subsequent dopaminergic signalling in the IL.”</p><p><italic>5) During fear, extinction activity in the prefrontal cortex is reduced. In a recent publication by Sotres-Bayon et al. (Neuron 2012) it was shown that upon fear, extinction activity of PCs in the medial prefrontal activity was reduced. It would be important to discuss whether the authors believe that these are the same or different PC populations controlling extinction and reinstatement of fear or different populations. This is therefore critical because the Title of the presented study states that ‘reinstatement of fear is regulated by down regulation of fear extinction circuits’ and proposes that this is the same circuitry. This was unclear from the Discussion.</italic></p><p>According to the previous studies including Sotres-Bayon et al., the activity of prelimbic neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) decreases and the activity of infralimbic (IL) neurons in the PFC increases during fear extinction. Then, the IL has been proposed as a critical circuit for fear extinction. In the current study, we found that the decreased activity of IL neurons is associated with fear reinstatement. Therefore, we propose that fear reinstatement is regulated by down regulation of extinction circuits (that is the IL). We added to the Discussion as follows: “Low IL activity may cause ITC downregulation and CeM upregulation to reinstate fear […] The CeM projects to brain structures controlling conditioned fear responses, including the periaqueductal grey and the ventromedial and lateral hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hopkins and Holstege, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cassell et al., 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Veening et al., 1984</xref>), and CeM activity is necessary and sufficient for expression of freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ciocchi et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wilensky et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, disinhibition of the CeM by downregulation of IL–ITC pathway may underlie fear reinstatement.”</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>1) My primary concern is that there is insufficient methodological detail for the quantification of c-Fos</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> <italic>cells. How many sections per animal were used? Was any kind of unbiased stereology used to identify brain structure borders? Were cell counts averaged per animal? The numbers are expressed in the figures as % of naïve animals, but it is impossible to know what these numbers really mean without more information. Moreover, no micrographs are shown.</italic></p><p>We have added an explanation for c-Fos labeling to the Material and Methods section as follows: “All cell counting experiments were conducted blind to experimental group.
