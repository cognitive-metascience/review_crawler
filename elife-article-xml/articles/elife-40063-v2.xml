However, the mechanism of this export pathway remains unclear. Through a screen for suppressors of a <italic>secA2</italic> mutant, we identified a new player in the mycobacterial SecA2 pathway that we named SatS for <underline>S</underline>ec<underline>A</underline>2 (<underline>t</underline>wo) <underline>S</underline>uppressor. In <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, SatS is required for the export of a subset of SecA2 substrates and for growth in macrophages. We further identify a role for SatS as a protein export chaperone. SatS exhibits multiple properties of a chaperone, including the ability to bind to and protect substrates from aggregation. Our structural studies of SatS reveal a distinct combination of a new fold and hydrophobic grooves resembling preprotein-binding sites of the SecB chaperone. These results are significant in better defining a molecular pathway for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> pathogenesis and in expanding our appreciation of the diversity among chaperones and protein export systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic></kwd><kwd>secretion</kwd><kwd>chaperone</kwd><kwd>SecA2</kwd><kwd>Mce</kwd><kwd>SapM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI054540</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Brittany K</given-names></name><name><surname>Ligon</surname><given-names>Lauren S</given-names></name><name><surname>Rigel</surname><given-names>Nathan W</given-names></name><name><surname>Malik</surname><given-names>Seidu</given-names></name><name><surname>Braunstein</surname><given-names>Miriam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006808</institution-id><institution>University of North Carolina</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate School Disseration Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Brittany K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 AI135899</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Brittany K</given-names></name><name><surname>Braunstein</surname><given-names>Miriam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 AI095208</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>Ryan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A-0015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>Ryan</given-names></name><name><surname>Sacchettini</surname><given-names>James C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM055336</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anjuwon-Foster</surname><given-names>Brandon R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SatS of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> is a new protein export chaperone with a role in exporting proteins by the specialized SecA2 pathway and a role in intracellular growth in macrophages.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>With 1.7 million deaths from tuberculosis in 2016, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> continues to have a significant impact on world health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">World Health Organization, 2017</xref>). For <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> to cause disease, the bacillus must export effector proteins to the host-pathogen interface. These effectors enable <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> to grow in macrophages and avoid clearance by the host immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Awuh and Flo, 2017</xref>). At least some of these effectors are exported by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> via the specialized SecA2 export pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sullivan et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism of SecA2 export remains poorly understood. SecA2 is a paralog of the SecA ATPase of the general Sec protein export pathway. The general Sec pathway transports preproteins with N-terminal signal sequences across the inner membrane through a channel comprised of SecY, SecE and SecG proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brundage et al., 1990</xref>). Preproteins must be in an unfolded state to travel through the SecYEG channel and, in Gram-negative bacteria, the SecB chaperone binds a subset of preproteins to maintain them in an unfolded translocation competent state. Following export across the membrane, the signal sequence is cleaved and the mature protein is released (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsirigotaki et al., 2017</xref>). While all bacteria possess an essential Sec pathway that carries out the majority of protein export, only mycobacteria and a subset of Gram-positive bacteria possess specialized Sec export systems that are defined by a second SecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bensing et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miller et al., 2017</xref>). In these organisms, SecA1 is the name given to the canonical SecA and the specialized SecA is named SecA2. For the mycobacterial SecA2 system, the housekeeping SecYEG channel, and possibly SecA1, as well, are also involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ligon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Prabudiansyah et al., 2015</xref>). However, SecA1 and SecA2 are functionally distinct, as shown by their inability to compensate for the loss of one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braunstein et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rigel et al., 2009</xref>), and it remains unclear how SecA2 functions to export its relatively small and specific subset of proteins.</p><p>Here, we carried out a suppressor screen using a dominant negative <italic>secA2 K129R</italic> mutant of <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic>, a fast-growing model mycobacteria, as a means to identify new components of the mycobacterial SecA2 pathway. The K129R substitution is in the ATP binding site of SecA2, and past studies lead to a model where SecA2 K129R is defective for SecA2-dependent export but still able to interact with its normal binding partners that include SecYEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rigel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ligon et al., 2013</xref>). As a result, SecA2 K129R disrupts SecYEG channels at the membrane, which hinders both general Sec and specialized SecA2 export as evidenced by more severe phenotypes of <italic>secA2 K129R</italic> than a Δ<italic>secA2</italic> null mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ligon et al., 2013</xref>). A large collection of <italic>secA2 K129R</italic> suppressor mutations mapped to <italic>msmeg_1684</italic>, a gene of unknown function that we renamed <italic>satS</italic> for <underline>S</underline>ec<underline>A</underline>2 (<underline>t</underline>wo) <underline>S</underline>uppressor. SatS is also present in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and, remarkably, the <italic>M. tuberculosis satS</italic> gene is in an operon with the gene encoding SapM, which is a secreted phosphatase exported by the SecA2 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zulauf et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we demonstrated that SatS, which we revealed is required for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> growth in macrophages, functions in the export of SapM and an additional subset of the proteins exported by the SecA2 pathway. We further identified properties of SatS that indicate a function as a protein export chaperone that protects its substrates from inappropriate interactions in the cytoplasm and additionally assists in their export. Finally, we determined the structure of the C-domain of SatS (SatS<sub>C</sub>), which reveals a new fold lacking similarities to any solved chaperone structures, yet contains surface hydrophobic grooves resembling those of the SecB chaperone. The identification of SatS expands our understanding of SecA2 export in mycobacteria and provides another example of the diversity of molecular chaperones across biological systems.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>satS</italic> suppressors of <italic>secA2 K129R</italic></title><p>A <italic>secA2 K129R</italic> mutant of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> exhibits more exacerbated phenotypes (<italic>i.e.</italic> azide sensitivity and poor growth on Mueller-Hinton agar) than a Δ<italic>secA2</italic> deletion mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ligon et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Starting with cultures of ∆<italic>secA2</italic> expressing the <italic>secA2 K129R</italic> allele on an integrating plasmid (this strain is referred to as <italic>secA2 K129R</italic> from hereon), we collected spontaneous suppressor mutants that restored growth on Mueller-Hinton agar.

For future experiments, we also constructed a ∆<italic>satS</italic> mutant in a <italic>secA2</italic><sup>+</sup> background. The ∆<italic>satS</italic> mutant had no in vitro growth defect compared to wild-type <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> mc<sup>2</sup>155 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Deletion of <italic>satS</italic> suppressed the exacerbated phenotypes of <italic>secA2 K129R</italic>, and the suppression phenotype of Δ<italic>satS</italic> could be complemented by adding back a copy of <italic>satS</italic> from <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Complementation was also successful with the <italic>M. tuberculosis satS</italic> homolog <italic>rv3311</italic> indicating that SatS function is conserved in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Unlike wild-type SecA2, which is predominantly in the cytoplasm, the majority of SecA2 K129R is localized to the membrane-containing cell envelope fraction, consistent with SecA2 K129R being trapped in a non-functional complex with SecYEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rigel et al., 2009</xref>). We assessed the ability of ∆<italic>satS</italic> to suppress the mislocalization of SecA2 K129R using immunoblot analysis of envelope (cell wall and membrane) and soluble (cytoplasm) fractions with SecA2 antibodies. Total SecA2 K129R levels were unchanged in the ∆<italic>satS</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, the absence of SatS suppressed the aberrant localization of SecA2 K129R (<italic>i.e.</italic> in the ∆<italic>satS/secA2 K129R</italic> strain) such that SecA2 K129R was now primarily localized to the cytoplasm, similar to wild-type SecA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). We immunoblotted for the cell wall MspA porin and the cytoplasmic GroEL protein as fractionation controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). SecA2 K129R is also associated with reduced levels of SecY, which is a presumed mechanism to eliminate jammed SecA2 K129R-SecYEG channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ligon et al., 2013</xref>). When we immunoblotted fractions from the ∆<italic>satS/secA2 K129R</italic> strain with SecY antibodies, we observed that the absence of SatS suppressed the SecA2 K129R effect on SecY. Both the rescued localization of SecA2 K129R and SecY levels observed in the ∆<italic>satS</italic> mutant could be complemented by introduction of <italic>satS<sub>Msm</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E and F</xref>). These results indicate that SatS is required for SecA2 K129R retention at the membrane in non-productive complexes with SecYEG. By extension, these results suggest a role for SatS in the SecA2 export pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>SatS is required for export of the SecA2-dependent SapM phosphatase</title><p>In <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, the gene encoding SatS is immediately downstream of the gene encoding SapM.

Past studies lead to a model where SecA2 K129R is locked in a nonfunctional complex with SecY while attempting to export its substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ligon et al., 2013</xref>).

Our discovery that loss-of-function <italic>satS</italic> mutations suppress <italic>secA2 K129R</italic> phenotypes suggests that SatS is required for the detrimental interaction of SecA2 K129R with SecYEG to occur. In fact, deletion of <italic>satS</italic> significantly reversed SecA2 K129R retention at the membrane and the associated SecY degradation, which is consistent with avoidance of the interaction.

However, if SatS were to function this way, we would expect all SecA2-dependent substrates would require SatS for export, which was not the case. An alternate possibility is that in order for SecA2 to be delivered to or engage the SecYEG channel it must first be bound to a substrate in a translocation competent state and that SatS functions as a protein export chaperone that facilitates this SecA2-substrate interaction. We favor this role for SatS as it would not only help explain why phenotypes of <italic>secA2 K129R</italic> depend on the presence of SatS but it is also consistent with our identification of an interaction between SatS and SapM and the chaperone activities of SatS. However, a question raised by this model is how elimination of SatS suppresses <italic>secA2 K129R</italic> if there are also SatS-independent proteins that could interact with SecA2 K129R. The answer may be that the threshold for phenotypic suppression does not require all SecA2 K129R to be diverted from the SecYEG channel.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>SatS as a protein export chaperone</title><p>Molecular chaperones are defined by their ability to transiently bind unfolded regions of proteins and, thereby, protect them from inappropriate interactions, such as aggregation, incorrect/premature folding or degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ellis, 1997</xref>). Chaperones are a common component of protein export systems, with SecB of the general Sec pathway in Gram-negative bacteria and Type III Secretion System Chaperones (T3SCs) being examples. In mycobacteria, EspG proteins of Type VII Secretion Systems are the only protein export chaperones identified so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daleke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ekiert and Cox, 2014</xref>). As a subset of molecular chaperones, protein export chaperones have additional functions in export, such as targeting substrates to export machinery. Although there is a notable lack of amino acid and structural similarity between different types of protein export chaperones, commonalities exist. Protein export chaperones are all highly acidic (pI &lt;5.0) proteins that transiently interact with their substrates in the cytoplasm and remain in the cytoplasm when the substrate is exported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Randall and Hardy, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thomas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ekiert and Cox, 2014</xref>). Additionally, a hallmark of a protein export chaperone is that its role is limited to a subset of the proteins exported by a given system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collier et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thomas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daleke et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, in some cases, the genes encoding the chaperone and substrate are co-expressed and in an operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Parsot et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daleke et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>SatS has many features of a protein export chaperone. SatS is a highly acidic (pI 3.83), cytoplasmic protein with a role promoting export of a subset of the proteins exported by the SecA2 pathway. Further, the <italic>satS</italic> and <italic>sapM</italic> genes are co-transcribed in an operon and we obtained evidence of a SatS:SapM interaction occurring in mycobacteria. SatS preferentially interacted with the full-length preprotein of SapM indicating that the interaction occurs in the cytoplasm prior to SapM export. However, like other protein export chaperones (T3SCs, SecB, and EspG<sub>5</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stebbins and Galán, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ekiert and Cox, 2014</xref>) where binding occurs in regions of the mature domain of the substrate, the signal sequence was not required for the SatS-SapM interaction. The in vitro anti-aggregation effect of SatS on SapM preprotein provided the most direct proof of a SatS:SapM interaction and a chaperone function for SatS. Finally, in the absence of SatS, the level of SapM in the cytoplasm was dramatically reduced. This effect of SatS on intracellular SapM levels is post-translational and is also reminiscent of effects of T3SCs and EspG chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thomas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Korotkova et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In comparison to the dramatic reduction in intracellular SapM in the ∆<italic>satS</italic> mutant, the ∆<italic>secA2</italic> mutant exhibited only a modest effect on intracellular SapM levels. This difference in intracellular SapM levels translates to the more severe secretion defect of the ∆<italic>satS</italic> mutant versus the ∆<italic>secA2</italic> mutant. Export defects of mycobacterial ∆<italic>secA2</italic> mutants are never 100% (i.e. residual export is observed in ∆<italic>secA2</italic> mutants) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braunstein et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van der Woude et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feltcher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zulauf et al., 2018</xref>). The pathway responsible for the residual export in a ∆<italic>secA2</italic> mutant remains unknown although the general Sec pathway involving SecA1 is an attractive candidate. Thus, it is possible that SatS also works with SecA1 and the general Sec pathway, at least when SecA2 is absent. Moreover, we cannot rule out the possibility that there are SatS substrates that are exported in a completely SecA2-independent manner. Additional studies will be required to address these unknowns.</p><p>Because of the dramatically reduced levels of SapM in the whole cell lysate of the Δ<italic>satS</italic> mutant, it was not immediately clear if the role of SatS in SapM secretion was solely to maintain intracellular levels of SapM preprotein or if SatS had additional roles.

It is noteworthy that the SapM secretion defect of the <italic>satS G134D</italic> mutant was on the order of a ∆<italic>secA2</italic> mutant, which is consistent with SatS G134 working in the SecA2 pathway.

However, the primary sequence and secondary structure similarity between the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of SatS raise the possibility of SatS being comprised of tandem SatS<sub>C</sub>-like domains. Investigation of the SatS<sub>C</sub> structure revealed a large network of negatively charged amino acids surrounding two surface exposed hydrophobic grooves, which are similar in arrangement, shape and size to the hydrophobic client binding sites of a SecB monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). In the solution structure of SecB in complex with a preprotein, the unfolded preprotein wraps around the SecB tetramer through interactions with the hydrophobic client binding sites. This binding architecture helps explain the means by which SecB maintains Sec preproteins in an unfolded state, as is required for their transport through the SecYEG channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsirigotaki et al., 2017</xref>). The similarity in hydrophobic grooves in SatS and SecB is intriguing since SatS works with the SecA2 pathway, which also uses the SecYEG channel. Moreover, these similarities suggest that the hydrophobic grooves in SatS may serve as similar substrate binding sites. In fact, in the anti-aggregation assay the SatS<sub>C</sub> domain was sufficient for preventing SapM preprotein aggregation, indicating that SatS<sub>C</sub> is capable of directly interacting with SapM preprotein.

Given that only a subset of SecA2 substrates are affected by SatS, future studies should include investigation of SatS substrates and their contribution to pathogenesis. Since our approach for identifying SatS substrates was not exhaustive, there may also exist SatS-dependent proteins that remain to be identified.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>By way of a genetic screen in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>, we identified a new protein SatS with roles in protein export in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. This work not only expands our understanding of the specialized SecA2 protein export pathway of mycobacteria but it provides important functional information for a previously uncharacterized <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> protein that contributes to pathogenesis. Further, by assigning a chaperone function to SatS, our studies expand our appreciation of the diversity of chaperones in biological systems. Although chaperones have common functions, substantial structural diversity exists among these proteins, which is further highlighted by the new fold revealed in the structure of SatS<sub>C</sub>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides"

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The submission by Braunstein and colleagues describes an investigation of secretion through the specialized SecA2 translocation system in mycobacteria. Using a mutant with a K129R mutation in SecA2, the authors isolate suppressors of the growth defect in this strain that mapped to Msmeg_1684, with mutations in various regions of this gene. The authors annotate this gene as SatS and confirm that deletion thereof relieved defects of the <italic>secA2 K129R</italic> mutant. Using heterologous complementation experiments, the authors also confirm that the SatS proteins from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> are functionally interchangeable. Loss of SatS was able to correct mis-localization of the SecA2 K129R mutant protein, which was found predominantly in the soluble fraction in the SatS deletion mutant. Deletion of <italic>satS</italic> alleviated the SecY abundance defects in the SecA2 K129R mutant. Next, the authors delete <italic>satS</italic> in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and report a dramatic reduction in SapM secretion and, as SapM has phosphatase activity, reduced phosphatase activity in the culture filtrate of the mutant. Similar results were noted when the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> SapM was expressed in <italic>M. smegmatis.</italic> Following this, the authors confirm that Mce1, Mce1E and Mce4A-HA (but not PknG, PhoS1 or Msmeg1704-HA) required SatS for transport. The authors note that deletion of SatS resulted in reduced cytoplasmic levels of some proposed targets, suggesting that SatS post-translationally stabalizes its targets, possibly serving as an export chaperone. This hypothesis was supported by the demonstration that SatS co-precipitates with one of its targets, SapM; this interaction was not dependent on the signal sequence of SapM. Using a <italic>satS secA2</italic> double mutant, the authors confirm that SatS most likely stabilizes substrates before they are transported by the SecA2 translocon. With recombinant forms of SatS and SapM, the authors confirm that SatS prevented aggregation of SapM, much like a chaperone acting on its natural substrate. Structural analysis of the SatS C-terminal domain suggested a novel fold, with an electronegative charge, similar to other reported chaperones. Consistent with this, the C-terminal domain was sufficient to prevent aggregation of recombinant SapM. The authors further interrogate the role of the G143 residue in SatS and their observations suggest that SatS has more than one role in secretion of a select set of SecA2 substrates.</p><p>Key findings:</p><p>1) Deletion of SatS relieves growth defects of a SatS defective mutant and affects secretion of SapM;</p><p>2) Mce1, Mce1E and Mce4A-HA require SatS for transport;</p><p>3) SatS is able to associate with target proteins such as SapM and cause disaggregation in manner akin to chaperones;</p><p>4) Structural analysis of the SatS C-terminus revealed a hydrophobic core, much like other known secretion chaperones, despite having a more unique overall structure;</p><p>5) Collective findings identify SatS as a chaperone in mycobacteria that is able to associate with and stabilize its targets for secretion.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As a general comment, ensure that appropriate loading controls are included in all western blots. Also, quantification of all blots would provide a numeric value of secretion and allow for statistics. This should be done. The <italic>sapM</italic> mutant analysis of cell associated and secreted proteins should be combined into one figure. The loading controls in Figure 2 are irrelevant if there isn't a positive control. Later in Figure 4 the authors show the cell-associated proteins; all of these data should be combined from a single experiment (i.e., with the same cultures), examining cell associated and secreted proteins along with loading controls.</p><p>2) &quot;Virulence&quot; really can't be measured in an ex vivo macrophage assay and in the absence of in vivo data, refrain from using this term. The only conclusion that can be made is that bacterial growth is affected. Also, are all of the strains plasmid-transformed i.e. the wild type and mutant strains should have empty vectors to rule out plasmid effects for all of the reported assays, but in particular for the macrophage work? These controls must be included.</p><p>3) The authors neglect the SecA1 system in their interpretations throughout the manuscript. It appears that SatS could also be a chaperone for the SecA1 system and the substrates of SecA2, that the authors focused on, could also be substrates of SecA1. As the <italic>satS</italic> null strain is more defective than the <italic>secA2</italic> null strain in SapM and Mce secretion (Figure 2), does this mean that SatS functions as a chaperone for both SecA1 and SecA2 systems and SapM and Mce proteins are secreted by both? In the third paragraph of the subsection “SatS as a protein export chaperone”, the authors state that the lower protein levels of the substrates in the <italic>satS</italic> mutant compared to the <italic>secA2</italic> mutant explains why the <italic>satS</italic> mutant secretion defect was more dramatic than that of the <italic>secA2</italic> mutant. But if the substrates depend on the SecA2 system for secretion, shouldn't they not be secreted at all in the null? More careful exposition of these findings and appending conclusions would be useful.</p><p>4) The models proposed in the Discussion are not supported by the data presented. The authors argue against a role for SatS in general SecA2 functioning because they don't observe an effect of the <italic>satS</italic> null mutant on all SecA2 substrates. Instead, the authors favour a model where in order for SecA2 to be delivered or engage the SecYEG channel, it must first be bound to a substrate and SatS functions as a protein export chaperone that facilitates this SecA2-substrate interaction. If this is true, why can't the SatS-independent SecA2 substrates cause accumulation of the SecA2 K129R mutant in the membrane in the absence of SatS? Another possibility is that as a chaperone, SatS increases the protein stability of the SecA2 K129R mutant and the <italic>satS</italic> null results in an unstable SecA2 K129R protein that does not interfere with SecA1 system. The authors should show the western blots used to make the calculations in Figure 1D, which may address this possibility. This potential function of SatS may or may not be relevant when WT SecA2 is expressed. It is possible that the K129R mutation is causing the protein to be unfolded and targeting it to SatS.</p><p>5) Why doesn't complemented SatS mutant look like H37Rv in Figure 2A?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40063.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As a general comment, ensure that appropriate loading controls are included in all western blots.

A consistent finding in all published studies of <italic>secA2</italic> mutants across three mycobacterial species is that the export defects of <italic>secA2</italic> mutants is never 100% (i.e. in the absence of SecA2 some residual export occurs) (Braunstein et al., 2001; van der Woude et al., 2014; Feltcher et al., 2015; Zulauf et al., 2018). Although the pathway responsible for the residual export in a <italic>secA2</italic> mutant is unknown, SecA1/the general Sec pathway is the likely candidate. Thus, SatS may also work with SecA1. Furthermore, with our studies so far, we cannot rule out the possibility of there being substrates of SatS that are completely SecA2-independent. We modified the Discussion to cover these details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The models proposed in the Discussion are not supported by the data presented. The authors argue against a role for SatS in general SecA2 functioning because they don't observe an effect of the satS null mutant on all SecA2 substrates. Instead, the authors favour a model where in order for SecA2 to be delivered or engage the SecYEG channel, it must first be bound to a substrate and SatS functions as a protein export chaperone that facilitates this SecA2-substrate interaction. If this is true, why can't the SatS-independent SecA2 substrates cause accumulation of the SecA2 K129R mutant in the membrane in the absence of SatS? Another possibility is that as a chaperone, SatS increases the protein stability of the SecA2 K129R mutant and the satS null results in an unstable SecA2 K129R protein that does not interfere with SecA1 system. The authors should show the western blots used to make the calculations in Figure 1D, which may address this possibility. This potential function of SatS may or may not be relevant when WT SecA2 is expressed. It is possible that the K129R mutation is causing the protein to be unfolded and targeting it to SatS.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed the comments with the following actions:</p><p>– The reviewers raise a good point about our model for suppression by loss of <italic>satS</italic>. This question about our model is now addressed in the Discussion. We suspect the reason deleting <italic>satS</italic> is sufficient to suppress <italic>secA2 K129R</italic> phenotypes is that the threshold for phenotypic suppression does not require all SecA2 K129R to be diverted from the SecYEG channel.</p><p>– In response to the possibility raised of SatS increasing the protein stability of SecA2 K129R, we added the requested representative immunoblot to Figure 1D. This immunoblot demonstrated that SecA2 K129R levels are not affected by the presence or absence of SatS, which argues against this proposal for SatS acting as a chaperone that stabilizes SecA2 K129R. We also added text to the Results section indicating that the level of SecA2 K129R level was unchanged in a <italic>satS</italic> mutant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Why doesn't complemented SatS mutant look like H37Rv in Figure 2A?</p></disp-quote><p>Our SatS complementing plasmid used in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> only restored SatS levels to 26% of wild type levels, which likely accounts for the partial complementation observed. We added this SatS immunoblot data in Figure 2—figure supplement 3A and we now note the partial complementation in the Results section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
