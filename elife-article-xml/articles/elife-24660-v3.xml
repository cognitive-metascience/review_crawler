Notch signaling plays a key role during this process. Here, we report that Lunatic fringe (<italic>Lfng),</italic> a key modifier of the Notch receptor, is selectively expressed in NSCs. Further, Lfng in NSCs and Notch ligands Delta1 and Jagged1, expressed by their progeny, together influence NSC recruitment, cell cycle duration, and terminal fate. We propose a new model in which Lfng-mediated Notch signaling enables direct communication between a NSC and its descendants, so that progeny can send feedback signals to the ‘mother’ cell to modify its cell cycle status. Lfng-mediated Notch signaling appears to be a key factor governing NSC quiescence, division, and fate.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24660.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24660.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>neural stem cells</kwd><kwd>adult hippocampal neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>Notch signaling</kwd><kwd>mouse models</kwd><kwd>Lunatic fringe</kwd><kwd>Lineage tracing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP130573CPRIT</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maletic-Savatic</surname><given-names>Mirjana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54HD083092</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maletic-Savatic</surname><given-names>Mirjana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000097</institution-id><institution>National Center for Research Resources</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10RR024574</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maletic-Savatic</surname><given-names>Mirjana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI036211</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maletic-Savatic</surname><given-names>Mirjana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003645</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30CA125123</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maletic-Savatic</surname><given-names>Mirjana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In adult mouse hippocampus, neural stem cell and their progeny communicate via Lunatic Fringe mediated Notch signaling to regulate stem cell quiescence, division, and fate.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability of the hippocampal neurogenic niche to respond to ever-changing stimuli throughout the lifespan requires that it carefully maintain its finite stock of neural stem cells (NSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kuhn et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">1996</xref>). NSCs are the primary stem cells of the niche and are quite plastic in their responses: for example, social isolation seems to increase NSC self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dranovsky et al., 2011</xref>), whereas running stimulates neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">van Praag et al., 1999</xref>), and seizures prompt NSCs to transform directly into reactive astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sierra et al., 2015</xref>). Taking into account that nearly 80% of the newborn progeny of NSCs die by apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sierra et al., 2010</xref>), the neurogenic niche needs to ensure not only that it responds properly to stimuli but also that NSCs, once they are activated, are cycling enough to produce sufficient progeny.</p><p>One way to achieve this optimization would be for the progeny to somehow communicate their status back to the ancestor NSC.

In the fetal brain, Notch activity maintains embryonic NSCs in an undifferentiated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Louvi and Artavanis-Tsakonas, 2006</xref>) by suppressing pro-neural gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gaiano et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ishibashi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lütolf et al., 2002</xref>) and supporting progenitor survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Androutsellis-Theotokis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Louvi and Artavanis-Tsakonas, 2006</xref>). In the adult brain, Notch seems to influence quiescence, cycling, and exit of neuroprogenitors from the cell cycle, acting most likely in a cell-autonomous fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ables et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Basak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Breunig et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ehm et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ehret et al., 2015</xref>). Despite considerable advances in our understanding of Notch signaling, however, we do not know the precise cell-specific mechanism that might connect hippocampal NSCs and their progeny.</p><p>We hypothesized that, if Notch does facilitate communication between the mother NSC and its daughter cells, it might do so through the fringe proteins (Lunatic, Manic, Radical), which are known regulators of Notch signaling. Glycosylation of Notch receptors by fringe proteins affects the intracellular cleavage of the heterodimeric receptor complex and generation of the Notch1 Intra Cellular Domain (NICD) following ligand binding. Typically, NICD production increases upon binding by Delta-like (Dll) and decreases following Jagged1 (Jag1) binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">LeBon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stanley and Okajima, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang et al., 2005</xref>); differential Notch cleavage ensures varying expression of downstream cell cycle genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chapouton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Isomura and Kageyama, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nellemann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ninov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yoshiura et al., 2007</xref>). To examine whether fringe proteins are present in NSCs, we systematically queried existing expression databases, such as the Allen Brain Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lein et al., 2007</xref>) and GENSAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gong et al., 2003</xref>), and discovered that Lunatic fringe (<italic>Lfng</italic>) appears to be selectively expressed in adult hippocampal NSCs. We confirmed this observation using <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP mice and further demonstrated the potency of <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP-expressing cells using a newly-generated <italic>Lfng-</italic>CreER<sup>T2</sup> line for lineage tracing. The selective expression of <italic>Lfng</italic> in NSCs has enabled us to explicitly examine the role of Notch signaling in NSC regulation.

Spatially, <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP expression in the hippocampus was restricted to the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus, where neural stem and progenitor cells reside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Seri et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left panel). <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells closely resembled NSCs: their triangular soma was located in the SGZ, from which a single radial process extended orthogonally and spanned the granule cell layer, ending in fine arborizations within the molecular layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right panel).

In the double transgenic mice, all <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells co-expressed CFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), but only 7.4 ± 1.9% (mean ± SEM, N = 3) of the CFP-labeled ANPs contained eGFP. The eGFP<sup>+</sup> ANPs were in close proximity to dividing BrdU<sup>+</sup> NSCs and in all cases were in cytoplasmic connection with the mother NSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, left panel), which suggests that the asymmetric division had not yet finished. ANPs not cytoplasmically connected with the NSCs had little if any eGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, left panel).</p><p>We next examined how long it took newborn ANPs to clear eGFP, using BrdU pulse-and-chase labeling. eGFP was cleared from <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP<sup>+</sup> ANPs, but not from <italic>Nestin</italic>-GFP<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mignone et al., 2004</xref>) ANPs, between days 1 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, left graph). The clearance correlates with the half-life of GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corish and Tyler-Smith, 1999</xref>), suggesting that the eGFP in ANPs is likely from the protein retained by the first progeny of <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP<sup>+</sup> NSCs. Indeed, only 10% of Type 2a cells (Sox2<sup>+</sup> early ANPs) were eGFP<sup>+</sup> in <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP mice compared to almost 95% in <italic>Nestin</italic>-GFP mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, right graph). No Type 2b cells (late ANPs) expressed <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, right panel). Together, these data strongly suggest that most of the <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP<sup>+</sup> ANPs are the immediate progeny of NSCs that retained some eGFP due to sequestration of the protein during cell division. ANPs quickly lose eGFP, implying that <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP expression is selective for NSCs and that <italic>Lfng</italic> is active in NSCs but not in ANPs.</p><p><italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP was not detected in neuroblasts/immature neurons, granule cells, or astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In a minority of cases (0.8%) we observed the endothelial cell marker CD31 overlapping with <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This is not surprising, as endothelial tip cells express Lfng during tip-stalk cell selection after exposure to angiogenic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benedito et al., 2009</xref>). Further, we observed a few <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells, some co-labeled with GFAP<sup>+</sup> or S100β<sup>+</sup>, randomly distributed in the dentate gyrus (0.9%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The overall quantification of the cell-type expression of eGFP indicated that the majority of eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells in <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP mice were NSCs (81.7 ± 2.6%), while only 16.4 ± 1.5% were ANPs and 1.9 ± 1.1% were other cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

These data emphasize the specificity of <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP expression for adult hippocampal NSCs, compared to the low selectivity of <italic>Nestin</italic>-GFP expression for NSCs.</p><p>At any given time, the majority of NSCs is quiescent; only about 1–4% of them divide under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Encinas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Knobloch et al., 2014</xref>). This property enables them to escape treatment with cytostatic drugs, such as temozolomide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Knobloch et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, only 15.0 ± 3.0% of the eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells were lost in <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP mice following temozolomide treatment (N = 4, p=0.27), compared to 35.0 ± 4.0% in the <italic>Nestin</italic>-GFP mice (N = 4, p=0.0035). This suggests that the <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP<sup>+</sup> population consists mostly of quiescent NSCs, which we confirmed by independent quantification of NSCs and ANPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Further, if <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells are true NSCs, then both physical exercise and electroconvulsive shock (ECS) should activate them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lugert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Madsen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Segi-Nishida et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Suh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">van Praag et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Warner-Schmidt and Duman, 2006</xref>).

These data demonstrate that Lfng-expressing cells generate neurons and enable detailed studies of the neuronal lineage linked directly to a single NSC.</p><p>In addition to neuronal progeny, we also detected tdTomato<sup>+</sup> S100β<sup>+</sup> astrocytes in the granule cell layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, left panel) and tdTomato<sup>+</sup> Sox2<sup>+</sup> GFAP<sup>+</sup> astrocyte-like cells in the hilus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, right panel). These may represent either terminally differentiated NSCs or the progeny of <italic>Lfng</italic>-expressing NSCs; characterization of these cells is beyond the scope of this paper and will await future studies. Finally, as in the <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP mice, we found tdTomato<sup>+</sup> tip cells in <italic>Lfng</italic>-CreER<sup>T2</sup>; RCL-tdT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), further supporting the finding that the same regulatory elements control the expression of both eGFP and CreER<sup>T2</sup> in these two different mouse models.</p><p>Quantitative evaluation of the lineage of Lfng-expressing NSCs provided additional information on the progeny and differentiation timeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Initially, most of the population consisted of NSCs with some ANPs and astrocyte-like cells (GFAP<sup>+</sup>, S100β<sup>-</sup>). Over the course of 60 days, the contribution of NSCs to the population of tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells diminished because of the growing contribution of ANPs, immature neurons and granule cells. Interestingly, the population of ANPs and immature neurons remained stable from 15 days on, indicating a continuous replenishment of these cell types. The granule cell number steadily increased from 15 days on and represented about 30% of all tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells at 60 days following induction. Surprisingly, the number of astrocyte-like cells did not change over the course of 60 days, although there was one change: these cells were mostly GFAP<sup>+</sup>, S100β<sup>-</sup> between 1 and 15 days and mostly GFAP<sup>+</sup>, S100β<sup>+</sup> thereafter. It may be that there is a steady conversion of NSCs into astrocyte-like cells that is independent of neurogenesis. Finally, we occasionally detected other tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cell types (mostly tip cells and their descendant endothelial cells), which constituted 6.8 ± 1.8% of the population at 60 days. In summary, these data demonstrate that Lfng-expressing cells in the SGZ are NSCs, able to self-renew and produce both neuronal (majority) and astrocytic (minority) lineage in the adult dentate gyrus. Collectively, these data establish <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP and <italic>Lfng</italic>-CreER<sup>T2</sup> as novel mouse models enhancing the existing repertoire of tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Semerci and Maletic-Savatic, 2016</xref>). With these new mouse models, the field will be able to study the intrinsic properties of NSCs distinct from their progeny and gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of quiescence and lineage potential in the healthy brain, during aging, and in disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Notch pathway elements are present in the SGZ NSC niche</title><p>The selective expression of <italic>Lfng</italic> in adult SGZ NSCs raises the question about its functional role in these cells.

Namely, in the resting state, the Dll1-expressing granule cells surrounding the NSC would promote NSC quiescence, so only a few stimulated NSCs would undergo division rather than the whole population. Once the NSC starts to divide in response to a given stimulus, the local accumulation of the Jag1-expressing ANP progeny would gradually shift the balance of Notch signaling within the ‘mother’ NSC, eventually halting Notch signaling and leading the NSC to exit the cell cycle. This would be beneficial on two fronts: it would prevent the niche from becoming overwhelmed by the perpetual production of ANPs, and it would preserve the mother NSC from exhaustion as there is only a finite number of divisions it can endure.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Lfng preserves NSCs by controlling their cell cycle</title><p>We first postulated that <italic>Lfng</italic> functions to preserve NSCs in both resting and active states, saving them from excessive mitosis.

Many double-labeled NSCs were observed in the wild-type mice, only a few were detected in the <italic>Lfng</italic><sup>−/+</sup> mice at either timepoint, but none were found in i<italic>Lfng</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). <italic>Lfng</italic> thus not only affects the NSC cell cycle but is also critically important for NSC cell cycle re-entry. Lack of double labeling could be due to intermittent division or to a genuine exit from the cell cycle. As <italic>Lfng</italic><sup>−/+</sup> mice had a decreased ratio of CldU/Ki67 double labeled NSCs 7 days following CldU injection (N = 4; p=0.0105; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), these data strongly indicate that <italic>Lfng</italic> mutant NSCs either dilute BrdU by multiple divisions, die, or directly differentiate/ transform into another cell type over the course of seven days.</p><p>Thus, we examined the number of NSCs that retained BrdU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, left panel). In <italic>Lfng</italic> mutant mice, after a two-hour pulse, only 5.2% of the initial BrdU<sup>+</sup> NSC population retained BrdU after 7 days (N = 4 per timepoint, p=0.0003). In control mice, however, 92.4% of the initial BrdU<sup>+</sup> NSC population retained BrdU after 7 days (N = 4 per timepoint, p=0.38). Further, we observed fewer NSCs with multiple S-phase re-entry in <italic>Lfng</italic> mutant mice at both 3 and 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), arguing against BrdU dilution. To then rule out the possibility that NSC depletion is caused by a rise in apoptosis, we turned to the conditional i<italic>Lfng</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice and quantified the number of apoptotic cells. Both immunostaining for activated caspase-3 and the ApopTag assay, which detects DNA strand breaks, indicated that i<italic>Lfng</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> actually had fewer apoptotic cells than control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Most apoptotic cells in SGZ are ANPs and differentiating neuroblasts, with very few astrocytes or NSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Breunig et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sierra et al., 2010</xref>). Notch signaling in <italic>iLfng</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice is downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) and thus more apoptotic cells would be expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nakamura et al., 2000</xref>). The surprising decrease in the number of apoptotic cells could thus be due to the production of fewer ANPs in <italic>iLfng</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice.</p><p>To then determine the fate of the NSCs, we quantified tdTomato<sup>+</sup> NSCs (Sox2<sup>+</sup>, single radial GFAP<sup>+</sup> process), ANPs (Sox2<sup>+</sup>, GFAP<sup>-</sup>), and astrocyte-like cells (Sox2<sup>+</sup>, multiple GFAP<sup>+</sup> processes emerging from the cell body). We observed a declining trend in the number of mutant NSCs (p=0.8215; 0.11; 0.06 for 1, 7, and 30 days, respectively), and a significant decline in the number of mutant ANPs (p=0.2817; 0.0024; 0.0049 for 1, 7, and 30 days, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, middle panel). This is not surprising, as <italic>Lfng</italic> removal caused fewer NSCs to undergo multiple rounds of cell cycle, which could impede ANP production. Interestingly, we observed a notable increase in tdTomato<sup>+</sup> astrocyte-like cells at 7 and 30 days post-induction (p=0.0003 and p&lt;0.0001, respectively). This warranted further examination to ensure that these cells are the progeny of induced mutant NSCs: we quantified the BrdU-retaining astrocyte-like cells and found a greater number of these cells in <italic>Lfng</italic> mutant mice, but only at 7 days (N = 4 per group, p=0.0302; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, right panel). At 30 days, there was no difference compared to control mice (p=0.4412), suggesting that NSCs lacking <italic>Lfng</italic> differentiate more rapidly into astrocyte-like cells, depleting the NSC population more quickly.</p><p>In sum, in the absence of <italic>Lfng</italic>, many more NSCs divide at the population level compared to controls. <italic>Lfng</italic>-deficient NSCs also spend less time in the active state, produce fewer ANPs over time, and tend to differentiate into astrocyte-like cells more rapidly than controls, which depletes the NSC population prematurely. These effects appear to depend on the level of <italic>Lfng</italic>, as homozygous conditional knockout mice had more pronounced alterations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Notch ligands Jag1 and Dll1 preserve NSCs by opposing effects on their cell cycle</title><p>We then set out to examine the effects of Dll1 or Jag1 loss of function on NSC recruitment, proliferation (cycling and S-phase), cell cycle duration, and generation of their immediate progeny.

The increase in NICD1 expression in individual mutant NSC clones in i<italic>Jag1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice two weeks after induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) supports this notion, in agreement with the reported conditional overexpression of NICD1, which increases cell cycle re-entry of NSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Breunig et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Conversely, there was no difference in double-labeled NSCs between <italic>Dll1</italic><sup>−/+</sup> and wild-type mice at 3 days, but at 7 days no CldU/IdU double-positive cells could be detected, suggesting that NSCs did not re-enter cell cycle (N = 4 per group, p=0.9624 at 3d, p=0.0016 at 7d; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Thus, whereas the absence of <italic>Jag1</italic> causes NSCs to re-enter the cell cycle while maintaining their overall number, absence of <italic>Dll1</italic> reduces NSC re-entry and substantially decreases their population.</p><p>To then examine the progeny of NSCs, we compared the number of NSCs that retained BrdU (BrdU<sup>+</sup> Sox2<sup>+</sup> GFAP<sup>+</sup> NSCs) in <italic>Dll1</italic><sup>−/+</sup> and <italic>Jag1</italic><sup>−/+</sup> vs. wild-type mice. In the absence of <italic>Dll1</italic>, none of the BrdU<sup>+</sup> NSCs two hours following a single BrdU injection retained BrdU at 7 days (N = 4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). The number of Type 2a ANPs did not differ from controls, even though there was a declining trend accompanied by significantly decreased ANP Ki67<sup>+</sup> cluster size around the NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).

Thus, NSCs lacking <italic>Jag1</italic> may have undergone self-renewal. We then quantified the total number of tdTomato<sup>+</sup> NSCs and ANPs in i<italic>Jag1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> at 1, 7 and 30 days following induction. Initially, both control and mutant mice had a similar number of tdTomato<sup>+</sup> NSCs and ANPs, but this number markedly increased at both 7 and 30 days in mutant compared to control mice (N = 4 per group, p=0.0263 and p&lt;0.0001 for NSC at 7d and 30d, p=0.0033 and p=0.069 for ANP at 7d and 30d; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Interestingly, there was no difference in the number of tdTomato<sup>+</sup> NSCs between 7 and 30 days (N = 3–4, p=0.3903), whereas the number of tdTomato<sup>+</sup> ANPs dropped significantly. Removal of <italic>Jag1</italic> therefore might lead to an initial increase in the accumulation of NSCs, previously interpreted as an indicator of self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dranovsky et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, increased S-phase re-entry, observed in NSCs from both <italic>Jag1</italic><sup>−/+</sup> and i<italic>Jag1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), might also lead to increased production of ANPs. Indeed, both the number of Type 2a ANPs and the size of the ANP clusters were significantly greater in <italic>Jag1</italic><sup>−/+</sup> mice than controls (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).</bold> To determine whether apoptosis had any role in the increased number of ANPs in <italic>Jag1</italic> mutants, we quantified the number of apoptotic cells using activated caspase-3 staining and ApopTag. Both methods demonstrated a prominent decrease in the number of apoptotic cells in <italic>iJag1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we attempted to generate a double knockout of <italic>Dll1</italic> and <italic>Jag1,</italic> which would provide us with clues about the combinatorial effect of the lack of both ligands in the SGZ NSC niche. Mating the two constitutive lines did not succeed, most likely because of the lack of compensatory mechanisms in these two constitutive mutations during embryogenesis. As our data indicate that lack of <italic>Lfng</italic> or <italic>Dll1</italic> exhibit similar phenotypes with respect to NSC recruitment and cell cycle duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C,F,G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D,F</xref>), we generated a <italic>Lfng</italic><sup>−/+</sup>; <italic>Jag1</italic><sup>−/+</sup> double heterozygous constitutive knockout line and measured NSC number, short term (2 hr) BrdU incorporation and 1 week cell cycle re-entry (CldU<sup>+</sup>/IdU<sup>+</sup>) in 6 month old mice. <italic>Lfng</italic><sup>−/+</sup>; <italic>Jag1</italic><sup>−/+</sup> double knockout mice had far fewer NSCs than wild-type (N = 3 for Lfng<sup>−/+</sup>; Jag1<sup>−/+</sup> and N = 4 controls; p&lt;0.0001 for wild-type vs Lfng<sup>−/+</sup> and Lfng<sup>−/+</sup>; Jag1<sup>−/+</sup>), but did not differ significantly from <italic>Lfng</italic><sup>−/+</sup> mice (N = 3 for Lfng<sup>−/+</sup>, p=0.6869 for Lfng<sup>−/+</sup> vs Lfng<sup>−/+</sup>; Jag1<sup>−/+</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The double knockout showed a higher BrdU<sup>+</sup> NSC ratio than wild-type (N = 3; p=0.0001 for wild-type vs Lfng<sup>−/+</sup>, p=0.0003 for wild-type vs Lfng<sup>−/+</sup>; Jag1<sup>−/+</sup>, p=0.6724 for Lfng<sup>−/+</sup> vs Lfng<sup>−/+</sup>; Jag1<sup>−/+</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), similar to <italic>Lfng</italic><sup>−/+</sup> mice. This suggests that in both mouse models, the NSC population is exhausted by increased recruitment due to the lack of <italic>Lfng</italic>. Finally, we observed greater NSC cell cycle re-entry in double knockout mice (N = 3; p&lt;0.00001 for wild-type vs Lfng-/+; Jag1<sup>−/+</sup> and Lfng<sup>−/+</sup> vs Lfng<sup>−/+</sup>; Jag1<sup>−/+</sup>), suggesting that removal of <italic>Jag1</italic> can reverse the low cell cycle re-entry phenotype observed in the NSCs lacking <italic>Lfng</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Overall, these data verified that <italic>Lfng</italic> functions primarily in the recruitment of quiescent NSCs, whereas <italic>Jag1</italic> functions in the cycling NSCs.</p><p>Altogether, these data indicate that Notch ligands, Dll1 and Jag1, are important regulators of NSC recruitment, cell cycle duration and exit, and generation of NSC progeny. Lack of <italic>Dll1</italic> increases NSC recruitment, leading to overall larger proportion of dividing NSCs compared to controls, and causes dividing NSCs to be active for a shorter period of time —there is a tendency to produce fewer ANPs and the total number of NSCs falls dramatically following increased terminal astrocytic differentiation. This phenotype thus resembles premature exhaustion of NSCs. On the other hand, lack of <italic>Jag1</italic> does not affect NSC recruitment, as the proportion of dividing NSCs did not differ from controls. Those that were dividing were active for a longer period and had increased cell cycle re-entry, ultimately leading to greater ANP production and increased NSC self-renewal.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this paper, we demonstrate that <italic>Lfng</italic>, a known regulator of Notch signaling, is selectively expressed in adult NSCs, where it participates in their preservation by regulating their cycling. In addition, we provide evidence that distinct modes of Notch signaling from NSC derivatives expressing Jag1 and Dll1 ligands, most likely mediated by Lfng, directly affect the NSC cell cycle. The differential effects of NSC progeny on the ancestor cell could be the key for preserving NSCs and thus neurogenesis throughout life.</p><p>These data lead us to propose a model in which Notch signaling provides direct communication between the NSC and its descendants, such that the progeny send feedback signals to the mother cell to modify its cell cycle status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). <italic>Lfng</italic> is central to this model, as it enables NSCs to distinguish between Dll1-expressing granule cells and Jag1-expressing ANPs. In the Notch signal-receiving NSC, Lfng glycosylation of the Notch receptor potentiates Notch signaling from Dll1 and attenuates signaling from Jag1: even though Lfng glycosylation of Notch does not affect Jag1 binding, the NICD is not cleaved from the Jag1-Notch complex. Consequently, Notch signaling decreases. In our model, the resting NSC is surrounded by mostly Dll-expressing granule cells. Thus, most Notch receptors are saturated with Dll1, which induces proteolytic cleavage and boosts the release of NICD in the NSC. The NICD is transported to the nucleus, where it activates a set of genes that ultimately maintain the NSC in a quiescent state with the potential to enter cell cycle if needed. Lfng-mediated Dll1-Notch signaling thus keeps majority of the NSCs in the quiescent state, protecting them from random activation and division.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24660.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for Lfng-mediated regulation of NSC maintenance by progeny.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In the resting state, Lfng-expressing NSC (green) is surrounded mostly by Delta1 (Dll)-expressing granule cells (GC, grey). Dll1 binds to the Lfng-modified Notch receptor on the NSC, which boosts Dll1-mediated Notch signaling by producing more NICDs and the NSC is kept quiescent but ready to undergo cell cycle if stimulated. Once activated, NSC (red) starts to produce ANPs. The first progeny (Type 2a, small dark yellow cells) do not express Notch ligands and the NSC continues to divide. As ANPs mature into late ANPs (Type 2b, yellow cells), they start to express Jag1. Jag1 binding to the Lfng-modified Notch receptor on the NSC does not generate NICD and thus the Notch signaling strength in the ‘mother’ NSC decreases. Eventually, the NSC is surrounded by mostly Jag1-expressing ANPs, and it exits active state (green NSC). Thus, in the resting state, the granule cell progeny prevents overt activation of NSCs, while in the active state, the ANP progeny prevents overt division of the NSC. These feedback signaling from the progeny both act to preserve the NSC population and the integrity of the niche.

Mice lacking <italic>Lfng</italic> and <italic>Dll1</italic> have similar phenotypes: NSCs are recruited in bulk, they divide less and faster, and eventually lead to depletion of NSC population. In Lfng mutant mice, there is an increased transformation into astrocytes (blue). Mice lacking <italic>Jag1</italic> have the opposite phenotype: while NSCs are activated as in the wild-type, they divide more and longer, and produce large clusters of ANPs as well as self-renew.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24660.013">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24660.013</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-24660-fig7-v3"/></fig></p><p>Once a NSC is stimulated to divide (active state), it starts to produce ANPs. The first progeny (Type 2a) do not express Notch ligands and the NSC continues to actively divide. As ANPs mature into late ANPs (Type 2b), they start to express Jag1. Jag1 binding to the Lfng-modified Notch on NSC does not generate NICD, so the local accumulation of Jag1-expressing ANP progeny around the mother NSC gradually lowers the levels of NICD within the NSC and decreases Notch signaling, eventually causing NSC to stop dividing because it is surrounded by progeny. This signaling thus preserves both the spatially-enclosed SGZ niche from an overwhelming number of newborn cells and the NSC itself from over-dividing. Note that our model describes preservation of the NSCs in two contexts: in the resting state, Lfng-boosted Dll1-mediated Notch signaling preserves the NSCs at the population level (i.e., prevents global NSC activation to undergo division), while in the context of active division, Jag1-mediated inhibition of Notch signaling preserves the NSC on the single-cell level (prevents its perpetual division). Therefore, Lfng-mediated Notch signaling could be the key for preserving NSCs in both resting and active states.</p><p>Our model is supported by our data on the outcomes of <italic>Lfng, Dll1</italic> and <italic>Jag1</italic> loss-of-function with respect to the NSC number, cell cycle properties, NICD1 intensity, and fate. Lack of <italic>Lfng</italic> reduced NICD1 expression in NSCs and induced many more NSCs to divide at the population level; they spend less time in the active state, produce fewer ANPs and tend to differentiate into astrocyte-like cells, eventually depleting the NSC population. Similar observations were made when Notch signaling in NSCs was inhibited by targeting different components of the pathway. Removal of either Notch1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ables et al., 2010</xref>) or Rbpj-κ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ehm et al., 2010</xref>) caused the depletion of NSCs, which was attributed either to a failure of NSC self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ables et al., 2010</xref>) or to an initial burst in the number of proliferating NSCs followed by their depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ehm et al., 2010</xref>). The deletion of Rbpj-κ caused a more robust and faster decrease in the NSC population compared to the removal of Notch1, possibly due to different mechanisms of Rbpj-k and Notch1 signaling. Namely, Rbpj-κ is required not only for Notch1-mediated signaling, but also Notch signaling through other receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersson et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, deletion of Rbpj-κ might cause a more severe depletion of NSCs as they could not remain quiescent. On the other hand, at least in the subventricular zone Notch1 seems to be required for the actively dividing NSCs but not when they are in the quiescent phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Basak et al., 2012</xref>); thus, deletion of Notch1 affects only a subpopulation of NSCs.</p><p>Our data in <italic>Lfng</italic> mutants resemble both models, suggesting that <italic>Lfng</italic> mediates signaling in both quiescent NSCs (similarly to the Rbpj-k) and active NSCs (similarly to Notch1). Both modes of <italic>Lfng</italic>-mediated action led to multiple rounds of NSC division, which, based on the literature, could be followed by either a return to quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonaguidi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lugert et al., 2010</xref>) or a terminal differentiation into astrocyte-like cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Encinas et al., 2011</xref>). Removal of <italic>Lfng</italic> both diminishes the intensity of Dll-Notch signaling and augments the production of NICD following Jag-Notch binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benedito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">LeBon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stanley and Okajima, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang et al., 2005</xref>). The diminished Dll-Notch signaling causes more quiescent NSCs to be recruited; once they start to produce Jag1-expressing ANPs, NSCs lacking <italic>Lfng</italic> will continue to be exposed to Notch signaling, which might lead to gliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Breunig et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chambers et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Imayoshi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tanigaki et al., 2001</xref>). Notably, we observed a greater number of astrocyte-like cells in <italic>Lfng</italic> mutants, not increased apoptosis. Indeed, the number of apoptotic cells in the <italic>Lfng</italic> mutant mice was diminished, most likely due to production of fewer ANPs.</p><p>As the Lfng-modified Notch receptor enables the cell to distinguish between Dll1 and Jag1 ligands to activate differential downstream targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chapouton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Isomura and Kageyama, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nellemann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ninov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yoshiura et al., 2007</xref>), it is not surprising that Dll1 and Jag1 have opposing effects on NSC biology. Absence of <italic>Dll1</italic> caused a greater proportion of NSCs to undergo division and accelerated their exit from the active state, leading to differentiation into astrocytes and premature exhaustion of the NSC population. On the other hand, absence of <italic>Jag1</italic> exerted its effect on the active NSC population rather than the quiescent one. We base this claim on the following: (i) the total NSC populations in <italic>Jag1</italic><sup>−/+</sup> and wild-type mice did not differ, so the quiescent NSCs were not exhausted because of increased recruitment; (ii) the two-hour BrdU incorporation rate was slightly greater in NSCs lacking <italic>Jag1</italic> compared to controls. On the other hand, there was a significant increase in the proportion of BrdU<sup>+</sup> NSCs in i<italic>Jag1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice compared to controls. This may be due to the dosage difference between the homozygous conditional and heterozygous constitutive <italic>Jag1</italic> knockout mice, which might result in an increase in the actively dividing NSC population rather than increased recruitment of NSCs from the quiescent pool. The extended cycling of NSCs agrees with previously reported extended cycling of NSCs that overexpress NICD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Breunig et al., 2007</xref>); indeed, NICD1 expression is higher in i<italic>Jag1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> NSCs. Thus, removal of <italic>Jag1</italic> lowers the chance of NSC to stop dividing via sustaining the Notch signaling intensity, which suggests that Jag1 expressed on the ANP progeny is able to send feedback signals to the ancestor NSC and downregulate its Notch signaling. In addition, our data suggest that in the absence of <italic>Jag1</italic>, NSCs undergo self-renewal in addition to producing large amounts of ANPs. Intuitively, more ANPs should give rise to more new neurons, but conditional ablation of <italic>Jag1</italic> has been shown to cause aberrant neuronal lineage formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lavado and Oliver, 2014</xref>); an increase in the number of ANPs should therefore be interpreted cautiously with respect to neurogenesis. Nevertheless, increased self-renewal with no significant rise in neuronal population has been observed in social isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dranovsky et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, it will be interesting to further investigate the mechanisms that mediate self-renewal in the future, as these processes might be exploited for targeted manipulation of NSCs.</p><p>Altogether, our data represent a substantial advance in our understanding of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, with critical implications for the preservation of adult NSCs. Namely, Lfng in NSCs along with Dll1 and Jag1 ligands in the progeny are an important part of the regulatory machinery that governs NSC maintenance, controlling their recruitment (preventing global activation), division (both the number and the termination of active state) and terminal fate (preventing over-transformation into astrocyte-like cells), both in physiological and pathological states associated with the NSC impairment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Experiments were performed using the following mice: <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MMRRC_015881-UCD">MMRRC_015881-UCD</ext-link>) mice obtained from GENSAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gong et al., 2003</xref>).

Each set contained 13–14 sections 250 μm apart from each other. Previously described modified optical dissector method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Encinas and Enikolopov, 2008</xref>) was used for unbiased quantification of absolute number of different cell types in the whole brain. Briefly, an observer blind to experimental groups counted immunoreactive cells that had the aforementioned markers and morphological properties in every fifth sagittal section throughout the dentate gyrus. NSCs were identified as cells with triangular cell body in the SGZ, a GFAP<sup>+</sup> radial process originating from a Sox2<sup>+</sup> nuclei in SGZ and spanning through granule cell layer in mice without the fluorescence reporter (C57BL/6, <italic>Lfng</italic><sup>−/+</sup>, <italic>Jag1</italic><sup>−/+</sup>, <italic>Dll1</italic><sup>−/+</sup>, tdTomato<sup>-</sup> clones in i<italic>Lfng</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>, i<italic>Jag1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>, and <italic>Lfng-</italic>CreER<sup>T2</sup>; RCL-tdT control mice). In mice with a fluorescence reporter (<italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP, <italic>Nestin</italic>-GFP, and tdTomato<sup>+</sup> clones in i<italic>Lfng</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>, i<italic>Jag1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>, and <italic>Lfng-</italic>CreER<sup>T2</sup>; RCL-tdT control mice), a triangular cell body located in the SGZ and a terminal ending with fine arborizations in granule cell layer-molecular layer boundary was also included as the criteria for NSC identification. Type2a and Type2b cells were identified as GFAP<sup>-</sup> Dcx<sup>-</sup> Sox2<sup>+</sup> or Tbr2<sup>+</sup>, respectively, round cells in the SGZ without a process cells. Neuroblasts and immature neurons were identified as Dcx<sup>+</sup> cells with single or multiple processes. Granule cells were identified as NeuN<sup>+</sup> cells with prominent dendritic arborizations. Astrocytes were identified as S100β<sup>+</sup> cells with stellar morphology. Astrocyte-like cells in i<italic>Lfng</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice were identified GFAP<sup>+</sup> S100β<sup>-</sup> cells with stellar morphology and multiple processes.</p><p>For quantification that required analysis of the phenotypic morphology and/or overlap of multiple markers (including BrdU, CldU, IdU, and Ki67), 20 µm thick optical sections were scanned with confocal microscope (Leica SP5, Leica SP8 or a Zeiss LSM 710). Three-dimensional reconstructions and orthogonal views were obtained using Zen 2012 SP1 software (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) or LAS AF Lite (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). Cells that were located in the uppermost focal plane were excluded from the quantification to avoid overestimation. Total counts from 13 to 14 sections were multiplied by five for the total number of cells of interest in one hemisphere and then by two to get the total number of cells for both dentate gyri. The proportion of BrdU, CldU, IdU, and Ki67 positive cells among a certain cell type was calculated by dividing the total number of positive cells to previously calculated number of total cells of a particular genotype or to the total number of tdTomato<sup>+</sup> clones of a particular cell type in lineage analysis.</p><p>Clusters were defined as groups of Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells located around the NSC, where individual cells were separated by 20 µm from their nearest neighbor. Cells beyond this limit were counted as separate clusters. Clusters were counted in every fifth section of the dentate gyrus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Quantification of NICD1 signal</title><p>Following NICD1 immunofluorescence staining, multiple sections from each genotype were imaged (N = 3 for 2 weeks post TMX injection in i<italic>Jag1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> and N = 4 for control and i<italic>Lfng</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice). 5 µm thick Z-stacks images from both CA1 region and a viewpoint that covers the whole SGZ region of the section were scanned with 2048 × 2048 pixel resolution (Zeiss710 LSM confocal microscope). Maximum intensity projections were converted to Tiff images in ZEN 2012 SP1-black edition 64 bit (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Regions of interest for individual NSCs (at least 20 cells per section) were drawn around in the tdTomato<sup>+</sup> NSC cell body located in the SGZ. Regions of interest in the whole SGZ were drawn as 15 µm thick stripes covering the whole SGZ in the section. To compensate the section-to-section differences due to staining irregularities, NICD1 immunofluorescence intensity of neurons in CA1 region (where <italic>Lfng</italic>-CreERT2 is not active) was used as control (75 µm X 50 µm rectangle). Blue channel fluorescence intensities (corresponding to Cy5 signal in TSA amplified NICD1 immunostaining) were measured by Histo tool in ZEN lite 2012-blue edition and intensities were normalized according to CA1 measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Quantification of venus/NICD1 signal overlap</title><p>Following NICD1 immunofluorescence staining, two different sections from CBF:H2b-Venus animals (N = 3) were imaged. 15 µm thick Z-stacks images with 2048x2048 pixel resolution were scanned with Zeiss710 LSM confocal microscope. At least 200 cells were counted from SGZ and GZ of each section to evaluate the overlap between Venus and NICD1 signals in the same cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Detection of apoptotic cells</title><p>For activated caspase-3 staining, paraffin embedded sections (8 µm thick) from control, i<italic>Lfng</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>, and i<italic>Jag1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> animals two weeks post TMX injection were treated with antigen retrieval solution (Tris-EDTA pH 9.0), followed by primary antibody treatment (anti act-casp3 antibody; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and DAB staining (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Due to high yield clearance of apoptotic cells from SGZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abiega et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sierra et al., 2010</xref>), we also used ApopTag Peroxidase in situ apoptosis detection kit (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA).

Diphtheria Toxin from Corynebacterium diphtheriae (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, 16 µg/kg in PBS) was administered as four intraperitoneal injections. Tamoxifen (200 mg suspended in 10 ml of 1:9 ethanol:corn oil mixture) solution was administered either at high (200 mg/kg) or low (120 mg/kg) dose.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;Hippocampal neural stem cells selectively express lunatic fringe&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your full submission has been evaluated by a Senior Editor a Reviewing Editor and three peer reviewers, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. We regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication.</p><p>There are a number of major issues raised by your reviewers and the editors handling your manuscript, but two key issues stand out: 1) the lack of lineage tracing of Lfng<sup>+</sup> cells to demonstrate that these marked cells give rise to neurons in vivo and 2) the lack of substantial mechanistic insights as to how Lfng affects neurogenesis of hippocampal stem cells. As such, although the expression patterns of Lfng<sup>+</sup> are provocative and this will no doubt be of interest to stem cell biologists, the critical evidence necessary to make a case for <italic>eLife</italic> is missing. Although the decision of <italic>eLife</italic> is not to publish, you may want to consider in revising your submission elsewhere that two of your reviewers found the writing difficult to read and confusing in parts.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this study the authors characterize the expression of Lunatic Fringe (Lfng) as a neural stem cells (NSCs) marker. In particular, they create a new transgenic mouse strain harboring the GFP under the control of the Lfng promoter and compare the Lfng-GFP expression with another well-established NSC reporter Nestin-GFP. They claim that, compared to Nestin-GFP, Lfng is a more specific marker for the quiescent NSC typeI. They phenotypically characterized the Lfng positive cells for other NSCs markers and demonstrate that Lfng is specifically expressed in the quiescent NSCs, being loss in the transition to amplifying neural progenitors (ANP) and derivatives. Moreover, by crossing the Lfng reporter with a Lfng knockout mouse they demonstrate that Lfng has an important role in the NSCs biology by preserving the NSCs population by restraining their proliferation. The general purpose of the study seems to be the creation and validation of a new NSCs marker useful for further studies. However, the authors present here some data about the specific role of this gene in the physiology and behavior of the NSCs.</p><p>The authors identified and counted different cell types such as NSCs and ANPs based only on cell morphology. This is an imperfect assay to discriminate the two population, the authors should include markers analysis such as Tbr2 for ANPs.</p><p>The in vitro characterization of Lfng-GFP cells should be improved. The authors isolate the GFP positive cells from Lfng-GFP mice and place them in neurosphere culture. The neurospheres lost the expression of the GFP and the authors claim that this is because the neurospheres are populated with progenitors. The authors must substantiate this claim with specific markers. Moreover, the Lfng-derived neurospheres should be analyzed for other stem cells marker expression, self-renewal and differentiation capacity. A full demonstration that these cells are NSCs is central and still needed.</p><p>In the BrdU assay described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref> is unclear how the authors determined and counted the different cell subpopulation.</p><p>The authors argue that Lfng has a role in the stem cells pool maintenance by regulating stem cells quiescence. But, at face value (see Figure.7D-E), the data show that, 1) endogenous LNFR is required to inhibits proliferation as measured by BrdU (at least on this putative NCS population above identified); 2) to promote proliferation as measured by Ki67 (in absolute terms); 3) to sustain NSC, that decline in the KOs (a data perhaps at odd with point 1); iii) to promotes differentiation. They comment that “elevated proportion of proliferating NSCs in Lfng<sup>-/+</sup> mice did not lead to increased number of INs, as one may expect. Rather, the total number of INs highly correlated with the absolute number of NSCs (R=0.9948) and not the total number of proliferating NSCs.” (before Discussion).</p><p>I find this very confusing. And the following conclusion is, in my opinion, a stretched interpretation of a complex set of data: …“Together, these data indicate that loss of Lfng causes impaired NSC maintenance due to increased proliferation rates of NSCs, which over time result in decreased number of newborn cells and the phenotype indicative of premature exhaustion of neurogenesis.”…</p><p>The authors never considered other interpretations, such as cell death (by various means), transition to different cell types other than those here studied. At the very least the conclusion should be changed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, Semerci et al. reported the identification of Lunatic Fringe (Lfng) as an adult hippocampal neural stem cell (NSC) marker. The authors carefully characterized Lfng-eGFP cells, and compared and contrasted them with Nestin-eGFP cells. Furthermore, the authors took advantage of Lfng knockout mice to demonstrate that Lfng is required to maintain adult hippocampal NSCs. The logic of the study is clear and straightforward. The data is convincing.</p><p>I have the following comments:</p><p>1) The study focused on adult hippocampal NSCs. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>, the authors showed that Lfng-eGFP cells are present in SVZ. It is unclear whether Lfng plays a similar role in other adult NSCs, i.e. SVZ NSCs. The author should clarify this.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the authors presented the evidence that Lfng-eGFP is expressed selectively in NSCs. It would be important to provide quantitative analysis for these experiments. Does Lfng-eGFP label all NSCs or a subpopulation? In addition, it appears that Lfng-eGFP cells include both NSCs with a triangular shape cell body and a radial process and ANPs with horizontal processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Based on the examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I, J</xref>, the authors concluded that the eGFP+ ANPs are newborn with residual eGFP. How representative are these examples? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, it appears the vast majority of Nestin-CFP cells express some Lfng-eGFP.</p><p>3) Related to the previous comment, how does Lfng-eGFP compare with Hes5-eGFP, which preferentially labels a subset of NSCs and ANPs? The authors may want to discuss about this.</p><p>4) In the Abstract, the authors wrote &quot;NSCs are dispensable.&quot; Does this mean for viability?</p><p>5) It is somewhat confusing who made Lfng-eGFPTg mice, authors or GENSAT? In the main text of the manuscript, it says that the authors made the mice, but in the Materials and methods it says that it was from GENSAT.</p><p>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, it is hard to see any neurospheres. A better image should be provided.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This paper proposes to have identified a new marker (lunatic fringe – Lfng) for neural stem cells in the sub granular zone of the dentate gyrus. While localization and morphology place Lfng in the right place at the right time and evidence is provided that Lfng cells can divide, critical evidence that their progeny give rise to neurons is lacking. In general, the paper is poorly written and there is virtually no information on the mechanism by which Lfng might affect neurogenesis of hippocampal stem cells.</p><p>The so-called bioinformatics approach does not involve any new datasets. Rather the authors simply queried published gene expression databases such as Allen and GENSAT, which provides detailed gene expression data at cellular resolution. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (supplemental?) are not publishable as they are available on the Gensat website.</p><p>There are many crucial experiments lacking in this paper, most notably a genetic lineage trace to show that Lfng positive cells give rise to neurons. What is provided is that Lfng<sup>+</sup> cells can divide (BrdU) and that cells that have undergone division (BrdU<sup>+</sup>) can give rise to neurons. Another issue that is not addressed is the timing of expression of Lfng<sup>+</sup> cells – the authors only show the timing of EGFP, which is likely very different than the timing of LFNG, given the perdurance of EGFP. The neurosphere experiments are concerning for many reasons, there is no indication of the efficiency of purification and since the Egfp transgene is not expressed, it is not valid to count the number of BrdU labeled cells and assumed they express Lfng. There is no measurement of Lfng RNA and protein in the crosses between the Gensat line and the loss of function hets. The identification of cell types is poorly controlled. Finally, there are no experiments to provide insight as to the mechanism of action, if any, of Lfng in adult hippocampal neurogenesis.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Lunatic fringe-mediated Notch signaling regulates adult hippocampal neural stem cell maintenance&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are a few remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Reviewer #2 suggests a few revisions to the figures and then one simple staining. Reviewer 3 has some concerns regarding your interpretations, and these seem reasonable. We'd thus ask you to adjust the text accordingly. In addition, like reviewer 2, this reviewer asks for more stainings and demonstration that you can reliably identify Notch signal activation (reliability of Hes5 staining, NICD staining, and Notch reporter in the tissues) and also confirm the specificity of Dll1 and Jag1 antibodies (staining patterns in your knockout animals) and demonstrate which cells are high for Notch signaling and which cells are negative for Notch signaling. Similar Notch signaling analysis in your inducible Lfng knockout animals seems reasonable.</p><p>The stainings should not take long for you to do, but they will go a long way in validating your findings. The revisions will also be useful both for your and our readers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Maletic-Savatic et al. is remarkably improved. It now provides elegant evidence that lunatic fringe is a new marker for Hippocampal NSCs and that Lfng along with the Notch ligands Jag1 and/or Δ functions in regulating cell cycle and generation of neurons from NSCs. In its revised form, this manuscript is an important advance on our understanding of mechanisms underlying adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus. I have no substantial concerns with the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this revised manuscript, Semerci et al. have made an impressive effort in extending and improving their original study. In particular, they generated a new mouse line (i.e. Lfng-CreERT2) allowing a systematic in vivo lineage tracing of LFNG-expressing cells (i.e. neural stem cells, NSCs) in the adult hippocampus. Moreover, they carried out comprehensive genetic analyses to explore potential mechanisms underlying the function of LFNG in NSC maintenance. In addition, the authors improved the characterization of cell types and NSC behavior, as well as the comparison between the Lfng-GFP and Nestin-GFP lines.</p><p>The revised manuscript is greatly improved and the authors have addressed my previous concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Semerci et al. investigate the function of Lunatic Fringe (Lfng) in maintaining the hippocampal NSCs. Lfng is a known component in the Notch pathway. By generating two Lfng lines: Lfng-EGFP and Lfng-CreER, the authors conducted comprehensive analysis of Lfng expression in the hippocampus. With lineage-tracing and ablation, they demonstrated that Lfng marks largely the hippocampal NSCs. To investigate the function of Lfng in NSCs, they further knockout Lfng in NSCs, and compared the results with knockout of Notch ligand Dll1 and Jag1.</p><p>Overall, the results are comprehensive and interesting, and the topic is of great interest to the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. The analyses related to Lfng expression and lineage tracing are rigorous. This said, I have some concerns regarding the authors' interpretation of Lfng, Dll1, and Jag1 phenotypes. Below I listed some questions that should be addressed before publication.</p><p>1) The analyses regarding Jag1 and Dll1 are incomplete and the conclusions are quite forced. First of all, using straight knockout to analyze adult phenotypes often complicate the interpretation due to accumulated effects since embryonic stage. The fact that Jag1<sup>+/-</sup> and inducible knockout of Jag1 have different phenotypes illustrates this point. Before more cell-type specific Jag1/Dll1 mutants are generated, these data are suggestive at best. Second, it is difficult to assess from the presented image whether Notch signaling is indeed up-regulated in the NSCs: It is unclear if NICD is on the Lfng-eGFP NSCs in the represented picture, the Hes5 staining looks like punta rather than nuclear, and CBF-H2B-Venus looks positive in the majority of the cells that are <italic>Sox2</italic> negative (and only in one cell that is <italic>Sox2</italic> positive). How specific and reliable are these antibodies as readouts of Notch signaling? The authors should do the following to strengthen this part of the data since these data are closely related to whether daughter cells indeed send feedback to stem cells via Notch signaling, one of the key conclusions of the paper:</p><p>a) Demonstrate that they can reliably identify Notch signal activation (reliability of Hes5 staining, NICD staining, and Notch reporter in the tissues they are working with) and also confirm the specificity of Dll1 and Jag1 antibodies (for example, they can examine the staining patterns in their knockout animals). Perform rigorous analysis (and quantifications) to demonstrate which cells are high for Notch signaling and which cells are negative for Notch signaling.</p><p>b) Perform similar Notch signaling analysis in their inducible Lfng knockout animals, so that they can directly compare Lfng wild type and knockout NSCs and their downstream progeny and demonstrate unequivocally that Notch signal is indeed affected in the Lfng knockout NSCs (and not other cell types).</p><p>c) Explain the discrepancies between Jag<sup>+/-</sup> and inducible Jag1 knockout data.</p><p>d) Significantly revise and tone down their claims about Notch signaling and the action of Notch ligand Dll1 and Jag1 unless they can demonstrate knockout data that is more cell type specific.</p><p>2) The authors' interpretation for their BrdU, or CIdU/IdU phenotype in Lfng mutant and Dll1/Jag1 is confusing and difficult to understand. Some textual changes will be essential to make these data more accessible to the readers.</p><p>Specifically, their data suggest that in Lfng mutant, (i) label retaining NSCs decrease with time (which is not due to multiple rounds of cell cycle entry during the chase period since fewer NSCs enter S phase twice in Lfng mutant); (ii) label retaining astrocytes increase with time; (iii) more NSCs are proliferating at any given time; and (iv) NSCs numbers are reduced. If apoptosis status is not altered in Lfng mutants (see below), this data together with the lineage-tracing data suggest that upon loss of Lfng, more NSCs are in cycle at any given time, but there is a shift in the division outcomes with regard to what cells are produced. In wild type, many of these divisions generate ANPs and stem cells, while in Lfng knockout animals, more astrocytes are produced.</p><p>The authors' statements like &quot;NSCs lacking Lfng mostly exited the cell cycle&quot;, &quot;Lfng removal caused NSCs to exit cycling mode earlier&quot;, or &quot;these data indicate that absence of Jag1 causes NSCs to be in cell cycle for a prolonged length of time, while absence of Dll1 causes them to exit cell cycle&quot; are confusing, and send out the opposite message. &quot;NSCs exit cell cycle&quot; implies that &quot;NSCs are withdrawn from the cell cycle and become quiescent but remain as NSCs&quot;. If this is the phenotype, they should have observed more BrdU label-retaining NSCs, not less. A more appropriate statement might be &quot;NSCs differentiate into astrocytes&quot;. In all, the authors should modify all of these related statements to convey the results more truthfully and enhance the readability of their manuscript.</p><p>3) The authors should also conduct apoptosis analysis to determine if changes in cell numbers are due to abnormal apoptosis, which is an independent mechanism that will influence interpretation.</p><p>4) The authors should provide evidence suggesting that Lfng-CreER is not active without tamoxifen induction (i.e., no leakage issue that might confound the interpretation).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24660.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] The authors identified and counted different cell types such as NSCs and ANPs based only on cell morphology. This is an imperfect assay to discriminate the two population, the authors should include markers analysis such as Tbr2 for ANPs.</italic> </p><p>We agree that cell morphology is imperfect; we have now done extensive quantifications based on the expression of previously known markers of these cells. First, we have established that markers known to label NSCs, such as nestin, <italic>Sox2</italic>, vimentin and GFAP, were all expressed in <italic>Lfng</italic>(BAC)::eGFP+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). ANPs were discriminated from NSCs based not only on their round morphology but also the presence of <italic>Sox2</italic> and Tbr2 and lack of markers such as GFAP and Dcx. We distinguished early ANPs (Type 2a: round cells in the SGZ that express <italic>Sox2</italic> and lack GFAP and Dcx) from late ANPs (Type 2b: round cells in the SGZ that express Tbr2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We then continued to use these markers to quantify NSCs and ANPs in most other experiments throughout the paper.</p><p>To demonstrate the specificity of Lfng expression to NSCs, we performed a series of additional experiments. Using the <italic>Lfng</italic>(BAC)::eGFP/<italic>Nestin</italic>-CFP<sup>nuc</sup> double transgenic mice and immunostaining with markers listed above, we detected only 7% (7.41 ± 1.95%; N=3) ANPs that were eGFP+. Next, we showed that <italic>Lfng</italic>(BAC)::eGFP is expressed only in minority of Type2a ANPs (<italic>Sox2</italic> + GFAP- cells in the SGZ; 10.58 ± 2.38, N=3), unlike <italic>Nestin</italic>-GFP (94.7 ± 0.34, N=4). We then determined the clearance time of the eGFP signal from Type 2a ANPs, using BrdU pulse-and-chase labeling. eGFP was cleared between days 1 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> left graph), which correlates with the eGFP half-life. Finally, using temozolomide to kill dividing cells, we quantified NSCs and ANPs and demonstrated that Lfng-expressing NSCs were mostly quiescent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Together, these data strongly suggest that most of the <italic>Lfng</italic>(BAC)::eGFP+ cells are NSCs. The <italic>Lfng</italic>(BAC)::eGFP+ ANPs are the immediate progeny of NSCs that retained some eGFP due to sequestration of the protein during cell division. ANPs quickly lose eGFP, implying that <italic>Lfng</italic>(BAC)::eGFP expression is selective for NSCs and that <italic>Lfng</italic> is active in NSCs but not in ANPs.</p><p><italic>The in vitro characterization of Lfng-GFP cells should be improved. The authors isolate the GFP positive cells from Lfng-GFP mice and place them in neurosphere culture. The neurospheres lost the expression of the GFP and the authors claim that this is because the neurospheres are populated with progenitors. The authors must substantiate this claim with specific markers. Moreover, the Lfng-derived neurospheres should be analyzed for other stem cells marker expression, self-renewal and differentiation capacity. A full demonstration that these cells are NSCs is central and still needed.</italic> </p><p>We have now generated the lineage tracing mouse and effectively demonstrated the multipotentiality of Lfng expressing cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, we have removed the in vitro data from the revised paper.</p><p><italic>In the BrdU assay described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref> is unclear how the authors determined and counted the different cell subpopulation.</italic> </p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref> in the initial submission is now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, and the quantification of the cells is described in detail in the Materials and methods section. For each time point in each genotype (<italic>Nestin</italic>-GFP and <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP), we performed three sets of immunostainings from each animal (n=4 per time point). We used: 1) mouse anti-GFAP, rabbit anti-<italic>Sox2</italic> and rat anti-BrdU for the first set; 2) rabbit anti-Dcx, mouse anti-NeuN, and rat anti-BrdU for the second; and 3) mouse anti-GFAP, rabbit antiDcx, and rat anti-BrdU for the third. NSCs were identified as BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells with a <italic>Sox2Sox2</italic><sup>+</sup> nuclei and triangular soma in the SGZ, from which a single GFAP+ radial process extended orthogonally and spanned the granule cell layer, ending in fine arborizations within the molecular layer. These cells lacked all other markers. ANPs were identified as BrdU<sup>+</sup> round GFAP- Dcx-cells in the SGZ. Immature neurons-neuroblasts and granule cells were Dcx+ and NeuN+, respectively. Cells outside of the SGZ and negative for Dcx and NeuN were categorized as 'other'.</p><p>To estimate the total number of different cell types or cells that are positive for different antigens without falling into a spatial bias, 50μm free-floating sagittal sections spanning through the whole dentate gyrus were collected in 5 parallel sets using a vibratome. Each set contained 13-14 sections 250μm apart from each other. The previously described modified optical dissector method (Encinas and Enikolopov, 2008) was used for unbiased quantification of absolute number of different cell types in the whole brain. Briefly, an observer blind to experimental groups counted immunoreactive cells that had the aforementioned markers and morphological properties in every fifth sagittal section throughout the dentate gyrus. Cells that were located in the uppermost focal plane were excluded from the quantification to avoid overestimation. Total counts from 13-14 sections were multiplied by 5 for the total number of cells of interest in one hemisphere and then by 2 to get the total number of cells for both dentate gyri.</p><p><italic>The authors argue that Lfng has a role in the stem cells pool maintenance by regulating stem cells quiescence. But, at face value (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D-E</xref>), the data show that, 1) endogenous LNFR is required to inhibits proliferation as measured by BrdU (at least on this putative NCS population above identified); 2) to promote proliferation as measured by Ki67 (in absolute terms); 3) to sustain NSC, that decline in the KOs (a data perhaps at odd with point 1); iii) to promotes differentiation. They comment that “elevated proportion of proliferating NSCs in Lfng<sup>-/+</sup> mice did not lead to increased number of INs, as one may expect. Rather, the total number of INs highly correlated with the absolute number of NSCs (R=0.9948) and not the total number of proliferating NSCs.” (before Discussion).</italic> </p><p><italic>I find this very confusing. And the following conclusion is, in my opinion, a stretched interpretation of a complex set of data: “Together, these data indicate that loss of Lfng causes impaired NSC maintenance due to increased proliferation rates of NSCs, which over time result in decreased number of newborn cells and the phenotype indicative of premature exhaustion of neurogenesis.”</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors never considered other interpretations, such as cell death (by various means), transition to different cell types other than those here studied.

We concluded that lack of <italic>Lfng</italic> impairs NSC maintenance by initially increasing the rate of proliferation, which prematurely exhausts the NSC population and thus the ultimate number of newborn neurons. We agree with the reviewer that further proof was warranted.</p><p>In the revised paper, we provide additional data using both constitutive and conditional knockout mice, in which we specifically deleted <italic>Lfng</italic> from Lfng-expressing NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In sum, those data demonstrate that in the absence of Lfng, many more NSCs divide at the population level compared to controls. Lfng-deficient NSCs spend less time in the active state, produce fewer ANPs over time, and have a tendency to differentiate into astrocyte-like cells more rapidly than controls, which depletes the NSC population prematurely. These effects appear to depend on the level of Lfng, as homozygous conditional knockout mice had more pronounced alterations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] I have the following comments:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The study focused on adult hippocampal NSCs.

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, it appears the vast majority of Nestin-CFP cells express some Lfng-eGFP.</italic> </p><p>Please see the answer to Reviewer #1, first comment, for an outline of the methodology used to quantify and distinguish NSCs and ANPs. In the revised manuscript, we have performed additional experiments to address the reviewers’ questions.</p><p>A nearly complete overlap between <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP expression and Nestin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) indicates that Lfng expressing NSCs are mostly the same population of NSCs labeled by <italic>Nestin</italic>-GFP. We corroborated this finding by comparing the total number of NSCs in <italic>Nestin</italic>-GFP and <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP mice at distinct time points throughout life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In addition, 84% of the <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP+ cells were also GFAP+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As nearly all GFAP+ radial processes that originate from SGZ and end at the border between the granule cell and molecular layers were also <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP+, it is plausible that Lfng is expressed in the same population of NSCs that are labeled with <italic>GFAP</italic>GFP. Nevertheless, NSCs are very heterogeneous and there are differences in the labeling efficiencies depending on the transgenic mouse line (Giachino and Taylor, 2014; Semerci and Maletic-Savatic, 2016). Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP labels in part a different population of cells in comparison to other mouse models. We have done extensive work to demonstrate its specificity to NSCs and will pursue characterization of sub-populations of <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP+ NSCs in the future.</p><p><italic>3) Related to the previous comment, how does Lfng-eGFP compare with Hes5-eGFP, which preferentially labels a subset of NSCs and ANPs? The authors may want to discuss about this.</italic> </p><p>To determine whether active Notch signaling is present in the <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP NSCs, we performed immunostaining against cleaved intracellular domain of Notch1 (NICD1) and Hes5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), as well as used the Notch reporter mouse, CBF-H2B-Venus (Duncan et al., 2005). These experiments all verified that only a subset of NSCs have active Notch signaling, indicating a similar pattern observed in <italic>Hes5</italic>-eGFP mice (Basak and Taylor, 2007; Lugert et al., 2012). Lack of NICD1 and Hes5 in many <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP+ NSCs suggests that Lfng expression is not limited to the cells with active Notch signaling but rather extends to a broader population.</p><p><italic>4) In the Abstract, the authors wrote &quot;NSCs are dispensable.&quot; Does this mean for viability?</italic> </p><p>In the revised manuscript, we eliminated this confusing statement and instead state that NSCs have different fates, ranging from terminal astrocytic differentiation to self-renewal.</p><p><italic>5) It is somewhat confusing who made Lfng-eGFPTg mice, authors or GENSAT? In the main text of the manuscript, it says that the authors made the mice, but in the Materials and methods it says that it was from GENSAT.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for noticing the ambiguity. In the revised paper, we made it clear that we purchased the <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP mice from GENSAT as FVB/N- C57BL/6 hybrid. We then crossed it to C57BL/6 mice for at least 10 generations before starting the characterization of the <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP expression in the SGZ.</p><p><italic>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, it is hard to see any neurospheres.

We also worked with a native English speaker to improve the clarity of the writing, and we hope the manuscript is now easier to read.</p><p><italic>The so-called bioinformatics approach does not involve any new datasets. Rather the authors simply queried published gene expression databases such as Allen and GENSAT, which provides detailed gene expression data at cellular resolution. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (supplemental?) are not publishable as they are available on the Gensat website.</italic> </p><p>In the revised paper, we explain our database query in the Introduction, as this query has led us to hypothesize that Lfng is a selective marker of NSCs. We removed the expression data from other brain regions; please note that in the initial paper these data were not taken from the GENSAT database but were produced from our own experiments. The fact that they matched GENSAT expression data reassured us that back-crossing to C57/Bl6 mice did not affect the Lfng expression pattern.</p><p><italic>There are many crucial experiments lacking in this paper, most notably a genetic lineage trace to show that Lfng positive cells give rise to neurons. What is provided is that Lfng<sup>+</sup> cells can divide (BrdU) and that cells that have undergone division (BrdU<sup>+</sup>) can give rise to neurons.</italic> </p><p>We have now generated a lineage tracing mouse and provided the in vivo evidence that Lfng expressing cells are multipotent stem cells, able to self-renew and give rise to both neurons and astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>Another issue that is not addressed is the timing of expression of Lfng<sup>+</sup> cells – the authors only show the timing of EGFP, which is likely very different than the timing of LFNG, given the perdurance of EGFP.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer raises an important issue: how much <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP expression correlates with Lfng protein expression? First, Lfng has been shown to have an oscillatory expression pattern in other systems (Kageyama et al., 2007; Maroto et al., 2005; Okubo et al., 2012). We don't know if it oscillates in NSCs. This would be important if Lfng is expressed in only a subset of NSCs and not in the whole NSC population. In this case, <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP would partially label the NSC population and thus, the total number of labeled cell would be significantly different from the total number of NSCs in other mouse models, such as <italic>Nestin</italic>-GFP. However, our data showed that almost all <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP+ cells express Nestin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and further, that <italic>Lfng</italic>-eGFP and <italic>Nestin</italic>-GFP mice have similar numbers of NSCs throughout their lifetime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These data suggest that Lfng expression is stable enough to drive the expression of eGFP in all NSCs labeled by Nestin. Other eGFP reporter lines such as <italic>Hes5</italic>-eGFP (Basak and Taylor, 2007; Lugert et al., 2012) that are based on Hes5 promoter with an oscillatory expression pattern, label only a subset of NSCs in which Hes5 is present.</p><p>Second, eGFP might stay in cells longer than Lfng protein. To determine the eGFP clearance from the labeled cells, we have performed additional experiments that demonstrate that eGFP is completely lost from the cells between day 1 and day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> left graph). Thus, even if Lfng has an oscillatory expression pattern, it is shorter than the life of eGFP.</p><p>Finally, our knockout experiments, both constitutive and conditional, indicate that Lfng expression is important not only for a part of NSC life, but for both quiescent and active NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p><italic>The neurosphere experiments are concerning for many reasons, there is no indication of the efficiency of purification and since the Egfp transgene is not expressed, it is not valid to count the number of BrdU labeled cells and assumed they express Lfng.</italic> </p><p>Please see the answer to reviewer #1, second comment.</p><p><italic>There is no measurement of Lfng RNA and protein in the crosses between the Gensat line and the loss of function hets.</italic> </p><p>Both the constitutive and conditional Lfng knockout mice have been used in previous studies where Lfng protein levels and the RNA have been determined (Benedito et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2012; Zhang and Gridley, 1998). We have thus not performed these experiments.</p><p><italic>The identification of cell types is poorly controlled.</italic> </p><p>In the revised paper, we have done extensive quantifications based not only on the morphology of cells but also on the expression of previously known markers of these cells, as described in detail in the methods section.

Further, we also provide new data on Notch ligands, Jag1 and Dll1, and their effects on NSC cell cycle and fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These data suggest the Lfng is a key modulator of NSC cell cycle and fate.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] Overall, the results are comprehensive and interesting, and the topic is of great interest to the broad readership of eLife. The analyses related to Lfng expression and lineage tracing are rigorous. This said, I have some concerns regarding the authors' interpretation of Lfng, Dll1, and Jag1 phenotypes. Below I listed some questions that should be addressed before publication.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The analyses regarding Jag1 and Dll1 are incomplete and the conclusions are quite forced. First of all, using straight knockout to analyze adult phenotypes often complicate the interpretation due to accumulated effects since embryonic stage. The fact that Jag1<sup>+/-</sup> and inducible knockout of Jag1 have different phenotypes illustrates this point. Before more cell-type specific Jag1/Dll1 mutants are generated, these data are suggestive at best. Second, it is difficult to assess from the presented image whether Notch signaling is indeed up-regulated in the NSCs: It is unclear if NICD is on the Lfng-eGFP NSCs in the represented picture, the Hes5 staining looks like punta rather than nuclear, and CBF-H2B-Venus looks positive in the majority of the cells that are Sox2 negative (and only in one cell that is Sox2 positive). How specific and reliable are these antibodies as readouts of Notch signaling? The authors should do the following to strengthen this part of the data since these data are closely related to whether daughter cells indeed send feedback to stem cells via Notch signaling, one of the key conclusions of the paper:</italic> </p><p><italic>a) Demonstrate that they can reliably identify Notch signal activation (reliability of Hes5 staining, NICD staining, and Notch reporter in the tissues they are working with) and also confirm the specificity of Dll1 and Jag1 antibodies (for example, they can examine the staining patterns in their knockout animals). Perform rigorous analysis (and quantifications) to demonstrate which cells are high for Notch signaling and which cells are negative for Notch signaling.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the discrepancy between CBF-H2B-Venus signal and NICD staining, which motivated us to search for a new antibody and optimize the protocol.</p><p>In our initial submission, we used CBF-H2F-Venus mice to demonstrate Notch activity in NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> – upper right panel). Both reviewer 2 and reviewer 3 urged us to complement these data with more detailed examination of Notch signaling through NICD staining, particularly in mutant mice.</p><p>To directly assess the presence and intensity of Notch signaling, we first need a reliable method to detect Notch signaling strength. Although CBF:H2B-Venus mice are a good tool to evaluate the presence or absence of Notch signaling, the accumulation of Venus fluorescence protein and high fluorescence intensity in the GZ (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) make it hard to perform reliable intensity quantifications in the SGZ where NSCs reside. We therefore turned to NICD1 as a more reliable measure of Notch signaling intensity.</p><p>To verify the reliability of NICD1 staining, we reasoned that NICD1 should be present in cells expressing Venus. Thus, we first stained CBF-H2B-Venus sections with four commercially available NICD1 antibodies (Abcam, cat#: 8925; Cell Signaling, cat#: 24215 and 4147S; and Assay Biotech, cat#L0119), optimized the staining protocol, and quantified the overlap between NICD1 staining and Venus. We found that rabbit anti-NICD1 from Assay BioTech, CA (cat#L0119) is the best available antibody in the market to show over 90% (90.79% ± 0.77%) signal overlap with CBF-H2B-Venus in SGZ and over 95% (96.95% ± 0.57%) in GZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> –left insetandright graph). Notably, NICD1 staining was mostly absent in the molecular layer and present in almost all of cells in which Venus was also present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> – right inset). We then quantified the fluorescence intensity of NICD1 staining in both <italic>iLfng</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> and <italic>iJag1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mutant NSC clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). To normalize the intensity between different sections and samples, we chose NICD1 staining intensity in CA1 neurons of the hippocampus as the control, as there was no <italic>Lfng</italic>-driven CreERT2 activity in these cells. In <italic>Lfng</italic> mutant NSC clones, we expected to see a decrease in Notch signaling as Lfng potentiates Dll1-mediated Notch signals. Indeed, in <italic>iLfng</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, we observed a significant drop in Notch signaling intensity, suggesting that decrease in Notch signaling might contribute to loss of NSC quiescence in <italic>Lfng</italic> mutant NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, E</xref>). In <italic>Jag1</italic> mutant NSC clones, we expected to see an increase in Notch signaling, due to the removal of inhibitory effect of Jag1 on Lfng- modified Notch receptor. Sure enough, we detected a significant increase in Notch signaling intensity in NSCs of <italic>Jag1</italic> mutant mice, which might contribute to extended cycling of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, E</xref>). Since our <italic>Dll1</italic> knockout mouse model is constitutive and has uniform Dll1 expression, we do not have a control region to normalize between samples. Thus, we could not examine the NICD1 signal intensity in <italic>Dll1</italic><sup>-/+</sup> mice.</p><p>We present these data in Results (subsections “Notch pathway elements are present in the SGZ NSC niche”, “Lfng preserves NSCs by controlling their cell cycle” and “Notch ligands Jag1 and Dll1 preserve NSCs by opposing effects on their cell cycle”) and describe the methodology in Materials and Methods (subsection “Confocal microscopy and stereology”).</p><p>We performed a panel of stainings in the CBF-H2B-Venus mice to examine which cells have Notch signaling in the SGZ and GZ of dentate gyrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). As reviewer #3 points out, Venus signal as well as NICD1 staining was mostly localized to GZ, where <italic>Sox2</italic><sup>-</sup> cells reside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C</xref>). Notch signaling plays an important role in the maintenance of granule neurons (Zhuang et al., 2015); thus, granule cells are expected to be positive for both NICD (Brandt et al., 2010; Breunig et al., 2007) and CBF-H2B-Venus signal. Indeed, CBF-H2B-Venus signal overlapped almost completely with NeuN staining with various degrees of intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, most Dcx<sup>+</sup> cells were devoid of Venus signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and only quarter of S100β<sup>+</sup> astrocytes were positive for Venus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We agree with reviewer #3 that some of the <italic>Sox2Sox2</italic><sup>+</sup> cells are negative for CBF-H2B-Venus signal, suggesting that some of the progenitor cells are devoid of active Notch signaling. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> – right panel, B(arrow heads), some of the NSCs are positive for Notch signal. This is in agreement with findings from Breunig and colleagues, who showed that only some of the NSCs have nuclear NICD staining (Breunig et al., 2007). Quantification of Venus<sup>+</sup> cells among different cell types revealed that cells with active Notch signaling progressively decline from NSCs to immature neurons. Once the cells become mature granule neurons, Notch signaling is turned on again (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These data are presented in Results (subsection “Notch pathway elements are present in the SGZ NSC niche”) and the methodology in Materials and methods. Hes5 is shuttled between nucleus and cytoplasm to control its transcriptional activity (Gottle et al., 2015; Meliou et al., 2011); thus, cytoplasmic staining pattern is possible. Our staining protocol included usage of Tyramide Signal Amplification kit, which might have contributed to the punctuated staining pattern. To demonstrate the specificity of the signal, we have provided new images in the revised manuscript, which includes the GZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> – right panel). Due to specific localization of the signal along the GFAP+ process of NSCs in SGZ and absence of it from the GZ, we believe the staining pattern is genuine.</p><p>Finally, to demonstrate the reliability of Jag1 antibody, we stained sections from both wild type and i<italic>Jag1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. Since CreERT2 is driven by <italic>Lfng</italic> promoter in i<italic>Jag1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, the effect of <italic>Jag1</italic> deletion is expected to be restricted to SGZ and not other parts of the dentate gyrus. This gave us the advantage of a positive control in the conditional knockout tissue. Indeed, in i<italic>Jag1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, we detected Jag1 staining in the hilar cells while the SGZ was mostly devoid of signal. In wild-type mice, we detected Jag1<sup>+</sup> cell clusters in the SGZ and hilus, confirming the specificity of Jag1 staining (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>; scale bars=20µm). Finally, the specificity of the Dll1 antibody could not be verified since we have used Dll1 heterozygous constitutive knockout mice.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24660.014</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Jag1 signal is mostly eliminated from SGZ in i<italic>Jag1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice.</title><p>Immunostaining for Jag1 expression using anti-Jag1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) shows that the signal is localized to both SGZ and hilus in control (Ctrl) samples, whereas it is present mostly in hilus in the conditional knockout mice and not in the SGZ.

In constitutive heterozygous <italic>Jag1</italic> mice, we find no significant difference in BrdU<sup>+</sup> NSCs ratio between mutant and wild-type mice, <italic>but there is an upward trend</italic>. In conditional homozygous <italic>Jag1</italic> mice, we find significantly increased BrdU<sup>+</sup> NSCs ratio compared to control mice. This difference could be due to Jag1’s ability to either control cell cycle duration or the recruitment of NSCs from the quiescent population. As we stated in the original text, multiple observations considered together favor the first hypothesis and support the role of <italic>Jag1</italic> in regulation of the NSC cell cycle duration but not in recruitment of quiescent NSCs.</p><p>First, if <italic>Jag1</italic> had a role in the recruitment of NSCs, there should be significant difference between the BrdU<sup>+</sup> NSC ratios of <italic>Jag1</italic><sup>-/+</sup> and wild-type mice, but this is not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> middle panel, p=0.8393).</p><p>Second, increased recruitment should have a negative effect on NSC population in <italic>Jag1</italic><sup>-/+</sup> animals as in <italic>Dll1</italic><sup>-/+</sup>, but there is no significant difference between wild-type and <italic>Jag1</italic><sup>-/+</sup> NSC populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>Third, 6 month-old <italic>Lfng</italic><sup>-/+</sup> and double constitutive heterozygous knockout <italic>Lfng</italic><sup>-/+</sup>; <italic>Jag1</italic><sup>-/+</sup> mice both have the same number of NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and similar BrdU<sup>+</sup> NSC ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Jag1</italic> does not have an additional effect on the recruitment of NSCs. There was an increased NSC cell cycle re-entry after 1 week BrdU pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>), most likely contributed by indicating that in the double knockout, lack of <italic>Lfng</italic> and lack of <italic>Jag1</italic> have independent effects.</p><p>In sum, these data support the hypothesis that the difference between constitutive heterozygous (upward trend in BrdU<sup>+</sup> ratio) and conditional homozygous (significant increase in BrdU<sup>+</sup> ratio) <italic>Jag1</italic> knockout data derives from the accumulation of actively cycling NSCs rather than an increase in the recruitment of quiescent NSCs. The increase in NICD1 expression in individual mutant NSC clones in i<italic>Jag1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice two weeks after induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) supports this notion, in agreement with the reported conditional overexpression of NICD1, which increases cell cycle re-entry of NSCs (Breunig et al., 2007). To clarify our findings, we modified the text in the Results section (subsection “Notch ligands Jag1 and Dll1 preserve NSCs by opposing effects on their cell cycle”) and added to Discussion (sixth paragraph).</p><p><italic>d) Significantly revise and tone down their claims about Notch signaling and the action of Notch ligand Dll1 and Jag1 unless they can demonstrate knockout data that is more cell type specific.</italic> </p><p>We have developed a reliable protocol for NICD1 staining to examine Notch signaling in NSCs and their progeny, and independently verified the reliability of the NICD1 staining in CBF:H2B-Venus mice, demonstrating that it overlaps more than 90% in the SGZ NSC niche. We have also shown that conditional removal of <italic>Lfng</italic> from NSCs results in decreased NICD1 intensity, whereas conditional removal of <italic>Jag1</italic> caused a significant increase in the NICD1 intensity in NSCs as well as in SGZ. Thus, in our opinion, we demonstrated that Notch signaling changes in <italic>Lfng</italic> and <italic>Jag1</italic> knockout mice specifically in NSCs. Nevertheless, we modified the text in the Results (subsections “Lfng preserves NSCs by controlling their cell cycle” and “Notch ligands Jag1 and Dll1 preserve NSCs by opposing effects on their cell cycle”) and Discussion to clarify our claims.</p><p><italic>2) The authors' interpretation for their BrdU, or CIdU/IdU phenotype in Lfng mutant and Dll1/Jag1 is confusing and difficult to understand. Some textual changes will be essential to make these data more accessible to the readers.</italic> </p><p><italic>Specifically, their data suggest that in Lfng mutant, (i) label retaining NSCs decrease with time (which is not due to multiple rounds of cell cycle entry during the chase period since fewer NSCs enter S phase twice in Lfng mutant); (ii) label retaining astrocytes increase with time; (iii) more NSCs are proliferating at any given time; and (iv) NSCs numbers are reduced. If apoptosis status is not altered in Lfng mutants (see below), this data together with the lineage-tracing data suggest that upon loss of Lfng, more NSCs are in cycle at any given time, but there is a shift in the division outcomes with regard to what cells are produced. In wild type, many of these divisions generate ANPs and stem cells, while in Lfng knockout animals, more astrocytes are produced.</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors' statements like &quot;NSCs lacking Lfng mostly exited the cell cycle&quot;, &quot;Lfng removal caused NSCs to exit cycling mode earlier&quot;, or &quot;these data indicate that absence of Jag1 causes NSCs to be in cell cycle for a prolonged length of time, while absence of Dll1 causes them to exit cell cycle&quot; are confusing, and send out the opposite message. &quot;NSCs exit cell cycle&quot; implies that &quot;NSCs are withdrawn from the cell cycle and become quiescent but remain as NSCs&quot;. If this is the phenotype, they should have observed more BrdU label-retaining NSCs, not less. A more appropriate statement might be &quot;NSCs differentiate into astrocytes&quot;. In all, the authors should modify all of these related statements to convey the results more truthfully and enhance the readability of their manuscript.</italic> </p><p>We have edited the text to the best of our ability. We also performed the 30-day BrdU pulse-and-chase experiment in the <italic>Dll1</italic><sup>-/+</sup> mice and showed that more proliferating NSCs terminally differentiate into astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). We present these data in Results and Discussion.</p><p><italic>3) The authors should also conduct apoptosis analysis to determine if changes in cell numbers are due to abnormal apoptosis, which is an independent mechanism that will influence interpretation.</italic> </p><p>Due to the rapid clearance of apoptotic cells in the SGZ (Sierra et al., 2010), quantification of apoptosis is difficult to examine. We therefore performed apoptosis analysis with two methods to ensure our observations are valid: activated caspase-3 staining and ApopTag®, which detects double-strand DNA breaks. Both methods demonstrated a significant decrease in the number of apoptotic cells in both <italic>iJag1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> and <italic>iLfng</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> animals compared to wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In <italic>iJag1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>, although increased production of ANPs was expected to result in a greater number of apoptotic cells, we actually observed significantly fewer apoptotic cells. In <italic>iLfng</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> animals, Notch signaling is downregulated, so more apoptotic cells would be expected. However, we observed a significant decrease in the number of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), most likely due to the production of fewer ANPs in <italic>iLfng</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. We present these findings in Results, subsections “Lfng preserves NSCs by controlling their cell cycle” and “Notch ligands Jag1 and Dll1 preserve NSCs by opposing effects on their cell cycle”, and describe the methodology in Materials and methods.</p><p><italic>4) The authors should provide evidence suggesting that Lfng-CreER is not active without tamoxifen induction (i.e., no leakage issue that might confound the interpretation).</italic> </p><p>We have added the control experiment (vehicle injection) for tamoxifen induction and no leakage was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
