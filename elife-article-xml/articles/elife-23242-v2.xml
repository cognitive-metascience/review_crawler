Here we document TCF7L1 upregulation in skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and demonstrate that TCF7L1 overexpression increases tumor incidence, tumor multiplicity, and malignant progression in the chemically induced mouse model of skin SCC. Additionally, we show that downregulation of TCF7L1 and its paralogue TCF7L2 reduces tumor growth in a xenograft model of human skin SCC. Using separation-of-function mutants, we show that TCF7L1 promotes tumor growth, enhances cell migration, and overrides oncogenic RAS-induced senescence independently of its interaction with Î²-catenin. Through transcriptome profiling and combined gain- and loss-of-function studies, we identified LCN2 as a major downstream effector of TCF7L1 that drives tumor growth. Our findings establish a tumor-promoting role for TCF7L1 in skin and elucidate the mechanisms underlying its tumorigenic capacity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23242.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23242.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>TCF7L1</kwd><kwd>skin squamous cell carcinoma</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>oncogene-induced senescence</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP110153</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nguyen</surname><given-names>Hoang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP101499</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Howard</surname><given-names>Jeffrey M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-HL092332-07</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Howard</surname><given-names>Jeffrey M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32HL92332</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ku</surname><given-names>Amy T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM088129</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ku</surname><given-names>Amy T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>7R01CA194617</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsai</surname><given-names>Kenneth Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 CA194062</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsai</surname><given-names>Kenneth Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>T.

When the expression profiles of several types of poorly differentiated and aggressive tumors were compared to embryonic stem (ES) cell signature genes, a subset of ES cell transcriptional regulators was found to be highly enriched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ben-Porath et al., 2008</xref>). One such ES cell signature gene enriched in aggressive tumors is <italic>TCF7L1</italic> (also known as <italic>TCF3</italic>).</p><p>TCF7L1 is a member of the LEF/TCF (lymphoid enhancer factor/T cell factor) family of transcription factors, which act as DNA binding partners for the WNT mediator Î²-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Korinek et al., 1998</xref>). LEF/TCF proteins contain a highly conserved DNA binding high-mobility group (HMG)-box, a conserved Î²-catenin binding domain in their amino terminus, and a Groucho/TLE binding domain in their central region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arce et al., 2006</xref>). In response to canonical WNT signaling, Î²-catenin is translocated to the nucleus and partners with LEF/TCF members to activate transcription of WNT target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Behrens et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Molenaar et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">van de Wetering et al., 1997</xref>). In the absence of WNT ligands, LEF/TCF binds to Groucho/TLE co-repressors to inhibit transcription of WNT target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cavallo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roose et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>TCF7L1 is expressed in ES cells and adult progenitors of many tissues, including hematopoietic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ivanova et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chambers et al., 2007</xref>), neural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ivanova et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lie et al., 2005</xref>) and skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DasGupta and Fuchs, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Merrill et al., 2001</xref>). In skin, TCF7L1 is expressed in embryonic epidermal cells, and postnatally its expression is restricted to hair follicle stem cells and their immediate progeny, the hair germ and the outer root sheath cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DasGupta and Fuchs, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Merrill et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nguyen et al., 2006</xref>). Overexpression of TCF7L1 in the newborn epidermis blocks terminal differentiation and maintains cells in an undifferentiated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Merrill et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nguyen et al., 2006</xref>). In the epidermis, the expression pattern of TCF7L1 is mirrored by its closely related paralogue TCF7L2 (also known as TCF4), which appears to possess similar functions and can compensate for the absence of TCF7L1. Loss of both TCF7L1 and TCF7L2 in skin results in hair follicle morphogenesis defects, as well as failure of long-term proliferation/self-renewal and wound repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nguyen et al., 2009</xref>). Recently, we found that TCF7L1 is induced at the skin wound edge and its overexpression promotes epidermal cell migration and wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miao et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Although TCF7L1 can bind to Î²-catenin, a number of its critical developmental functions occur through its role as a transcriptional co-repressor with Groucho/TLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wray et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pereira et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gribble et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miao et al., 2014</xref>). For instance, although <italic>TCF7L1</italic>-null mice die embryonically with gastrulation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Merrill et al., 2004</xref>), mice homozygously expressing a knock-in <italic>TCF7L1âN</italic> mutant that does not bind to Î²-catenin gastrulate normally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al. 2012</xref>), suggesting that TCF7L1âs role in Î²-catenin binding and canonical WNT activation is not essential in this context. However, the knock-in <italic>TCF7L1</italic>â<italic>N</italic> mutant mice die at birth with multiple developmental defects, suggesting that TCF7L1 requires binding to Î²-catenin to allow normal development to occur in other tissues. In ES cells, WNT signaling activation does lead to the interaction of Î²-catenin with TCF7L1; however, rather than forming a transcriptional activation complex, Î²-catenin instead stimulates TCF7L1âs removal from the promoters of pluripotency genes to allow their derepression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wray et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yi et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, there is evidence that WNT signaling actually downregulates TCF7L1 expression in ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atlasi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shy et al., 2013</xref>) and that binding to Î²-catenin stimulates TCF7L1 degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shy et al., 2013</xref>). TCF7L1 downregulation by WNT is also observed in neural progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuwahara et al., 2014</xref>). Together, these data suggest that WNT signaling is unlikely to stimulate transcription of WNT target genes through the formation of an activating Î²-catenin/TCF7L1 complex. However, a study in breast cancer cells showed that <italic>TCF7L1</italic> knockdown led to the simultaneous upregulation and downregulation of different subsets of WNT target genes, suggesting that TCF7L1 may directly or indirectly play an activating role in WNT signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Slyper et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In human breast cancer, high levels of TCF7L1 are found in high-grade tumors and its expression is associated with poor survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Slyper et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, downregulation of <italic>TCF7L1</italic> was shown to decrease tumor growth and reduce metastasis rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Slyper et al., 2012</xref>). However, the mechanism underlying TCF7L1âs tumor-promoting role in breast cancer remains to be defined. In colorectal cancer, high level of <italic>TCF7L1</italic> mRNA also correlates with shorter survival of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Murphy et al., 2016</xref>). Knocking out TCF7L1 reduced growth of a colorectal tumor cell line in vitro and reduced the size of xenografted tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Murphy et al., 2016</xref>). EPHB3 was among the genes upregulated in TCF7L1-null cells, but its knockdown only partially rescued the growth defect of TCF7L1-null cells in vitro, suggesting that other downstream effectors of TCF7L1 are needed to execute the full function of TCF7L1.</p><p>In skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), Î²-catenin is essential for tumor growth both in a chemically-induced mouse model of skin SCC and a xenograft model of human skin SCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Malanchi et al., 2008</xref>). Coincidentally, <italic>Tcf7l1</italic> mRNA is highly expressed in mouse papillomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Malanchi et al., 2008</xref>), which are premalignant lesions that precede SCC. However, it is unclear what function TCF7L1 plays in the development of SCC, and whether its tumor-promoting role requires its interaction with Î²-catenin. Intriguingly, TRANSFAC-based motif analysis identified TCF7L1 as one of the 17 transcription factors whose targets are significantly altered between normal skin and premalignant tumors (papilloma/actinic keratosis) as well as between premalignant and malignant skin tumors (SCC) in both human and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chitsazzadeh et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we show that overexpression of TCF7L1 increases tumor incidence, multiplicity, and malignant conversion in a mouse model of skin SCC. In a xenograft model of human skin SCC, we show that overexpression of TCF7L1 also promotes tumor growth while downregulation of TCF7L1 and its paralogue TCF7L2 decreases tumor growth. Moreover, we demonstrate that TCF7L1 overexpression promotes tumor growth, enhances migration, and suppresses oncogenic RAS-induced senescence independently of Î²-catenin interaction. Finally, we identified the secreted protein LCN2 as the downstream effector of TCF7L1 that stimulates tumor growth. LCN2 (lipocalin 2, also known as NGAL, 24p3, uterocalin, or siderocalin) is a secreted protein that is induced in response to stress and injury and is overexpressed in many types of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li and Chan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rodvold et al., 2012</xref>).

We compared the tumorigenic potential of full-length TCF7L1 to three mutant versions: TCF7L1ÎN, which lacks the Î²-catenin binding domain, TCF7L1ÎG, which lacks the Groucho/TLE corepressor binding domain, and TCF7L1*, which contains a mutation in its HMG domain and cannot bind to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Merrill et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

We transduced cells to express oncogenic HRAS<sup>G12V</sup> in the presence or absence of tet-inducible <italic>TCF7L1</italic>, and then evaluated the degree of cellular senescence by measuring senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase (SA-Î²-gal) activity. As expected, expression of oncogenic HRAS<sup>G12V-</sup>induced senescence in both primary mouse keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6AâC</xref>) and fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). However, when co-expressed with TCF7L1, its effect on senescence in keratinocytes was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6AâC</xref>). Importantly, TCF7L1 counteracted HRAS<sup>G12V</sup>-induced senescence independently of its binding to Î²-catenin, as TCF7L1ÎN mutant exerted even greater negating effect than full-length TCF7L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Consistent with our finding that TCF7L1 suppressed OIS independently of Î²-catenin, we found that OIS was not affected by the overexpression of ÎNÎ²-catenin, the N-terminus truncated version of Î²-catenin that is hyper-active due to its increased stability and consequent nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gat et al., 1998</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

In fact, introducing ÎNÎ²-catenin together with TCF7L1 reduced the suppressing effect of TCF7L1 on OIS.

Through immunostaining of human skin samples (nÂ =Â 16), we found that while 10 out of 16 samples were positive for TCF7L1, 15 were positive for LCN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10âfigure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, although all of TCF7L1 expressing tumors express LCN2, 83.3% of TCF7L1 negative also express LCN2, indicating that LCN2 can be induced by factors other than TCF7L1.</p><p>To test whether LCN2 is a major downstream effector of TCF7L1 that stimulates tumor growth, we took a combined gain- and loss-of-function strategy. After validating that two different sets of shRNAs against <italic>LCN2</italic> can efficiently downregulate the expression levels of both mRNA and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C,D</xref>), we transduced SRB12 cells to express vector control or tet-inducible <italic>Tcf7l1</italic> with shRNAs against nonspecific sequence (shNS) or <italic>LCN2</italic> (sh<italic>LCN2</italic>#1 and sh<italic>LCN2</italic>#2). We grafted the transduced cells onto NSG mice and placed these grafted mice on a doxycycline-containing diet the following day. After eight weeks, TCF7L1-overexpressing tumors were significantly bigger than the control tumors. Importantly, downregulating <italic>LCN2</italic> decreased tumor size, abrogating the effect of TCF7L1 overexpression on tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E,F</xref>). Moreover, as was similarly shown in primary murine keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miao et al., 2014</xref>), inhibition of LCN2 with neutralizing antibody abolished the promigratory effect of TCF7L1 in SCC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10G</xref>).</p><p>Since LCN2 has been shown to stimulate neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shao et al., 2016</xref>), and inflammation facilitates tumor growth, we evaluated whether overexpressing TCF7L1 increases neutrophil infiltration in tumors and whether downregulating LCN2 alters their infiltration. Using flow cytometry analysis, we quantified the number of neutrophils (CD11b+Ly6G+Lyc6C+) and macrophages (CD11bÂ +F4/80+) in xenografted tumors expressing control vector or <italic>Tcf7l1</italic>Â with or without downregulation of <italic>LCN2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s3">Figure 10âfigure supplement 3</xref>). We found that while overexpression of TCF7L1 did not affect the number of macrophages (vector: 2.78Â Â±Â 1.57% vs. TCF7L1: 2.27 Â± 1.02%), it increased the number of neutrophils by four fold (vector: 0.36Â Â±Â 0.09% vs. TCF7L1: 2.28 Â± 0.74%). However, downregulation of LCN2 did not impinge on the ability of TCF7L1 to increase neutrophil infiltration. Together, our data therefore imply that TCF7L1 accelerates human SCC cell migration and tumor growth through induction of LCN2 but does not require LCN2 to stimulate neutrophil infiltration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p><italic>TCF7L1</italic> is an embryonic stem cell signature gene that is upregulated in multiple aggressive cancer types, including breast cancer, glioblastoma, and bladder carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ben-Porath et al., 2008</xref>). In a xenograft model of breast cancer, downregulation of <italic>TCF7L1</italic> decreased tumor growth and reduced metastasis rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Slyper et al., 2012</xref>). Because downregulating <italic>TCF7L1</italic> in these cells resulted in simultaneous upregulation and downregulation of different subsets of WNT target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Slyper et al., 2012</xref>), it was thought that TCF7L1âs function as a Î²-catenin binding transcriptional coactivator might explain its role in promoting tumorigenesis. This hypothesis was supported by the finding that Î²-catenin is essential for the development and growth of papillomas in a murine skin SCC model, and that <italic>Tcf7l1</italic> mRNA is upregulated in papilloma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Malanchi et al., 2008</xref>). However, whether the overexpression of TCF7L1 contributes to the development of premalignant tumors and SCC in skin and whether it requires Î²-catenin interaction in this function remain to be elucidated.</p><p>Here we report that TCF7L1 protein is upregulated in premalignant and malignant tumors in both the chemically- and UV-induced mouse models of skin SCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Using the tet-inducible <italic>Tcf7l1</italic> transgenic mouse model to mimic the upregulation of TCF7L1 found in papilloma and skin SCC, we demonstrated that TCF7L1 overexpression promotes and accelerates both premalignant papilloma formation and progression into SCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2EâG</xref>).</p><p>In the DMBA/TPA chemical carcinogenesis protocol, because the tumor-initiating step (DMBA) is distinct from the promoting step (TPA), we could identify which phase of tumorigenesis was impacted by TCF7L1 overexpression by omitting each agent. Although TCF7L1 overexpression was not sufficient to promote tumor development without DMBA/TPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>), the overexpression of TCF7L1 partially compensated for TPA administration in promoting tumor development, suggesting that TCF7L1 acts as a tumor promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2HâJ</xref>). Since prolonged overexpression of TCF7L1 increased proliferation in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>), it is reasonable that TCF7L1 overexpression can partially fill the role of TPA, which is known to induce cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yuspa et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hennings et al., 1987</xref>) and expansion of mutated clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karen et al., 1999</xref>). However, it should be noted that while overexpression of TCF7L1 increased the incidence of papilloma development in DMBA/TPA treated mice, it did not increase the average size of papilloma (data not shown). Since overexpression of TCF7L1 did not stimulate proliferation of DMBA/TPA induced papilloma per se and did not promote tumor development without DMBA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3C</xref>), it suggests that TCF7L1 may facilitate the transitioning of DMBA-induced mutated cells into premalignant tumors.</p><p>In a xenograft model of human skin SCC, downregulation of <italic>TCF7L1</italic> and its paralogue <italic>TCF7L2</italic> decreased tumor size, indicating that these two LEF/TCF family members, whose functions overlap in skin development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nguyen et al., 2006</xref>), are required for the optimal growth of xenografted tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Conversely, overexpression of TCF7L1 increased tumorigenic capacity of SCC cells in limiting dilution assay and stimulated tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). While overexpression of TCF7L1 stimulated SCC growth in vivo, it did not alter SCC cell proliferation in vitro (data not shown), suggesting that xenografted TCF7L1-overexpressing SCC cells acquire characteristics that confer growth advantage in vivo.</p><p>Our data clearly demonstrate that TCF7L1 exerts a tumorigenic function in both the chemical-induced mouse model of skin SCC and the xenograft model of human skin SCC. Our finding that TCF7L1 overexpressing mice developed papilloma at a higher number and at an earlier time under both DMBA/TPA or DMBA alone treatment indicates that TCF7L1 overexpression contributes to the early step of tumor formation. Since we saw a higher number of TCF7L1-overexpressing mice developed SCC, we infer that TCF7L1 overexpression also influences malignant progression. Our finding that TCF7L1-overexpressing human SCC cells formed larger xenografted tumors and at a higher efficiency further corroborates that TCF7L1 contributes to the malignant nature of SCC cells.</p><p>These data together suggest that elevated expression of TCF7L1 facilitates the transitioning into the premalignant state as well as the progression from the premalignant state to SCC. This model for TCF7L1âs role in the development and progression of skin SCC was also supported by the observation made by Chitsazzadeh et al. that expression of the target genes of TCF7L1 are significantly altered not only between normal skin and papilloma/actinic keratosis samples, but also between papilloma/actinic keratosis samples and skin SCC in both human and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chitsazzadeh et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Since Î²-catenin is critical for tumor growth in the DMBA/TPA model of skin SCC, and both nuclear Î²-catenin and <italic>Tcf7l1</italic> mRNA are upregulated in papillomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Malanchi et al., 2008</xref>), it was thought that TCF7L1âs tumor-promoting role might depend on its binding to Î²-catenin in the canonical WNT signaling pathway. However, our data demonstrate that TCF7L1 promotes tumor growth independently of its interaction with Î²-catenin, requiring only its binding to DNA and Groucho/TLE corepressors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Our results imply that TCF7L1 might act as a transcriptional repressor in its tumor-promoting role, further supporting the model that TCF7L1 functions primarily as a repressor and not as a WNT target gene-activating Î²-catenin cofactor as shown in a variety of developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wray et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pereira et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gribble et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuwahara et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miao et al., 2014</xref>). However, we should note that the deleted region in TCF7L1ÎG encompassing the Groucho/TLE binding domain is quite large and may contain binding interfaces to other proteins. Therefore, our interpretation should be viewed with the caveat that TCF7L1ÎG may be deficient in binding to other factors than just to Groucho/TLE.</p><p>TCF7L1 has been shown to promote tumor growth in both xenograft models of human breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Slyper et al., 2012</xref>) and colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Murphy et al., 2016</xref>), but it is not clear whether TCF7L1 functions as an activator or repressor to exert its tumorigenic role. In colorectal cancer cell line HCT116, downregulation of TCF7L1 increased WNT reporter TOP-FLASH activity in vitro, suggesting that TCF7L1 functions as a repressor. In breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468, overexpression of TCF7L1 together with Î²-catenin increased TOP-FLASH activity, suggesting that it functions as a coactivator with Î²-catenin. Moreover, since downregulation of TCF7L1 in breast cancer cells decreased the expression of some WNT-responsive genes while increasing a different subset, it implies that TCF7L1 can act as an activator or repressor depending on the targets. However, to date no experiments have been conducted in vivo to identify which function of TCF7L1 is required for tumorigenesis. Therefore, although that TCF7L1 may function as an activator and repressor in breast cancer cells, its tumorigenic role may depend only on its function as a repressor. Our work is the first to use deletion mutations of TCF7L1 to show that TCF7L1 does not require binding to Î²-catenin to promote tumor growth. It is possible that this repressor function of TCF7L1 may be similarly required in cancers other than skin SCC, but that remains to be determined experimentally in vivo. What is consistent in all three tissue models (breast, colorectal, and skin) is that TCF7L1 plays a pro-tumorigenic role.</p><p>Since TCF7L1 overexpression promoted and accelerated skin tumor development, we explored possible mechanisms underlying this role. Previous studies have shown that mutation of the <italic>Ras</italic> oncogene is an early event in the DMBA/TPA carcinogenesis model. As early as 3â4 weeks after DMBA treatment, activating mutations in <italic>Hras1</italic> can be detected in the epidermis before any development of papillomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nelson et al., 1992</xref>). Subsequently, these mutations are found in the majority of papillomas that are induced by DMBA/TPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balmain et al., 1984</xref>). We hypothesized that TCF7L1 overexpression may help tumor cells overcome oncogene-induced senescence, which is a phenomenon observed both in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Serrano et al., 1997</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Braig et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Collado et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lazzerini Denchi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Michaloglou et al., 2005</xref>). In tissues where expression of oncogenic HRAS promotes tumor formation, senescence markers are found abundantly in premalignant lesions but are absent in carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Collado et al., 2005</xref>). These findings led to the model that overcoming senescence is a crucial step in malignant progression. Indeed, in a separate study, premalignant tumors induced by oncogenic HRAS overexpression progressed into malignancy only after the senescence pathway was abrogated by genetic ablation of the tumor suppressor gene <italic>Trp53</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sarkisian et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We found that TCF7L1 overexpression overrides oncogenic HRAS-induced senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Although these in vitro results suggest that this may be a mechanism by which TCF7L1 overexpression increases tumor incidence and growth, we currently lack the in vivo data to support this claim due to technical limitations associated with detecting senescent markers in mouse epidermis. Detection of SA-Î²-gal has been reported in aged human epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dimri et al., 1995</xref>), but its staining has been negative in aged mouse epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gannon et al., 2011</xref>) unless senescence is activated by genetic manipulation of senescence genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tokarsky-Amiel et al., 2013</xref>). We were unable to detect SA-Î²-gal activity in aged mouse epidermis or in tested skin papillomas (data not shown). Similarly, by immunostaining for expression of p16<sup>INK4a</sup> as well as LaminB, whose respective increased and decreased levels have been used to show senescence in aged human skins, we failed to see expected changes in aged mouse epidermis. Indeed, although these markers have been used to differentiate young and aged human skin, they have so far failed to be validated in aged mouse skin by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gannon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tokarsky-Amiel et al., 2013</xref>). Due to this technical limitation to detect senescence in mouse skin in vivo, our finding regarding TCF7L1 overriding senescence is based only on in vitro experimental data. Nevertheless, we could conclude that at least in vitro TCF7L1 is able to override HRAS-induced senescence mainly through its DNA- and Groucho/TLE corepressor binding domains and not on itsÂ Î²-catenin binding domain, similarly to its ability to promote tumor growth.</p><p>Besides overcoming HRAS-induced senescence, prolonged TCF7L1 overexpression also stimulated proliferation of both murine interfollicular epidermis and hair follicles in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). It has been shown that quiescent hair follicle stem cells are less prone to cancer initiation in response to activating <italic>Kras</italic> mutations (<italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup></italic>) and p53 ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">White et al., 2014</xref>). It is thus possible that TCF7L1 overexpression increases tumor incidence and/or progression by promoting the proliferation of quiescent stem cells with oncogenic mutations. Since non-TCF7L1 overexpressing epidermal cells in the TCF7L1-overexpressing epidermis (due to mosaicism) also showed increased proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), we surmise that overexpression of TCF7L1 might affect proliferation in a paracrine manner. However, paracrine effect of TCF7L1 on proliferation remains to be tested, as we lack an in vitro assay to evaluate the effect of conditioned-media from TCF7L1-overexpressing cells, given that TCF7L1 overexpressing cells have similar proliferative capacity in vitro.</p><p>Although TCF7L1-overexpressing skins are hyperproliferative, control and TCF7L1-induced papilloma do not differ in size. Since overexpression of TCF7L1 increased papilloma incidence but not papilloma size, we postulate that TCF7L1 facilitates the transformation of mutated cells into premalignant state and contributes little to growth of papilloma. Moreover, since TCF7L1-induced mice developed more SCCs, we speculate that overexpression of TCF7L1 also stimulates the progression of papilloma into malignancy.</p><p>We should point out that in contrast to the DMBA/TPA model where TCF7L1 overexpression increased proliferation of epidermal cells in skins that have yet to become papilloma but not in the papilloma themselves, in a xenograft model overexpression of TCF7L1 increased proliferation of SCC cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). We found that TCF7L1 overexpression also induced cell migration in human SCC cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), as was observed in mouse primary keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miao et al., 2014</xref>). Similar to its ability to increase tumor growth and suppress oncogene-induced senescence, its promigratory function requires binding to DNA and Groucho/TLE and not to Î²-catenin.</p><p>Our transcriptome analyses of SCC cells expressing TCF7L1 or its mutant variants found that overexpression of TCF7L1 or TCF7L1ÎN transforms the global gene expression profile to a similar extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This is not surprising given that overexpression of TCF7L1 and TCF7L1ÎN produced a similar effect on tumor growth, OIS, and cell migration. Since cells overexpressing TCF7L1 and TCF7L1ÎN showed the highest tumorigenic activity while TCF7L1*-overexpressing cells were indistinguishable from control cells, we chose to focus on genes that were altered by TCF7L1 and TCF7L1ÎN but not TCF7L1*. Using this metric, we identified a specified induced and repressed set of genes controlled by TCF7L1 that may be important to the growth of skin SCC. We should note that since our profiling studies were performed on SCC13 cells, which are already malignant, our study is likely to identify only TCF7L1-responsive genes that contribute to increased SCC growth and may miss out the downstream effectors of TCF7L1 that facilitate the early step of tumor formation.</p><p>Further GO analysis of specified genes altered by TCF7L1 and TCF7L1ÎN in SCC13 cells identified the inflammatory response as the top altered biological process. Induced genes include TNF secreted factors such as <italic>LTA</italic> (160.9 fold), <italic>LTB</italic> (8.2 fold), <italic>TNF</italic> (23.3 fold), <italic>TNFSF8</italic> (2.6 fold), <italic>TNFSF10</italic> (4.2 fold), <italic>TNFSF14</italic> (3.0 fold), and <italic>TNFSF18</italic> (3.1 fold), pro-inflammatory factors such as <italic>IL6</italic> (4.6 fold), <italic>IL8</italic> (2.9 fold), <italic>LCN2</italic> (27.7 fold) and <italic>MMP9</italic> (13.3 fold) and a subset of TNF receptors, including <italic>TNFRSF1B</italic> (13.7 fold), <italic>TNFRSF8</italic> (3.4 fold), <italic>TNFRSF9</italic> (3.6 fold), <italic>NGFR</italic> (5.5 fold), and <italic>TNFRSF18</italic> (4.1 fold). TNF and IL6 have been well defined as inflammatory cytokines in cancer-associated inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Suganuma et al., 2002</xref>). Mice deficient of TNF or IL6 are more resistant to DMBA/TPA-induced skin tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moore et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ancrile et al., 2007</xref>). Our study discovered a causative link between TCF7L1 up-regulation and cancer-associated inflammation in skin tumorigenesis, suggesting that TCF7L1 may facilitate tumor growth through induction of a subset of cytokines in a paracrine manner.</p><p>Of the top altered inflammatory genes, we focused on <italic>LCN2</italic>, because we previously found that LCN2 acts as a major downstream effector of TCF7L1 that induces murine epidermal cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miao et al., 2014</xref>). The paracrine effect of TCF7L1 on cell migration in vitro and wound closure in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miao et al., 2014</xref>) suggested that the secreted LCN2 might be a prime effector of TCF7L1 in skin tumorigenesis. Consistent with its proposed role in skin SCC, expression of LCN2 is undetectable in normal epidermis and is robustly upregulated in both murine and human skin SCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">2</xref>). While overexpression of TCF7L1 in skin induced expression of LCN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), it did not further increase the already upregulated level of LCN2 in the tumors (data not shown). Since LCN2 is upregulated in TCF7L1-induced skins but not upregulated any higher in TCF7L1-induced tumors, it suggests that factors regulating the expression of LCN2 including TCF7L1 may already be in excess in the tumors; hence further increases of TCF7L1 do not affect expression of LCN2. Since overexpression of TCF7L1 predisposed DMBA/TPA treated skins to develop tumors at a higher rate but did not affect tumor size, it suggests that upregulation of LCN2 by TCF7L1 in the pre-tumor state may be facilitating the transitioning of mutated cells into tumor cells.</p><p>In our xenograft model, we found that downregulating LCN2 in human SCC cells counteracted the pro-tumorigenic and promigratory effect of TCF7L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10EâG</xref>), demonstrating that LCN2 acts a major downstream effector of TCF7L1 in these cells. Although LCN2 has been reported to stimulate chemotaxis of neutrophils in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shao et al., 2016</xref>), we found that downregulating LCN2 did not diminish the ability of TCF7L1 to stimulate neutrophil infiltration in tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s3">Figure 10âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Together, the data show that TCF7L1 requires LCN2 to induce growth and migration but works independently of LCN2 to stimulate neutrophil infiltration.</p><p>Apart from its role in inducing cell migration, which other cellular processes LCN2 acts on to stimulate tumor growth remains to be elucidated. Moreover, how overexpression of TCF7L1 leads to increased transcription of <italic>LCN2</italic> remains to be elucidated. Since TCF7L1-induced <italic>LCN2</italic> expression depends mainly on DNA interaction but not on Î²-catenin interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>), we suspect that TCF7L1 acts on yet to be identified direct targets that consequently bring about the induction of <italic>LCN2</italic>. Given that LCN2 is induced in the majority of human skin SCC, and is expressed in both TCF7L1-positive and -negative samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10âfigure supplement 2</xref>), factors other than TCF7L1 must also upregulate LCN2 in tumors. Indeed, NF-ÎºB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Karlsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mahadevan et al., 2011</xref>), C/EBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glaros et al., 2012</xref>), and NFAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gaudineau et al., 2012</xref>) all have been shown to activate expression of LCN2 in response to various stress and injury stimuli.</p><p>In summary, we established that TCF7L1 promotes the development of papilloma and skin SCC, affecting both the early step of tumor formation as well as the progression step into malignancy in the DMBA/TPA model. Using a xenograft model of human skin SCC, we demonstrated that TCF7L1 stimulates tumor growth, suppresses oncogene-induced senescence, and accelerates tumor cell migration, independently of its interaction with Î²-catenin. Although we do not yet know the direct repressed target genes of TCF7L1 that contribute to skin tumorigenesis, we clearly showed that LCN2 is a major downstream effector of TCF7L1 that drives tumor growth. Our findings thus provide mechanistic insight into a transcription factor that is upregulated in multiple aggressive cancer types and plays an important role in skin tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MaterialsÂ andÂ methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice breeding and carcinogenesis protocol</title><p><italic>KRT14-rtTA</italic> transgenic mice (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:008099">IMSR_JAX:008099</ext-link>) were crossed with <italic>TRE-mycTcf7l1</italic> mice to generate the double transgenic line in FVB/N background as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nguyen et al., 2006</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript examines the role of Tcf3 in cancer by focusing on effects of Tcf3 expression during the development and progression of squamous cell carcinoma using mouse and human systems. The authors strongly and clearly show that the Î²-catenin interaction domain of Tcf3 is not necessary for its effects on skin tumor promotion. Through RNA-seq analysis from xenografts overexpressing different mutant forms of Tcf3, the authors attribute the effects observed to induction of Lipocalin-2. This manuscript has important findings relating to the role of Tcf3 and its interaction with the Wnt signaling pathway, and upon the necessary revisions, can prove interesting for the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript does not sufficiently address or discuss how Tcf3 could cause the effects observed in skin but appear to be different in breast cancer? Is the repressor-only effect of Tcf3 something specific to SCC, or is it indicative of a mechanism broadly relevant to cancer in other organs? Can the authors experimentally test this or add a discussion of these two organ systems?</p><p>2) The manuscript starts off showing that Tcf3 overexpression in a GEMM using the K14 promoter. However, the authors do not make use of the advantages of such a GEMM in the rest of the manuscript. All the follow up experiments are based on xenograft models in immune-deficient mice. The cell lines are extremely useful for determining the function of their different Tcf3 mutants, but it would be important to analyze the data in the original mouse model. For example, is Lcn-2 upregulated in papillomas and SCCs in the Tcf-3 induced mice? Would the tumor incidence be reduced, if Lcn-2 was deleted in this GEMM?

This would suggest that the main role of Tcf3 is in tumor promotion, likely by replacing the inflammatory action of TPA. The authors should analyze the immune compartment of these tumors, and determine whether the Tcf3-induced tumors have increased inflammatory infiltrates and mediators to account for the increased tumor burden.

However, there are no data demonstrating that TCF7L1 acts differently in breast and skin in vivo. Our work is in fact the first to use deletion mutations of TCF7L1 to show that TCF7L1 does not require binding to Î²-catenin to promote tumor growth. It is possible that this repressor function of TCF7L1 may be similarly required in other types of cancer besides skin SCC, but that remains to be determined experimentally in vivoin those other cancer models.</p><p>Although TCF7L1 plays a tumorigenic role in xenograft models of both breast and colorectal cancer, no experiments were conducted to identify which function of TCF7L1 is required for its tumorigenic role in these two models. In colorectal cancer cell line HCT116, downregulation of TCF7L1 increases WNT reporter TOP- FLASH activity in vitro, suggesting that TCF7L1 functions as a repressor. However, downregulating TCF7L1 in breast cancer cells decreases expression of some WNT-responsive genes and increases expression of others, implying that TCF7L1 functions as an activator or repressor depending on its targets.</p><p>Although TCF7L1 may function as an activator or repressor on different sets of target genes in breast cancer cells, its tumorigenic role may depend only on its function as a repressor. Whether the repressor function of TCF7L1 is broadly required in its tumorigenic role will need to be demonstrated in different cancer models using the similar deletion mutations of TCF7L1 that we have used.</p><p>We have revised the Discussion section to include the above points.</p><p><italic>2) The manuscript starts off showing that Tcf3 overexpression in a GEMM using the K14 promoter. However, the authors do not make use of the advantages of such a GEMM in the rest of the manuscript. All the follow up experiments are based on xenograft models in immune-deficient mice. The cell lines are extremely useful for determining the function of their different Tcf3 mutants, but it would be important to analyze the data in the original mouse model. For example, is Lcn-2 upregulated in papillomas and SCCs in the Tcf-3 induced mice?</italic> </p><p>Thank you for these comments, we now include data showing that expression of LCN2 is undetectable in normal skin but induced in both mouse and human skin SCC (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10âfigure supplements 1 and 2</xref>). Moreover, overexpression of TCF7L1 in skin induces expression of LCN2 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). However, once tumors are formed, overexpression of TCF7L1 does not further increase the already upregulated level of LCN2 in the tumors.</p><p>We have included the above findings in the new supplementary figures and revised the Discussion section as follows:</p><p>âConsistent with its proposed role in skin SCC, expression of LCN2 is undetectable in normal epidermis and is robustly upregulated in both murine and human skin SCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10âfigure supplements 1, 2</xref>). [â¦] Since LCN2 is upregulated in TCF7L1-induced skins but not upregulated any higher in TCF7L1-induced tumors, it suggests that factors regulating the expression of LCN2 including TCF7L1 may already be in excess in the tumors; hence further increases of TCF7L1 do not affect expression of LCN2.â</p><p><italic>Would the tumor incidence be reduced, if Lcn-2 was deleted in this GEMM?</italic> </p><p>We are aware that the xenograft model can be used only to dissect whether TCF7L1 requires LCN2 to promote growth of xenografted SCC cells and cannot address whether TCF7L1 requires LCN2 to increase tumor incidence, which could only be addressed with the DMBA/TPA model using GEMM. However, the GEMM experiment requires the intercrossing the tet-inducible <italic>Tcf7l1</italic> line, which is in FVB/N background, and <italic>Lcn2</italic> null mice, which are in C57BL/6 background. Since mice in C57BL/6 background have a different propensity for tumorigenesis, we would need to backcross the line with the FVB/N line before using the mice in the DMBA/TPA induced skin SCC model. Given that multiple crosses and generations are required to obtain the desired genotype, it would take more than 2 years to receive results from experiments conducted in tet-inducible <italic>Tcf7l1</italic> mice in the background of <italic>Lcn2</italic> null line. For this reason, we used the xenograft model to dissect TCF7L1âs requirement for LCN2 in its tumor-promoting role, while understanding its limitation.</p><p>In order to identify which stage of tumorigenesis affected by TCF7L1 requires induction of LCN2, we would need to inducibly ablate <italic>Lcn2</italic> in the tet-inducible <italic>Tcf7l1</italic> mouse model at different stages of tumor development (pre- and post-papilloma formation, pre- and post-SCC). Although a new <italic>Lcn2</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> line has recently been generated (Mosialou et al., Nature 2017) which we hope to use in the future, accomplishing this is beyond the time frame for the revision of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>Would turning off Tcf3 by removing Dox lead to decrease of tumorigenesis?</italic> </p><p>We agree that results from this experiment would reveal whether sustained overexpression of TCF7L1 is required to sustain tumor growth, progression into SCC or that it contributes to only papilloma development. Results from this experiment will provide additional insights into the role of TCF7L1 in tumorigenesis process; however, including the breeding time this experiment requires at a minimum 36 weeks, which is outside the time frame (2-3 months) allowed for resubmission. The proposed experiment requires putting 8 week old mice on dox-containing or normal diet and then subjecting them to DMBA/TPA treatment. And then after tumors are formed at different time points post DMBA/TPA treatment, half of the dox-diet group will be put back on a normal diet with continued TPA treatment for additional weeks until the end point of the experiment.</p><p><italic>3) The authors show that Tcf3 induction can lead to tumor development with DMBA treatment only. This would suggest that the main role of Tcf3 is in tumor promotion, likely by replacing the inflammatory action of TPA. The authors should analyze the immune compartment of these tumors, and determine whether the Tcf3-induced tumors have increased inflammatory infiltrates and mediators to account for the increased tumor burden. IL-22 has been shown to link inflammation to keratinocyte proliferation, thus, it should be measured in the Tcf-3 induced tumors.</italic> </p><p>As advised, we immunostained uninduced and TCF7L1-induced skins that were treated with vehicle control, DMBA, or DMBA/TPA. We did not observe any obvious changes in the amount of neutrophils and macrophages between the control and TCF7L1-induced skins under all 3 treatments. However, using flow cytometry analysis of xenografted dissociated tumors, we did observe increased neutrophil infiltration in TCF7L1-overexpressing tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10âfigure supplement 2</xref>). We have included these findings in the revised result and Discussion sections.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we also examined expression of IL-22 in the TCF7L1-induced skins and did not observe any difference between the control and induced group. Indeed IL-22 is secreted by immune cells and has been reported to affect keratinocyte proliferation and migration; however, IL-22 itself is not expressed in epidermal cells. Our RNA-seq confirms that the expression of IL-22 is undetectable in SCC cells and unaffected by overexpression of TCF7L1.</p><p><italic>4) Lcn-2 deletion has been shown to decrease neutrophil infiltrate in a chemically-induced psoriasis-like disease model (Aldara treatment) (Shao S et al., 2016, JID). Aldara is used as a treatment for SCCs in patients, thus it would be interesting to determine whether Lcn-2 deletion in the setting of skin tumors leads to depletion of neutrophils.</italic> </p><p>We grafted SCC cells that were engineered to express vector control or <italic>Tcf7l1</italic> with nonspecific shRNAs or shRNAs against <italic>LNC2</italic>. As expected, TCF7L1-overexpressing tumors were larger than control tumors, but the TCF7L1-overexpressing tumors were smaller when co-expressing shRNAs against LCN2. Through flow cytometry analysis of dissociated tumors, we found that overexpression of TCF7L1 resulted in increased neutrophil infiltration but downregulation of LCN2 in the TCF7L1-overexpressing tumors did not impinge on TCF7L1âs ability to increase neutrophil infiltration. This result leads us to conclude that while TCF7L1 requires LCN2 to promote tumor growth, it works independently of LCN2 to stimulate neutrophil infiltration. These results also show the complexity of the role of TCF7L1 in the tumorigenic process and make our profiling experiments valuable for further future mechanistic dissections.</p><p>We have included the new finding in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10âfigure supplement 2</xref> and revised the Results section as follows:</p><p>âSince LCN2 has been shown to stimulate neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro(Shao et al. 2016), and inflammation facilitates tumor growth, we evaluated whether overexpressing TCF7L1 increases neutrophil infiltration in tumors and whether downregulating LCN2 alters their infiltration. [â¦] Together, our data therefore imply that TCF7L1 accelerates human SCC cell migration and tumor growth through induction of LCN2 but does not require LCN2 to stimulate neutrophil infiltrationâ.</p><p><italic>5) Can authors determine whether the staining of LCN-2 and TCF3 correlate in human SCCs? In other words, do the cells expressing TCF3 also express</italic> LCN-2?</p><p>As recommended, we immunostained human skin SCC samples for LCN2 and TCF7L1 expression and found that while only 10 out of 16 samples expressed TCF7L1, 15 samples expressed LCN2. Although all of the TCF7L1-positive samples expressed LCN2, 83.3% of TCF7L1-negative samples also expressed LCN2. These results imply that induction of LCN2 in human skin SCC is not dependent solely on TCF7L1.</p><p>We have added these data in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s3">Figure 10âfigure supplement 3</xref> and included our interpretation in the revised Discussion section as follows:</p><p>âGiven that LCN2 is induced in the majority of human skin SCC, and is expressed in both TCF7L1-positive and -negative samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10âfigure supplement 2</xref>), factors other than TCF7L1 must also upregulate LCN2 in tumors. Indeed, NF-ÎºB (Shen et al. 2006; Li et al. 2009; Karlsen et al. 2010; Mahadevan et al. 2011), C/EBP (Shen et al. 2006; Glaros et al. 2012), and NFAT1 (Gaudineau et al. 2012) all have been shown to activate expression of LCN2 in response to various stress and injury stimuli.â</p></body></sub-article></article>
