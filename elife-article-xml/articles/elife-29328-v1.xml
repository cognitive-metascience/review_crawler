pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29328.001</object-id><p>To build the spindle at mitosis, motors exert spatially regulated forces on microtubules. We know that dynein pulls on mammalian spindle microtubule minus-ends, and this localized activity at ends is predicted to allow dynein to cluster microtubules into poles. How dynein becomes enriched at minus-ends is not known. Here, we use quantitative imaging and laser ablation to show that NuMA targets dynactin to minus-ends, localizing dynein activity there. NuMA is recruited to new minus-ends independently of dynein and more quickly than dynactin; both NuMA and dynactin display specific, steady-state binding at minus-ends. NuMA localization to minus-ends involves a C-terminal region outside NuMA’s canonical microtubule-binding domain and is independent of minus-end binders γ-TuRC, CAMSAP1, and KANSL1/3. Both NuMA’s minus-end-binding and dynein-dynactin-binding modules are required to rescue focused, bipolar spindle organization. Thus, NuMA may serve as a mitosis-specific minus-end cargo adaptor, targeting dynein activity to minus-ends to cluster spindle microtubules into poles.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29328.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Every time a cell divides, it needs to duplicate its DNA and evenly distribute it between the two new ‘daughter’ cells. To move and distribute DNA, the cell builds a large machine called a spindle, which is made of stiff cables called microtubules.</p><p>Many proteins, including a motor called dynein, help to organize the spindle’s microtubules. One of dynein’s jobs is to cluster all microtubules at the two tips of the spindle, pulling them into shape. Without this clustering, spindles have the wrong shape and structure and can make mistakes when moving DNA.</p><p>Microtubules have a ‘plus’ end and a ‘minus’ end, and motor proteins usually only travel in one specified direction. Dynein, for example, moves towards the minus end of microtubules, which is where most of the clustering happens. It can form a complex with other proteins that help clustering, one of which is called NuMA. Until now, it was thought that dynein transports NuMA to the minus ends.</p><p>To test this model, Hueschen et al. studied dividing human cells under a microscope and isolated minus ends with the help of a laser. The experiments showed that, in fact, NuMA gets to minus ends independently of dynein. Once it is on the minus ends, NuMA grabs hold of another protein complex called dynactin, which then gathers dynein. Dynein then pulls the spindles into shape from the minus ends. When NuMA was experimentally removed from the cells, dynein-dynactin complexes were scattered along the entire length of the microtubule instead of pulling specifically on minus-ends, which resulted in disorganized spindles. Thus, where dynein complexes pull determines what spindle shape they build.</p><p>Hueschen et al. also showed that dynein complexes only pull on minus-ends while the cell divides, which makes sense, because NuMA remains hidden in the cell nucleus for the rest of the time. Together, these results suggest that NuMA makes sure dynein pulls specifically on the minus-ends of the microtubules to tighten the spindle at the right time.</p><p>A next step will be to test how the mechanical properties of the spindle are changed without dynein pulling on minus-ends. A better knowledge of how different proteins work together to build the spindle and help cells divide can help us understand what goes wrong when cells divide abnormally, as in the case of cancer

motors help remodel the microtubule cytoskeleton into a bipolar assembly of microtubules called the spindle. The spindle’s bipolar architecture is essential to its function – accurate chromosome segregation. In mammalian spindles, microtubule plus-ends mechanically couple to chromosomes, while microtubule minus-ends are focused into two poles that dictate where chromosomes are transported at anaphase. To build the spindle’s architecture, motors must exert spatially regulated forces on microtubules. Microtubule ends offer platforms for such localized regulation, since they are structurally distinct. Indeed, motor recruitment and activity at plus-ends is well-documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al., 2006</xref>), but motor regulation at minus-ends is less well understood.</p><p>Dynein is a minus-end-directed motor which slides parallel spindle microtubules to focus their minus-ends into spindle poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heald et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Verde et al., 1991</xref>), working in complex with its adaptor dynactin and the microtubule-binding protein NuMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gaglio et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Merdes et al., 1996</xref>). The clustering of parallel microtubules into poles presents a geometric problem when forces are indiscriminately applied all along microtubules: inversely oriented motors between parallel microtubules will oppose each other, resulting in gridlock, unless symmetry is broken by dynein enrichment at microtubule minus-ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hyman and Karsenti, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McIntosh et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Surrey et al., 2001</xref>). In computational models, localizing a minus-end-directed motor at microtubule ends permits microtubule clustering into asters or poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Foster et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goshima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nedelec and Surrey, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Surrey et al., 2001</xref>) and the emergence of a robust steady-state spindle length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Burbank et al., 2007</xref>). More recently, experimental work has shown that dynein-dynactin and NuMA do indeed selectively localize to spindle minus-ends, with dynein pulling on them after kinetochore-fiber (k-fiber) ablation in mammalian spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Elting et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sikirzhytski et al., 2014</xref>). This is consistent with suggestions that dynein and NuMA capture and pull on distal k-fiber minus-ends in monopolar spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khodjakov et al., 2003</xref>). Altogether, these findings demonstrate the importance (in silico) and existence (in vivo) of localized dynein activity at spindle microtubule minus-ends.</p><p>How dynein becomes localized at minus-ends remains an open question. Dynein may be enriched near minus-ends because it walks toward them on microtubules and piles up when it runs out of track; indeed, pile-up of dynein has been observed at minus-ends in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Soundararajan and Bullock, 2014</xref>) and can drive minus-end clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tan et al., 2017</xref>). Alternatively, the exposed α-tubulin interface at minus-ends is structurally distinct and could bind an adaptor protein that specifically recruits dynein, analogous to recruitment at canonical dynein cargoes like organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kardon and Vale, 2009</xref>). NuMA can target dynein-dynactin to the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lechler and Fuchs, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nguyen-Ngoc et al., 2007</xref>) and thus could be one such adaptor. However, in vitro NuMA has shown no direct affinity for minus-ends specifically, binding all along the microtubule lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Du et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Forth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haren and Merdes, 2002</xref>) or at both ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Seldin et al., 2016</xref>), unlike three proteins known to interact directly with minus-ends at mitosis: γ-TuRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zheng et al., 1995</xref>), CAMSAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhmanova and Hoogenraad, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hendershott and Vale, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>) and KANSL1/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meunier et al., 2015</xref>). In cells, NuMA is thought to require dynein activity to carry it to minus-ends and spindle poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Merdes et al., 2000</xref>), where it anchors spindle microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dionne et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gaglio et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heald et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Silk et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, it remains unclear whether dynein-dynactin and NuMA have specific binding sites at minus-ends, and if so, whether they are recruited by known minus-end binders. Finally, knowing how dynein is targeted to minus-ends would make it possible to test the in vivo role of minus-end-localized – compared to indiscriminately-localized – forces in spindle organization.</p><p>Here, we use laser ablation in cells to create new, isolated minus-ends in the mammalian spindle, and quantitative imaging to map protein recruitment to these ends and its mechanistic basis. We demonstrate that NuMA binds at minus-ends independently of dynein, and that NuMA targets dynactin – and thereby dynein activity – to spindle minus-ends. This challenges the prevailing model that dynein delivers NuMA to spindle minus-ends and poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Merdes et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Radulescu and Cleveland, 2010</xref>). NuMA localization to minus-ends is independent of known direct minus-end binders γ-TuRC, CAMSAP1, and KANSL1/3, and it involves both NuMA’s canonical microtubule-binding domain and an additional region of its C-terminus. Thus, NuMA – which is sequestered in the nucleus at interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lydersen and Pettijohn, 1980</xref>) – may serve as a mitosis-specific minus-end cargo adaptor, recruiting dynein activity to spindle minus-ends. Both NuMA’s minus-end-binding domain and dynactin-binding domain are required for correct spindle architecture, supporting long-standing in silico predictions that localizing dynein to minus-ends enables effective clustering of parallel microtubules into poles. These findings identify a mechanism for mitosis-specific recruitment of dynein to microtubule minus-ends and, more broadly, illustrate how spatial regulation of local forces may give rise to larger scale cytoskeletal architectures.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dynactin and NuMA display mitosis-specific, steady-state binding at microtubule minus-ends</title><p>To visualize the spatial targeting of the dynein-dynactin complex to microtubule minus-ends – which are normally buried in dense mammalian spindles – we used nocodazole washout and laser ablation to create resolvable minus-ends in mitotic cells. First, to determine whether dynein-dynactin and NuMA localize to individual microtubule minus-ends, we treated mammalian PtK2 and RPE1 cells with the microtubule-depolymerizing drug nocodazole and fixed cells 6–8 min after drug washout to capture acentrosomal microtubules with clearly visible plus- and minus-ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). p150<italic><sup>Glued</sup></italic> (p150, a dynactin subunit) and NuMA strongly co-localized at one end of these individual microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), with a clear binding preference for minus-ends over the microtubule lattice or the plus-end when polarity was marked by EB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

To do so, we used laser ablation of k-fibers in PtK2 cells to create new minus-ends within the spindle body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). By spatially and temporally synchronizing the creation of a bundle of minus-ends, laser ablation allowed for dynamic measurements of the recruitment to minus-ends of GFP-tagged dynactin (Arp1A) and NuMA and comparison to a direct minus-end binding protein, CAMSAP1. High dynein background in the cytoplasm prevented accurate recruitment kinetics measurements of the motor itself. Dynactin, NuMA, and CAMSAP1 robustly recognized new microtubule minus-ends within the spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>). The kinetics of dynactin and NuMA recruitment to minus-ends were distinct from CAMSAP1, which reached a max intensity after approximately 5–10 s, but then decreased in intensity as if its binding sites at the minus-end were gradually obstructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>). Unlike CAMSAP1, dynactin and NuMA intensities reached a stable plateau, suggesting that binding saturates, reaching a steady-state. This finite binding is consistent with a truly end-specific localization (rather than localization along the unbounded lattice <italic>near</italic> the minus-end). In addition, the rate of NuMA or dynactin accumulation at new minus-ends did not correlate with the length of k-fiber stubs created by ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), which could indicate that recruitment rate is set by the number of individual microtubule minus-ends (which is similar across k-fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McEwen et al., 1997</xref>]) rather than k-fiber length.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-29328-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29328.005</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Dynactin is robustly recruited to new spindle microtubule minus-ends.</title><p>See also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. Live confocal imaging of a PtK2 cell expressing GFP-Arp1A, with spindle microtubules labeled by siR-tubulin.

Alternatively, dynein-dynactin could walk toward minus-ends, carrying NuMA, and pile up or dwell there (‘Walk and Pile-up,’ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To test the ‘Walk and Pile-up’ model, we inhibited dynein-dynactin in PtK2 spindles by over-expressing p50 (dynamitin), resulting in fully unfocused k-fiber arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The ‘Walk and Pile-up’ model predicts that in the absence of dynein-dynactin transport, NuMA – which requires dynactin for its interaction with dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Merdes et al., 2000</xref>) – should not reach minus-ends.

However, a lack of mechanistic information and tools made it difficult to test such hypotheses in vivo. The present study reveals a mechanism for direct recruitment of the motor to minus-ends, via NuMA, and is consistent with the prediction that targeting dynein-dynactin to the sides of microtubules is not sufficient for robust spindle organization. Both the minus-end-binding module (‘C’) and dynein-dynactin-binding module (‘N’) of NuMA are required for bipolar focusing, while the distance between them is not critical for function. Fusing the dynein-dynactin-binding module to the Tau microtubule binding domain is not sufficient, suggesting a requirement for minus-end-specific forces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). However, we cannot formally exclude that features of the NuMA C-terminus (missing from ‘N-Tau’) other than minus-end binding enable rescue of pole focusing, or that while N-Tau recruits dynactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), it cannot effectively couple to dynein. Altogether, the work is consistent with a model for mammalian spindle organization in which targeting poleward force to microtubule minus-ends (by NuMA-mediated dynactin recruitment) is critical for organizing microtubules into a focused, bipolar array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

Laser ablation (30 3-ns pulses at 20 Hz) with 551 nm light was performed using the galvo-controlled MicroPoint Laser System (Andor, Belfast, UK).

Cells were incubated with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 hr at room temperature, and then with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Secondary antibodies ((anti-mouse Cy3B; Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA); anti-rabbit AF647 (Life Tech, Carlsbad,CA)) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Antibody incubations were followed by four washes with 0.2% BSA in PBS. Samples were stored in PBS during confocal imaging, and coverslip grid was used to re-find the individual ablated cell. For 3D STORM imaging, samples were mounted on glass slides with a standard STORM imaging buffer consisting of 5% (w/v) glucose, 100 mM cysteamine, 0.8 mg/mL glucose oxidase, and 40 µg/mL catalase in 1M Tris-HCI (pH 7.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rust et al., 2006</xref>). Coverslips were sealed using Cytoseal 60. STORM imaging was performed on a homebuilt setup based on a modified Nikon Eclipse Ti-E inverted fluorescence microscope using a Nikon CFI Plan Apo λ 100x oil immersion objective (NA 1.45). Dye molecules were photoswitched to the dark state and imaged using either 647- or 560 nm lasers (MPB Communications, Montreal, CAN); these lasers were passed through an acousto-optic tunable filter and introduced through an optical fiber into the back focal plane of the microscope and onto the sample at intensities of ~2 kW cm<sup>−2</sup>. A translation stage was used to shift the laser beams towards the edge of the objective so that light reached the sample at incident angles slightly smaller than the critical angle of the glass-water interface. A 405 nm laser was used concurrently with either the 647- or 560 nm lasers to reactivate fluorophores into the emitting state. The power of the 405 nm laser (typical range 0–1 W cm<sup>−2</sup>) was adjusted during image acquisition so that at any given instant, only a small, optically resolvable fraction of the fluorophores in the sample were in the emitting state. Emission was recorded with an Andor iXon Ultra 897 EM-CCD camera at a framerate of 220 Hz, for a total of ~120,000 frames per image. For 3D STORM imaging, a cylindrical lens of focal length 1 m was inserted into the imaging path so that images of single molecules were elongated in opposite directions for molecules on the proximal and distal sides of the focal plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2008</xref>). Two-color imaging was performed via sequential imaging of targets labeled by AF647 and Cy3B.

To test microtubule re-growth in the presence of gatastatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), all cells were treated with 10 μM STLC for 6 hr to create monopolar spindles. For cold treatment, cells were then placed on ice; after 1 hr, 30 μM gatastatin or equivalent (0.1%) DMSO was added. After 10 more minutes on ice, cells were moved to room temperature for 1 min before fixation. Control cells (no ice) were incubated in media containing 30 μM gatastatin or DMSO for 11 min at room temperature before fixation. For all microtubule re-growth experiments after nocodazole washout, cells were treated with 5 μM nocodazole (M1404; Sigma) for 15 min at 37°C.

To measure GFP intensity at ablation-created minus-ends over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), we used a home-written Matlab (R2012a Version 7.4) program to integrate GFP intensity within a 1.4 μm-diameter circle centered on the manually-tracked k-fiber minus-end, and to measure local background intensity within a surrounding 2.7 μm-diameter ‘donut’.

After background subtraction, the intensity measured at the cut site during the three frames before ablation (k-fiber intensity) was averaged and set to zero. For NuMA and Arp1A, we then fit a sigmoid function (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></inline-formula> where <italic>y</italic> = intensity and <italic>x</italic> = time) to each trace, normalized to plateau height (<italic>a</italic> = 1), and solved for the time <italic>b</italic> at which <italic>y</italic> = 0.5*<italic>a</italic> to determine time to half-maximum intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). For CAMSAP1, we normalized each trace to peak height (mean intensity from t = 5 s to t = 20 s) and found the first point at which intensity passed 0.5 to determine time to half-maximum intensity. Finally, to generate mean intensity traces, data from all traces were collected into 5 s wide bins in time and their intensities were averaged. Stub length (distance between k-fiber plus- and minus-ends, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) was measured in ImageJ at the first frame following ablation.</p><p>Minus-end position data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) were generated by manual tracking of ablation-created k-fiber minus-ends (marked by GFP-CAMSAP1) and spindle poles in time-lapse videos, using a second home-written Matlab program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Elting et al., 2014</xref>). Nearest neighbor distances between NuMA puncta in STORM imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>) were measured as the center-to-center distance from each NuMA puncta to its nearest neighboring puncta. NuMA truncation rescue capability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) reports the percentage of bipolar spindles with two focused poles compared to disorganized spindle architecture characteristic of NuMA knockout (detached centrosomes, loss of k-fiber focusing into two poles).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Anna Akhmanova (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Reto Gassmann (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Hueschen and co-workers use microscopy, laser ablation and molecular genetic techniques to investigate NuMA's role in regulating dynein and dynactin within the mitotic spindle. Their findings include the observation that NuMA localizes rapidly to newly created microtubule minus ends, and that this behaviour does not appear to depend on dynein, dynactin, or known minus-end binders γ-TuRC, CAMSAP1, and KANSL1/3. Conversely, the localization of dynactin (and, by inference, dynein) does depend on NuMA. The experiments suggest a specific region of NuMA autonomously recognizes minus ends, thereby recruiting dynein activity there. This work provides interesting evidence regarding the hierarchy of minus end association between NuMA, dynein, and dynactin, while raising a number of mechanistic puzzles and experimental queries.</p><p>This manuscript exhibits rigor in quantifying the localization kinetics of microtubule minus-end-binding proteins and in using knockout cell lines to perform clean molecular replacement experiments. The results are well presented with sound statistical analysis and fully support the authors' conclusions. The central idea of the study – NuMA targets dynein motor activity specifically to microtubule minus ends, and not vice versa as previously thought – is an important novel insight that will be of great interest to motor biochemists, developmental biologists and cell biologists.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Minus-end recognition</p><p>In several places in the manuscript, it is stated that NuMA &quot;recognizes&quot; minus ends. To many, this will imply a direct interaction, which is not explicitly tested in this work. The authors state that previous in vitro experiments with related NuMA fragments have not shown specific minus-end localization. An in vitro microtubule-binding experiment with the exact 'C-tail1+2A' construct used in this work would greatly strengthen the authors conclusions. Alternatively, instances of &quot;recognizes&quot; should be softened to &quot;localizes to&quot; or another expression that does not imply direct binding.</p><p>Further, discussion of the Sedlin et al. (2016) study could be expanded on. For example, if the 1811-1985 region of NuMA localizes to plus and minus ends as that paper suggests, is it conceivable that cellular factors are required to prevent plus-end binding? The notion of microtubule curvature recognition by NuMA is also raised in that paper. The authors should comment on these points.</p><p>2) NuMA localization under conditions of dynein inhibition or knockout</p><p>To investigate whether NuMA is localized to minus ends by direct recruitment or dynein transport, dynein activity is perturbed by p50 overexpression, p150 overexpression, and knockout of the dynein heavy chain. However, the kinetics of NuMA recruitment are only probed in detail in the p50 overexpression case. This provides the interesting observation that NuMA can still localize to minus ends when dynein activity is perturbed, but apparently with slower kinetics, suggesting that both direct recruitment and transport may contribute to NuMA localization. However, as the kinetic traces are noisy, it would be important to show the same trend in at least one of the other dynein inhibition conditions (i.e. perform laser ablation experiments, ideally in the dynein heavy chain knockout cell line).</p><p>The key point here is to strengthen the conclusion that dynein transport alone does not target NuMA to minus ends.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: NuMA is shown to reach the spindle poles before dynactin, suggesting it recruits dynein/dynactin, not the other way round. There is no measurement of dynein. The authors should explain why dynein was not looked at.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> reports that a DHC KO still leads to Numa and dynactin localization. This suggests that dynactin can be localized by NuMA independently of dynein. An important control is to show that the dynein level is completely knocked down by Western blot.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows how NuMA targets dynactin. It would be helpful to the reader to include the dynein localization (currently in Figure 4—figure supplement 1) in this main figure. It explains why the authors focus on dynactin localization and do not directly address dynein localization.</p><p>6) Gatasin treatment</p><p>Do the authors have data to establish how effectively γ-TuRC was removed from minus ends by this treatment? Spindle length measurements do not probe this directly.</p><p>7) Super-resolution microscopy</p><p>A control with another minus-end binder (e.g. CAMSAP) needs to be included to provide convincing evidence for &quot;organized clusters of NuMA puncta&quot;, rather than a lawn of molecules along the lattice near the minus-end.</p><p>8) Title: NuMA Targets Dynein to Microtubule Minus-Ends at Mitosis</p><p>There is a disconnect between title and the experiments in the study, as the localization data pertain mainly to dynactin rather than dynein. &quot;Dynein&quot; should be replaced with &quot;Dynein and Dynactin&quot; or &quot;dynein activity&quot;.</p><p>There may also be some confusion with the use of &quot;Targets&quot; as some will feel dynein naturally targets minus end via its motor activity. Replacing with &quot;Recruits&quot; or &quot;Localizes&quot; may avoid this confusion.</p><p>9) The Materials and methods suggest that T-tests were used for statistical comparisons.

To many, this will imply a direct interaction, which is not explicitly tested in this work. The authors state that previous in vitro experiments with related NuMA fragments have not shown specific minus-end localization. An in vitro microtubule-binding experiment with the exact 'C-tail1+2A' construct used in this work would greatly strengthen the authors conclusions. Alternatively, instances of &quot;recognizes&quot; should be softened to &quot;localizes to&quot; or another expression that does not imply direct binding.</p><p>Further, discussion of the Sedlin et al. (2016) study could be expanded on. For example, if the 1811-1985 region of NuMA localizes to plus and minus ends as that paper suggests, is it conceivable that cellular factors are required to prevent plus-end binding? The notion of microtubule curvature recognition by NuMA is also raised in that paper. The authors should comment on these points.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the feedback that our language in certain places implied knowledge of a direct interaction between NuMA and minus-ends. We have carefully reviewed the text with this concern in mind and have softened our language to better convey our intended message: that our data do not distinguish between direct or indirect recruitment of NuMA to minus-ends (subsection “NuMA localizes to minus-ends independently of dynein”, last paragraph; subsection “NuMA is required for dynein activity and dynactin localization at minus-ends”, last paragraph; subsection “NuMA recognizes localizes to minus-ends independently of known minus-end binders”; subsection “NuMA function requires both minus-end-recognition and dynactin-recruitment modules”, second paragraph; subsection “NuMA targets dynactin to minus-ends, spatially regulating dynein activity at mitosis”, last paragraph; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> legend). We also thank the reviewers for the suggestion to expand our discussion of the Seldin et al. (2016) study. We have done so in the last paragraph of the subsection “NuMA targets dynactin to minus-ends, spatially regulating dynein activity at mitosis”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) NuMA localization under conditions of dynein inhibition or knockout</p><p>To investigate whether NuMA is localized to minus ends by direct recruitment or dynein transport, dynein activity is perturbed by p50 overexpression, p150 overexpression, and knockout of the dynein heavy chain. However, the kinetics of NuMA recruitment are only probed in detail in the p50 overexpression case. This provides the interesting observation that NuMA can still localize to minus ends when dynein activity is perturbed, but apparently with slower kinetics, suggesting that both direct recruitment and transport may contribute to NuMA localization. However, as the kinetic traces are noisy, it would be important to show the same trend in at least one of the other dynein inhibition conditions (i.e. perform laser ablation experiments, ideally in the dynein heavy chain knockout cell line).</p><p>The key point here is to strengthen the conclusion that dynein transport alone does not target NuMA to minus ends.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have performed laser ablation experiments in the inducible dynein heavy chain (DHC) knockout HeLa cell line. We measured GFP-NuMA recruitment to new minus-ends with and without deletion of DHC, and the data show the same trends as with and without p50 overexpression in PtK2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-E</xref>). NuMA is robustly recruited to HeLa k-fiber minus-ends even after DHC deletion, but recruitment is slightly delayed. We have added these data to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. We thank the reviewers for strengthening the manuscript with this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: NuMA is shown to reach the spindle poles before dynactin, suggesting it recruits dynein/dynactin, not the other way round. There is no measurement of dynein. The authors should explain why dynein was not looked at.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added an explanation as suggested (subsection “Dynactin and NuMA display mitosis-specific, steady-state binding at microtubule minus-ends”, second paragraph). Thank you for this feedback. In brief, high cytoplasmic levels of dynein result in variable and low signal-to-background imaging of the motor on microtubules. This precluded accurate measurements of dynein’s dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> reports that a DHC KO still leads to Numa and dynactin localization. This suggests that dynactin can be localized by NuMA independently of dynein. An important control is to show that the dynein level is completely knocked down by Western blot.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers and have added a western blot demonstrating dynein depletion after inducible DHC KO to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>. Furthermore, dynein depletion was always verified in individual cells analyzed – by spindle phenotype or, whenever possible, by immunofluorescence labeling of dynein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows how NuMA targets dynactin. It would be helpful to the reader to include the dynein localization (currently in Figure 4—figure supplement 1) in this main figure. It explains why the authors focus on dynactin localization and do not directly address dynein localization.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this feedback and have moved the dynein localization into the main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Gatasin treatment</p><p>Do the authors have data to establish how effectively γ-TuRC was removed from minus ends by this treatment? Spindle length measurements do not probe this directly.</p></disp-quote><p>To more directly test how effectively gatastatin blocks γ-TuRC’s interaction with minus-ends, we performed a microtubule regrowth assay in the presence of 30 μM gatastatin or equivalent DMSO (as in Chinen et al., Nat Comm 2016). After cold treatment, 30 μM gatastatin dramatically blocked γ-TuRC’s ability to bind α-tubulin to nucleate new microtubules (bottom panels, below). Gatastatin did not depolymerize existing microtubule networks (top panels), demonstrating its specificity in binding γ-tubulin, not α- or β-tubulin. We thank the reviewers for suggesting this important control and have included these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>. Details of the re-growth assay have been added to the manuscript’s Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Super-resolution microscopy</p><p>A control with another minus-end binder (e.g. CAMSAP) needs to be included to provide convincing evidence for &quot;organized clusters of NuMA puncta&quot;, rather than a lawn of molecules along the lattice near the minus-end.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We have performed 3D STORM of CAMSAP at PtK2 k-fiber minus-ends created by ablation, as done for NuMA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D-H</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, we show examples of k-fiber minus-ends (white boxes) created by ablation and imaged by 3D STORM after immunofluorescence labeling of NuMA (top) or CAMSAP (bottom). In middle panels, structures are colored according to position in the Z-axis. Cartoons depict orientation of k-fiber and minus-end. Like NuMA, CAMSAP forms organized clusters of puncta, and distances between neighboring ‘nodes’ of both CAMSAP and NuMA (e.g., ‘*’) are ~50-150 nm (<italic>n</italic> = 32 nodes, 4 ablations for NuMA; <italic>n</italic> = 28 nodes, 3 ablations for CAMSAP). This spacing is consistent with measured spacing between individual microtubules within PtK2 k-fibers (McDonald et al., J. Cell Biol. 1992). These data support the idea of “organized clusters of NuMA puncta, rather than a lawn of molecules along the lattice near the minus-end”.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29328.025</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-29328-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><p>Unfortunately, limited signal from these minus-ends structures meant that we could only detect NuMA or CAMSAP clearly when labeled with the high-photon-yield and low-duty-cycle dye Alexa 647; this precluded two-color imaging of NuMA and CAMSAP co-localization in the same cell. In addition, while the large size and flat shape of mitotic PtK2 (rat kangaroo) cells made STORM experiments possible, commercially available CAMSAP1 antibodies raised against human antigen did not label any PtK2 proteins. The images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> show immunofluorescence staining with a CAMSAP2 antibody (17880-1-AP; Proteintech). In human cells (e.g., RPE1), this CAMSAP2 antibody does not label spindles, as human CAMSAP2 is phosphorylated at mitosis and does not interact with microtubules (Jiang et al., Dev Cell2014). Although these data support our claims, we do not include them in the manuscript due to the above limitations – and to avoid potential confusion looking forward.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Title: NuMA Targets Dynein to Microtubule Minus-Ends at Mitosis</p><p>There is a disconnect between title and the experiments in the study, as the localization data pertain mainly to dynactin rather than dynein. &quot;Dynein&quot; should be replaced with &quot;Dynein and Dynactin&quot; or &quot;dynein activity&quot;.</p><p>There may also be some confusion with the use of &quot;Targets&quot; as some will feel dynein naturally targets minus end via its motor activity.

We have changed the corresponding text to make it clear that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, not 1A, provides the information about microtubule polarity (subsection “Dynactin and NuMA display mitosis-specific, steady-state binding at microtubule minus-ends”, first paragraph). Interestingly, we see EB1 label plus-ends, not minus-ends, of single acentrosomal microtubules with high fidelity at mitosis. (Small bundles of microtubules, on the other hand, sometimes show EB1 labeling at both ends, presumably because they contain microtubules of mixed polarity.) In agreement with this specificity, we have never been able to detect evidence of microtubule polymerization at minus-ends after ablation in mitosis, at least in PtK2 cells. We have added a clarifying note on this topic to the Materials and methods (subsection “Data Analysis”, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) N-Tau experiments</p><p>The conclusion that dynein needs to be localized at the minus end, rather along the length of the microtubule, is based on use of an N-Tau construct.

Rep. 2015; Ahmadzadeh et al., Biophys. J.2015) suggest that Tau’s interaction with the microtubule can bear load.</p><p>To quantify the expression level of the GFP-N-Tau construct compared to full-length (FL) GFP-NuMA, we measured the average GFP intensity within the spindle region (normalized to cytoplasmic background intensity) for a confocal slice through the spindle center, for all cells used in our analysis of spindle organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Unfortunately, more ideal comparisons of integrated intensity within the whole spindle volume were not possible, given how these data were acquired. However, these average intensity measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>) suggest that N-Tau expression was comparable or higher than full-length NuMA. Each data point represents an individual cell; <italic>n</italic> = 19 for FL NuMA and <italic>n</italic> = 16 for N-Tau. Thus, N-Tau’s inability to rescue spindle organization is not due to low protein expression. Comparison to endogenous levels was not possible, as the polyclonal NuMA antibody binds with unknown stoichiometry to N-Tau vs. NuMA. Due to these limitations, we do not report this data in the manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29328.026</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-29328-resp-fig2-v1"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
