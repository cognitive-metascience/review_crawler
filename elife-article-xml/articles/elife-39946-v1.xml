As tetrapods transitioned from water to land, lungs replaced gills, allowing expiration to drive sound production. Some frogs then returned to water. Here we explore how air-driven sound production changed upon re-entry to preserve essential acoustic information on species identity in the secondarily aquatic frog genus <italic>Xenopus</italic>. We filmed movements of cartilage and muscles during evoked sound production in isolated larynges. Results refute the current theory for <italic>Xenopus</italic> vocalization, cavitation, and favor instead sound production by mechanical excitation of laryngeal resonance modes following rapid separation of laryngeal arytenoid discs. Resulting frequency resonance modes (dyads) are intrinsic to the larynx rather than due to neuromuscular control. Dyads are a distinctive acoustic signature. While their component frequencies overlap across species, their ratio is shared within each <italic>Xenopus</italic> clade providing information on species identity that could facilitate both conspecific localization and ancient species divergence.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

But such bubbles have never been observed, and exactly how these frogs manage to create sounds underwater has been a mystery.</p><p>Here, Kwong-Brown et al. filmed the larynx as it was stimulated to produce sounds and discovered that the rapid separation of the discs excites the larynx and the surrounding tissues to create the harmonic frequencies. Then, to determine how the frog creates its harmonic intervals, Kwong-Brown et al. tried to ‘detune’ the larynx. In a series of experiments, they placed weights on the surface of the larynx, drilled a hole in the cartilage and filled it with helium, or introduced small glass beads. None of these attempts had any effect. However, rupturing the elastic cartilages within the larynx – which separate its internal cavity into three chambers – disrupted the harmonic intervals.</p><p>This new way of creating underwater sounds helped to maintain the quality of the frog’s voice and may explain how <italic>Xenopus</italic> can shape its songs to convey crucial information to others, such as identifying species, sex and social intent.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>anuran</kwd><kwd>pipid</kwd><kwd>frog</kwd><kwd>vocal</kwd><kwd>sound</kwd><kwd>communication</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000042</institution-id><institution>Amgen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kwong-Brown</surname><given-names>Ursula</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 GM103266</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>Ian C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001312</institution-id><institution>Charles H.

Many current tetrapods use air movement to empower specialized vocal organs such as the larynx of frogs and mammals and the syrinx of birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Elemans et al., 2015</xref>). The resulting sounds are shaped by a combination of vibrating elements and cavity resonances to voice different acoustic qualities that convey sex, age, species, emotional state and even intent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hall et al., 2013</xref>). While voice provides essential information for social interactions, we know surprisingly little about how vertebrate vocal organs create these complex acoustic features. In particular, when an ancestral tetrapod leaves the land and vocalizes underwater without air movement, how are communication sounds produced and then shaped to maintain essential social information, and how do they diversify during speciation? Frogs in the secondarily aquatic genus <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Evans et al., 2015</xref>) present an informative system for addressing these questions.</p><p>In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, social communication is dominated by vocal signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kelley et al., 2017</xref>). Males in each species produce distinctive advertisement calls underwater whose acoustic features inform species identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Evans et al., 2015</xref>). These calls consist of a series of sound pulses that form species-typical temporal patterns and characteristically include two dominant frequencies (DFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tobias et al., 2011</xref>). The sound pulses that comprise <italic>Xenopus</italic> calls are produced in the larynx, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tobias and Kelley, 1987</xref>) a vocal organ interposed between the nasal and buccal cavities and the lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Vocal folds are absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ridewood, 1897</xref>) and a separate glottis gates air flow to and from the lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brett and Shelton, 1979</xref>). The larynx consists of a cricoid frame or ‘box’ of hyaline cartilage flanked bilaterally by bipennate muscles. These insert anteriorly, via a tendon, onto paired, closely apposed arytenoid cartilage discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) whose medial faces are coated by mucopolysaccharide secreted by adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yager, 1992</xref>).

The small film of fluid between the arytenoid discs should allow neither high velocity flow nor bubble formation, and bubbles have not yet been observed. Additionally, cavitation bubble collapse produces a high amplitude pressure pulse (~50–100 kPa), several orders of magnitude louder than the radiated sound pressure of <italic>Xenopus</italic> sound pulses.

In favorable preparations, a fluid layer could then be observed retreating from the medial surface of the discs with increasing isometric force. This observation suggests that the discs are kept together by a capillary binding force through a liquid bridge. When bilaterally exerted muscle force overcomes the binding force, the liquid bridge ruptures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and the discs separate rapidly with mean gap peak acceleration of 13.5 ± 9.1 <italic>g</italic> (N = 3; range: 6.4–23.8 <italic>g</italic>, where 1 <italic>g</italic> = 9.82 m/s<sup>2</sup>) and mean peak velocity of 50.3 ± 21.9 mm/s (N = 3; range: 35.5–75.4 mm/s) (see examples: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Disc peak deceleration (10.6 ± 5.2 <italic>g</italic>; N = 3; range: 6.5–16.4 <italic>g</italic>) occurs only 0.57 ± 0.10 ms after peak acceleration. In this short time, the gap between the discs enlarges to 18.6 ± 5.5 µm (range: 14.1–24.8 µm), a value that is 27.5 ± 8.0% (range: 22.8–35.6%) of the maximum gap width of 72.6 ± 34.5 µm (N = 3; range: 39.6–108.4 µm).

Two alternative mechanisms that could account for the association between disc movement and sound production are: 1) acoustic excitation by a rapid pressure drop between the discs or 2) disc movement-associated mechanical excitation of the larynx. Sound pressure reduction between the discs may produce a propagating sound pressure wave, exciting air cavity resonances within the larynx. This mechanism should result in a bipole sound source with strong directional radiation pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Larsen and Wahlberg, 2017</xref>). Because of impedance mismatch between the air cavities and cartilages of the larynx, however, this mechanism would produce a poor, low intensity sound. In addition, replacing air with helium should alter the frequency distribution of cavity resonances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rand and Dudley, 1993</xref>), an effect not observed in this study, nor previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yager, 1992</xref>).</p><p>Alternatively, separation of the arytenoid discs might mechanically excite vibration of laryngeal elements. This mechanism would result in a monopole sound source – the entire larynx - with a more omnidirectional radiation pattern, effectively coupled to the medium, producing a more intense sound. The sound pressure produced by such a vibrating monopole structure depends on its space and time averaged velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hambric and Fahnline, 2007</xref>), which is consistent with our observations of a linear correlation between disc velocity and sound pressure, and the minimal velocity required for sound production. This mechanism is also consistent with previous experiments in which splitting 'the elastic sac surrounding the discs' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yager, 1992</xref>) prevented sound pulse production. We thus favor the second explanation and propose that disc movements specifically excite vibration of the elastic tissues surrounding the discs (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>As key features of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> larynx - including lack of vocal folds and modification of the laryngeal box and cartilages - are shared across Pipid species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ridewood, 1897</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ridewood, 1900</xref>), this proposed mechanism of underwater sound production may also be shared. In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, water is prevented from entering the larynx during underwater calling by inhibition of glottal motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zornik and Kelley, 2007</xref>), thus ensuring the attainment of the disc peak velocity values identified here as required for sound production. The sound-protection afforded would not be required in another pipid, <italic>Hymenochirus merlini</italic>, that has reverted to calling in air (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Irisarri et al., 2011</xref>), presumably through an open glottis. We predict that <italic>H. merlini</italic> calling is also powered by disc separation rather than air flow.</p><p>Our experimental results support the hypothesis that arytenoid disc movements subsequently excite two natural vibratory resonance frequencies of the larynx itself. These harmonic dyads require intact elastic cartilage septa that separate the central laryngeal lumen from the lateral laryngeal chambers. Both species-specific individual DFs and the clade-specific dyad ratio are thus intrinsic to the larynx rather than the result of laryngeal or respiratory muscle modulation by neural circuitry. Which, as yet unidentified, characteristics of laryngeal tissue geometry and properties result in species-specific DFs and their ratios remain to be determined, but are likely to reflect a common tuning mechanism in descendants of ancestral <italic>Xenopus</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sassoon et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baur et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Three mechanisms have been identified for producing and shaping vertebrate laryngeal vocalizations: the myoelastic aerodynamic theory (MEAD), active muscle contraction (ACM) and intralaryngeal aerodynamic whistles. The MEAD mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Titze, 1980</xref>) explains the physical basis for sounds produced by isolated larynges of mammals and terrestrial frogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Suthers et al., 2006</xref>) as well as by syringes in birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Elemans et al., 2015</xref>).

Intralaryngeal aerodynamic whistles produce ultrasound in mice and probably all murine rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mahrt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Roberts, 1975</xref>). All of these mechanisms require air flow to produce vocalizations and thus none of them explain how <italic>Xenopus</italic> call. The return to water in ancestral <italic>Xenopus</italic> was instead accompanied by a novel mechanism for laryngeal sound production: disc movement-induced excitation of laryngeally intrinsic resonance modes - dyads - shaped spectrally by material properties of elastic cartilage septa. Thus, the evolutionary change that allowed sound to be produced underwater without airflow in Pipids is not only responsible for production of sound pulses, but also their spectral features. Species-specific, rhythmic activity patterns of laryngeal motor neurons drive the precise temporal pattern of laryngeal muscle contractions responsible for the arytenoid disc separations that produce vocalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Leininger and Kelley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barkan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barkan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In terrestrial frogs, as in other vocal vertebrates, acoustic features of male advertisement calls contain information on species identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gerhardt and Huber, 2002</xref>). This is also true for <italic>Xenopus</italic>; other call types - such as the male release call - vary little between species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tobias et al., 2014</xref>). Information on species identity can serve to reduce interspecific mating and costs associated with hybrid offspring, including male sterility, that lead to restricted gene flow and speciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lemmon and Lemmon, 2010</xref>). Across <italic>Xenopus</italic>, temporal patterns of the advertisement call are homoplasious: the same pattern - for example a click-type call – recurs in genetically distant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tobias et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Roberts, 1975</xref>). While temporal information can be ambiguous due to homoplasy, our data suggest that spectral information in advertisement calls – constrained by the morphology of the larynx – is more phylogenetically informative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gingras et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>However, <italic>Xenopus</italic> evolution has also been shaped by multiple rounds of inter-specific hybridization resulting in genomic introgression and the numerous highly polyploid species of the phylogeny, particularly A clade species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Evans et al., 2015</xref>). Rapid oviposition once eggs are ovulated places a premium on locating a male. When different species share the same pond, a female mating with a male from the same clade is more likely to produce viable and fertile offspring. The peripheral auditory system of females is tuned to their species' own dyad: DF1, DF2 and the DF2/DF1 ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hall et al., 2016</xref>). Species-specific complementarity between vocal production and perception should reinforce the divergence of populations during speciation by limiting gene flow. The acoustic advantage to a gravid female of locating the most genetically-compatible calling male using the clade-specific common harmonic vocal signature thus may drive co-evolution of the vocal organ in the male and auditory perception in the female.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Species</title><p>Subjects for this study were all sexually mature, male, clawed frogs from the sub-genus <italic>Xenopus.</italic> We either obtained frogs from commercial suppliers (Avifauna, Xenopus Express, Xenopus One, or Nasco) or from our <italic>Xenopus</italic> colony at Columbia University (species and populations<italic>: X. pygmaeus, X. ruwensoriensis, X. amieti, X. boumbaensis, X. allofraseri, X. andrei, X. itombwensis, X. wittei, X. vestitus, X. lenduensis, X. largeni, X. gilli, X. poweri, X. laevis</italic> Nigeria, <italic>X. laevis</italic> South Africa, <italic>X. victorianus, X. petersii, X. laevis Malawi, X. borealis</italic> and <italic>X. muelleri;</italic> see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tobias et al., 2011</xref>) for details on geographic locales; species nomenclature as revised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Evans et al., 2015</xref>).) Frogs were housed in 2–5 L of water in polycarbonate tanks, under a 12–12 light-dark cycle, fed frog brittle (Nasco; Ft. Atkinson, WI, USA) and had their water changed twice per week. All animals were housed and handled in accordance with the guidelines established by the Danish Animal Experiments Inspectorate (Copenhagen, Denmark) and the Columbia University Animal Care and Use Committee.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Measuring arytenoid disc acceleration and velocity; sound pulse production</title><p>We used high speed films of tissue movements in the isolated larynx preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tobias and Kelley, 1987</xref>) of 5 adult male <italic>X. laevis</italic> to test the cavitation hypothesis. The animals were euthanized and their vocal organ and attached lungs were removed. The air-filled larynx was submerged in physiological saline in a 66 mm Petri dish. After isolation, larynges were pinned, dorsal side up, via extra-laryngeal cartilages, to a Sylgard coated recording dish submerged in oxygenated Ringers solution. The bilateral, freed motor nerves were drawn into suction electrodes for stimulation (WPI Linear stimulus isolator model A395R-C). All isolated larynges produced sound pulses.</p><p>Sound was recorded with a 1/2-inch pressure microphone-pre-amplifier assembly (model 46AD, G.R.A.S., Denmark) and amplified (model 12AQ, G.R.A.S., Denmark). The microphone and recording chain sensitivity was measured before each experiment (sound calibrator model 42AB, G.R.A.S., Denmark). The microphone was placed at 22–24 mm away from the mounted larynx. Because the signal-to-noise ratio of the hydrophone was lower than the microphone and the timing of sound events did not differ, we used the microphone signal for further analysis. Microphone, hydrophone and stimulation timing signals were low-pass filtered at 10 kHz, (custom-built filter, ThorLabs, Germany) and digitized at 30 kHz (USB 6259, 16 bit, National Instruments, Austin, Texas).</p><p>Larynges were imaged with a 12 bit high-speed camera (MotionPro-X4, 12 bit CMOS sensor, Integrated Design Tools, Inc.) mounted on a stereomicroscope (M165-FC, Leica Microsystems). The preparation was back-lighted to visualize the arytenoid discs by a plasma light source (HPLS200, Thorlabs, Germany) through liquid light guides and reflected of a 45° angled silver coated prism (MRA series, Thorlabs) to absorb heat. To track the position of landmarks, we placed 40–80 µm diameter carbon spheres on the surface of the larynx, muscles and arytenoid discs as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The position of spheres was tracked at subpixel precision by interpolating the 2D intensity cross-correlations of the same sphere in an initial frame to each movie image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). Velocity and acceleration of the spheres were calculated by differentiation of their position. All control and analysis software was written in MATLAB. In all five preparations, we filmed the larynx <italic>in toto</italic> following varying rates of nerve stimulation. In three preparations we obtained sufficiently high contrast images of the arytenoid discs at high imaging frame rates of 10,00–44,000 fps to allow automated position extraction during stimulation of the bilateral motor nerves at 40 Hz for 50 cycles. Data acquisition on the NI board and camera system was synchronized by a 1 ms TTL pulse. The camera was triggered at the positive rise of this 1 ms TTL pulse. The camera’s specifications allow shutter speed as short as 1 µs. During earlier synchronization tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Elemans et al., 2015</xref>), we determined that the trigger accuracy was below the duration of one frame (maximally 21 µs) and thus well below the relevant time scales investigated here.</p><p>Arytenoid gap width was defined as distance moved between the two markers from their resting position and perpendicular to the midline. Minimum and maximum acceleration of gap width were calculated per stimulus. Sound was bandpass filtered between 1–4 kHz (3th order butterworth filter implemented with zero phase-shift; filtfilt algorithm). The noise floor was defined as three times the standard deviation of a 67 ms background recording prior to each stimulation experiment. However, because sound energy did not fully dissipate in the experimental chamber between consecutive nerve stimulations, especially after 30–40 cycles, we used a threshold of 0.01 Pa to determine sound onset per stimulus. The first detectable sound pulse typically occurred after 2–3 stimulations. This is consistent with our earlier work showing that male laryngeal neuromuscular synapses are ‘weak,’ i.e., require facilitation to release sufficient neurotransmitter to generate a muscle action potential and contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ruel et al., 1997</xref>). We used linear regressions - including only measurements above sound threshold – to calculate the minimal disc velocity and acceleration associated with sound generation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Recordings of vocal behavior</title><p>For in vivo recordings, frogs were placed in a 75 L aquarium. To promote vocal behavior, males were injected with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; Sigma: 50–200 IU depending on body size) one day prior to and on the day of recording. Males were then paired with a conspecific, sexually unreceptive female in a glass aquarium (60 × 15 × 30.5 cm, L × W × H; water depth = 23 cm; 20◦ C). A hydrophone (High Tech, Gulfport, MI, USA; output sensitivity −164.5 dB at 1 V/µPa, frequency sensitivity 0.015–10 kHz; or Cornell Bioacoustics, output sensitivity −163 dB at 1 V/µPa) was used to record calls to a Marantz digital recorder CD or flash card (CDR300, Marantz, Mahwah, NJ, USA; 44.1 kHz sampling rate) or on a computer (Macintosh) via a Lexicon A/D converter. To measure values for DF1 and DF2, three non-consecutive advertisement calls (the smallest vocal unit as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tobias et al., 2011</xref>)) were analyzed from 3 males of each species. Dominant frequencies were calculated from fast Fourier transforms (FFT) with maximum Q values (peak frequency/maximum frequency 6 dB below peak frequency - minimum frequency 6 dB below peak frequency; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The initial attack segment of each sound pulse was not included in the analysis because it is more broadband than the sustained portion of the call. The values shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> are the mean of individual means for all calls by species recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Sound and laser recordings in vivo and ex vivo</title><p>Advertisement calls of single males were recorded in aquaria with a hydrophone (H2a, Aquarian Audio Products; Anacortes, WA, USA) and vibration velocities were recorded simultaneously with a portable laser (PDV 100 laser, Polytec Inc.; Irvine, CA, USA) directed at the ventral surface of the singing frog.

To access the elastic cartilages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), we drilled a small hole in the dorsal surface of the larynx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and then sealed it with a small piece of Parafilm. To ensure that the hole had no effect, sound and laser recordings were obtained before and after this procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The Parafilm was then removed and a 30 g needle used to puncture the elastic cartilage on both sides, after which the Parafilm was replaced. At the end of the experiment, the larynx was split saggitally ('butterflied') and the disruption of elastic cartilage was confirmed by visual inspection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>, illustrating intact vs punctured elastic cartilage). Sound and laser recordings were digitized (PreSonus Audio box; Baton Rouge, LA, USA) and stored on a Macintosh computer.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by a National Institutes of Health grant (R01 NS23684) and research funds associated with the Weintraub Chair (DBK), the Danish Research Council (FNU) and Carlsberg Foundation awards to CPHE, post-doctoral fellowships from the NIH (F32 GM103266) and the Revson Foundation to ICH and Amgen and SURF awards to UKB.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Min Zhu as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Andrew King as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have also agreed to reveal their identity: Franz Goller (Reviewer #2); Fernando Montealegre-Zapata (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The Reviewing Editor has highlighted the concerns that require revision and/or responses, and we have included the separate reviews below for your consideration. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a high-quality study that explores the sound generating mechanism in the unusual larynx of <italic>Xenopus</italic>, a clade of frogs mostly calling under water. The results refute the current hypothesis for <italic>Xenopus</italic> vocalization, cavitation, and suggest sound production by mechanical excitation of laryngeal resonance modes following rapid separation of laryngeal arytenoid discs. The study also shows that the resulting frequency modes (dyads) are intrinsic to the larynx, and provides new insights in how essential acoustic information for social communication in frogs can be linked to laryngeal structure. As such, this study will be very interesting both to the scientific community and to the public.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) To help the readability of your hypothesis, the text figures should be improved in labellings. There also exist the figure citation errors.</p><p>Figure legends, &quot;Figure 1—figure supplement 2&quot; should be &quot;supplement 1&quot;.

Figure 2—figure supplement 1 seems to show the opposite of what was stated for water injection in regard to velocity and acceleration.</p><p>Figure 1: panel A does not correspond to the title of this panel the figure caption: <italic>Xenopus</italic> call while submerged. Panel B, the isolated larynx, will be benefit from having body coordinates labels (anterior, posterior, etc). This is for the non-experts. I also find it very distracting the use of acronyms in the labels. Why don't use fine arrows and the full name of the structure in white fonts? Or make the anatomy panels bigger?</p><p>Figure 2.

Most tetrapods use air to produce sound in specilized vocal organs such as the larynx of frogs and mammals and the syrinx of birds. Some groups of tetrapods, such as pipid frogs, cetaceans and extinct marine reptiles, however returned to fully aquatic lifestyles. How these land vertebrates adapted their originally air-driven sound production system for social communication under water remains ambiguous. This study explores how air-driven sound production system changed when the land ancestor of aquatic frog <italic>Xenopus</italic> returned to water. The results refute the current hypothesis for <italic>Xenopus</italic> vocalization, cavitation, and suggest sound production by mechanical excitation of laryngeal resonance modes following rapid separation of laryngeal arytenoid discs. The study also shows that the resulting frequency modes (dyads) are intrinsic to the larynx, and provides new insights in how essential acoustic information for social communication in frogs can be linked to laryngeal structure. As such, this study will be very interesting both to the scientific community and to the public.</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>In the section &quot;references&quot;, all the genus and species names should be in italics. Some references such as Larsen and Larsen (2017) should be edited in the right format.</p><p>Figure legends, &quot;Figure 1—figure supplement 2&quot; should be &quot;Supplement 1&quot;.

The data are convincing and the phylogenetic distribution of the ratio of dyad frequencies suggests a morphological basis for species identity. Unfortunately, the precise origin of this dyad signature remains to be discovered. I have a few suggestions, comments and questions, which are detailed below.</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>I would argue that cavitation is hardly a theory, rather a proposed mechanism and as such a hypothesis (as correctly stated in the Introduction).</p><p><italic>Xenopus</italic> should be italicized.</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>The point that we do not know in sufficient detail how specific acoustic signatures are generated is well taken. The transition to the return to water however may have provided a simple case in which this can be studied. The special mechanism however does not inform us how it is done in a vocal fold vibration mechanism.</p><p>Results:</p><p>I am wondering whether these data allow the authors to discern between the respective roles of excursion amplitude of the discs and peak velocity/acceleration in determining the threshold for sound detection. Is it really peak velocity and acceleration that determine whether or not sound is detectable or does the actual amplitude of excursion of the discs also play a role? A larger excursion could generate larger pressure peaks and only then is sound detectable.</p><p>Figure 2—figure supplement 1 seems to show the opposite of what was stated for water injection in regard to velocity and acceleration.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>The production mechanism for ultrasound in rodents is currently not clear. In fact, the mechanism cited here (Mahrt et al., 2016) has been credibly challenged (Riede et al., 2017). Although not central to the current analysis, it would be appropriate to cite all papers here.</p><p>The last paragraph does not seem very relevant to the story presented here.</p><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 2:</p><p>The labeling and legend explanation need clarification (ad vs ac), what is t?,</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is an outstanding interesting piece of work, and I really enjoyed reading it. The authors took an interdisciplinary approach to answer a challenging question about sound production in aquatic frogs. The research is innovative as the team used a combination of state-of-the-art technologies (HS video, Laser Doppler vibrometry, condenser mics and hydrophones recordings, electrophysiology, comparative analysis, etc) to answer the questions. Sound production in aquatic frogs is not well understood and has previously been explained by a mechanism known as 'implosion of air bubbles or cavitation'. The authors challenged this explanation and more convincingly demonstrated that bubbles or high-velocity-flow are never formed during the process, and instead their data supports another mechanism: sound production by mechanical excitation of laryngeal resonance modes. The authors took this analysis further and investigated this across several species of the genus <italic>Xenopus</italic>. Results imply that this mechanism is shared across the species studied, therefore its relevance in various fields, including evolutionary biology.</p><p>I have some comments, which I consider minor, and which I hope the team will take into consideration to improve the clarity of the paper, etc</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Paragraph 1: very clear, and targets the point.</p><p>Paragraph 2: Some bits of the description of the anatomy here are far more complex than the respective Figure For example, the anatomy of the vocal organ and nasal and buccal cavities is not clear in panel A of Figure 1. Fonts are too small and only brain and larynx are labelled; please label the other structures as well (although many aspects are clarified in Figure 1 supplement). For Other suggestion see comments on Figure 1, below. I had some problems imagining how this disk moves, and this is due to the indistinguishable anatomy of the AC in the inset of Figure 1A.</p><p>Paragraph 3: What is a high velocity separation of the AD?

The readers will benefit to know how the high-speed video was synchronized with data acquisition.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this information to the Materials and methods section: &quot;Data acquisition on the NI board and camera system was synchronized by a 1 ms TTL pulse. The camera was triggered at the positive rise of this 1 ms TTL pulse. The camera’s specifications allow shutter speed as short as 1 μs. During earlier synchronization tests we determined that the trigger accuracy was below the duration of one frame and maximally 21 μs2 and thus well below the relevant time scales investigated here.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) We are wondering whether these data allow the authors to discern between the respective roles of excursion amplitude of the discs and peak velocity/acceleration in determining the threshold for sound detection. Is it really peak velocity and acceleration that determine whether or not sound is detectable or does the actual amplitude of excursion of the discs also play a role? A larger excursion could generate larger pressure peaks and only then is sound detectable.</p></disp-quote><p>Detection of sound pulses depends on the signal-to-noise ratio of the sound pressure recording; low amplitude pulses can be masked by noise. Because the sound energy remains in the experimental chamber for several milliseconds after a sound pulse, accurate onset of sound detection as nerve stimulation proceeds causes the noise level to increase and this affects sound onset detection accuracy. We therefore set the threshold for sound detection rather conservatively as described in the Materials and methods:</p><p>&quot;The noise floor was defined as three times the standard deviation of a 67ms background recording prior to each stimulation experiment. However, because sound energy did not fully dissipate in the experimental chamber between consecutive nerve stimulations, especially after 30-40 cycles, we used a threshold of 0.01 Pa to determine sound onset per stimulus.&quot;</p><p>Before any sound pulses have been generated, noise is about 5 mPa ptp; the first detectable sound pulse typically occurred after 2-3 stimulations. This result is consistent with our earlier work showing that male laryngeal neuromuscular synapses are &quot;weak&quot; i.e. require facilitation to release sufficient neurotransmitter to generate a muscle action potential and contraction. We have added this information to the Materials and methods (and provide a correct version of the appropriate reference.15)</p><p>Our hypothesis is that the mucopolysaccharide liquid coating the medial surfaces of the discs forms an adhesive liquid bridge. The discs separate when force exerted on the discs by the muscles, via the tendon, overcomes the adhesive liquid bridge force. In general, the respective roles of position, velocity and acceleration of disc kinematics can be hard to dissect, because all correlate positively with sound amplitude (e.g. Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1). However introducing water prevented the liquid bridge formation and shed some light on this question.</p><p>In our revision we added gap width, next to disc peak velocity and peak acceleration, to Figure 2—figure supplement 1. These data clearly show that after adding water in the gap, the discs still move and form a gap up to 80 μm – exceeding the 50 μm amplitude that accompanies sound pulses produced before water was introduced. The lower maximal disc excursion is most likely due to the fact that less energy is injected in the spring system by the muscles because the discs are not kept together by the liquid bridge force. Of disc gap width, peak velocity and peak acceleration values associated with sound pulse production, only disc peak velocity does not reach threshold when the liquid bridge holding the discs together is disrupted (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). This observation supports the hypothesis that a threshold disc peak velocity is required for sound production.</p><p>The manuscript has been revised to include the position data in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and we added the following text:: &quot;Of disc gap width, peak velocity and peak acceleration values associated with sound pulse production, only disc peak velocity does not reach threshold when the liquid bridge holding the discs together is disrupted (Figure 2—figure supplement 1).

About 120 years ago, Ridewood reported that the Pipids lack vocal folds. and speculated about how sounds might be produced, underwater, without them. The sounds that make up species-specific vocal communication in anurans are important in communicating essential social information including species, sex, age, reproductive state, rivalry. In our studies, we asked how this information could be still be produced in <italic>Xenopus</italic> without air flow and vocal folds. Our evidence supports the idea that the Pipid return to water from land was accompanied by a new way of making sound that preserves the kinds of acoustic information that was ancestrally essential. We note that another Pipid, <italic>Hymenochirus boettergi</italic>, has returned to land from water and that movement of air from the lungs into the mouth cavity accompanies call production (reference 11) and predict this new way of producing sounds persists, an idea which can be tested directly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results:</p><p>I am wondering whether these data allow the authors to discern between the respective roles of excursion amplitude of the discs and peak velocity/acceleration in determining the threshold for sound detection.

In fact, the mechanism cited here (Mahrt et al., 2016) has been credibly challenged (Riede et al., 2017). Although not central to the current analysis, it would be appropriate to cite all papers here.</p></disp-quote><p>The data presented in the Mahrt et al. paper questioned a prevailing hypothesis that ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are generated by hole-tone whistles or superficial vocal fold movements. The authors proposed that rodent USVs are instead produced by feedback between downstream convecting coherent flow structures from the glottis and upstream-propagating acoustic waves, perhaps also due to reverberating acoustic conditions. However, they conclude that: “What exact mechanism constitutes the feedback remains unknown; it could be either upstream propagating acoustic disturbances through the core of the jet, or outside of the jet, or some edge effect.”</p><p>The wall or edge tone is hard to separate and still rather intensively debated in mechanical engineering literature. The equations predicting stable modes are exactly the same for both core, wall or edge feedback mechanisms. The paper by Riede et al., 2017 shows that several rodent species have an intralaryngeal ventral pouch that affects USVs. While their data inform the question of what geometric structure could provide feedback, results do not challenge the main conclusions of Mahrt et al. Though very interesting, this discussion is not relevant for the main conclusions of our paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The last paragraph does not seem very relevant to the story presented here.</p></disp-quote><p>Species-specific courtship songs generally serve as pre-zygotic barriers that prevent mating between males and females of different species. The consequences of choosing a different species to mate with is producing hybrid offspring that are less successful than pure species offspring, either in viability or reproduction. All <italic>Xenopus</italic> species, however, arose from ancient intra-specific hybridizations. L clade species produce fertile hybrids of both sexes that can mate with each other but hybrids between L and M clade species do not produce inter-fertile hybrids. Recognizing a potential reproductive partner from the same clade (<italic>i.e.</italic> genetically similar) is thus advantageous and we propose that this recognition drives the remarkable conservation of the dyad (DF2/DF1 ratio) within each clade. The dyad ratio provides a feature of voice that <italic>Xenopus</italic> can use locate a genetically favorable partner. We have revised the paragraph for clarity as follows:</p><p>“However, <italic>Xenopus</italic> evolution has also been shaped by multiple rounds of inter-specific hybridization resulting in genomic introgression and the numerous highly polyploid species of the phylogeny, particularly A clade species.4 Rapid oviposition once eggs are ovulated places a premium on locating a male. When different species share the same pond, a female mating with a male from the same clade is more likely to produce viable and fertile offspring. The peripheral auditory system of females is tuned to their species' own dyad: DF1, DF2 and the DF2/DF1 ratio.35 Species-specific complementarity between vocal production and perception should reinforce the divergence of populations during speciation by limiting gene flow. The acoustic advantage to a gravid female of locating the most genetically compatible calling male using the clade-specific common harmonic vocal signature thus may drive co-evolution of the vocal organ in the male and auditory perception in the female.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 2:</p><p>The labeling and legend explanation need clarification (ad vs ac), what is t?,</p></disp-quote><p>See response above.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] I have some comments, which I consider minor, and which I hope the team will take into consideration to improve the clarity of the paper, etc</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Paragraph 1: very clear, and targets the point.</p><p>Paragraph 2: Some bits of the description of the anatomy here are far more complex than the respective Figure For example, the anatomy of the vocal organ and nasal and buccal cavities is not clear in panel A of Figure 1.
