While transient in vivo, these precursor populations readily interconvert in vitro. We show that altered transcription is the driver of these coordinated changes, known as lineage priming, in a process that exploits novel polycomb activities. We find that intragenic levels of the polycomb mark H3K27me3 anti-correlate with changes in transcription, irrespective of the gene’s developmental trajectory or identity as a polycomb target. In contrast, promoter proximal H3K27me3 is markedly higher for PrEn priming genes. Consequently, depletion of this modification stimulates the degree to which ESCs are primed towards PrEn when challenged to differentiate, but has little effect on gene expression in self-renewing ESC culture. These observations link polycomb with dynamic changes in transcription and stalled lineage commitment, allowing cells to explore alternative choices prior to a definitive decision.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14926.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14926.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Lineage Priming</kwd><kwd>Heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>Embryonic Stem Cells</kwd><kwd>Polycomb</kwd><kwd>Transcription</kwd><kwd>H3K27me3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BBSRC_BB/H008500/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Illingworth</surname><given-names>Robert S</given-names></name><name><surname>Bickmore</surname><given-names>Wendy A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Illingworth</surname><given-names>Robert S</given-names></name><name><surname>Bickmore</surname><given-names>Wendy A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BBSRC_BB/H005978/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hölzenspies</surname><given-names>Jurriaan J</given-names></name><name><surname>Brickman</surname><given-names>Joshua M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Novo Nordisk Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>107012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brickman</surname><given-names>Joshua M</given-names></name><name><surname>Hölzenspies</surname><given-names>Jurriaan J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Novo Nordisk Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Section for Basic Stem Cell Biology</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hölzenspies</surname><given-names>Jurriaan J</given-names></name><name><surname>Brickman</surname><given-names>Joshua M</given-names></name><name><surname>Roske</surname><given-names>Fabian V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Polycomb enables lineage priming in mouse embryonic stem cells by establishing a barrier to commitment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from the ICM of the early mammalian blastocyst are characterised by their capacity to differentiate into all cell types of the future organism (pluripotency) and by their ability to transmit this property through successive self-renewing cell divisions. Pluripotency is supported by a combination of extrinsic signals - such as LIF - and by an intrinsic transcription factor (TF) network that includes the core pluripotency factors OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG.</p><p>Like the peri-implantation ICM from which they are derived, ESCs are heterogeneous and consist of at least two morphologically indistinguishable cell types, representing primed progenitors of the epiblast and endoderm lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Singh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Canham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lanner and Rossant, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Morgani et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic> these progenitors exist very transiently prior to implantation, at which point cells rapidly become committed to adopt embryonic or extra-embryonic fates. However, in ESC culture, these two cell states dynamically interconvert and are maintained indefinitely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Canham et al., 2010</xref>). When isolated and challenged to differentiate, the PrEn-primed pluripotent population exhibits an enhanced capacity for endoderm differentiation in vitro and can colonise the extra-embryonic endoderm when re-introduced into either morulas or blastocysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Canham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Morgani et al., 2013</xref>). The Epi-primed pluripotent population shows an equivalent enhanced capacity to differentiate towards epiblast lineages and contributes to the epiblast in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Canham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Morgani et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>At a molecular level, Epi-primed ESCs display elevated expression of mRNAs for various pluripotency associated TFs, such as <italic>Nanog</italic>, <italic>Esrrb</italic> and <italic>Zfp42</italic> (Rex1). In turn, the PrEn fraction expresses higher levels of endoderm specific mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Canham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Morgani et al., 2013</xref>). Both populations express similar levels of <italic>Pou5f1</italic> (Oct4) and the ESC-specific cell surface markers SSEA1 and PECAM. In total, several hundred genes show small, but significant, changes in expression as ESCs transit between these primed states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Canham et al., 2010</xref>). How the expression of these genes is coordinately changed, and how this is linked to functional priming is unknown.</p><p>Polycomb and trithorax chromatin modifying complexes have been implicated in establishing the competence of ESCs to differentiate. Mouse embryos deficient for polycomb complexes PRC1 and PRC2 fail to develop beyond gastrulation and exhibit defects in both embryonic and extra-embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Faust et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Faust et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">O'Carroll et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Voncken et al., 2003</xref>). PRC mutant ESCs express high background levels of differentiation-specific determinants and are unable to down-regulate TFs associated with pluripotency during differentiation. Moreover, reprogramming of somatic cells to the pluripotent state (iPS cells) requires both PRC1 and PRC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pereira et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>PRCs orchestrate developmental programmes by maintaining target genes in a poised transcriptional state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dellino et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stock et al., 2007</xref>). PRC2 trimethylates histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao et al., 2002</xref>) through the EZH1/2 histone methyltransferase (HMTase) component of the complex and this histone modification can in turn recruit PRC1 through the chromodomains of CBX subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morey and Helin 2010</xref>). Recently, variant PRC1 complexes have been shown to nucleate PRC2 binding providing a self-reinforcing mode of polycomb recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blackledge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cooper et al., 2014</xref>). In mouse ESCs, H3K27me3 and PRCs occupy large domains at repressed genes that encode developmental regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mikkelsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Endoh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ku et al., 2008</xref>) and consequently transcripts of these genes are upregulated in response to loss of PRC1 or PRC2 in ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Endoh et al., 2008</xref>). The trithorax system is associated with trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) - a modification found at the majority of non-methylated CpG islands (CGIs) that marks a transcriptionally permissive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klose et al., 2013</xref>). A subset of CGIs, however, contain nucleosomes marked by both H3K27me3 and some H3K4me3, a combination of histone modifications referred to as bivalency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azuara et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mikkelsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Voigt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Denissov et al., 2014</xref>). The co-incidence of these two histone modifications is also accompanied by the presence of a form of RNA polymerase II associated with transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brookes et al., 2012</xref>), consistent with the hypothesis that the bivalent chromatin state contributes to robust gene activation or silencing during the exit from pluripotency and the initiation of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Voigt et al., 2012</xref>). Whether this chromatin state is involved in lineage priming or is required only for commitment during differentiation has not been explored.</p><p>PrEn- and Epi-primed ESCs can be isolated based on the expression of a highly sensitive fluorescent reporter that contains a Venus insertion in the primitive endoderm gene <italic>Hhex</italic>, and on the presence of the ESC-specific cell surface marker SSEA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Canham et al., 2010</xref>). Cells that express the <italic>Hhex</italic>-Venus (HV) reporter and SSEA1 self-renew, are PrEn-primed and readily convert to an HV<sup>-</sup>, SSEA1<sup>+</sup>, Epi-primed ESC state. Here we use this tool to investigate the role of polycomb in maintaining the balance between Epi- and PrEn-primed ESC populations. We use gene expression microarrays in combination with genome-wide nuclear run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) to identify a set of genes with a distinct expression profile in these populations that is primarily regulated at the level of transcription. We show that gene body H3K27me3 is reduced with increased transcriptional activity across our priming gene sets, suggesting that H3K27me3 is a response to these small and dynamic changes in transcription. In contrast, promoter proximal H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 levels are invariant during priming, with a pattern of H3K27me3 around the start site that is significantly enriched in PrEn priming genes. Consistent with this observation, single cell qPCR analysis on polycomb mutant ESCs suggests that PRC1 and 2 are required for the establishment of ESC heterogeneity. Furthermore, short-term inhibition of EZH2 activity results in reduced neural differentiation efficiency in vitro and preferential PrEn contribution in vivo. These results suggest that polycomb regulates rapid and reversible damping of transcription and the maintenance of heterogeneity in early lineage specification.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Heterogeneous <italic>Hhex</italic> reporter expression reflects changes in transcription</title><p>To identify a definitive set of genes correlated with lineage priming in ESCs we isolated SSEA1+ (S<sup>+</sup>) HV reporter ESCs by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) based on the level of HV expression (low/high fractions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; green and red gates respectively). Amplified poly-A RNA from both populations was hybridised to expression microarrays and combined with data from a previous dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Canham et al., 2010</xref>). As previous analysis suggested that the PrEn-primed population (HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup>) exhibited small but detectable increases in expression of endoderm markers, we first defined the set of genes showing differential expression between the undifferentiated Epi-primed fraction (HV<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; green gate) and spontaneously differentiated endoderm cells (HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>-</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; yellow gate) using analysis of variance (ANOVA; FDR of 0.05 and a fold change of &gt; 1.5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). From this initial gene list, we then selected only those genes that showed a differential magnitude of expression between primed ESC populations, i.e. HV<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup> versus HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; green and red gates respectively) consistent with the direction of differential expression in the original HV<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup> versus HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>-</sup> comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Using these criteria we identified 210 genes that were up-regulated in HV<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup>, and 533 genes up-regulated in the HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup> populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Interestingly however, functional analysis showed that priming genes were not principally developmental in nature: Epi priming genes are involved in cell cycle and cellular metabolism, whereas PrEn priming genes are important for intracellular transport, cell migration and cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). This suggests that cellular composition and metabolism is markedly altered, albeit reversibly, prior to the upregulation of developmental genes and the entry of these cells into lineage specification.</p><p>Physical characterisation of both sets of genes identified an elevated G+C composition and CpG observed/expected ratio surrounding their transcription start sites (TSSs; ± 500 bp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) consistent with a significant enrichment for CGI promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>; p=2.7 × 10<sup>−3</sup> and 7.7 × 10<sup>−11</sup> for HV<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup> and HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup> populations respectively).

To determine if this was characteristic of priming genes, GRO-seq signal was mapped to a composite gene of normalised length. Genes upregulated in either the Epi-primed (HV<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup>) or PrEn-primed (HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup>) population displayed increased nascent transcript abundance in the relevant cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) - albeit with a smaller magnitude of change than that observed for steady state RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

These data indicate that gene expression patterns characteristic of priming are primarily regulated at the level of transcription, but for PrEn priming transcripts there is also a post-transcriptional component.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Priming genes are polycomb targets</title><p>To investigate mechanisms governing the dynamic transcriptional changes characteristic of lineage priming, we profiled histone modifications in primed populations of ESCs by native chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in two biologically independent cultures followed by deep sequencing. Given the proposed role of polycomb in the balance between pluripotency and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Voigt et al., 2012</xref>) and the enrichment of CGIs associated with priming gene sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), we focussed on H3K27me3 and H3K4me3. As expected, the constitutively highly expressed <italic>Actb</italic> was devoid of H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and enriched for H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, a canonical polycomb target region, the <italic>Hoxd</italic> cluster, was decorated with H3K27me3 and had low level H3K4me3 in both HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup> and HV<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup> cell populations. <italic>Zmiz1</italic>, a gene upregulated in the HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup> population, showed a broad domain of H3K27me3 peaking at two CGIs, but the levels of H3K27me3 at <italic>Zmiz1</italic> were somewhat reduced in HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup> as compared to HV<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The reverse held true for genes upregulated in the HV<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup>, Epi-primed population. For example, <italic>Aldh1b1</italic> - an HV<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup> enriched transcript - had slightly increased H3K27me3 that correlated with its reduced transcription in the HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup> fraction, despite a less extensive coating of H3K27me3 at this gene than at <italic>Zmiz1. Zmiz1</italic> and <italic>Aldh1b1</italic> had H3K4me3 surrounding their promoters, coincident with CGIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>; green bars), but unlike H3K27me3, their levels of H3K4me3 appeared not to vary between the primed cell populations. Since these differences were very subtle on single genes, we examined the average differential levels of H3K27me3 between the populations for all genes within each gene list to establish whether this change was specific to PrEn or Epi priming genes. We found no quantitative difference at the TSS (± 500 bp) between the HV<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup> and HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup> populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Meta-analysis confirmed the invariant H3K27me3 signal both at and upstream of the TSS, but surprisingly identified a small but significant reciprocal relationship between transcriptional activity and the level of H3K27me3 within gene bodies (TSS +501 bp to transcription end site (TES) +2 kb; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). This occurred not only for PrEn priming genes, but also for Epi priming genes, despite the reduced magnitude and incidence of H3K27me3 TSS ‘peaks’ at these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–E</xref>). As the observed effect was subtle however, we replicated these results using an alternative, formaldehyde cross-linked ChIP methodology. This approach confirmed both the invariant H3K27me3 levels at the TSS of priming genes and the differential H3K27me3 within gene bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). While both ChIP methodologies showed very similar results, the gene-body effect at Epi-priming genes showed the same trend as in the native ChIP, but as the level of H3K27me3 is low in these genes and cross linked ChIP is less efficient than that performed under native conditions, this trend was less robust than that observed under native conditions.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14926.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>PrEn priming genes are enriched for polycomb targets.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example H3K27me3 ChIP-seq profiles (log<sub>2</sub>(IP/Input)) for <italic>Actb</italic> and <italic>Hoxd</italic> (Control Loci), <italic>Aldh1b1</italic> (Upregulated in HV<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup>) and <italic>Zmiz1</italic> (Upregulated in HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup>).

However, when we split our gene lists based on the presence or absence of a ‘peak’ of H3K27me3 at the TSS, we found that the reciprocal relationship between H3K27me3 and transcription occurred irrespective of this sub-division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Conversely, when we selected only those genes that showed differential levels of GRO-seq signal between the primed populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>) only a subset of these genes showed an enrichment for H3K27me3 at their TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). These findings suggest that H3K27me3 depositions at the TSS and within the gene body are independent of one another. We used the same methodology to examine the behaviour of H3K4me3 in primed ESC populations. As expected, we found little variation in H3K4me3 levels either at the TSS or across gene bodies, for both sets of differentially expressed genes in both ESC populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Heatmaps representing the distribution of H3K4me3 around the TSSs (± 2.5 kb) of all differentially expressed genes showed that H3K4me3 levels did not change significantly between the HV<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup> and HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup> cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and generally appeared similar irrespective of the expression state in PrEn- and Epi-primed ESCs. In contrast, a far greater proportion of genes upregulated in the HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup> population showed promoter proximal enrichment for H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), and this corresponded to a significant enrichment for TSS associated polycomb ‘peaks’ at these genes (41.3% of genes upregulated in the HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup> population vs. only 19.5% of genes upregulated in the HV<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup> population; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Consistent with this finding, PrEn priming genes show an elevated tendency to be upregulated in response to the loss of both PRC1 and PRC2 components (RING1B and EED, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Conversely, Epi priming genes are enriched for genes that are downregulated in polycomb mutant ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leeb et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Given the relatively subtle nature of dynamic H3K27me3 redistribution within the body of priming genes we wanted to confirm this result using an independent dataset. Studies on ESC heterogeneity using the early epiblast marker <italic>Rex1</italic> (<italic>Zfp42</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marks et al., 2012</xref>) included both gene expression and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq datasets. These populations dynamically interconvert, although unlike PrEn- and Epi-primed cells, the <italic>Rex1</italic> low (Rex<sup>-</sup>) population contains partially differentiated cells and, therefore, Rex<sup>-</sup> cells give rise to <italic>Rex1</italic> high (Rex<sup>+</sup>) cells at a lower frequency than the reverse. Thus, the Rex<sup>+</sup> population resembles the Epi-primed fraction, whereas the Rex<sup>-</sup> population includes spontaneously differentiated cells in addition to the PrEn-primed cells described here. Rex<sup>+</sup> and Rex<sup>-</sup> populations therefore resemble the HV<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup> and HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup> populations with the caveat that HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup> are merely a subset of Rex<sup>-</sup> cells. To explore this systematically we compared the gene set enriched in the <italic>Rex1</italic> expressing populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>) to the lists we compiled based on HV expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Almost one third (73/210) of the Epi priming genes were also upregulated in the Rex<sup>+</sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Moreover, more than half of the PrEn priming genes were represented in the list of genes upregulated in the Rex<sup>-</sup> population (285/533 genes). Comparison of Rex<sup>+</sup> with HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup> and Rex<sup>-</sup> with HV<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup> showed negligible overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with our own findings in HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>+</sup>/HV<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup> cells, differential expression was associated with a reciprocal enrichment of H3K27me3 across the gene bodies in Rex<sup>+</sup>/Rex<sup>-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). In this comparison however, both differentially expressed gene sets show a significant reduction of H3K27me3 at the TSS as well as the gene body and this is not surprising as the Rex<sup>-</sup> population contains cells that have already embarked on differentiation rather than just primed populations of ESCs. To test this contention, we performed ChIP-seq for H3K27me3 on spontaneously differentiated PrEn cells (HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>-</sup>) and compared this to H3K27me3 levels in the Epi-primed population. Consistent with the Rex analysis, we observed more pronounced changes in H3K27me3 levels between these populations, including a significant reduction at the TSSs and upstream regions of PrEn-priming genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C and D</xref>).</p><p>These results confirm that PrEn priming genes are enriched for polycomb targets, but also suggest that changes in the levels of gene body H3K27me3 are inversely proportional to transcriptional changes in both primed and spontaneously differentiating ESCs, while measurable losses at TSSs only become evident upon differentiation.</p><p>In light of these findings, we investigated the relationship between the interconversion of the primed populations and differential gene-body H3K27me3 levels. To test this, we determined the rate at which primed populations re-equilibrate when returned to culture using modified reporters that contain either the original <italic>Hhex</italic>-IRES-Venus and a constitutive <italic>H2b</italic>-mCherry lineage label (HVHC ESCs) or an amplified <italic>H2b</italic>-mCherry under control of the <italic>Hhex</italic> locus and a constitutive <italic>H2b</italic>-Venus lineage marker (HFHCV ESCs). For both reporter lines, Epi- and PrEn-primed populations were isolated by FACS and returned to culture. <italic>Hhex</italic> expression was then monitored by flow cytometry at defined time points (18, 24, 48 and 72 h post-sorting; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A,B</xref>). Re-equilibration dynamics were found to be largely equivalent irrespective of the developmental trajectory or the reporter used. Moreover, co-culturing the two populations isolated from lineage labelled, but different colour reporter lines showed nearly identical dynamics to those cultured independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref> – compare solid with dashed lines). These results indicate that the rate of interconversion was independent of the starting gene expression state and any paracrine interactions between the populations. By 72 h, both Epi- and PrEn starting populations were largely equivalent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A–C</xref>), although complete equilibration was probably achieved around day 5 after sorting (extrapolated from the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>). Based on the re-equilibration dynamics observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>, we chose an intermediate time point during re-culture and determined the levels of gene body H3K27me3. Half of each of the primed populations used to generate the cross-linked ChIP data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> was re-cultured for 30 h prior to performing H3K27me3 ChIP on the SSEA1+ (S<sup>+</sup>) fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4D</xref>). As expected (and comparable to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), the ChIP-seq profiles for the <italic>Hoxd</italic> and <italic>Actb</italic> loci showed patterns of high and low H3K27me3 levels, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4E</xref>). However, a comparison of the ChIP-seq signal between the re-cultured primed populations showed a complete loss of the differential H3K27me3 levels observed at the time of the initial sort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4E</xref> compared to the parental populations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This suggests that differential gene-body H3K27me3 levels are closely coupled to the dynamics of the cells as they transit between primed states, supporting the idea that these patterns are dictated largely by gene transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Polycomb is required for transcriptional heterogeneity in mouse ESCs</title><p>PrEn priming genes are generally marked by invariant H3K27me3 proximal to their transcription start site, while epiblast priming genes are not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). Since both gene sets could be regulated by PRC2 in the gene body, we wanted to determine whether a complete removal of polycomb activity would result in a loss of priming. To determine whether polycomb functions as a primary regulator of coordinate changes in expression of priming-associated genes in individual ESCs we performed single cell qRT-PCR on SSEA1<sup>+</sup> FACS sorted <italic>Eed</italic><sup>-/-</sup> (PRC2) and <italic>Ring1b</italic><sup>-/-</sup> (PRC1) ESCs and their wild type (WT) parental ESC line (assayed genes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leeb et al., 2010</xref>).

Expression changes observed between conditions with and without EPZ occurred almost exclusively in those genes with H3K27me3 at their TSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>), suggesting that the effects of EPZ on expression were directly related to the block of H3K27 methylation.</p><p>To understand the impact of this loss of H3K27me3 on the lineage priming status of ESCs, we assessed the effect of EPZ treatment on the fraction of ESC culture that is primed towards either PrEn or Epi as assayed by HV or Nanog-GFP transcriptional reporter ESC lines, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The response of these reporters to 24 h incubation in N2B27+LIF base media containing standard 2i or PD03 alone, conditions in which PrEn priming is specifically blocked by inhibiting MEK-ERK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hamilton and Brickman 2014</xref>), was compared to EPZ treatment in the same base medium, a condition in which H3K27me3 catalysis is blocked. We found that this short-term inhibition of H3K27me3 resulted in increased PrEn priming (HV<sup>+</sup> fraction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, left panel), although there is little specific effect of EPZ on Nanog expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, right panel).</p><p>Lineage priming in ESCs has a clear functional definition that is based on differentiation outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Canham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Morgani et al., 2013</xref>) and we found that transient inhibition of H3K27me3 inhibited priming toward Epi derivatives and stimulated priming toward PrEn. To assess whether inhibition of H3K27me3 deposition influences ESC differentiation bias, we tested their tendency to differentiate in a specific direction upon removal of the reversible pharmacological block to H3K27 methylation. Epi differentiation was assessed in the form of defined neural differentiation using a reporter cell line in which GFP expression is driven by the promoter of the neural progenitor marker, Sox1. Following EPZ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) Sox1-GFP (46c) cells were differentiated and the levels of GFP expression were quantified by flow cytometry on day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Transient removal of H3K27me3 resulted in reduced neural differentiation efficiency and cells that formed less extensive axon networks while expressing relatively high levels of TUJ1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). We also assessed the capacity of the descendants of EPZ-treated ESCs to colonize the epiblast or PrEn lineages in vivo by injecting treated ESCs that contained a constitutive nuclear mCherry label (HVHC ESCs, see the methods section) into host morulas. Prior to injection, HVHC ESCs were grown in serum+LIF for 24 h, followed by 24 h of treatment in fresh serum+LIF (ESC control), N2B27+LIF+DMSO (DMSO control), or N2B27+LIF+EPZ (EPZ). ESCs grown in serum+LIF gave the expected high levels of Epi contribution and minimal contribution to the extra-embryonic visceral and parietal endoderm as we have observed in morula injections previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Morgani et al., 2013</xref>). While ESCs cultured in neutral media (N2B27+LIF+DMSO) produced a modest enhancement in extra-embryonic contribution, they also gave robust contribution to the epiblast (control 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In contrast, descendants of EPZ-treated ESCs were found at low levels in the embryonic epiblast and throughout the extra-embryonic endoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The impact of H3K27me3 inhibition on colonization of the PrEn and Epi lineages was apparent in both the number of embryos with extra-embryonic contribution and the extent of contribution in individual embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and data not shown). These results indicate that short-term inhibition of polycomb activity strongly reduces contribution to the epiblast while enhancing contribution to extra-embryonic endoderm. Taken together, both the in vitro differentiation and in vivo contribution results indicate that a transient loss of PRC2 catalytic activity shifts the distribution of priming in ESCs in favor of PrEn and away from epiblast.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Lineage primed cells, although functionally distinct, differ only subtly at the level of gene expression. These small fluctuations are associated with the acquisition of a distinct differentiation bias, although the corresponding changes in the physical properties of chromatin at individual gene loci are expected to be modest at best. This presupposes an inherent limitation in the ability to robustly detect the molecular events surrounding lineage priming on a per-gene basis. However, here we have taken advantage of the fact that these small expression changes occur synchronously across an extended set of genes. This allowed us to perform multi-gene meta-analysis for both transcriptional and epigenetic states and, in so doing, to detect changes that would otherwise have been unappreciated. This added power has allowed us to substantiate the gene expression changes observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Canham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Morgani et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover it has allowed us to determine that priming in embryonic stem cell populations is principally regulated at the level of transcription and involves the activity of polycomb repressive complexes. While the polycomb system has long been associated with regulating developmental gene expression, here we show that these proteins are both enablers and regulators of priming toward specific lineages during sequential rounds of ESC self-renewal.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Regulation of gene expression in ESC lineage priming</title><p>Lineage priming has been observed in several systems and refers to the existence of stem cell populations that possess equivalent capacities for self-renewal combined with transiently biased developmental potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mansson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kobayashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Canham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tsakiridis et al., 2014</xref>). Some insight has been gained as to the signalling cascades that influence lineage priming in ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hamilton and Brickman, 2014</xref>), yet the gene regulatory mechanisms underpinning these subtle and transient expression changes have remained undetermined. Here we performed nascent RNA analysis on Hhex-defined Epi- and PrEn-primed ESC populations to show that the regulation of lineage priming occurs primarily at the level of transcription. A small number of genes do however show alterations in steady-state but not nascent RNA levels, suggesting that post transcriptional mechanisms also play a role, particularly for genes that are upregulated in the PrEn-primed population. These genes include immediate early responders to ERK/MAPK signalling, such as Fos, Jun, Fosl1, Fosl2, Ctgf, Cyr61 and Igf2, all of which were previously shown to be regulated at the level of RNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rabani et al., 2011</xref>). As short durations of MEK-ERK signalling can stimulate the expression of these genes and promote reversible PrEn priming, a post-transcriptional mechanism would be compatible with rapid signal-induced state switching.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Polycomb allows for dynamic modulation of the expression of both PrEn and Epi priming genes</title><p>The Polycomb repressive system underpins the regulation of developmental gene expression programs during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fisher and Fisher 2011</xref>) and is important in lineage commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chamberlain et al., 2008</xref>). We show that transcriptional changes associated with lineage priming in ESC populations correlate with levels of H3K27me3 in two ways. An invariant pattern of H3K27me3 proximal to the transcription start site of PrEn priming genes and a reciprocal relationship between transcription and the levels of gene body H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). The dynamic changes in PRC2 activity within gene bodies links H3K27me3 deposition to changes in nascent transcription. This result suggests that PRC2 occupancy may be antagonised by local polymerase density and associated changes in chromatin state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schmitges et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miyazaki et al., 2013</xref>). Thus our observations argue that polycomb is not merely a silencing factor, but can help balance the dynamic oscillations in transcription that occur during lineage priming. This general role for polycomb contrasts with the lineage specific implications of the invariant pattern of H3K27me3 that we observe around the transcription start site of a large proportion of PrEn priming genes. Based on ChIP-seq analysis on mixed ESC populations, it has been suggested that polycomb targets in ESCs are lineage specific developmental genes, including PrEn genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azuara et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mikkelsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fisher and Fisher, 2011</xref>). However, these datasets contain a large number of genes expressed at unrelated stages of development. Here we link Polycomb specifically to the choice between Epi and PrEn differentiation that occurs in the blastocyst at around the time of ESC derivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chazaud et al., 2006</xref>). Based on our analysis, a large proportion of PrEn priming genes (~40%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) are polycomb targets that are upregulated in response to loss of polycomb activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leeb et al., 2010</xref>). However, datasets acquired using polycomb mutant ESCs are complicated by the selective nature of ESC growth and the capacity of polycomb mutant ESCs to adapt to culture over time. We also observed enhanced homogeneous expression of both PrEn genes and heterogeneously expressed members of the core Epi/pluripotency network (e.g. <italic>Esrrb</italic>, <italic>Nanog</italic> and <italic>Tbx3</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). One explanation for this lies in the inherently selective nature of ESC expansion. Thus, the induction of higher levels of PrEn priming might incur a growth disadvantage that could be compensated for by increased epiblast/pluripotent gene expression in PrEn primed cells. As PrEn supports Epi expansion in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Morgani and Brickman 2015</xref>), a loss of polycomb might result in the production of paracrine factors that can promote epiblast/pluripotent gene expression as has recently been suggested for the Wnt/Pcp pathway downstream of Jarid2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Landeira et al., 2015</xref>). In light of these results, we propose a model whereby polycomb acts around the start site of transcription to constrain PrEn gene expression within a limited dynamic range under homeostatic conditions, and in so doing, facilitates PrEn priming through transient and coordinated fluctuations in gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Sustained loss of polycomb activity therefore leads to selection of cells that exhibit reduced levels of heterogeneity.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14926.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Model for the role of polycomb in lineage priming of ESCs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The model depicts the stable interconversion of Epi- and PrEn-primed cell populations when ESCs are maintained in serum + LIF culture conditions. Epi- and PrEn-primed populations are represented as green and red filled circles, respectively. While these cells express differential levels of priming genes, they maintain ESC surface markers (represented by the black boundaries of the circles). Spontaneous differentiation in ESC culture is represented by a switch from ESC surface markers to lineage specific surface markers (represented by the coloured boundaries of the circles) as well as a switch from expression of priming genes to lineage specific marker genes (represented by the change from light to dark fill of the circles). Within the dashed vertical lines, the equilibrium between these states and self-renewal continues indefinitely. This balance is maintained, in part, by forces that resist lineage commitment to either the Epi or PrEn lineages (depicted as peaks). Both transcription factors (TFs; dark grey) and polycomb mediated repression (blue) are asymmetric components of this system, with TFs mainly restricting commitment towards Epi and polycomb mainly restricting commitment towards PrEn. (<bold>B</bold>) In the absence of polycomb-mediated repression, the balance is lost and the equilibrium shifts in favour of PrEn gene expression, which disrupts Epi priming and results in reduced Epi and increased PrEn commitment upon differentiation. Relative transcription levels of genes characteristic of Epi (green line) and PrEn (red line) are shown in the top panel.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14926.016">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14926.016</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-14926-fig5-v1"/></fig></p><p>Removal of H3K27me3 by short-term inhibition of polycomb (EZH2) methylation activity produces a state in which cells exhibit enhanced PrEn priming with very few actual changes in gene expression. This modest transcriptional effect could be due to the passive nature of H3K27me3 loss, where progressive dilution of the modified histone occurs as hypomethylated H3 is deposited following rounds of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alabert and Groth, 2012</xref>). Alternatively, removal of certain histone modifications may simply have little impact on global transcription under steady-state culture conditions, as the TF circuitry required to maintain gene expression levels remains intact. There is some evidence for this scenario, as disruption of components of both the SET1/MLL and PRC2 complexes leads to a marked reduction in the levels of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, respectively, with surprisingly little effect on gene expression. Interestingly, in these instances, the limited effect on expression contrasts with a marked impact on differentiation potential and these findings are compatible with the observations presented here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carlone et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jiang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clouaire et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Riising et al., 2014</xref>). We propose then, that EPZ treated cells are, to an extent, freed from the constraints on gene expression variability that are normally supported by polycomb. Under these conditions, priming loci have a greater probability of engaging in expression when challenged to differentiate. As a result, exposure of ESCs to short-term polycomb inhibition does not lead to a clear transcriptional response, but predisposes PrEn priming genes for rapid upregulation upon exposure to differentiation cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This is also consistent with the data we obtained using the <italic>Eed</italic> mutant HV reporter cell line, which showed enhanced expression of HV in response to Chi, a Gsk3 inhibitor also used to induce endoderm differentiation from ESCs. Taken together, our work suggests that stable polycomb occupancy at TSSs marks priming genes in ESCs and is coupled to highly dynamic, but limited fluctuations in transcription. These fluctuations are a component of the priming process, but their magnitude is kept in check to prevent ESCs from embarking on differentiation.</p><p>Embryonic development normally progresses from a state in which blastomeres co-express embryonic and extra-embryonic determinants, such as <italic>Nanog</italic> and <italic>Gata6</italic>, to states in which these factors are expressed in a mutually exclusive pattern in the ICM cells of the blastocyst in progenitors of the embryonic epiblast and extra-embryonic endoderm, respectively. The segregation of these two lineages is dependent on Fgf signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yamanaka et al., 2010</xref>) and involves the induction of lineage specific transcription factors. ESCs are derived from these stages of embryonic development and our data suggests that polycomb group proteins are important mediators of these initial lineage segregation events, perhaps supporting a limited period of dynamic cell fate choice in PrEn progenitors that precedes commitment to embryonic or extra-embryonic lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xenopoulos et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>ESC culture, inhibitor treatment and differentiation</title><p>E14 Tg2a ESCs (hereafter referred to as E14; 129/Ola background) and the derivative line HV5.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Canham et al., 2010</xref>) were cultured on 0.1% (w/v) gelatin (Sigma G1890) coated Corning flasks in ESC medium + LIF (GMEM (Sigma G5154) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA 10270–106), 1x MEM non-essential amino acids (Life Technologies 11140–036), 0.1 μM 2-Mercaptoethanol (Sigma, St. Louis, MO M6250), 2 mM L-Glutamine (Life Technologies 25030–024), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Life Technologies 11360–039), and 1000 U/ml of LIF.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Illingworth and colleagues work towards understanding the transcriptional regulation of cell fate heterogeneity within embryonic stem (ES) cell populations. Specifically, they take advantage of two interconverting populations of mouse ESCs primed for the primitive endoderm or the epiblast lineages, respectively, to gain insights into mechanisms underlying lineage priming in self-renewing ESCs. The authors provide evidence that this heterogeneity correlates with transcriptional variation between the two cell populations, which correlates with subtle changes in the distribution of the H3K27me3 histone post-translational modification (PTM), a mark catalyzed by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), both within gene bodies and, for primitive endoderm primed ESCs, at the promoter region. The authors provide evidence that loss of function of Polycombs leads to a loss of transcriptional heterogeneity, and, using both in vitro and in vivo developmental assays, report that transient inhibition of the PRC2 Polycomb complex in the ESC state leads to perturbations in cell fate decisions.</p><p>In summary, the authors suggest that polycombs create a block to PrEn commitment. The strength of the work is that the authors reveal a role of polycomb in regulating heterogeneity and lineage priming in self-renewing ESCs. To date most work on polycomb proteins has been done in the context of its function in ESC differentiation, i.e. when ESCs are moved down a specific lineage. As such the manuscript is an important addition for the field and new insights in this area improve our understanding of the early stages of development when pluripotent stem cells undergo lineage commitment.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Among the reviewers, there is considerable concern about the low-level effects, which limit the strength of the conclusions that can be reached. While there is not much that the authors can do about this, it limits the ability of the reader to know to what extent the differences are meaningful or direct. So far there are correlations between K27me3 and transcription as well as functional changes in the Polycomb KO, but a clear mechanistic framework is still lacking. Thus, all reviewers agree that more experiments are necessary to support and strengthen the conclusions.</p><p>1) The H3K27me3 ChIP data need to be upgraded. First, it is unclear how many replicates were performed to determine the differences in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Second, the ChIP-seq of histone PTMs is not a quantitative measure. Instead, ChIP-RX (Orlando et al., Cell Reports, 2014) is the now the accepted technique to establish whether there are quantitative differences in histone PTM levels, in this case for H3K27me3 in the Epi or PrEn cells. In fact, ChIP-RX would be particularly important in this case because the observed modest differences in H3K27me3 levels at promoters and gene bodies between the two cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>2) One question relates to the two populations sorted. How stable are the populations after sorting, what is their transition time? The authors should include further analysis of their sorted cells to show how their changes correlate with the changes in H3K27me3.</p><p>3) To better examine the role of Polycomb proteins in maintaining transcriptional heterogeneity, the authors provide single cell qPCRs for some genes. However, it is difficult to appreciate the extent of heterogeneity from the data provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The minor fluctuations in transcription observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> do not yet suggest any significant difference (here is no significance testing done for differences)? Could the authors represent their data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref> in a more quantitative manner? Quantifications of Nanog in several different fields are required in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> so as to provide an objective quantification of the experiment. Are Rex1 or Hhex now homogeneously expressed? Importantly, the analysis should be carried out in Polycomb knockout cells that have been sorted into either Epi or PrEn lineages, as done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. This would require more work, but would be essential to support the statements made by the authors. Perhaps a quick way to do this is to use CRISPR on the already made and validated Hhex reporter ES cell lines to KO Eed and Ring1A, separately.</p><p>4) The authors show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> that H3K27me3 signal is down by western blot in their inhibition studies, but not what is happening at the level of chromatin. It is impossible to know if the effects of this drug are direct or indirect or, whether cell fate decisions are modified by gene body H3K27me3 status, promoter methylation, or another mechanism. It would be useful to confirm that H3K27me3 is lowered gene bodies/promoters especially in the inhibitor treated cells. More molecular analysis of what is happening at the chromatin level in the inhibitor experiment is important for interpretation of the data.</p><p>5) It remains somewhat unclear what the effect of gene body methylation versus promoter methylation is – it would be important for the authors to provide more insights.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Polycomb Underlies Transcriptional Heterogeneity in Embryonic Stem Cells&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

I have a general issue with the lack of novelty with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.

The strengths of this paper are that it addresses an important question that is tough to get at experimentally, and makes interesting conclusions regarding the role of the PcG system in different precursor populations. This is a fundamental question in developmental biology, so the paper should be of broad interest. The weakness of the paper continues to be the fact that the effects are small, and therefore the conclusions are not as strong as they would be if there were significant effects. This is the biology of the system, however. The strengths significantly outweigh that weakness and I support publication of the revised paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The authors have done a good job of addressing the reviewers’ concerns although the issue of small changes remain.

While there is not much that the authors can do about this, it limits the ability of the reader to know to what extent the differences are meaningful or direct. So far there are correlations between K27me3 and transcription as well as functional changes in the Polycomb KO, but a clear mechanistic framework is still lacking. Thus, all reviewers agree that more experiments are necessary to support and strengthen the conclusions.</italic> </p><p>While we agree that some of the effects are small, it is important to keep in mind that lineage priming is by definition a small transcriptional change with functional consequences. It is therefore exceedingly difficult to approach priming on a gene by gene basis using current technology. However, the power of our analysis lies in our ability to define gene sets that vary synchronously with priming and this is how we have been able to substantiate these changes in previous publications (Canham 2010, Morgani 2013). Here we have used the power of these priming gene sets to define two novel modes of Polycomb regulation, a subtle but robust change in the gene body of all priming genes that is inversely correlated with transcription, and a promoter-specific road block to Primitive Endoderm (PrEn) commitment.</p><p>However, we appreciate the reviewers concern and have addressed these issues with additional data. In particular, in our response to point 2 raised below we now show that the small differences in gene body H3K27me3 disappear as priming reverses itself during self-renewal, providing further support for the dynamic nature of this Polycomb activity and its coupling to lineage priming.</p><p><italic>1) The H3K27me3 ChIP data need to be upgraded. First, it is unclear how many replicates were performed to determine the differences in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Second, the ChIP-seq of histone PTMs is not a quantitative measure. Instead, ChIP-RX (Orlando et al., Cell Reports, 2014) is the now the accepted technique to establish whether there are quantitative differences in histone PTM levels, in this case for H3K27me3 in the Epi or PrEn cells. In fact, ChIP-RX would be particularly important in this case because the observed modest differences in H3K27me3 levels at promoters and gene bodies between the two cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</italic> </p><p>The existing ChIP dataset was derived from two independent biological replicates mixed together in equal amounts prior to sequencing. This is now stated in the first paragraph of the subsection “Priming Genes Are Polycomb Targets”.</p><p>We agree that, given the subtlety of the described effect, additional replication would strengthen these observations. Consequently, we prepared two additional H3K27me3 ChIP-seq libraries from the primed populations, this time using cross-linked, in place of native, ChIP so that we could spike in pre-prepared cross-linked <italic>Drosophila</italic> material as per the ChIP-RX protocol. The ChIP worked well and corroborated our initial experiments using an equivalent normalisation (new data is now present as “cross linked ChIP,” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>As described, the ChIP-RX protocol is difficult to apply to sorted populations. In the two examples provided by Orlando et al. (Orlando et al. 2014) they use 1.5 and 2.0 x 10<sup>7</sup> cells for each experiment, and then add 50% of these values in cross-linked S2 cells to provide the <italic>Drosophila</italic> chromatin that enables normalization. These numbers are difficult to obtain in cell sorting experiments. As a result, we tried to scale the ChIP-RX down to cell numbers that could be obtained in multiple cell sorting experiments (between 0.5-1.3 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells). We also scaled down the number of cross-linked S2 cells (<italic>Drosophila</italic> spike), but as a result, we found that the test to spike ratios varied significantly between samples. Consequently, the resulting normalisation (as outlined by Orlando and colleagues) led to highly variable results, even between replicate experiments. Despite this issue, we could still detect the differential signal between the primed populations, but the overall ChIP enrichment was skewed due to differences in test to spike ratios between samples, making the data harder to interpret. We would be happy to provide spike-normalised data to illustrate the above points, should the reviewers wish to see it or consider it worth publishing in the online response document.</p><p>As exogenous spike normalisation is designed to account for global changes in ChIP signals that occur between different cell types, and primed ESCs are essentially the same cell type, we think it is unlikely that it is necessary in this case.</p><p>To address the reviewers’ concerns regarding the robustness of the effect we observed, we have provided additional replicates generated using an alternative ChIP methodology that corroborate our results. We hope this is sufficient to satisfy reviewers as to the robust nature of these results. We have also added additional cross-linked ChIP-seq comparing Epiblast (Epi) primed and spontaneously differentiated PrEn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, new panels C and D).</p><p><italic>2) One question relates to the two populations sorted. How stable are the populations after sorting, what is their transition time? The authors should include further analysis of their sorted cells to show how their changes correlate with the changes in H3K27me3.</italic> </p><p>This is an important point, as it is central to understanding the dynamics of lineage priming in ESCs and how this relates to the observed differences in H3K27me3 at gene bodies.</p><p>To address this, we utilised two new Hhex reporter lines to monitor the inter-conversion dynamics of the two primed populations. These cell lines contain two different fluorescent proteins (Venus vs. H2B-Cherry) to ensure that our kinetic measurements are independent of the behaviour of different fluorescent proteins. These cell lines also include a constitutively expressed lineage label, that enables us to conduct cell mixing experiments to determine whether the transition between one primed population and another is the same regardless of whether the starting point is a mixed culture or a single population. This has allowed us to exclude the impact of paracrine selective pressure driving the re-establishment of heterogeneity.</p><p>Our measurements of the dynamics of priming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>) indicate that sorted ESC populations were largely equivalent after 72 hours of re-culture, although full equilibration requires approximately 5 days (extrapolated from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>). Re-equilibration dynamics were equivalent regardless of which population was used as a starting point or whether the opposite populations were mixed together using the different constitutive lineage labels to separate them upon analysis (subsection “Priming Genes Are Polycomb Targets”, last paragraph).</p><p>To measure the re-equilibration of gene body H3K27me3, we chose an intermediate time point (30 hours) of re-culture. Thus we took half of the primed populations isolated to address point 1 above, so that the data would be directly comparable, and placed them back in self-renewing culture. Following 30 hours of re-culture, these cells were processed for ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D-F</xref>). Strikingly, the re-equilibration of the primed-populations in this time frame resulted in a complete homogenisation of the differential H3K27me3 levels seen between the primed populations. From this analysis we conclude that: ‘differential gene-body H3K27me3 levels are closely coupled to the dynamics of the cells as they transit between primed states, supporting the idea that these patterns are dictated largely by gene transcription.’</p><p>This data is included as a new supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), which is now described in the ‘Priming Genes Are Polycomb Targets’ Results section (last paragraph). We think this constitutes a major improvement to the paper and thank the reviewers for their suggestion.</p><p><italic>3) To better examine the role of Polycomb proteins in maintaining transcriptional heterogeneity, the authors provide single cell qPCRs for some genes. However, it is difficult to appreciate the extent of heterogeneity from the data provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The minor fluctuations in transcription observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> do not yet suggest any significant difference (here is no significance testing done for differences)? Could the authors represent their data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref> in a more quantitative manner?</italic> </p><p>We have added density plots representing the per cell expression values of WT, Ring1B KO and Eed KO ESCs (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The single cell data was evaluated for each gene using a Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test under the null hypothesis that there was no shift in the distribution of expression values between the WT and each mutant cell line. This non-parametric test assesses the cumulative distribution of a set of values to determine the likelihood that two samples are derived from the same distribution. Significant comparisons are indicated within the plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We also compared the p values for the KS tests to those obtained from Wilcoxon-Rank Sum tests (an alternative non-parametric test) performed on the same data. Data from these two statistical tests are found in a new supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>We have moved the violin plot representation of the single cell qRT-PCR data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, to make room for the new analysis in the main figure.</p><p><italic>Quantifications of Nanog in several different fields are required in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> so as to provide an objective quantification of the experiment.</italic> </p><p>This quantification has been inserted as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and includes the results of Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests, which were used to test for differential IF signal between the WT and mutant ESCs.</p><p><italic>Are Rex1 or Hhex now homogeneously expressed? Importantly, the analysis should be carried out in Polycomb knockout cells that have been sorted into either Epi or PrEn lineages, as done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. This would require more work, but would be essential to support the statements made by the authors. Perhaps a quick way to do this is to use CRISPR on the already made and validated Hhex reporter ES cell lines to KO Eed and Ring1A, separately.</italic> </p><p>As the reviewers suggested, we used the CRISPR targeting system to generate new HV5.1 reporter lines lacking either Eed or Ring1B (predominant PRC1 catalytic component in ESCs). We have now included data for an Eed deficient Hhex reporter.</p><p>In the time allowed for revision, we have been able to obtain an Eed mutant, but did not obtain a homozygous mutant Ring1B line. We believe that part of the problem may have been a failure of the Ring1B lines to stabilize in ESC culture, but it could also be that we need to go back and try new gRNAs. If this is a sticking point with the reviewers, we can go back and do this inducibly, as we think this might be required to ensure that we obtain an otherwise normal cell line in a relatively short span of time. We believe that this would be beyond the scope of the current manuscript and we felt it best to proceed with the Eed mutant, particularly since it exhibits aspects of the Polycomb phenotype we had already described. We hope the reviewers will be satisfied with the new data we have provided on Eed.</p><p>Analysis of the HV reporter Eed mutant is now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> and discussed at the end of the ‘Polycomb is Required for Transcriptional Heterogeneity in Mouse ESCs’ Results section.</p><p>Importantly, in Eed mutant reporters, we observe a similar reduction in Hhex heterogeneity as we described in our single cell PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). As a result we do not believe that it would be informative to sort primed populations from these mutants. However, we also observe that the Hhex reporter was significantly induced in Eed mutants in response to adding the Gsk3 inhibitor Chiron (Chi) to media. Chi is known to stabilize β-catenin, leading to the induction of Wnt targets, and Hhex is a known Wnt target (Zorn et al. 1999; Huelsken et al. 2000; Rodriguez et al. 2001; Zamparini et al. 2006). The enhanced induction of the reporter supports one of the substantial conclusions of our paper, that Polycomb acts to suppress endoderm commitment and while PrEn genes are not significantly induced in its absence, they become poised for activation.</p><p><italic>4) The authors show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> that H3K27me3 signal is down by western blot in their inhibition studies, but not what is happening at the level of chromatin. It is impossible to know if the effects of this drug are direct or indirect or, whether cell fate decisions are modified by gene body H3K27me3 status, promoter methylation, or another mechanism. It would be useful to confirm that H3K27me3 is lowered gene bodies/promoters especially in the inhibitor treated cells. More molecular analysis of what is happening at the chromatin level in the inhibitor experiment is important for interpretation of the data.</italic> </p><p>To address this point we performed native H3K27me3 ChIP followed by quantitative PCR in 3 independent Hhex reporter lines treated for 24h with either EPZ or DMSO (control). This candidate analysis confirmed the extensive reduction in H3K27me3 levels observed by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and extended this to show that this occurs to an equivalent extent at both TSSs and gene bodies. This new information can be found in the ‘Short-term Inhibition of PRC2 function results in enhanced PrEn priming’ Results section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref> (new panel).</p><p><italic>5) It remains somewhat unclear what the effect of gene body methylation versus promoter methylation is – it would be important for the authors to provide more insights.</italic> </p><p>In the manuscript we maintain that gene body H3K27me3 varies during priming inversely with transcription. When PolII density is decreased, H3K27me3 accumulates in the gene body. In the promoter, the unique H3K27me3 configuration around the start site of transcription in the PrEn priming genes enables transcriptional variation, but constrains it, to block commitment. During priming we observed no change in promoter localized H3K27me3, supporting this idea. However, what about differentiation?</p><p>To address this we collected the spontaneously differentiating fraction of PrEn from ESCs by isolating the HV<sup>+</sup>S<sup>-</sup> fraction by FACS and performed H3K27me3 ChIP on these cells. We then compared this data to that of the Epi-primed fraction (HV<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup>). This supports our observations based on the published Rex reporter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>) showing more pronounced changes in H3K27me3 levels including changes at the TSS and the region just upstream of it. Based on these results we suggest that ‘changes in the levels of gene body H3K27me3 are inversely proportional to transcriptional changes in both primed and spontaneously differentiating ESCs, while measurable losses at TSSs only become evident upon differentiation’. This new data is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C, D</xref> and discussed in the ‘Priming Genes Are Polycomb Targets’ Results section.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>All reviewers agree that the small changes observed in the manuscript are an inherent problem of their biological system.
