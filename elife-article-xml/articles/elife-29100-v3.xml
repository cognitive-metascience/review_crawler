As powerful chemical signals, pheromones are enormously varied in different animal species. How the animal olfaction has evolved at the molecular level to adapt to the changing pheromones is a forefront research subject in life sciences.</p><p>Moths are good model systems for pheromone communication study. Male moths fly upwind to find conspecific females releasing a plume of sex pheromone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cardé and Haynes, 2004</xref>). Most moth sex pheromones have multiple components present in specific ratios that play significant roles in intraspecific sexual communication and in interspecific reproductive isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cardé et al., 1977</xref>). Male moths possess highly sensitive and selective olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) located in antennal sensilla that detect the pheromone molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schneider, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hansson and Stensmyr, 2011</xref>). Pheromone receptors (PRs) located in the dendritic membrane of OSNs play a pivotal role in peripheral coding of sex pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leal, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sakurai et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Unlike general odorant receptors (ORs) that typically bind more than one ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Fouchier et al., 2017</xref>), PRs are in general narrowly tuned to specific pheromone components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grosse-Wilde et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang and Löfstedt, 2015</xref>). The ligands of some PRs in lepidopteran species have been successfully identified using heterologous expression systems, including <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wetzel et al., 2001</xref>), the HEK293 cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grosse-Wilde et al., 2006</xref>), the Sf9 cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kiely et al., 2007</xref>), <italic>Drosophila melanogaster delta-halo</italic> mutants with an empty ab3A neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dobritsa et al., 2003</xref>), and <italic>Or67D-GAL4</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kurtovic et al., 2007</xref>). However, the functions of many PRs in moth species are still unknown, thus hindering our understanding of pheromone detection at the molecular level in this group of insects.</p><p>Closely related moth species often use combinations of the same or similar pheromone components, which is a reflection of their common evolutionary history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cardé and Haynes, 2004</xref>). They also possess homologous PRs with very similar sequences, but clearly differentiated in their ligand specificity. How do changes in amino acid sequences alter the ligand selectivity of PRs? The single study to date that has addressed this question showed that a single-point mutation in a PR is responsible for its different specificities in <italic>Ostrinia furnacalis</italic> and <italic>Ostrinia nubilalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leary et al., 2012</xref>). Studies of a number of ORs in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> indicated that the determinant amino acids are located mainly in transmembrane domains and extracellular loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo and Kim, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hughes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nichols and Luetje, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pellegrino et al., 2011</xref>), but the molecular mechanisms that determine the ligand selectivity of ORs are still unclear.</p><p>The closely related moth species, <italic>Helicoverpa assulta</italic> and <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic>, are sympatric pests in Asia. The former is a specialist mainly feeding on solanaceous plants, including tobacco and hot pepper, whereas the latter is a polyphagous species and is one of the most devastating pests in the world. <italic>H. assulta</italic> and <italic>H. armigera</italic> share two compounds, (<italic>Z</italic>)−9-hexadecenal (Z9-16:Ald) and (<italic>Z</italic>)−11-hexadecenal (Z11-16:Ald) as their principal sex-pheromone components, but in inverse ratios, 93:7 and 3:97, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Piccardi et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). (<italic>Z</italic>)−9-tetradecenal (Z9-14:Ald) acts as an antagonist in the pheromone communication of <italic>H. assulta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boo et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). In that of <italic>H. armigera</italic>, Z9-14:Ald acts as an agonist in small amounts (0.3%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rothschild, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>) but an antagonist in higher amounts (1% and above) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gothilf et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kehat and Dunkelblum, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). Three functional types of pheromone-sensitive sensilla, A, B and C, can be distinguished in the male antennae of the two species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baker et al., 2004</xref>). Sensilla type A specifically respond to Z11-16:Ald, type B respond to Z9-14:Ald, and type C respond to Z9-16:Ald, Z9-14:Ald and some other structurally related compounds. B-type and C-type sensilla are classified into subtypes according to their response spectra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). The population of A-type sensilla predominates in males of <italic>H. armigera</italic>, while C-type sensilla are most numerous in males of <italic>H. assulta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). The two species share almost the same set of orthologous PRs. Previous functional studies of the PRs showed that HarmOr13 and HassOr13 are specifically tuned to Z11-16:Ald (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), HarmOr14b and HassOr16 are tuned to Z9-14:Ald (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), HarmOr16 is tuned to both Z9-14:Ald and (<italic>Z</italic>)−11-hexadecenol (Z11-16:OH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), while HarmOr6 and HassOr6 are mainly tuned to (<italic>Z</italic>)−9-hexadecenol (Z9-16:OH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>). However, it is still unclear which PR is specific for Z9-16:Ald, the major component of <italic>H. assulta</italic> sex pheromone.</p><p>In this study, we first identified the PR tuned to Z9-16:Ald in <italic>H. assulta</italic>. Because C-type sensilla responding to Z9-16:Ald are densely distributed in the male antennae of <italic>H. assulta</italic>, we predicted that this PR should be highly expressed in male antennae. Therefore, we used qPCR to analyze the expression level of all candidate PRs in male antennae in <italic>H. assulta</italic>, and then used the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte expression system and two-electrode voltage-clamp recording to examine the function of highly expressed PRs. We surprisingly found that the PR tuned to Z9-16:Ald is HassOr14b, while its ortholog HarmOr14b is tuned to Z9-14:Ald in the closely related species <italic>H. armigera.</italic> Next, focusing on the two orthologous receptors, we identified the amino acid residues determining this functional shift. We used a series of regional replacements and single-point mutations, coupled with functional analyses, to demonstrate that two single-point mutations located in the intracellular regions of the molecule together determine their ligand selectivity. Our results suggest that a change in the tuning selectivity of PRs during the speciation of some moths could result from just a few mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phylogenetic analysis of candidate PRs</title><p>The reported transcriptome data and full-length cloning of the PRs made it possible to analyze all candidate PRs in the two closely related species and in other species of Noctuidae.

To investigate the evolutionary pressures acting on the coding regions of each cluster, we estimated the ratios of nonsynonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) nucleotide substitution (ω = dN/dS) in the PR gene lineages and the Orco lineage using DnaSP version 5.10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Librado and Rozas, 2009</xref>).

This provided an opportunity to examine the relationship between structure and function in the two orthologous PRs. From the sequence alignment and secondary structural analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; TOPCONS, topcons.net), we found that the 38 differing amino acids were distributed fairly uniformly in the two proteins. Therefore, we separated the whole sequence into eight regions (RI–VIII) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Then we conducted a series of mutagenesis experiments by replacing each of the eight regions of HassOr14b with the corresponding segment of HarmOr14b, while maintaining the rest of the sequence unchanged. After successfully constructing the modified sequences, we analyzed their functions as for the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Interestingly, comparing with the ligand selectivity of the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), we observed that the ligand selectivity of HassOr14b was changed remarkably by replacement of the region VI or VIII. HassOr14b after replacing the region VI had a significantly higher response to Z9-14:Ald than to Z9-16:Ald (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), while after replacing the region VIII had strong responses to both Z9-16:Ald and Z9-14:Ald (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). However, most of the region replacements in HassOr14b showed selectivities similar to that of the wild type, with Z9-16:Ald being the most effective ligand. In particular, replacement of the regions I or III produced significantly lower responses to Z9-16:Ald (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and C</xref>), while replacement of the region VII resulted in a significantly stronger response to Z9-16:Ald (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>).

It is worth noting that inward currents of the oocytes expressing HassOr14b induced by Z9-16:Ald were distinct but relatively low. It is common that the oocytes expressing some PRs are relatively weaker than others in responding to their ligands. However, their responding patterns in the oocyte system are generally representative of those in native OSNs. A clear dose-response curve to the most effective ligand is always helpful to confirm the receptor’s function.</p><p>The previous functional studies of HassOr14b did not find its activity by using the <italic>Xenopus</italic> system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we re-cloned the sequence of <italic>HassOr14b</italic> by use of Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and repeated again to verify the sequence by Sanger sequencing for 10 samples, and also compared with the sequence in the transcriptome data of <italic>H. assulta</italic>.

Moreover, we further analyzed the transcriptome data in <italic>H. assulta</italic> and confirmed that in the three different amino acids positions, there is no sequence polymorphism. We used the accurate sequence this time and characterized the function of HassOr14b, which is specifically tuned to Z9-16:Ald, the major sex pheromone component in <italic>H. assulta</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2016</xref> also used the LA-<italic>Taq</italic> polymerase (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang et al.

By analyzing the transcriptome data in <italic>H. assulta,</italic> we confirmed that this amino acid position has no sequence polymorphism. Another difference between the two studies is the vector used in the expression system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2016</xref> used the pT7Ts vector, while we use the pCS2+ vector in the expression system. We suggest that the accuracy and integrity of the sequence is crucial to identify the function of the receptors. Moreover, the selection of the appropriate expression vector could be also important.</p><p>As the ligands of HassOr14b and the second abundant PRs, HassOr6 and HassOR16 are all included in the responding spectrum of the C type sensilla, we further investigated the expressing sites of the three PRs in the sensilla. HassOr14b is co-localized with HassOR6 or HassOR16 in the neighboring neurons in the same sensilla, while HassOr6 and HassOr16 are always expressed in different sensilla, which is different from the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2016</xref>). Our results indicate that there are different combinations of the PRs in the C type sensilla, which is consistent with the previous single sensillum recording results that there are subtypes in the type C sensilla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that shows the various combinations of PRs were the molecular basis for the different sensilla subtypes in moth species.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Two amino acids located in the intracellular domains together determine the OR selectivity</title><p>Insects use olfactory receptors to discriminate amongst thousands of volatiles or pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaupp, 2010</xref>). Insect ORs require the co-expression of a ligand-selective OR and a universal odorant co-receptor (Orco) to form ligand-gated ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Missbach et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vosshall and Hansson, 2011</xref>). In the absence of data on the crystalline structure of insect ORs, the relationship between structure and function in these molecules is elusive. By amino acid covariation across insect Orcos and ORs, Hopf <italic>et al</italic>. constructed the first 3D models of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> ORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hopf et al., 2015</xref>). However, this provided only an indirect insight into protein structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carraher et al., 2015</xref>). Previous site-directed mutagenesis studies performed to probe OR specificity, mainly focused on the transmembrane domains (TMDs) and extracellular loops (ECLs), based on the assumption that the TMDs and ECLs of the OR form the ligand-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo and Kim, 2010</xref>). Leary <italic>et al</italic>. reported that a single amino acid mutation located in the predicted third TMD could change the ligand specificity of a PR between that of the Asian corn borer and that of the European corn borer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leary et al., 2012</xref>). Pellegrino <italic>et al.</italic> showed that a single natural polymorphism of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Or59B in the third transmembrane domain altered DEET sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pellegrino et al., 2011</xref>). In <italic>A. gambiae</italic>, a single mutation of AgOr15 at the interface between ECL2 and TMD4, produced large changes in responses to odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hughes et al., 2014</xref>). To address the relationship between OR-Orco structure and function, several recent studies showed that some amino acid residues in the OR or Orco were essential for channel activity of the heteromeric insect OR-Orco complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakagawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Turner et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The different ligand selectivities of HassOr14b and HarmOr14b provide a convenient system in which to study structure-function relationships of PRs. Comparing the whole amino acid sequences of the two orthologous receptors, we identified two regions that were responsible for their selectivity. This new method is convenient and efficient, particularly for functional comparisons between orthologous or paralogous genes with many differing amino acids. By further replacing single amino acids in the two regions, we finally detected two single-point mutations, T355I and F232I responsible for the different ligand selectivities of HassOr14b and HarmOr14b. It is for the first time to find that the two mutation sites in the intracellular domains (ICDs) rather than in the TMDs and ECLs were involved in determination of ligand selectivity. We suggest two possible explanations for the role of ICDs. First, the binding site of ligand-specific ORs, such as PRs, may have a complex structure, which involves TMDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leary et al., 2012</xref>), ECLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hughes et al., 2014</xref>) and ICDs. Alternatively, ICDs may be involved in the specific interactions of the PR with the related G proteins. To relay the signal into the cell interior, binding of an extracellular molecule to an OR is tightly followed by binding of the receptor to a trimeric G protein inside the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ignatious Raja et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wicher et al., 2008</xref>). Elucidation of the details of the structural and functional mechanisms of ORs must await further study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications for the modulation and evolution of OR selectivity</title><p>Animal nervous systems are shaped by shifting environmental selection pressures to perceive and respond to new sensory cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Prieto-Godino et al., 2017</xref>). The olfactory systems found in all animals have nearly the same design features, which give olfaction a considerable flexibility for signaling to evolve. Since the central odor processing is relatively conserved, new olfactory pathways tend to evolve from the peripheral changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Galizia and Rössler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Prieto-Godino et al., 2017</xref>). How mutations in olfactory receptors change the olfactory responses of animals and eventually impact on the evolution of animal behavior is crucial but remains unclear.</p><p>In moth species, the co-evolution of pheromones produced by females and their detection by males present a paradox. Under stabilizing selection, variation of the female pheromone blend is limited, and the males typically prefer the most common pheromone blends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Groot et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roelofs et al., 2002</xref>). The ω value for all clusters of PRs analyzed in this study are less than 1, suggesting that PRs would be subjected to purifying selection. However, at the same time, the male moths need to have a degree of plasticity to adapt to changes in signal structures associated with speciation. Site-directed mutagenesis and functional analyses could validate how many amino acid substitutions are required to alter a PR’s selectivity.</p><p>Based on previous studies, suggesting that <italic>H. assulta</italic> is ancestral to <italic>H. armigera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fang et al., 1997</xref>), we tried to reproduce the assumed evolutionary process that mutated HassOr14b into HarmOr14b. Most of the regional replacements and site mutations did not change the ligand selectivity of HassOr14b, indicating the functional stability of this PR. Only F232I and T355I substitutions produced a large change of the ligand selectivity of Or14b, from Z9-16:Ald in <italic>H. assulta</italic> to Z9-14:Ald in <italic>H. armigera</italic>. The former site mutation produced a small shift from Z9-16:Ald to Z9-14:Ald in the response spectrum, the latter extended and strengthened the responses to both chemicals, while the two mutations together generated a complete functional shift from Z9-16:Ald to Z9-14:Ald. These results indicate that the substitutions of a few key amino acids are able to greatly change PR selectivity, laying the molecular foundations for PR plasticity. Moreover, it seems that at least two steps, involving in the functional extension and shift, are required for a major functional change of HassOr14b, each step with a single point mutation. In the course of speciation, the functional change of ORs could be a process with multiple amino acid mutations, a few making drastic changes and many making small modifications or even no change in function.</p><p>The two closely related species <italic>H. assulta</italic> and <italic>H. armigera</italic> are one of the ideal study systems for pheromone communication. They share two chemicals, Z9-16:Ald and Z11-16:Ald, as their principal sex pheromone components but with reverse ratios. Males possess sensitive olfactory systems to detect conspecific sex pheromone blends. Peripheral coding of the binary blends with reversed ratios is mainly attributed to two group of specific OSNs in separate antennal sensilla with reverse population sizes, which reflect different expression levels of related PRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, we discover that HassOr14b, the highest expressed PR in male antennae of <italic>H. assulta</italic> is tuned to Z9-16:Ald, the major component of the sex pheromone of <italic>H. assulta</italic>, while its ortholog HarmOr14b is tuned to Z9-14:Ald in <italic>H. armigera</italic>, which provides us an ideal model to study the determinants of OR selectivity. We systematically identify two single-point mutations, F232I and T355I, located in the intracellular regions of HassOr14b that together determine the functional shift to its ortholog, HarmOr14b, in <italic>H. armigera</italic>. The peripheral modifications of the two closely related species took place in both PR expression level and PR tuning selectivity. These findings not only help us specifically understand the evolution of the two <italic>Helicoverpa</italic> species, but also provide new insights into the structure and function of cell membrane receptors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Insects</title><p><italic>H. assulta</italic> and <italic>H. armigera</italic> were originally collected as larvae in tobacco fields in Zhengzhou, Henan province of China, and were reared at the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing.

Your article has been reviewed by Fred Gould (Reviewer #1), Astrid Groot (Reviewer #2), and Christer Loefstedt (Reviewer #3), and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ian Baldwin as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this letter to prompt a response from you concerning the serious concerns of the reviewers. Please address these concerns in a letter, which we will have the Board and reviewers consider before a binding recommendation is made.</p><p>Your manuscript has been evaluated by three experts in the field. Although they found your results interesting, they have also identified important concerns related to the experimental results in connection to previous studies by your and other groups. As a consequence, the story that you tell in the manuscript is flawed. For the manuscript to be acceptable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, you need to connect better to the literature and include caveats such as the suitability of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> system that does not seem to work well for HR14b in Hass and the fact that there are other receptors for Z9-16Ald in Hass and that Z9-16Ald may be antagonistic in both species. How does this affect the conclusions that you can draw from your experiments? Also the in situ hybridization images are not convincing and do not support previous publications. You will find the detailed comments by the reviewers below. In the light of these evaluations, the manuscript cannot be accepted at this moment. If you feel that you can effectively address the most critical concerns of the reviewers, please send us your responses for further evaluation but the Board and reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>General: Overall this is a very interesting paper that is one of only a couple of papers that have identified amino acid changes if a moth pheromone receptor that change specificity. This is a very important finding because it could show that the evolution of new sexual communication systems in moths could evolve based on very simple genetic changes. That said, I do have some concerns about specific issues.</p><p>Specific:</p><p>1) As far as I can tell only one peer reviewed paper indicates the Z9-14Ald is an active positive part of the Harm pheromone. In another paper this compound is found to be an antagonist in both Hass and Harm. This should be made clear to the reader because unlike some other systems where there is a clear change from using one compound to using another in two closely related species, in this case the selective pressure to evolve the receptor in Harm for Z9-14Ald is not very clear.</p><p>2) Earlier research papers that have searched for activity of HR14b in Hass have failed to find any activity. This includes a recent paper by some of the authors of the current paper. It would be useful for the authors to explain why they did not find activity in their other recent paper, but that they now find it.</p><p>3) Looking at the plots in the figures that show &quot;current (nA)&quot; on the Y-axis, it becomes clear that at least with the <italic>Xenopus</italic> system, the level of activity of the Hass HR14b receptor is much lower than for the Harm HR14b receptor. Whereas the response to Z9-14Ald in Harm is over 400 and for Z9-16Ald is around 50, the response of the Hass HR14b receptor to even Z9-16Ald (to which it is specific) is only about 60. Clearly, this oocyte system is not very efficient for Hass HR14b. This may be why previous studies didn't find any activity. The authors should acknowledge this.</p><p>4) This lack of sensitivity of the HR14b of Hass is problematic for interpreting the results of single mutations to the Hass HR14b receptor. Clearly, the T3551 mutation dramatically increases the overall response of HR14b while negating specificity. This makes it hard to interpret the interaction of the two mutations.</p><p>5) There is overlap between the paper Olfactory perception and behavioral effects of sex pheromone gland components in <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> and <italic>Helicoverpa assulta</italic>, Meng Xu et al. 2016 and the current paper. This overlap should be made more clear.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript describes the functional characterization of an olfactory receptor in the noctuid moth <italic>Helicoverpa assulta</italic>, HassOR14b, that is tuned to the major sex pheromone of this species, Z9-16:Ald, while its ortholog HarmOR14b in <italic>H. armigera</italic> is tuned to Z9-14:Ald, the secondary sex pheromone component of this species (the main sex pheromone component Z11-16:Ald, which is perceived through HarmOR13). Through a series of mutagenesis experiments, the authors convincingly show that two single point mutations, F232I and T355I, in HassOR14b changes the sensitivity of this receptor from Z9-16:Ald to Z9-14:Ald. These mutations correspond to the HarmOR14b amino acid sequences at these sites. In additions, the authors show with in-situ hybridizations that HassOR14b is co-localized with HassOR6 and HassOR16.</p><p>I only have a few minor, but essential comments on the text that I think can easily be addressed:</p><p>1. I miss citation to the recent article by De Fouchier et al. in Nature Communications (DOI: 10.1038/ncomms1570910)</p><p>2. Since HarmOR14b is tuned to Z9-14:Ald, I think it's important that the authors write 1-2 sentences on how this component is a minor (but essential) sex pheromone component in <italic>H. armigera</italic>. In the current text it seems that the sex pheromone system of these two species is a two-component system with similar reverse ratios as in the two pheromone strains of Ostrinia nubilalis, while the pheromone blend of H. armigera (and also H. assulta) is a bit more complex than just a two-component blend.</p><p>3. The authors give dN/dS ratios (ω) for the different ORs (Results, subsection “Phylogenetic analysis of candidate PRs”), reasoning that ω &lt; 1 indicates puryfying selection, while ω &gt; 1 indicates positive selection. As they found a ω = 0.17 for cluster OR14b, this thus indicates puryfying selection. However, in the discussion the authors do not come back to this result and instead write &quot;The female moth produces a pheromone blend of several components, stabilized by strong selection pressure against any change in such blends (Roelofs et al., 2002). This requires an equivalent stability from the male moths to detect the same species-specific pheromones, but at the same time should allow for a degree of plasticity to adapt to changes in pheromone structures associated with speciation.&quot; This part needs to be revised, as 'stabilized by strong selection pressure' and 'equivalent stability' are strangely used. Also, the latter part &quot;should allow for a degree of plasticity&quot; comes across as hand waving. Similarly, &quot;In the course of speciation, the functional change of ORs is a gradual process with multiple amino acid mutations, a few making drastic changes and many making small modifications or even no change in function&quot; need to be revised, as 'gradual changes' contradicts 'a few making drastic changes' and as a whole this sentence doesn't make sense.</p><p>4. Discussion, subsection “Novel identified PR and the different combinations with other PRs”, first paragraph: HassOR14b should be &quot;HassOR16 in the same sensilla&quot;. Do the authors know where the orthologous ORs are localized in <italic>H. armigera</italic>? Is HarmOR14b also co-localized with HarmOR6 or HarmOR16?

Discussion, subsection “Novel identified PR and the different combinations with other PRs”, second paragraph:: Where are these amino acid residues located? I think it's important to specify this, especially because this is the first study (right?) where amino acid sequence changes in the intracellular domains (ICDs). I would also like to read a bit more on how the authors think these changes may alter the function. They give two very short explanations in the next paragraph, but what do they mean with 'complex deep structure'?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Yang et al. report that two amino acid substitutions in intracellular domains may account for the difference in ligand specificity between HarmOr14b and HassOr14b. The conclusion is based on a series of mutagenesis experiments. The results are interesting but &quot;the story&quot; is not ready for publication. A number of major issues are listed below. In addition, I think that the discussion of how mutations in the intracellular domains may influence ligand specificity (subsection “Two amino acids located in the intracellular domains together determine the OR selectivity”, last paragraph) is speculative and lacks both references and a possible mechanism.</p><p>The study is mainly based on the authors´ finding that HassOR14b is responsive to Z9-16:Ald whereas HarmOR14b is responsive to Z9-14:Ald. However, according to a previous study from the same laboratory (Jiang et al., 2014) and the study by Chang et al. (2015), HassOR14b did not respond to any tested compounds including Z9-16:Ald. This needs to be clarified. The authors do not mention about this discrepancy and do not even cite the Chang et al. paper:</p><p>Jiang, X.-J., Guo, H., Di, C., Yu, S., Zhu, L., Huang, L.-Q., Wang, C.-Z. (2014).

In addition, it is not clear to me how the authors can conclude anything about the expression levels in the ancestor. Based on analysis of the contemporary species (which at some point had a common ancestor) we can at the best conclude that expression levels are different in these two species. The reasoning further involves a teleological argument, i.e. that the species that evolved from the common ancestor had some &quot;specific demands&quot;. This is not how evolution works.</p><p>In the subsection “Quantitative real-time PCR”: the authors write that the reference gene is 18s rRNA, but the GenBank number provided is actually the actin gene.

Your article has been reviewed by Fred Gould (Reviewer #1), Astrid Groot (Reviewer #2), and Christer Loefstedt (Reviewer #3), and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ian Baldwin as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers have appreciated your effective revision of the manuscript and the extensive explanation in the rebuttal. They conclude that your study provides very interesting results on how small differences in pheromone receptors may influence ligand selectivity. Still some important issues remain and I invite you to address these comments by the reviewers and prepare a second revision of the manuscript. Specific attention should be paid to sentences where you refer to the literature on odour reception and genetic mechanisms and evolutionary consequences. Some of these sentences are highlighted in the reviews, while others are not. For example, what is meant with 'a few steps' in the last sentence of the Abstract?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The <italic>eLife</italic> editor summarized my concerns well as &quot;For the manuscript to be acceptable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, you need to connect better to the literature and include caveats such as the suitability of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> system that does not seem to work well for HR14b in Hass and the fact that there are other receptors for Z9-16Ald in Hass and that Z9-16Ald may be antagonistic in both species. How does this affect the conclusions that you can draw from your experiments? &quot;</p><p>The authors have made useful changes but I think a little more discussion of some of the issues with the <italic>Xenopus</italic> system in this specific case is warranted because the same issue is likely to arise in future studies.</p><p>I realize that in the current Abstract and in most of the manuscript the authors avoid discussing the relevance of their findings to the evolution of the two species of <italic>Helicoverpa</italic>. For example, in the Abstract they state that &quot;We conclude that species-specific changes in the tuning specificity of the PRs of male moths could be achieved with just a few steps&quot;. As long as the authors don't indicate that their findings help us to specifically understand the evolution of the two <italic>Helicoverpa</italic> moths, I think they are on solid ground. The two mutations they study certainly change the tuning specificity.</p><p>It still would be good if the authors could elaborate on the fact their findings are of most interest in terms of neurophysiology and are not a direct commentary on the evolution of these specific moths.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Overall, I'm very impressed with all the work the authors have done and also with their revision. I have a few remaining questions for the authors:</p><p>The numbering of the figures was a bit confusing, I'm not sure which figures are now supposed to be supplementary figures, so I'll go with the complete names of the figures.</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> the authors show that HasOR14b responds to Z9-16:Ald, but when comparing the different graphs, the y-axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is in a different (smaller) scale than the y-axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, which shows that HassOr6 actually responds more to Z9-16:Ald (300 nA) than HassOr14b (70 nA). Such a difference in scaling is also present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; HassOr14b shows a current response to Z9-16:Ald of 70 nA again, and/but HarmOr14b shows a current response of 30-40 (?) nA. I do understand that HarmOr14b mostly responds to Z9-14:Ald, but the response to Z9-16:Ald may also be important, no? (In this respect it is indeed very impressive that the authors found an almost 10x stronger response when mutating T335I (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Which relates to my next question:</p><p>2) As Z9-16:Ald is also an important (albeit minor) sex pheromone component of <italic>H. armigera</italic>, with what receptor(s) do the authors think <italic>H. armigera</italic> is perceiving this component?</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> the authors show that HassOR6 is highly expressed in males, and a little in females. Which makes sense to me, as females probably smell their own pheromone as well. I don't think that sex-specific expression is a necessary criterium for an OR to be a sex pheromone OR.</p><p>4) The authors have responded to previous comments on why previous functional assays with HassOr14b didn't work by writing that the sequence had not been correct in previous work and that this is now corrected. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3——figure supplement 3</xref> they specify which 3 amino acids have been corrected (Yang et al. is the current sequence used). In checking these 3 amino acids in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6, I</xref> found them in RIII, in RVII and in RVIII. I find it hard to determine whether one of these 3 SNPs were among the ones tested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>. Still, I think the authors make a convincing case that the right sequence together with the selection of the appropriate expression vector is crucial to identify the function of receptors.</p><p>5) Hopefully <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref> is not a supplementary figure, as I think this figure is a great way of showing the results of the single mutations.</p><p>6) As for the in situ hybridization pictures, these are clear to me, but I leave this to the more experienced reviewer(s) to decide whether this is sufficiently clear.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In summary, I think that the revision represents a considerable improvement of the manuscript and the authors have to a large extent explained many of the mistakes and the missing information in the original submission. However, some of my previous comments/questions still apply.</p><p>In the rebuttal letter the authors write:</p><p>'Basically there are two major concerns: (Baker et al., 2004) the suitability of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> system […] (Boo et al., 1995) Contradiction of our in situ hybridization results'.</p><p>In my opinion this is not correct. At least not when it comes to my concerns. My major concern was that the authors avoided mentioning the inconsistency in the response of wild type HassOR14b compared to previous publications. In the current version, the authors explain that the gene sequences were not correct in previous publications. However, the explanation is not straight forward:</p><p>- The sequences in Chang et al., 2016 were based on the transcriptome data from the previous paper (Zhang et al., 2015) from the same group. There's a single amino acid difference of HassOR14b sequence between the current manuscript and the sequence in Chang's paper. Could it simply be explained by the use of different polymerases? How could the authors exclude the possibility of polymorphism? Although possible, it's not very likely that this one amino acid difference would totally abolish the response to Z9-16:Ald (No response to Z9-16:Ald or any other ligand in Chang et al. 2016) but significant response to Z9-16:Ald in the current study (70 nA – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The authors of the present manuscript can of course not take the responsibility of any possible flaws in a study published by another group but the discrepancy requires an explicit comment in the Discussion.</p><p>Zhang, J., Wang, B., Dong, S., Cao, D., Dong, J., Walker, W.

PloS one, 10(2), e0117054.</p><p>I do not understand how different expression vectors could cause the difference in sequence. The authors have to explain how. Otherwise it is just an ad hoc explanation that needs to be tested. It's the cRNAs that are injected and expressed in the oocytes. The resulting receptor proteins should have the same sequences despite of what the original expression vectors were. In addition, the pT7TS vectors have been widely and successfully used in oocyte recordings and OR studies. Why should this vector not be suitable for HassOR14b expression and oocyte recordings?</p><p>The authors write in the rebuttal and mention in the Discussion that they re-sequenced HassOr14b and came up with the &quot;right sequence&quot;. This is a new (and important) result and as such it should be mentioned in the Results section and the relevant methods and materials should be described in Materials and methods before the discrepancy with previous studies is discussed in the Discussion section.</p><p>As far as I understand reviewer #1 was not really questioning oocytes as a suitable system for OR de-orphanization in general, but said that the system may not be efficient for testing HassOR14b. In my opinion, however, a current of 60 nA is not too small to be noticed. Hence this is not the reason why Chang et al. did not find a response, but there seems to be a real difference in activity between the two studies.</p><p>It remains mysterious to me why the wild type HassOR14b responds so differently in this and previous studies and it's problematic that the authors did not mention this inconsistency in the first version. In addition, a number of other mistakes/errors were pointed out by me and the other reviewers. The authors have now corrected these errors but can we be sure that additional errors did not go unnoticed by the reviewers? Careful double checking appears necessary.</p><p>Some other points for your consideration.</p><p>1) 'Unlike general odorant receptors (ORs) that typically bind more than one ligand (de Fouchier et al., 2017), PRs are narrowly tuned to specific pheromone components (Grosse-Wilde et al., 2007).' This statement is not correct. There are both narrowly tuned PRs and broadly tuned PRs reported in the literature (Miura et al., 2010; Wanner et al. 2010; Zhang and Löfstedt 2015). Even in Grosse-Wilde et al., 2007 cited by the authors, it was proposed that 'there are two different designs of pheromone receptors'. The authors have to be more precise in their statements and more rigorous when citing the literature:</p><p>Miura, N., Nakagawa, T., Touhara, K., and Ishikawa, Y. (2010).

As we suggested before, there's no point of listing these examples so this sentence can be removed.</p><p>3) Results and Discussion sections: ‘all the PRs and Orcos are subjected to purifying selection which is consistent with the previous studies (Zhang and Löfstedt, 2013; Zhang et al., 2014b)'. This is not a correct reference. Zhang and Löfstedt (2013) as well as other researchers (e.g. Leary et al., 2012) found that some PR clusters are under purifying selection while some are under relatively relaxed selective pressure. Since the authors used a limited number of moth species in the phylogenetic tree in the current study, it's too daring to draw the conclusion that 'all the PRs and Orcos are subjected to purifying selection'.</p><p>Leary, G.

In another paper this compound is found to be an antagonist in both Hass and Harm. This should be made clear to the reader because unlike some other systems where there is a clear change from using one compound to using another in two closely related species, in this case the selective pressure to evolve the receptor in Harm for Z9-14Ald is not very clear.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, for <italic>H. armigera</italic>, Z9-14:Ald acts as an agonist in small amounts (0.3%) (Rothschild, 1978; Wu et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2012) but an antagonist in higher amounts (1% and above) (Gothilf et al., 1978; Kehat and Dunkelblum, 1990; Wu et al., 2015); for <italic>H. assulta,</italic> Z9-14:Ald acts as an antagonist (Boo et al., 1995; Wu et al., 2015). We accept your suggestion and add this information in the revised manuscript (Introduction, fifth paragraph).</p><p>The selective pressure to evolve the receptor in <italic>H. armigera</italic> for Z9-14:Ald is intriguing. The SSR data prove that male antennae of <italic>H. armigera</italic> have olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) responding to Z9-14:Ald (Wu et al. 2015; Xu et al., 2016). Two reasons may explain its evolution:</p><p>1) Z9-14:Ald acts as an agonist at the low dosage and an antagonist in the pheromone communication system of <italic>H. armigera</italic>, so it is necessary to have such a pheromone receptor. Up to now, HarmOr14b is the only receptor specifically responding to Z9-14:Ald in <italic>H. armigera.</italic></p><p>2) The pheromone ratio of Z9-16:Ald to Z11-16:Ald in <italic>H. assulta</italic> is 93:7, and that in <italic>H. armigera</italic> is 3:97.

Assuming that <italic>H. assulta</italic> is more primitive species than <italic>H. armigera</italic> (Cho et al., 2008; Fang et al., 1997; Wang et al., 2005), shifting a given receptor’s selectivity could be the simplest and most efficient way to change the population ratio of pheromone OSNs in the evolution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Earlier research papers that have searched for activity of HR14b in Hass have failed to find any activity. This includes a recent paper by some of the authors of the current paper. It would be useful for the authors to explain why they did not find activity in their other recent paper, but that they now find it.</p></disp-quote><p>It has long been a mystery about the receptor to Z9-16:Ald, the major sex pheromone component of <italic>H. assulta</italic>. In 2014, our group first cloned the full-length sequences of HassOr14b and HarmOr14b by the use of LA-<italic>Taq</italic> polymerase (Takara shuzo, Shiga, Japan), but failed to identify its function when using <italic>Xenopus</italic> system (Jiang et al., 2014). Along with identifying the function of more and more Ors by using <italic>Xenopus</italic> system, we found that the accuracy and integrity of the OR sequence is very important in functional analysis. Therefore, in this study we re-cloned the sequence of <italic>HassOr14b</italic> by use of Q5® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs, USA) and repeated again to verify the sequence by Sanger sequencing for 10 samples, and also compared with the sequence in the antennal transcriptome data of <italic>H. assulta</italic>. Finally, we got the correct sequence, in which there are 3 amino acids different comparing with the old sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Moreover, we further analyzed the transcriptome data in <italic>H. assulta</italic> and confirmed that in the 3 different amino acids positions, there is no sequence polymorphism. We use the accurate sequence this time and finally get the function of HassOr14b, which is specifically tuned to Z9-16:Ald, the major sex pheromone component in <italic>H. assulta</italic>.</p><p>In the study of Chang et al. (2016), they also try to identify the function of HassOr14b but failed when using <italic>Xenopus</italic> system (Chang et al., 2016). There are two differences between the two studies. One is that they also used the LA-<italic>Taq</italic> polymerase we used before when they cloned the sequence, and there is 1 amino acid different in the 5’ ends with ours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). By analyzing the transcriptome data in <italic>H. assulta,</italic> we confirmed that this amino acid position has no sequence polymorphism. Another difference is the vector used in the expression system. They used the pT7Ts vector, while we use the pCS2+ vector in the expression system.</p><p>In short, we find that the accuracy and integrity of the sequence is crucial to identify the function of the receptors. We use the right sequence so we get the activity of HassOr14b. Moreover, using the appropriate expression vector could be also important. We add this information in the second paragraph of the subsection “Novel identified PR and the different combinations with other PRs”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Looking at the plots in the figures that show &quot;current (nA)&quot; on the Y-axis, it becomes clear that at least with the Xenopus system, the level of activity of the Hass HR14b receptor is much lower than for the Harm HR14b receptor. Whereas the response to Z9-14Ald in Harm is over 400 and for Z9-16Ald is around 50, the response of the Hass HR14b receptor to even Z9-16Ald (to which it is specific) is only about 60. Clearly, this oocyte system is not very efficient for Hass HR14b. This may be why previous studies didn't find any activity. The authors should acknowledge this.</p></disp-quote><p>The <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocyte expression system with two electrode voltage clamping is an efficient system for identifying insect odorant (pheromone) receptors (Di et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2007; Mitsuno et al., 2008; Nakagawa and Touhara, 2013; Sakurai et al., 2004; Tanaka et al., 2009; Wanner et al., 2007; Xia et al., 2008). One major advantage of oocytes is that these cells only express a few ion channels and receptors, which are quite different from those of insects, so that the insect receptors can be studied without contamination from endogenous channels and receptors (Goldin, 2006). The oocyte system is particularly well suited for the study of many different mutations because injection and two-electrode voltage-clamping can be carried out rapidly and in a semi-automated fashion (Goldin, 2006; Hill et al., 2015; Hughes et al., 2014; Leal, 2013; Leary et al., 2012; Nakagawa et al., 2012).</p><p>We think this system is also suitable for HassOr14b based on the following reasons:</p><p>1) The responding current of the oocytes expressing HassOr14b to 10<sup>-4</sup> M of Z9-16:Ald is about 70 nA, which is comparable to the current (80 nA) of the oocyte expressing HarmOr13 tuning to the major component, Z11-16:Ald in <italic>H. armigera</italic> (Liu et al., 2013; our unpublished data). We have done many technical and biological replications, and the results are repeatable.</p><p>2) The oocytes expressing HassOr14b to Z9-16:Ald are retested within a dose–response paradigm, revealing a clear concentration dependency.</p><p>3) Other evidences also support the HassOr14b is the receptor of Z9-16:Ald in <italic>H. assulta</italic>: The expression level of HassOr14b is highest among all the PRs in male antennae of <italic>H. assulta</italic>, and the OSNs responding to Z9-16:Ald is the most abundant in male antennae of <italic>H. assulta</italic>; the localization patterns of HassOr14b with other PRs in male antennae of <italic>H. assulta</italic> are consistent with the single sensilla recording results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) This lack of sensitivity of the HR14b of Hass is problematic for interpreting the results of single mutations to the Hass HR14b receptor. Clearly, the T3551 mutation dramatically increases the overall response of HR14b while negating specificity. This makes it hard to interpret the interaction of the two mutations.</p></disp-quote><p>The sensitivity of HassOr14b is well retested by the dose response paradigm of HassOr14b stimulated with a range of Z9-16:Ald concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), with the EC50 value for Z9-16:Ald was 8.65 × 10<sup>–5</sup> M. T355I mutation increases the response of HassOr14b to the related compounds but not overall. We think this does not negate the specificity (not responding to all the tested ligands) but extend the tuning spectrum from Z9-16:Ald to both Z9-16:Ald and Z9-14:Ald.</p><p>In the mutagenesis study, the change of the tuning selectivity is what we focus on. We find that only T355I and F232I change the selectivity. When we made the combination of the two site mutations, the PR with two mutations shifted the ligand selectivity. The experimental work is systematic and the results are convincing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) There is overlap between the paper Olfactory perception and behavioral effects of sex pheromone gland components in Helicoverpa armigera and Helicoverpa assulta Meng Xu et al. 2016 and the current paper.

However, in the discussion the authors do not come back to this result and instead write &quot;The female moth produces a pheromone blend of several components, stabilized by strong selection pressure against any change in such blends (Roelofs et al., 2002).

Also, the latter part &quot;should allow for a degree of plasticity&quot; comes across as hand waving. Similarly, &quot;In the course of speciation, the functional change of ORs is a gradual process with multiple amino acid mutations, a few making drastic changes and many making small modifications or even no change in function&quot; need to be revised, as 'gradual changes' contradicts 'a few making drastic changes' and as a whole this sentence doesn't make sense.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for all the suggestions.

(In this respect it is indeed very impressive that the authors found an almost 10x stronger response when mutating T335I (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Which relates to my next question:</p></disp-quote><p>The <italic>Xenopus</italic> system is a heterologous expression system. Its main disadvantage is that the oocytes are not the native cells in which the PRs are normally expressed. Although the functional properties that are observed may not be identical to those characterized in native olfactory sensory neurons, the most effective ligand obtained by using the <italic>Xenopus</italic> system is convincing. However, the response range is often wider than the natural situation (Wang et al., 2016). It is hard to judge whether the compounds inducing lower currents could actually activate the related neurons in the sensilla. For example, the neurons expressing HarmOr13 and HassOr13 in Type A sensilla are only tuning to Z11-16:Ald specifically (Wu et al., 2013; Chang et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2016). When HarmOr13 and HassOr13 are expressed in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic>, the most effective ligand is still Z11-16:Ald, but they also show a relatively lower response to Z9-14:Ald (Jiang et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2013). So we would better pay more attention to the response selectivity rather than the absolute current value among different ORs.

Up to now, 4 of them are functional characterized: HarmOr6, HarmOr13, HarmOr14b, HarmOr16. The most effective ligands are Z9-16:OH for HarmOr6 (Jiang et al., 2014), Z11-16:Ald for HarmOr13 (Liu et al., 2013), Z9-14:Ald for HarmOr14b (Jiang et al., 2014, and this study), Z11-16:OH (Chang et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2013) and Z9-14:Ald (Liu et al., 2013) for HarmOr16. The function of other 3 PRs (HarmOr11, HarmOr14, HarmOr15) are not yet identified. HarmOr11 is co-localized with HarmOr13 in Type A sensilla (Chang et al., 2016), it has no possibility tuning to Z9-16:Ald; HarmOr15 has a much lower expression in male <italic>H. armigera</italic> (this study, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), so could not be the candidate receptor. Therefore, it could be HarmOr14 as the potential receptor tuning to Z9-16:Ald, although all the studies up to now failed to identify its function (Jiang et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2013). In the recent ESITO meeting, a new PR clade was reported in <italic>Spodoptera</italic>, it would be also interesting to explore the new PRs in <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> in the further study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> the authors show that HassOR6 is highly expressed in males, and a little in females. Which makes sense to me, as females probably smell their own pheromone as well. I don't think that sex-specific expression is a necessary criterium for an OR to be a sex pheromone OR.</p></disp-quote><p>We totally agree with this. A recent study on <italic>Heliothis virescens</italic> (Zielonka et al., 2016) find that HR6 is expressed in both female and male antennae, which indicates that the females can detect pheromone components released by themselves or by conspecifics. We also agree that the sex-specific expression is not a necessary criterium for an OR to be a PR, functional analysis is the only criterium to judge whether it is a PR. However, the male biased expression pattern could narrow the scope of the candidate PRs in moths, which is the efficient way to identify most of the PRs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors have responded to previous comments on why previous functional assays with HassOr14b didn't work by writing that the sequence had not been correct in previous work and that this is now corrected. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> they specify which 3 amino acids have been corrected (Yang et al. is the current sequence used). In checking these 3 amino acids in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6, I</xref> found them in RIII, in RVII and in RVIII. I find it hard to determine whether one of these 3 SNPs were among the ones tested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>. Still, I think the authors make a convincing case that the right sequence together with the selection of the appropriate expression vector is crucial to identify the function of receptors.</p></disp-quote><p>In the site mutation analysis, we just focused on the different amino acids between orthologs of <italic>H. assulta</italic> to <italic>H. armigera.</italic> Among the three revised amino acids of HassOr14b, two of them located in RIII and RVIII respectively are the same with those of HarmOr14b. The third amino acid located in RVII of HassOr14b is different from that of HarmOr14b, when we replaced the whole region VII of HassOr14b with that of HarmOr14b, we did not find the selectivity change. Therefore, we did not test these three amino acids specifically. We think “<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>” you mentioned should be “<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>”. Thank you for your comments to our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Hopefully <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref> is not a supplementary figure, as I think this figure is a great way of showing the results of the single mutations.</p></disp-quote><p>We think that “<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>” you mentioned is “<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>”, which is the result of the two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings of site mutations with pheromone components and analogs. This result is not a supplementary figure. Thank you for your comments to our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) As for the in situ hybridization pictures, these are clear to me, but I leave this to the more experienced reviewer(s) to decide whether this is sufficiently clear.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments to our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] In the rebuttal letter the authors write: 'Basically there are two major concerns: (Baker et al., 2004) the suitability of the Xenopus system.… (Boo et al., 1995) Contradiction of our in situ hybridization results'</p><p>In my opinion this is not correct. At least not when it comes to my concerns. My major concern was that the authors avoided mentioning the inconsistency in the response of wild type HassOR14b compared to previous publications. In the current version, the authors explain that the gene sequences were not correct in previous publications. However, the explanation is not straight forward:</p></disp-quote><p>The full-length sequences of HassOr14b and HarmOr14b were first cloned by Jiang et al. in 2014, and Jiang et al. identified HarmOr14b was tuned to Z9-14:Ald, but failed to identify the function of HassOr14b (Jiang et al., 2014). In 2016, Chang et al. proved the function of HarmOr14b, and tried to identify the function of HassOr14b again but also failed. Because Jiang et al. (2014) is the first study of HassOr14b and there is no new progress of this gene in functional analysis in the following study, we just cited Jiang et al.’s work in the very first manuscript version. From the last revision, we accepted the reviewer’s suggestion and cited both of them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The sequences in Chang et al., 2016 were based on the transcriptome data from the previous paper (Zhang et al., 2015) from the same group. There's a single amino acid difference of HassOR14b sequence between the current manuscript and the sequence in Chang's paper. Could it simply be explained by the use of different polymerases? How could the authors exclude the possibility of polymorphism? Although possible, it's not very likely that this one amino acid difference would totally abolish the response to Z9-16:Ald (No response to Z9-16:Ald or any other ligand in Chang et al. 2016) but significant response to Z9-16:Ald in the current study (70 nA – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The authors of the present manuscript can of course not take the responsibility of any possible flaws in a study published by another group but the discrepancy requires an explicit comment in the Discussion.</p><p>Zhang, J., Wang, B., Dong, S., Cao, D., Dong, J., Walker, W.

Among the DNA polymerases supplied by many companies, the fidelity of them is quite different. By our experiences, in the purpose of cloning the sequences for functional analysis, the high fidelity enzyme should be the first choice. The DNA polymerase used in Chang et al.’s study is LA-<italic>Taq</italic> (Chang et al., 2016), which is not a high fidelity enzyme.</p><p>Concerning the possibility of polymorphism, we excluded it using the following strategy: The transcriptome data represents many separate individuals, and the results of sequencing include abundant separate “reads”. For each gene, there are many “reads” mapping to it, but each “reads” is not exactly the same in all the positions, which may come from the polymorphism in such position. If all of the “reads” in one position is the same, we can exclude the possibility of polymorphism in that position. We analyzed all the related transcriptome data of <italic>H. assulta</italic> carefully, and if we found that all of the “reads” in one position is the same, we exclude the possibility of polymorphism in that position.</p><p>Concerning the amino acid difference from that in Chang et al. (2016), this amino acid is located in RI of HassOr14b, which is the same with that of HarmOr14b, so we do not test this amino acid specifically because in the site mutation experiments we just focused on the different amino acids between orthologs of <italic>H. assulta</italic> to <italic>H. armigera.</italic> Although we do not test whether the change of this amino acid would totally abolish the response of HassOr14b, we have experience that one amino acid change in HarmOr13 could totally abolish its function (our unpublished data). Therefore, we suggest that the accuracy and integrity of the sequence is crucial to identify the function of ORs. We have explained this in the second paragraph of the Discussion subsection “Novel identified PR and the different combinations with other PRs”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I do not understand how different expression vectors could cause the difference in sequence. The authors have to explain how. Otherwise it is just an ad hoc explanation that needs to be tested. It's the cRNAs that are injected and expressed in the oocytes. The resulting receptor proteins should have the same sequences despite of what the original expression vectors were. In addition, the pT7TS vectors have been widely and successfully used in oocyte recordings and OR studies. Why should this vector not be suitable for HassOR14b expression and oocyte recordings?</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that the vector would not cause the difference in sequence, but the vector itself used in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> system could affect the identification of the ORs. pT7TS vectors have been successfully used in oocyte recordings in many OR studies, but Chang et al. used it and failed to identify HassOr14b’s function. We use the pCS2+ vector and successfully identify HassOr14b. Comparing with the Chang et al.’s study, we notice that there are two major differences: one is on the sequence of HassOr14b, another is on the expression vector, so we speculate that these two differences could be the possible reasons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors write in the rebuttal and mention in the Discussion that they re-sequenced HassOr14b and came up with the &quot;right sequence&quot;.

Hence this is not the reason why Chang et al. did not find a response, but there seems to be a real difference in activity between the two studies.</p><p>It remains mysterious to me why the wild type HassOR14b responds so differently in this and previous studies and it's problematic that the authors did not mention this inconsistency in the first version. In addition, a number of other mistakes/errors were pointed out by me and the other reviewers. The authors have now corrected these errors but can we be sure that additional errors did not go unnoticed by the reviewers? Careful doublechecking appears necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for explaining the results in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte system. Concerning the difference in activity, the fact is not that the previous studies found one function and we find another function of HassOr14b, but is that the previous studies all failed to identify its function and we find it in this study. We suggest that it would be the use of the right sequence and the selection of the expression vector that result in our success in this study. As both Jiang et al. and Chang et al. failed to identify the function of HassOr14b, and Jiang et al. is the first study identifying HassOr14b (Jiang et al., 2014, Chang et al., 2016), we just cited Jiang et al.’s work in the very first manuscript version. In the revised manuscript, we accept your suggestion and cite both of them. Thanks for your suggestion and we had double-checked the manuscript carefully.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some other points for your consideration.</p><p>1) 'Unlike general odorant receptors (ORs) that typically bind more than one ligand (de Fouchier et al., 2017), PRs are narrowly tuned to specific pheromone components (Grosse-Wilde et al., 2007).' This statement is not correct. There are both narrowly tuned PRs and broadly tuned PRs reported in the literature (Miura et al., 2010; Wanner et al. 2010; Zhang and Löfstedt 2015). Even in Grosse-Wilde et al., 2007 cited by the authors, it was proposed that 'there are two different designs of pheromone receptors'. The authors have to be more precise in their statements and more rigorous when citing the literature:</p><p>Miura, N., Nakagawa, T., Touhara, K., and Ishikawa, Y. (2010).

This is not a correct reference. Zhang and Löfstedt (2013) as well as other researchers (e.g. Leary et al., 2012) found that some PR clusters are under purifying selection while some are under relatively relaxed selective pressure. Since the authors used a limited number of moth species in the phylogenetic tree in the current study, it's too daring to draw the conclusion that 'all the PRs and Orcos are subjected to purifying selection'.

A similar situation was observed for HassOr14b and HassOr16. They were co-localized in some sensilla, but only HassOr14b was detected in other sensilla. HassOr6 and HassOr16 were always expressed in different sensilla. These results indicate that HassOr6 or HassOr16 were co-localized with HassOr14b in the neighboring neurons in the Type C sensilla, which is consistent with the previous SSR data that there are subtypes in the type C sensilla. We revised the statement in the Discussion as “HassOr14b is co-localized with HassOR6 or HassOR16 in the neighboring neurons in the same sensilla,”, and added the statement as “Our results indicate that there are different combinations of the PRs in the C type sensilla, which is consistent with the previous single sensillum recording results that there are subtypes in the type C sensilla (Xu et al., 2016).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors refer to the transcriptome a couple of times in the manuscript.
