peptidoglycan is primarily crosslinked by penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). However, in mycobacteria, crosslinks formed by L,D-transpeptidases (LDTs) are highly abundant. To elucidate the role of these unusual crosslinks, we characterized <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> cells lacking all LDTs. We find that crosslinks generate by LDTs are required for rod shape maintenance specifically at sites of aging cell wall, a byproduct of polar elongation. Asymmetric polar growth leads to a non-uniform distribution of these two types of crosslinks in a single cell. Consequently, in the absence of LDT-mediated crosslinks, PBP-catalyzed crosslinks become more important. Because of this, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) is more rapidly killed using a combination of drugs capable of PBP- and LDT- inhibition. Thus, knowledge about the spatial and genetic relationship between drug targets can be exploited to more effectively treat this pathogen.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37516.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most bacteria have a cell wall that protects them and maintains their shape. Many of these organisms make their cell walls from fibers of proteins and sugars, called peptidoglycan. As bacteria grow, peptidoglycan is constantly broken down and reassembled, and in many species, new units of peptidoglycan are added into the sidewall. However, in a group of bacteria called mycobacteria, which cause tuberculosis and other diseases, the units are added at the tips.</p><p>The peptidoglycan layer is often a successful target for antibiotic treatments. But, drugs that treat tuberculosis do not attack this layer, partly because we know very little about the cell walls of mycobacteria.</p><p>Here, Baranowski et al. used genetic manipulation and microscopy to study how mycobacteria build their cell wall. The results showed that these bacteria link peptidoglycan units together in an unusual way. In most bacteria, peptidoglycan units are connected by chemical links known as 4-3 crosslinks. This is initially the same in mycobacteria, but as the cell grows and the cell wall expands, these bonds break and so-called 3-3 crosslinks form. In genetically modified bacteria that could not form these 3-3 bonds, the cell wall became brittle and weak, and the bacteria eventually died.</p><p>These findings could be important for developing new drugs that treat infections caused by mycobacteria. Baranowski et al. demonstrate that a combination of drugs blocking both 4-3 and 3-3 crosslinks is particularly effective at killing the bacterium that causes tuberculosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group

bacterial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vollmer et al., 2008a</xref>), and the target of many antibiotics. PG consists of linear glycan strands crosslinked by short peptides to form a continuous molecular cage surrounding the plasma membrane. This structure maintains cell shape and protects the plasma membrane from rupture. Our understanding of PG is largely derived from studies on laterallyÂ growing model rod-shaped bacteria like <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). In these organisms, new PG is constructed along the lateral side wall by the concerted effort of glycosyltransferases, which connect the glycan of a new PG subunit to the existing mesh, and transpeptidases, which link peptide side chains. An actin-like protein, MreB, positions this multi-protein complex along the short axis of the cell so that glycan strands are inserted circumferentially, creating discontinuous hoops of PG around the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DomÃ­nguez-Escobar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garner et al., 2011</xref>). This orientation of PG creates a mechanical anisotropy that is responsible for rod shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hussain et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>However, not all rod-shaped bacteria encode MreB. In fact, there are important differences between model bacteria and Actinobacteria like mycobacteria, a genus of rod-shaped bacteria that includes the major human pathogen <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb). In mycobacteria, new PG is inserted at the cell poles (at unequal amounts based on pole age), rather than along the lateral walls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Additionally, mycobacteria are missing several factors, including MreB, that are important for cell elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kieser and Rubin, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> the vast majority (&gt;90%) of the peptide linkages are created by D,D-transpeptidases known as penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pisabarro et al., 1985</xref>). PBPs, the targets of most Î²-lactams, link the fourth amino acid of one peptide side chain to the third amino acid of another, forming 4â3 crosslinks. Peptidoglycan crosslinks can also be catalyzed by L,D-transpeptidases (LDTs), which link peptide side chains by the third amino acid forming 3â3 linkages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).

If the first hypothesis were true, high osmolarity should protect cells against forming blebs.

We measured the rigidity of cells in relation to their height. Generally, WT cells are stiffer than ÎLDT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Blebs in ÎLDT cells can be identified by a sharp increase in height (<italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, pink shaded</italic>). Since circumferential stress of the rod measured by AFM is proportional to the radius of the cell, and inversely proportional to the thickness of the cell wall (an immeasurable quantity by AFM), we used cell height, a proxy for radius, to normalize the stiffness measurement. We found that stiffness drops in the area of blebs (<italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, pink shaded</italic>).</p><p>Why does loss of rod shape occur locally and only in a subpopulation of cells? Mycobacterial polar growth and division results in daughter cells with phenotypic differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aldridge et al., 2012</xref>). For example, the oldest cell wall is specifically inherited by the new pole daughter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aldridge et al., 2012</xref>). We hypothesized that the loss of rod shape might occur in specific progeny generated by cell division. Indeed, the daughter which inherited the new pole from the previous round of division, and the oldest cell wall, consistently lost rod shape over time, while the old pole daughter maintained rod shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). In addition, blebs localized to the oldest cell wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), as visualized by pulse-chase labeling of the cell wall. Thus, 3â3 crosslinking is likely occurring in the oldest cell wall, which is non-uniformly distributed along a single cell and in the population via asymmetric polar growth and division. Taken together, these data suggest that LDTs act locally to reinforce aging PG and to maintain rod shape in a subpopulation of Msm cells - specifically, new pole daughters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title><italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> is hypersensitive to PBP inactivation in the absence of LDTs</title><p>Our observations lead to the following model: 4â3 crosslinks made by PBPs are formed at the poles where new PG is inserted and where pentapeptide substrates reside. These newly synthesized 4â3 crosslinks can then be gradually cleaved (by D,D-endopeptidases) as PG ages and moves toward the middle of the cell, leaving tetrapeptide substrates for LDTs to create 3â3 crosslinks. This is consistent with the FDAA incorporation pattern, which reflects the abundance of tetrapeptide substrates available for LDT exchange. Specifically, there are more available tetrapeptides near the poles and fewer near mid-cell, the site of older PG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In the absence of LDTs to catalyze 3â3 crosslinks, old cell wall loses integrity and turgor pressure causes bleb formation.</p><p>This model predicts that ÎLDT cells should be even more dependent on 4â3 crosslinking than wild-type cells.

Polar growth segregates newer PG to the poles, and, as growth occurs, older PG migrates towards the middle of the cell.

There are many possibilities. For example, perhaps in the absence of lateral cell wall synthesis, the creation of substrate for LDTs through the destruction of 4â3 crosslinks allows the cell to engage the PG along the lateral cell body. This could be important for altering the thickness of the PG layer or anchoring it to the membrane at sites of otherwise âinertâ cell wall. Additionally, it may be that as PG ages, it is being manicured or marked for septal synthesis. Supporting this idea, we find that the gradient localization patterns of fluorescently tagged PonA1, LdtE and DacB2, (as well as FDAAs) all have local minima at mid-cell closer to the new pole- a location that correlates with the asymmetric site of division in mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aldridge et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Santi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eskandarian et al., 2017</xref>). The lack of localization of PG synthesis enzymes and FDAAs suggests a lack of penta- and tetra- peptide substrates. This implies that this region of the cell may be more abundantly crosslinked, as crosslinking utilizes these peptide species. Could 3â3 crosslinking be a signal for septal placement? Mycobacteria are missing known molecular septal placement mechanisms like the Noc and the Min system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hett and Rubin, 2008</xref>). The major septal PG hydrolase is RipA, a D,L-endopeptidase which cleaves the bond between the second and third amino acid of PG side chains, a substrate available on 3â3 crosslinked material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">BÃ¶th et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vollmer et al., 2008b</xref>). While LdtE-mRFP does not itself strongly localize to the site of division, the crosslinks it synthesizes could migrate toward the mid-cell through polar elongation. Transmitting information from the tip to mid-cell through polar growth was recently described in mycobacteria: atomic force microscopy revealed cell-envelope deformations formed at the pole of Msm travel to mid-cell through polar growth, marking the future site of division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eskandarian et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, it is intriguing to speculate that 3â3 crosslinks found at aging cell wall could be important for localizing cell division machinery.</p><p>In well-studied rod-shaped bacteria like <italic>E.coli</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, shape is maintained by MreB-directed PG synthesis along the lateral cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hussain et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ursell et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, mycobacteria maintain shape in the absence of an obvious MreB homolog, and in the absence of lateral cell wall elongation. Furthermore, in contrast to lateral-elongating bacteria, in which new and old cell wall are constantly intermingled during growth, polar growth segregates new and old cell wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We find that mycobacteria appear to utilize 3â3 crosslinks at asymmetrically distributed aging cell wall to provide stability along the lateral body, something that may not be required in the presence of MreB-directed PG synthesis.</p><p>New drug combinations for TB are desperately needed. There has been a renewed interest in repurposing FDA-approved drugs for TB treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Diacon et al., 2016</xref>). Some of that interest has focused on Î²-lactams, the oldest class of antibiotics which are the therapeutic bedrock for most other infections. We find that the protein targets of two different classes of Î²-lactams â enzymes which do very similar chemistry â PG crosslinking â are distributed differentially in a single cell and across the population. In the absence of 3â3 crosslinks, 4â3 crosslinks become more important for cell viability. These data predict that a drug combination which inhibits both PBPs and LDTs will work synergistically to more quickly kill Mtb, a prediction we verified <italic>in vitro</italic>. Interestingly, meropenem combined with amoxicillin/clavulanate resulted in early clearance of Mtb from patient sputum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Diacon et al., 2016</xref>). In fact, the combination might be key to accelerated killing of Mtb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gonzalo and Drobniewski, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain (<italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis)</italic></td><td valign="bottom">KB85; (WT Msm)</td><td valign="bottom">this work</td><td><italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> mc<sup>2</sup>155</td><td valign="bottom">Wildtype <italic>M. smegmatis</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain (<italic>M. smegmatis)</italic></td><td>KB134</td><td valign="bottom">this work</td><td>mc2155â<italic>ldtA</italic>::loxP</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain (<italic>M. smegmatis)</italic></td><td>KB156</td><td valign="bottom">this work</td><td>mc2155â<italic>ldtA</italic>::loxP + â<italic>ldtE</italic>:: zeoR</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain (<italic>M. smegmatis)</italic></td><td>KB200 (â<italic>ldtAEB</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">this work</td><td>mc2155â<italic>ldtA</italic>::loxP â<italic>ldtE</italic>:: zeoR + â<italic>ldtB</italic>:: hygR</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain (<italic>M. smegmatis)</italic></td><td>KB209</td><td valign="bottom">this work</td><td>mc2155â<italic>ldtA</italic>::loxP â<italic>ldtE</italic>::loxP â<italic>ldtB</italic>::loxP + â<italic>ldtC</italic>:: hygR</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain (<italic>M. smegmatis)</italic></td><td>KB222</td><td valign="bottom">this work</td><td>mc2155â<italic>ldtA</italic>::loxP â<italic>ldtE</italic>::loxP â<italic>ldtB</italic>::loxP â<italic>ldtC</italic>:: hygR â<italic>ldtG</italic>:: zeoR</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain (<italic>M. smegmatis)</italic></td><td>KB303 (âLDT)</td><td valign="bottom">this work</td><td>mc2155â<italic>ldtA</italic>::loxP â<italic>ldtE</italic>::loxP â<italic>ldtB</italic>::loxP â<italic>ldtC</italic>:: loxP â<italic>ldtG</italic>:: loxP â<italic>ldtF</italic>:: hygR</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> XL1-Blue)</td><td>KB302</td><td valign="bottom">this work</td><td>pTetO-ldtE(MSMEG_0233)-Gly-Gly-Ser linker-mRFP</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain (<italic>M. smegmatis)</italic></td><td>KB316 (âLDTcomp)</td><td valign="bottom">this work</td><td>[mc2155âldtA::loxP âldtE::loxP âldtB::loxP âldtC:: loxP âldtG:: loxP âldtF:: hygR]+KB302</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain (<italic>M. smegmatis)</italic></td><td>KK311</td><td valign="bottom">this work; plasmid from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kieser et al.

Briefly, optical fluorescence images were acquired with an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) iXon Ultra 897 camera (Andor) mounted on an IX81 inverted optical microscope (Olympus) equipped with an UPLFLN100XO2PH x100 oil immersion objective (Olympus). Transmitted light illumination was provided by a 12V/100W AHS-LAMP halogen lamp. An U-MGFPHQ fluorescence filter cube for GFP with HQ-Ion-coated filters was used to detect GFP fluorescence. The AFM was mounted on top of the inverted microscope, and images were acquired with a Dimension Icon scan head (Bruker) using ScanAsyst fluid cantilevers (Bruker) with a nominal spring constant of 0.7 N m<sup>â1</sup> in Peak Force QNM mode at a force setpointÂ ~1 nN and typical scan rates of 0.5 Hz. Indentation on the cell surface was estimated to beÂ ~10 nm in the Z-axis.

A background correction was conducted to by dividing the DMT modulus values of the cell surface by the mean value of the PDMS surface and rescaled to compare the cell surface rigidity between individual cells from different experiments. The DMT modulus reflects the elastic modulus (stress-strain relationship) for each cross-sectional increment along the cell length.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Analysis of fluorescent protein distribution</title><p>Using a segmented line, profiles of cells from new to old pole were created at the frame âpre-divisionâ based on physical cell separation of the phase image.

Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michel Arthur (Reviewer #2); Clif Barry (Reviewer #3); Gyanu Lamichhane (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Dr. Rego and colleagues explores peptidoglycan (PG) metabolism in mycobacteria. The biosynthetic pathway for the PG polymer in these organisms represents several departures from well-known paradigms, most notably; mycobacteria extend their cell surfaces by incorporating new material at the cell tips. Also, the composition of cross-linked mycobacterial PG comprises a large proportion of 3-3 crosslinks, which are relatively rare in model organisms wherein PG has been intensely studied. This form of cross linking is mediated by the activity of L,D-transpeptidases (LDTs) and the authors focus their efforts on describing the function of these enzymes in <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic>. Using fluorescent D-amino acids (FDAAs) to visualise PG synthesis, they report strong staining of an FDAA at the cell poles, with a gradient of staining that extends to mid-cell, from the old pole. To determine which enzymes drive this pattern of staining the authors carry out saturating transposon mutagenesis, together with fluorescence associated cell sorting, to identify cells where staining was reduced. This analysis identified three LDTs (LDTA, B, and E) and combinatorial deletion of these resulted in reduced FDAA uptake. The authors proceed to delete all six LDTs (ÎLDT) and note similar effects, indicating that FDAA incorporation in mycobacteria is LDT-dependent. Next, the authors characterise the morphological defects that occur upon combinatorial deletion of all LDTs and report that a proportion of cells lose rod shape, which could be rescued by high osmolarity, suggesting that loss of cell wall rigidity mediated shape defects, a notion supported by measurement of cell rigidity using atomic force microscopy. Time-lapse microscopy revealed that the daughter cell that lost rod shape inherited the new pole and oldest cell wall, with spherical blebs localized in the cell retaining the old cell wall. This suggested that LDTs stabilize old cell wall material. After this, the authors demonstrate that in the absence of LDTs, mycobacteria depend on PbpA and PonA2-mediated 4-3 crosslink formation to maintain cell wall integrity. The authors then demonstrate that PG synthesizing and remodelling enzymes locate to distinct sites of the cell. Combinatorial inhibition of both 4-3 and 3-3 crosslink formation by antibiotics illustrated the potential tractability of targeting PG for tuberculosis drug treatment.</p><p>Central conclusions:</p><p>1) LDT-mediated 3-3 crosslinks are required for maintenance of rod shape in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>.</p><p>2) The different types of cross-links, 4-3 versus 3-3, are most likely spatially distributed to distinct locations in the mycobacterial cell, with mature PG locating to the sidewall in a 3-3 crosslinked conformation.</p><p>3) In the absence of the ability to generate 3-3 crosslinks, mycobacteria become critically reliant of 4-3 crosslinks generated by HMW PBPs.</p><p>The study is carefully conducted and opens new avenues to decipher the mechanism underlying septum localization in mycobacteria and to identify strategies for synergistic killing of mycobacteria by drug combinations.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In Figure 1B, how do the authors determine the new from the old pole? This most likely related to birth size and intensity of staining at the cell pole, but some illustration of this would be useful in the figure and is required to understand the rest of the work.</p><p>2) Data demonstrating how the genotype of the Msm strains lacking all 6 (and 3) LDT-encoding genes was verified is necessary. It could be Southern blotting or sequencing. Sequencing is mentioned in the Materials and methods section, but it is not clear what was done to ensure that there were no unintended cross-over events elsewhere in the chromosome as well.</p><p>3) Why just complement with LDTE? Were the other three LDTs enriched/identified in the screen? Was the sextuple mutant necessary to completely eliminate FDAA staining? In this context, for rigour, genetic complementation of the LDT triple mutant is necessary, this seems relatively easy. The same construct used to complement the ÎLDT mutant can be used in this case.</p><p>4) The study unambiguously shows that DacB2 has endopeptidase activity (cleavage of 4-3 crosslinks) and that DacB2 co-localizes with LDTE. The authors conclude that the endopeptidase activity of DacB2 is responsible for the formation of blebs in the absence of LDTs. Direct evidence of the proposed model should be obtained by constructing a <italic>dacB2</italic> ÎLDT mutant. As <italic>dacB2</italic> was deemed to be nonessential in genome wide inactivation studies in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and direct gene deletion (Microb Pathog. 2012 52:109-16), this experiment should be feasible and is required to support the conclusions of the study. Genetic complementation of the resulting combinatorial mutant (<italic>dacB2</italic> ÎLDT mutant) is also required.</p><p>5) The MS analysis of peptidoglycan structure appearing in &quot;Figure 1âfigure supplement 3B&quot; raises numerous issues including the absence of any definition of the molecular ions that were detected and the inversion of the donor and acceptor stems between the sets of 4-3 and 3-3 crosslinked dimers. There are inconsistencies between the observed mass and the proposed structures, e.g. peaks 7 and 14 display the same mass but contain 2 and 4 NH2, respectively. Please, be consistent and list the number of NH2 rather than a mixed designation with OH for certain peaks. More importantly, peak 10 disappeared upon deletion of the LDT genes although it is reported to contain a 4-3 crosslink (formed by PPBs). These shortfalls must be addressed.</p><p>6) The experiments showing the cellular localization of the various proteins are not really as clear. Figure 4, subsection âPeptidoglycan synthesizing enzymes localize to differentially aged cell wallâ, first paragraph: While it is clear that LDTE-mRFP localized farther from the poles, it appears PonA1-RFP localizes throughout the cell wall as the staining is clearly visible throughout the cell.</p><p>Subsection âPeptidoglycan synthesizing enzymes localize to differentially aged cell wallâ, last paragraph: Figure 4A, bottom panel, shows prominent staining in the poles as well. Therefore, the conclusion that 'DacB2-mRFP localized closer to LDT-mRFP' is not entirely supported by the data.</p><p>Similarly, from the Discussion (end of third paragraph) to conclude that 3-3 cross-linkages are responsible for localizing the biosynthetic machinery seems inadequate from the location of only one of these proteins. These shortfalls can be addressed by attempting localization of another LDT homologue and providing clearer pictures of how PonA1-RFP localizes. Please ensure that any quantification of localization intensity is done for a sufficient number of cells to ensure robustness.</p><p>7) Figure 6A, subsection âMycobacteria are hypersensitive to PBP inactivation in the absence of LDTsâ, first paragraph: It is proposed that D,D-endopeptidase generates tetrapeptide substrates. Data/citation to support this claim is missing. The figure shows tetrapeptide as a substrate. Please address this.</p><p>8) Subsection âDrugs targeting both PBPs and LDTs synergize to kill Mtbâ: Clavulanic acid at 5 Î¼g/mL was used for this assay. Therefore, it is important to include this detail here. It is not possible to conclude that amoxicillin and meropenem exhibit synergism as the experiment included another agent (clavulanic acid). Or, the assay needs to be repeated in the absence of clavulanic acid to draw this conclusion. Also, previous work (Kumar P et al., 2017) describes the relationship between various B-lactams and transpeptidases of Mtb. The concluding sentence of this paper is that combinations of two different b-lactams would be most optimal to treat TB. This paper is directly relevant to parts of this manuscript and should be considered.</p><p>9) The synergy experiments in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> are a (wholly unnecessary) distraction from the importance of the study. It would be far more useful to see the synergy (and or lack of) with the various <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> mutants. None of the other studies were done in Mtb and there is not even an attempt to discuss the relevant enzymes or orthologs in Mtb. Please address this.</p><p>10) Currently, the figures are highly complex and the manuscript would benefit from an improved lead in their content. Figure 6 is limited to substrate and enzyme localization. The relation of the central part to panels A and B is unclear. Considering this, Figure 6 is not at the high quality level of the rest of the manuscript. Address this. A related minor point is that Figure 6 is introduced before Figure 3 to 5. As <italic>eLife</italic> caters to a broad readership base, improved flow of your text, clear figures demonstrating key conclusions and a carefully synthesized graphic of the central conclusions would substantively enhance the value of your submission.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Maturing <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> Peptidoglycan Requires Non-canonical Crosslinks to Maintain Shape&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

We have attempted to knock-out <italic>dacB2</italic> in the ÎLDT strain, but were unsuccessful. The biological meaning of this is unclear, as the ÎLDT strain already grows quite slowly, and even more so when expressing the RecET recombination machinery. To address this same point, we used a recently-developed mycobacterial CRISPRi system. In the ÎLDT background, we constructed a strain that expresses both a <italic>dacB2</italic>-specific guide RNA and dCas9 upon addition of anhydro-tetracycline (aTc). Addition of aTc led to smaller blebs compared to the blebs formed by the same strain not induced by aTc (Figure 4âfigure supplement 3). These data are consistent with our model, in which bleb formation in ÎLDT is due to unchecked endopeptidase activity. However, as knockdown of <italic>dacB2</italic> did not completely eliminate bleb formation in ÎLDT, we hypothesize that there are additional <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> D,D-endopeptidases. The text for this experiment can be found in the second paragraph of the subsection âPeptidoglycan synthesizing enzymes localize to differentially aged cell wallâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The MS analysis of peptidoglycan structure appearing in &quot;Figure 1ââfigure supplement 3B&quot; raises numerous issues including the absence of any definition of the molecular ions that were detected and the inversion of the donor and acceptor stems between the sets of 4-3 and 3-3 crosslinked dimers. There are inconsistencies between the observed mass and the proposed structures, e.g. peaks 7 and 14 display the same mass but contain 2 and 4 NH2, respectively. Please, be consistent and list the number of NH2 rather than a mixed designation with OH for certain peaks. More importantly, peak 10 disappeared upon deletion of the LDT genes although it is reported to contain a 4-3 crosslink (formed by PPBs). These shortfalls must be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-analyzed these data and created a new, more informative and more clearly labeled figure (Figure 1âfigure supplement 4). We have provided EICs (extracted ion chromatograms) for 3-3 crosslinked species that are readily detectable. We do not detect any significant 3-3 crosslinks in the ÎLDT strain. The disappearance of peak 10 is curious. However, since we have deleted 6 cell wall enzymes in this strain, we expected there to be other changes in peptidoglycan besides disappearance of 3-3 crosslinks. For instance, the LDTs may play important roles as partners in complexes responsible for creating specific 4-3 crosslinks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The experiments showing the cellular localization of the various proteins are not really as clear. Figure 4, subsection âPeptidoglycan synthesizing enzymes localize to differentially aged cell wallâ, first paragraph: While it is clear that LDTE-mRFP localized farther from the poles, it appears PonA1-RFP localizes throughout the cell wall as the staining is clearly visible throughout the cell.</p><p>Subsection âPeptidoglycan synthesizing enzymes localize to differentially aged cell wallâ, last paragraph: Figure 4A, bottom panel, shows prominent staining in the poles as well. Therefore, the conclusion that 'DacB2-mRFP localized closer to LDT-mRFP' is not entirely supported by the data.</p><p>Similarly, from the Discussion (end of third paragraph) to conclude that 3-3 cross-linkages are responsible for localizing the biosynthetic machinery seems inadequate from the location of only one of these proteins. These shortfalls can be addressed by attempting localization of another LDT homologue and providing clearer pictures of how PonA1-RFP localizes. Please ensure that any quantification of localization intensity is done for a sufficient number of cells to ensure robustness.</p></disp-quote><p>Upon rereading this section, we agree with the reviewers that it is not written clearly and we have carefully rewritten this section (subsection âPeptidoglycan synthesizing enzymes localize to differentially aged cell wallâ). There is a substantial amount of heterogeneity in the localization of all three enzymes. We agree that, for certain cells, PonA1 is localized more uniformly than for other cells. To account for this heterogeneity, we have quantified and averaged the distributions for approximately 25 cells for each strain. This quantification (Figure 4B) clearly shows that PonA1 is most abundant near the poles. While we have not rigorously explored the underlying source of the heterogeneity in the localization of these enzymes, it appears that it could be dynamic in nature. For this reason, we have provided videos of the time-lapse microscopy for these localization studies as well as a frame-by-frame distribution of PonA1-RFP, LDTE-mRFP and DacB2-mRFP in the figure supplement (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1). Lastly, we have attempted to localize LDTA-mRFP and LDTB-mRFP using the same cloning scheme as LDTE-mRFP without success.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 6A, subsection âMycobacteria are hypersensitive to PBP inactivation in the absence of LDTsâ, first paragraph: It is proposed that D,D-endopeptidase generates tetrapeptide substrates. Data/citation to support this claim is missing. The figure shows tetrapeptide as a substrate. Please address this.</p></disp-quote><p>The figure has been modified to clearly show that the 4-3 crosslink generated by the PBP is the substrate for the D,D-endopeptidase reaction. Our in vitro DacB2 experiment (Figure 4C, Figure 4âfigure supplement 2) shows that 4-3 crosslinks are cleaved and result in tetrapeptides. As one peptide stem participating in a 4-3 crosslink is a tetrapeptide, when the crosslink is cleaved there must remain a tetrapeptide.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Subsection âDrugs targeting both PBPs and LDTs synergize to kill Mtbâ: Clavulanic acid at 5 Î¼g/mL was used for this assay. Therefore, it is important to include this detail here. It is not possible to conclude that amoxicillin and meropenem exhibit synergism as the experiment included another agent (clavulanic acid). Or, the assay needs to be repeated in the absence of clavulanic acid to draw this conclusion. Also, previous work (Kumar P et al., 2017) describes the relationship between various B-lactams and transpeptidases of Mtb. The concluding sentence of this paper is that combinations of two different b-lactams would be most optimal to treat TB. This paper is directly relevant to parts of this manuscript and should be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for missing this critical literature citation and thank the reviewers for this information. We have cited this important work in the Introduction, and in the subsection âDrugs targeting both PBPs and LDTs synergize to kill Mtb Mycobacterium tuberculosisâ.</p><p>Because clavulanic acid is maintained identically in all conditions, it is controlled for in this experiment and therefore is unlikely to be a confounder for these results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The synergy experiments in M. tuberculosis are a (wholly unnecessary) distraction from the importance of the study. It would be far more useful to see the synergy (and or lack of) with the various M. smegmatis mutants. None of the other studies were done in Mtb and there is not even an attempt to discuss the relevant enzymes or orthologs in Mtb. Please address this.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this important suggestion and agree that, as the manuscript is currently organized, there is a leap to Mtb experiments. We have addressed this by including experiments in Msm (Figure 5A, Figure 5âfigure supplement 2) and also by including relevant information regarding LDTs in Mtb (subsection âDrugs targeting both PBPs and LDTs synergize to kill <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosisâ</italic>).</p><p>We do feel, however, that direct testing in Mtb is worthwhile as this has consequences for drug therapy. We already know that there are differences in essentiality of LDTs in Msm and Mtb (Kieser et al.,2015); thus, the lack of synergy by MIC in Msm does not necessarily reflect the potential of this treatment for tuberculosis. The kinetic data shown in Figure 5 (and Figure 5âfigure supplement 2) illustrates that the combination of these drugs kills Msm more rapidly than either drug alone. Given this, we reasoned that it was necessary to attempt these drug synergy experiments in the pathogen itself.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Currently, the figures are highly complex and the manuscript would benefit from an improved lead in their content. Figure 6 is limited to substrate and enzyme localization. The relation of the central part to panels A and B is unclear. Considering this, Figure 6 is not at the high quality level of the rest of the manuscript. Address this. A related minor point is that Figure 6 is introduced before Figure 3 to 5. As eLife caters to a broad readership base, improved flow of your text, clear figures demonstrating key conclusions and a carefully synthesized graphic of the central conclusions would substantively enhance the value of your submission.</p></disp-quote><p>The manuscript has been heavily edited to better assist the reader with the figures. We agree that the central panel of Figure 6 (a summary of the left panel) is not necessary, and actually is quite confusing. We have re-made Figure 6 to address these points.</p></body></sub-article></article>
