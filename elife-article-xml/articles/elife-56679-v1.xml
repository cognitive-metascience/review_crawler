aberrant activity is associated with Alzheimer’s disease and cancer. While its structure is atomically resolved, γ-secretase localization in the membrane in situ relies mostly on biochemical data. Here, we combined fluorescent tagging of γ-secretase subunits with super-resolution microscopy in fibroblasts. Structured illumination microscopy revealed single γ-secretase complexes with a monodisperse distribution and in a 1:1 stoichiometry of PSEN1 and nicastrin subunits. In living cells, sptPALM revealed PSEN1/γ-secretase mainly with directed motility and frequenting ‘hotspots’ or high track-density areas that are sensitive to γ-secretase inhibitors. We visualized γ-secretase association with substrates like amyloid precursor protein and N-cadherin, but not with its sheddases ADAM10 or BACE1 at the cell surface, arguing against pre-formed megadalton complexes. Nonetheless, in living cells PSEN1/γ-secretase transiently visits ADAM10 hotspots. Our results highlight the power of super-resolution microscopy for the study of γ-secretase distribution and dynamics in the membrane.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The γ-secretase complex is an intramembrane cleaving protease (i-CLiP) formed by the catalytic presenilin (PSEN), nicastrin (NCT), anterior-pharynx defective 1 (APH1) and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De Strooper, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kimberly et al., 2003</xref>). It cleaves more than a hundred type-I transmembrane substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jurisch-Yaksi et al., 2013</xref>) including Notch (important for development and cancer), ErbB4 (involved in breast cancer), and the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), whose cleavage product is the toxic amyloid-β, a major hallmark in Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Annaert and De Strooper, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Selkoe and Hardy, 2016</xref>). To fully explore the potential of γ-secretase as a drug target in the fields of neurodegeneration and cancer, a detailed understanding of its structure and biology is required.</p><p>The complex is assembled in a 1:1:1:1 ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sato et al., 2007</xref>) in early biosynthetic compartments, a process thought to be mediated through recycling from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Spasic et al., 2007</xref>). Whereas overexpression of any subunit results in its ER jamming, the knock-out (KO) of a single subunit prevents complex assembly and destabilizes remaining subunits, all together underscoring that all are required for complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Steiner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Luo et al., 2003</xref>). A mature functional γ-secretase complex is characterized by glycosylated NCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yu et al., 2000</xref>) and the endoproteolysis and heterodimerization of PSEN N- and C-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Luo et al., 2003</xref>). This form is long-lived as opposed to unassembled subunits that are rapidly degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">De Strooper and Annaert, 2010</xref>).</p><p>While enormous progress has been made in the past years to unveil γ-secretase protein structure at atomic resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bai et al., 2015b</xref>), we are still lacking direct evidence to reveal γ-secretase distribution and dynamics in membranes of living cells. Only microscopy techniques like FLIM-FRET and molecular dynamics simulations based on the γ-secretase 3D-cryo structure have helped to better understand conformational changes γ-secretase undergoes for substrate recognition and cleaving mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wolfe, 2019</xref>). Less is known about the lateral nanoscale organization of γ-secretase at the plasma membrane (PM), and these insights are still based on biochemical and fractionation studies. Lipidome analysis of immunoprecipitated γ-secretase identified cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine molecules, which were also identified in γ-secretase 3D-cryo structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). These findings could support the association of γ-secretase with cholesterol- and sphingomyelin-enriched domains called lipid rafts. However, to date, most of these data rely on the biochemical characterization of detergent-resistant membranes and flotation gradient centrifugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vetrivel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hur et al., 2008</xref>). Likewise, co-immunoprecipitation and gel filtration approaches found γ-secretase associated with high molecular weight, up to megadalton, complexes that include the cognate sheddases, ADAM10 and BACE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). However, this lateral nanoscale organization of γ-secretase has thus far not been corroborated with imaging approaches for long because of the lack of resolution.</p><p>Given the diffraction limit of light, conventional widefield and confocal microscopy are limited to ~200 nm lateral resolution. Thus, proteins distributed at a distance below this limit cannot be distinguished from one another. The limited resolution significantly jeopardizes co-localization analysis commonly used to assess protein-protein associations. This has dramatically changed in the past decade with the introduction of super-resolution and quantitative microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schermelleh et al., 2019</xref>). It delivered not only unique close-ups of subcellular structures but also powerful tools to study biological processes, including protein nanodistribution at the single-molecule level and in their native context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zuidscherwoude et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nicovich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lagache et al., 2018</xref>). Thanks to Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM), Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy and Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM), the lateral resolution has been increased up to ~100 nm for SIM and ~20 nm for STED and SMLM. These and other advanced microscopy techniques have revealed the importance of nanodomain organization of proteins and lipids, allowing now to study their impact on downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nakajo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hastie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tobin et al., 2018</xref>). Under living conditions, these nanodomains can be seen as dynamic hotspots for protein recruitment or confinement, as revealed by single-particle tracking coupled to photo-activated localization microscopy (sptPALM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Manley et al., 2008</xref>) in molecular dynamics maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rossier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nair et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Constals et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bademosi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Padmanabhan et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we combined SIM, molecular counting by photobleaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Ulbrich and Isacoff, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arant and Ulbrich, 2014</xref>) and sptPALM to advance the current biochemical knowledge on γ-secretase. We focus on PSEN1/γ-secretase complexes not only for their relevance for the Alzheimer’s disease and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jurisch-Yaksi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Voytyuk et al., 2018</xref>), but also because it is particularly abundant at the PM making it more accessible to different microscopy techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sannerud et al., 2016</xref>). We show for the first time PSEN1/γ-secretase stoichiometry at the PM at single-molecule resolution and provide evidence of its majorly mono- and dimeric distribution in living cells. sptPALM identified dynamic hotspots where PSEN1/γ-secretase is recruited, which are influenced by γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) treatments, denoting a yet unknown dynamic nanodomain organization. Importantly, and in contrast to earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu et al., 2019</xref>), our analysis does not provide support for preformed megadalton-sized associations of PSEN1/γ-secretase with sheddases. Rather, SMLM suggests that hotspots are frequented by the different secretases in a transient or temporally regulated manner. Therefore, our study sets out new criteria for γ-secretase research at nanoscale resolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>γ-Secretase PSEN1 and NCT subunits are in a 1:1 stoichiometry at the cell surface</title><p>Studies related to the complex formation and stoichiometry of γ-secretase have been essentially biochemical in nature. Here, we set out to validate the biochemical model of γ-secretase subunit stoichiometry by direct visualization using super-resolution imaging approaches. We selected PSEN1 for being the most studied PSEN and for being more abundantly expressed at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sannerud et al., 2016</xref>). We introduced GFP or mEOS3.2 on PSEN1 and SNAP-tag on NCT for dual-color fluorescence microscopy. To ensure that the introduced tags did not interfere with complex assembly and maturation, we first tested each of them in single KO backgrounds. For both, PSEN1 endoproteolysis and mature glycosylation of NCT was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), as well as broad localization in different subcellular compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This underscores that the introduced tags do not interfere with normal maturation of subunits and complex formation, which is in agreement with previous reports on PSEN and NCT tagging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kaether et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cui et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sannerud et al., 2016</xref>). For the single-molecule visualization of both tagged subunits in one γ-secretase complex in situ, we next engineered a triple KO (tKO; NCT<sup>-/-</sup>, PSEN1<sup>-/-</sup>, PSEN2<sup>-/-</sup>) mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. These tKO MEFs were subsequently used to stably re-introduce NCT-SNAP and GFP-PSEN1 to generate rescued cell lines with two tagged γ-secretase subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To obtain balanced levels of both subunits, we labeled NCT-SNAP with the far-red fluorescent cell-permeable SNAP-SiR ligand and used Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) to select four populations depending on the relative levels of either PSEN1 or NCT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We selected P8 for further experiments, which (i) had the highest levels of mature glycosylated NCT-SNAP and PSEN1 heterodimers, but (ii) exhibited no apparent accumulations of full-length PSEN1 (indicating non-incorporation into complexes), (iii) showed PEN2 stabilization, and (iv) normalized processing of APP-CTF as a direct substrate of γ-secretase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Blue native PAGE of a 0.5% n-Dodecyl β-D-maltoside (DDM) cell extract displayed the expected ~440 kDa high molecular weight complex (HMWC), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kimberly et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fraering et al., 2004</xref>) and indicating proper assembly of the tagged subunits into a mature complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). To confirm the presence of mature tagged complexes at the cell surface, we used aminolipid-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) to isolate highly purified PMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplemental 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tharkeshwar et al., 2017</xref>). Subsequent pull-down with GFP antibodies from CHAPSO extracted PMs (which preserves γ-secretase complex integrity), followed by SDS-PAGE and quantitative western blotting showed that GFP-PSEN1-NTF co-immunoprecipitated with NCT-SNAP and PSEN1-CTF in ratios that are similar to those from the input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Blue native PAGE of DDM-extracted PMs further confirmed the integrity of the tagged complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Lastly, quantitative western blotting, using recombinant γ-secretase as a standard, gave a GFP-PSEN1/NCT-SNAP ratio in tKO samples comparable to the one observed in WT and single KO (sKO) GFP-PSEN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Confocal imaging revealed co-localized subunits at the cell surface, including membrane ruffles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), and in LAMP1-positive organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Thus, the tKO NCT-SNAP/GFP-PSEN1 rescued MEFs demonstrated a normal assembly, maturation and localization of the tagged subunits into γ-secretase complexes, indistinguishable from WT cells. Moreover, the proper trafficking of the complex to the cell surface, a major resident compartment for PSEN1/γ-secretase, allowed us now to study its cell surface distribution in unprecedented detail using super-resolution microscopy.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Visualizing the stoichiometry of γ-secretase subunits.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme of double-tagged γ-secretase.

By coating cell monolayers with silica beads, the upper PM is rigidified and can be removed by shear force, leaving only the basal PM attached to the coverslip as shown by scanning electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Actin staining with Phalloidin-Alexa647 revealed that some cytoskeletal elements remained attached to the PM, but the PM is otherwise essentially devoid of other adhering organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Although this method has been previously reported to not disturb native organization of molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Paparelli et al., 2016</xref>), we compared as a control PSEN1 organization at the basal PM of entire cells versus supported PM sheets in PSEN1 sKO MEFs stably rescued with mEOS3.2-PSEN1. Analysis of reconstructed PALM images confirmed that PM sheets do not majorly disturb the native organization of molecules as shown by the cluster radius and overall distribution of points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Of note, these clusters shown by PALM do not represent an equal number of mEOS3.2-PSEN1 molecules, but result from the blinking property of mEOS3.2 giving rise to multiple localizations per molecule.</p><p>To further assure that different fluorescent tags do not have an impact on PSEN1/γ-secretase distribution at the PM, we analyzed PM sheets of MEF cell lines with different genetic backgrounds stably expressing fluorescently tagged-PSEN1. Widefield images were analyzed by the tessellation-based QuASIMoDOH algorithm, which measures slight changes in lateral density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Paparelli et al., 2016</xref>). This analysis demonstrated that tagged PSEN1/γ-secretase spots are randomly distributed, regardless of the genetic background and fluorescent tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Moreover, density analysis of SIM resolved spots showed a similar pattern in all cell lines, giving an average of 10 spots/µm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Importantly, SIM analysis demonstrated as well that supported PM sheets give a superior signal-to-noise ratio making this approach highly recommended for quantitative fluorescence microscopy of PM proteins and lipids.</p><p>We next analyzed PM sheets from tKO MEFs rescued with only NCT-SNAP or together with GFP-PSEN1 imaged by SIM. In the absence of PSEN expression, tKO NCT-SNAP MEFs had a close to 8-fold decreased NCT-SNAP density at the cell surface compared to tKO NCT-SNAP/GFP-PSEN1 MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These results demonstrate that the trafficking of unassembled subunits is strongly impaired when another subunit, in this case, PSEN1, is missing further consolidating the normal complex assembly in tKO NCT-SNAP/GFP-PSEN1 MEFs.</p><p>We then visualized NCT and PSEN1 subunits in the same γ-secretase complex at the PM. PM sheets from tKO NCT-SNAP-SiR/GFP-PSEN1 MEFs displayed most GFP-PSEN1 spots overlapping with or adjoining NCT-SNAP-SiR spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, middle panel). The density ratio of NCT-SNAP:GFP-PSEN1 was indistinguishable from immunolabeling GFP-PSEN1 with GFPbooster-Atto647N (GFPnb) indicating a one to one stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). This was confirmed by nearest-neighbor analysis, wherein the distance to the nearest-neighbor is measured starting from the centroid coordinates of the spot. Herein, NCT-SNAP-SiR over GFP-PSEN1 revealed a peak at ~50 nm, that is slightly larger compared to the ~20 nm for GFP-PSEN1 over GFPbooster-Atto647N, but clearly distinct from a theoretical random distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). We noticed a fraction of the experimental population that follows the random distribution in both cases, representing about 16% for GFPnb and 30% for NCT of the total population. These likely correspond to GFPnb or NCT-SNAP that pair with GFP-PSEN1 of another complex that is not visible, either due to GFP photobleaching or immature chromophores. Indeed, the expected fraction of fluorescent GFP at the PM for a given GFP construct is ~80%, which is in line with our observed association to GFPnb or NCT-SNAP by GFP-PSEN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Ulbrich and Isacoff, 2007</xref>). As the resolution of SIM is limited to 100 nm, distances up to 100 nm are considered associations. The slightly higher paired distance for PSEN1-NCT compared to the dual-labeled GFP-PSEN1 may originate from the linkers used to fuse the SNAP-tag and GFP to NCT and PSEN1, respectively. Theoretically, they separate the tags to a maximum of ~60 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, the close apposition/co-localization of NCT and PSEN1 at the PM of fully rescued tKO MEFs confirms the biochemical predicted 1:1 ratio in γ-secretase complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PSEN1/γ-secretase is majorly mono and dimeric at the cell surface</title><p>As NCT-PSEN1 spots had almost a 1:1 ratio in a very short distance range (&lt;50 nm), these spots likely correspond to one fluorophore each, thus representing one γ-secretase complex per spot. To determine whether this is indeed the case, we generated a NCT KO MEF line using CRISPR/Cas9. This line was subsequently stably rescued with both NCT-SNAP and NCT-GFP lentiviral vectors and after selection and quality control, PM sheets were imaged by SIM. If γ-secretase is monomeric, distances to the nearest-neighbor for differently labeled NCT molecules will be similar to a random distribution. On the other hand, if γ-secretase exists in higher-order multimers or clusters, we expect strong associations below 100 nm. Nearest-neighbor analysis demonstrated a close to random distribution, underscoring an essentially monomeric distribution of NCT molecules at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To further support this, we applied two independent approaches, first by counting the photobleaching steps of GFP-PSEN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and second, by photon counting the number of fluorescent emitters of NCT-YFP at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Ulbrich and Isacoff, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Ta et al., 2015</xref>).

Since γ-secretase complexes in living cells were very mobile and their paths cross each other, counting the photobleaching steps was impossible. Instead, we used the intensity of the complexes to estimate the number of fluorescently labeled subunits they contain. In tKO MEFs rescued with NCT-GFP and GFP-PSEN1, we could expect two GFP tags per γ-secretase complex, and therefore, the double intensity as for a single GFP tag, as in the case of a sKO GFP-PSEN1 cell line. Because the density of PSEN1/γ-secretase was too high to spatially separate individual molecules, we used a technique to reduce the molecule density while conserving the labeling stoichiometry, called PhotoGate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Madl et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Belyy et al., 2017</xref>). This approach is based on fast photobleaching of a region of interest and partial re-population of the bleached area by fluorescent complexes diffusing from outside this region. Hence, this method only allows us to study mobile complexes. Since these mobile complexes were not exposed to the pre-bleaching pulse, their fluorescent labels are still intact allowing their intensity analysis at single-molecule resolution. After the initial photobleaching step, we observed diffusing fluorescent spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

The histogram of tKO NCT-GFP/GFP-PSEN1 MEFs showed a pronounced shoulder at twice the intensity of a single GFP that disappeared at the end of movie acquisition, meaning that the distribution shifted from complexes with one or two intact GFP tags to only one remaining GFP tag. In contrast, the distribution of spot intensities in sKO GFP-PSEN1 MEFs was similar at the beginning and the end of the movie. The histogram of spot intensities from NCT-GFP/GFP-PSEN1 MEFs yields 42% of spots with two functional GFP and 58% with one functional GFP. Based on 20% of GFP that remain dark (likely due to misfolding) and that has been observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Ulbrich and Isacoff, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Madl et al., 2010</xref>), we would expect a slightly higher fraction of 67% of spots with two functional GFP. The lower fraction in our experiment can be explained by additional pre-bleaching of complexes during cell search and focusing, by a minor fraction of complexes that contain only one GFP, or a combination of both. Since in post-Golgi compartments, γ-secretase subunits exist essentially in a complex, we cannot exclude that unassembled, immature subunits from the PM-juxtaposed cortical ER diffuse into the focal plane, further explaining this pool of single GFP molecules. The ER harbors relatively most of the unassembled and immature subunits, further supporting this. Taking the different independent approaches together, our data indicate that under both fixed and live conditions, the majority of PSEN1/γ-secretase complexes are mono- or dimeric complexes, but not higher-order clusters.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>PSEN1/γ-secretase displays fast diffusion at the plasma membrane</title><p>Thus far, our data demonstrate a random distribution of single or dimeric PSEN1/γ-secretase complexes, but lacks kinetic insight in how these tetrameric complexes behave laterally in the PM of living cells. To address this, we stably rescued PSEN1 sKO MEFs with PSEN1 tagged with the photoswitchable fluorescent protein, mEOS3.2. This allows to perform sptPALM, with the restriction that only short tracks of few seconds can be captured. However, short tracks are compensated by an increase in the number of molecules sampled at a given time. We noticed that even in these short tracks, we could observe changes in PSEN1 lateral behavior. To appreciate which behavior is predominant in the population, we analyzed the different motilities depending on the distance travelled during a given time period such as immobile, confined, anomalous, Brownian or directed. This is represented by the mean squared displacement (MSD), whose fit <italic>r<sup>2</sup> = t<sup>α</sup>+k</italic> gives us information on the type of motility by evaluating α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sibarita, 2014</xref>). On average, PSEN1/γ-secretase showed anomalous motility (mean α = 0.844) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, when classifying individual tracks, most of them have a predominant directed motility mixed with other types of motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To further understand the dynamics of γ-secretase, we calculated the average diffusion coefficient by fitting the first 4 points of the MSD curve. This revealed an average diffusion coefficient of 0.15 µm/s² for PSEN1/γ-secretase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Further analysis showed that most of the tracks are mobile (87%) with a small fraction being immobile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The latter is defined by tracks that stay within an area smaller than the spatial resolution of the imaging system (~50 nm, D ~ 0.01 µm²/s, Log<sub>10</sub>D = −2) extracted from the value of time zero in the MSD.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>PSEN1/γ-secretase diffusion is fast at the cell surface and unaffected by GSI treatments, whereas hotspot areas display sensitivity to treatments.</title><p>Rescued MEFs were treated for 1 hr at 37°C with 1 µm of either DAPT or InhX (L-685,458) prior to imaging.

Recent progress in understanding the structural biology of PSEN1/γ-secretase showed the existence of compact/semi-open conformations likely reflecting the active state of the enzyme versus the rigidifying effects of GSI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bai et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bai et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguayo-Ortiz and Dominguez, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hitzenberger and Zacharias, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). To test if conformational changes affected PSEN1/γ-secretase diffusion at the PM, we treated mEOS3.2-PSEN1 MEFs with the GSIs DAPT and L-685,458 (InhX). DAPT ‘locks’ the γ-secretase structure in an intermediate state between the active and inactive conformation, while InhX is a transition-state analog that binds to the active site in a similar manner as the substrate APP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hitzenberger and Zacharias, 2019</xref>), inducing a ‘compact/semi-open’ conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elad et al., 2015</xref>). Exposure to GSI did not affect the MSD, diffusion coefficient or the overall distribution of Log<sub>10</sub> D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–E</xref>). We only found a slight increase of the immobile fraction upon DAPT treatment visible in the Log<sub>10</sub> histogram showing the diffusion coefficient of individual tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Upon closer inspection of PSEN1/γ-secretase tracks, we observed a slight enrichment of tracks at the cell edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). To analyze this further, we selected regions from the inner part of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,ii</xref>) and the periphery of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,i</xref>) and analyzed, according to its diffusion coefficient, the ratio of mobile to immobile tracks. The apparent ‘enrichment’ of tracks at the cell edge tended to correlate with an increased number of mobile tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). As we imaged in TIRF, the possibility arises that we include some molecules from the upper membrane near the edges, but this was maximally avoided by restricting the localization precision (16 nm ±3.7) during the tracking analysis. Nevertheless, because we are measuring the ratio of mobile/immobile tracks, the density of tracks is normalized. Our analysis thus suggests a higher presence of PSEN1/γ-secretase in the protruding or migrating edges of the cell and GSI treatment mildly reduced the distribution of mobile tracks at these edges.</p><p>Thus far, the spatial super-resolution analysis of PSEN1/γ-secretase does not support a clustered organization, reflecting its presence in high molecular weight complexes. Alternatively, these protease complexes might only associate transiently in a dynamic subdomain that cannot be revealed by spatial analysis in fixed cells. To identify such ‘hot-spots’, defined as areas with a higher frequency in encountering a PSEN1/γ-secretase complex passing through or halting, we analyzed the single-molecule localization data of the sptPALM using Density-Based Spatial Clustering Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ester, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). To avoid cell edges, four to eight squared ROIs of the same size per cell were analyzed for hotspots. We defined a hotspot in DBSCAN as an area with more than 18 localizations to avoid having only one immobile track (most tracks have only ten localizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>)). Of note, we found that DBSCAN–defined hotspots correspond to high-intensity regions in a diffraction-limited projection of the sptPALM stack (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), which allows also the analysis through masks used later in the study. Interestingly, the size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>), but not the average number of hotspots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>), became significantly reduced following treatment with GSIs. In addition, the localizations per hotspot showed a diminishing trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). When examining the number of tracks per hotspot, fewer tracks were found, explaining the smaller hotspot area in GSI-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>). These data suggest that locking PSEN1/γ-secretase conformation in an active-mimicking conformation restricts visiting these hotspots. One could hypothesize that a conformational change induced by GSIs affects the interaction with proteins and/or lipids thereby affecting the normal mobility and localization of PSEN1/γ-secretase to hotspot areas at the PM.</p><p>In summary, although GSI induce conformational compaction of PSEN1/γ-secretase, this does not strikingly affect the kinetics nor density of PSEN1/γ-secretase complexes at the cell surface. Furthermore, our sptPALM data reveal a highly dynamic PSEN1/γ-secretase complex across the PM with different types of motilities not associated with a conformational change induced by GSI. Alternatively, this diversity in motilities could reflect transient associations of the complex with lipids or proteins or distinct nanodomain organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sibarita, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bianchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Martínez-Muñoz et al., 2018</xref>).

Despite the lower density of endogenous APP at the cell surface, nearest-neighbor analysis demonstrated a significant association of PSEN1/γ-secretase with both substrates below a 100 nm distance, supporting in situ association with substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). We then extended this to ADAM10 and BACE1, two sheddases preceding γ-secretase in the dual processing of substrates. Of note, because of the lack of proper antibodies, we expressed SNAP-tagged ADAM10 or BACE1 in GFP-PSEN1 expressing sKO MEFs and limited our analysis only to those cells with the lowest expression to avoid overexpression artifacts. In contrast to substrates, nearest-neighbor analysis showed almost no difference compared to a random distribution analysis of the same spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). Only a small fraction of ADAM10 (6% ± 0.4) showed association with PSEN1/γ-secretase.

However, hotspots of sheddases did not overlap with those of PSEN1/γ-secretase as shown by the very low Pearson’s and Mander’s coefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). As PSEN1 hotspots correspond to a high density of tracks, we next analyzed instead the association of individual PSEN1/γ-secretase tracks with ADAM10- or BACE1-SNAP hotspots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Although there is a tendency of more PSEN1/γ-secretase tracks being associated with BACE1 hotspots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), they had high diffusion coefficients (D = 0.08 ± 0.01 µm²/s), indicating that these tracks represent PSEN1/γ-secretase merely passing by BACE1 hotspots without actually being associated to it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

These tracks may, therefore, represent complexes that are slowing down to associate with ADAM10-frequented regions.

Although we strongly progressed in understanding its structural conformation with increasing detail, the field is lagging behind on the whereabouts of γ-secretase. This originates from its tetrameric stoichiometry and heterogeneity making it for a long time a challenging complex to study through more classic cell biological approaches. The advent of super-resolution microscopy techniques in recent years allows now to revisit this with an unprecedented resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schermelleh et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we describe how PSEN1/γ-secretase complexes are organized and diffuse in the plane of the PM at single-molecule/complex resolution. We approached this through engineering PSEN and/or NCT deficient cells stably rescued with their fluorescently tagged versions allowing super-resolution analyses. The potential risk of overexpression artifacts is avoided through the use of retro- or lentiviral vectors followed by FACS sorting to select pools of cells with similar physiological levels of expression of exogenously introduced γ-secretase subunits, as demonstrated by rigorous biochemical analysis. By starting from PSEN deficient cells, we could selectively focus on the dynamics of PSEN1 containing complexes that are known to distribute mainly at the cell surface and endosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Annaert et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kaether et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Réchards et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sannerud et al., 2016</xref>). Analysis of SIM-imaged PM sheets on our dual-tagged γ-secretase complex gave us quantitative evidence of subunit associations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Further experiments proved that these associations were in fact 1:1 molecular associations of NCT and PSEN1 in the same complex. To our knowledge, this is the first time that PSEN1/γ-secretase stoichiometry is demonstrated in situ.</p><p>Independent and complementary imaging strategies surprisingly demonstrate that PSEN1/γ-secretase laterally distributes at the PM as mono- and dimeric complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The latter is consistent with earlier biochemical evidence on the existence of dimeric complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hébert et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cervantes et al., 2004</xref>) as well as in lower resolution structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ogura et al., 2006</xref>). When analyzed by blue native PAGE, mostly a ~ 440 kDa complex is reported possible coinciding with a dimeric configuration as the sum of the four components is about 210 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kimberly et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fraering et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Spasic et al., 2007</xref>). A functional implication for monomers versus dimers is however not known, but could be potentially related to regions in the membrane with a higher density of complexes that promote dimerization. From a technical perspective, the fact that we can image PSEN1/γ-secretase as single complexes implicates that SIM analysis on PM sheets achieves single-molecule imaging, likely because imaging PM monolayers increases the signal to noise ratio.</p><p>Diffusion coefficients of membrane proteins range typically from ~0.0002 to 0.5 µm²/s using single-particle tracking methods. SptPALM revealed very dynamic PSEN1/γ-secretase complexes with a mean diffusion coefficient of 0.15 µm²/s, which is fast for a complex with twenty transmembrane domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Other multimembrane proteins like cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) diffuse extremely slow (0.005 µm²/s) whereas G-protein coupled receptors, that also di-/oligomerize at the cell surface, have as well low mean diffusion coefficients (0.05–0.06 µm²/s for GABA and β<sub>1</sub>/β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bates et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Calebiro et al., 2013</xref>]). Only rhodopsin and smoothened, both seven transmembrane domain proteins, have much higher coefficients (0.77 µm²/s and 0.26 µm²/s, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Milenkovic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kreutzberger et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, rhomboids, another member of the i-CLiP family, diffuse extremely fast with a mean diffusion coefficient of 0.88 µm²/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kreutzberger et al., 2019</xref>). The mechanism behind this appears to be a hydrophobic mismatch with the surrounding lipids, causing a membrane distortion that reduces in turn membrane viscosity. As diffusion is the rate-limiting step in substrate catalysis, rhomboids overcame this by breaking the viscosity imposed ‘speed limit’ to facilitate substrate processing. PSEN1/γ-secretase has a tendency to be more mobile at the cell’s edges, where it is assumed to be more active/required because of the higher presence and turnover of adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Haapasalo and Kovacs, 2011</xref>). Whether or not PSEN1/γ-secretase uses as well hydrophobic mismatch as a mechanism to diffuse across the PM needs to be further explored.</p><p>SptPALM revealed that PSEN1/γ-secretase changes motility during its diffusion, with frequent intervals of directed movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). At the level of the PM, molecular motors are unlikely to act upon PM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Levi and Gratton, 2007</xref>). Alternatively, directed motility has been explained by either the uniform flow or conveyor belt models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Saxton, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Saxton and Jacobson, 1997</xref>). In the uniform flow model, particles in the membrane move together with the lipids at a constant velocity. In the conveyor belt model, the particle goes on and off from a structure that defines the directed motion, resulting in a mix of directed and other motilities. In support of the latter model, few studies suggested a functional interaction of PSEN1 with the actin cytoskeleton. For instance, PSEN1 has been reported to interact with filamin, an actin-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guo et al., 2000</xref>). More indirectly, absence of the orthologous PSEN in the moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic>, causes cytoskeletal defects pointing to a scaffolding role of the moss PSEN between the cytoskeleton and adherent proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khandelwal et al., 2007</xref>). To explore directed motility of PSEN1/γ-secretase in relation to the actin cytoskeleton, more appropriate cellular models including migrating cells, or the neuronal growth cone might be considered.</p><p>Different types of motilities have been correlated to transient protein-protein associations, changes in lipid microenvironment and/or changes in protein conformational state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Suzuki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sibarita, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Constals et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Freeman et al., 2018</xref>). Anchoring to the cytoskeleton usually results in an immobile state as shown for CD44 and integrin β<sub>1</sub> and β<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rossier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Freeman et al., 2018</xref>). Confined motility of α<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin receptor (α2MR) and transferrin receptor (TfR) has been related to the enclosure of the protein in between actin filaments of the cytoskeleton, leading to the 'picket-fence' hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kusumi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sako and Kusumi, 1994</xref>). In the AMPAR, conformational changes triggered by binding of glutamate leads to a desensitized state correspondent to a switch from immobile to mobile molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Constals et al., 2015</xref>). Although experimental and simulated data show that PSEN1/γ-secretase also undergoes conformational changes upon substrate binding or in the presence of inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bai et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguayo-Ortiz and Dominguez, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>), sptPALM did not reveal changes on diffusion coefficients, distribution of tracks or types of motility following treatment with GSIs. Both GSIs only showed a trend in decreased motility of PSEN1/γ-secretase in the edges of the cell. Further analysis of sptPALM localizations with DBSCAN revealed hotspots with a higher density of PSEN1/γ-secretase tracks, which became reduced in the presence of GSIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>). We currently do not know the nature of these hotspots, but they could relate to specific nano- or microdomains that favor the presence of PSEN1/γ-secretase because of a specific lipid microenvironment, or underlying structures like cytoskeletal elements. PSEN1/γ-secretase could be recruited to these hotspots when in a specific activation state and/or conformation. If these hotspots were sites of substrate cleavage, locking the conformation in the active or transition state would mimic this causing an increase in the number or size of such hotspots. However, the opposite is seen, indicating that inactive PSEN1/γ-secretase complexes might settle down here. Support also comes from the observation that PSEN1/γ-secretase hotspots did not associate with those of the sheddases ADAM10 and BACE1, which would be preferential locations where CTF substrates for PSEN1/γ-secretase would be generated. Whether PSEN1/γ-secretase dynamic hotspots are indeed favored by inactive PSEN1/γ-secretases, requires additional experimentation using, for instance, inactive aspartate mutants.</p><p>When analyzing individual tracks of PSEN1/γ-secretase, a small portion of tracks frequented hotspots of both ADAM10 and BACE1. However, while they appeared to pass by in the case of BACE1 hotspots, the motility, as measured by mean diffusion coefficient, decreased in the case of ADAM10 to ~0.04 µm²/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This is in line with the association found between PSEN1/γ-secretase and ADAM10-SNAP using nearest-neighbor analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This is not detected for BACE1, which may not be that surprising given that BACE1 activity is more favorable in endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sannerud et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Das et al., 2016</xref>) and that the potential encountering of BACE1 via the produced substrates with PSEN1/γ-secretase complexes would more likely to be found there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rajendran et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wang, 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, as compared to the substrate APP, this ADAM10 association is very moderate, also considering, the density of ADAM10-SNAP (three spots/µm²) compared to the even lower density of APP (0.5 spots/µm²). Together with the largely mono- and dimeric nature of PSEN1/γ-secretase at the PM, this questions the existence of preformed megadalton-sized complexes, which suggests multiple copies of either ADAM10 or BACE1 and PSEN1/γ-secretase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, to our knowledge, sheddases have not been identified in the several interactome studies using PSENs as a bait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wakabayashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jeon et al., 2013</xref>), whereas this was the case for the substrate APP-C83 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Esler et al., 2002</xref>). The support for the megadalton-sized complexes concept is majorly biochemical in nature and based on the void fractions of gel filtration-based separations of crude detergent extracts. Thus, it cannot be excluded that such macrocomplexes may be formed during or after extraction. Our single-particle analysis rather favors the idea of a 1:1 encountering of PSEN1/γ-secretase to areas where sheddases reside to ‘accept’ the respective substrate CTF for further processing. At most, this would result in short temporal or transient associations via substrate transfer.</p><p>In conclusion, the presented single-molecule resolution analyses uncovered the distribution and dynamics of PSEN1/γ-secretase at the PM, as well as show, for the first time, the stoichiometry of the complex while embedded in its natural environment. These findings will pave the way for studying the association of γ-secretase with substrates or regulatory proteins in real-time. Ultimately, the spatial and temporal regulation of consecutive processing by a sheddase and γ-secretase could be obtained. We anticipate that single-molecule resolution approaches will become a standard in the field to further decipher the dynamics of intramembrane proteolysis particularly in the neuron. Herein, the distribution and dynamics of these enzymes at the growth cone and synapse will be of particular interest given that many γ-secretase substrates are adhesion proteins functioning in axonal outgrowth and synapse formation and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jurisch-Yaksi et al., 2013</xref>). Whereas their neuronal functions are slowly unveiled, indeed little is known about the dynamics of regulated intramembrane proteolysis in the synapse, let alone how for instance Familial Alzheimer’s Disease (FAD)-associated mutations in PSEN1 or APP alter these dynamics and thus the functional readouts of the synapse. In an Alzheimer’s disease context, synaptic plasticity is affected in absence of PSENs and in PSEN1 FAD models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Saura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Priller et al., 2007</xref>). Hence, characterizing the distribution, associations and dynamics of γ-secretase in the synapse would give a much more detailed insight on the molecular mechanisms driving the disease.</p></sec><sec

GFP-PSEN1 rescued dKO and GFP- and mCherry-PSEN1 rescued sKO MEFs have previously been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sannerud et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, rescue lines with mEOS3.2-hPSEN1 were generated. Briefly, KO MEFs were exposed to different amounts of virus loads and selected by puromycin resistance (3 µg/ml). Stable pools were validated by WB and confocal microscopy to confirm γ-secretase maturation, activity, and localization. For PSEN1/PSEN2/NCT tKO MEFs, we used the web-based CRISPR Design Tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://crispor.tefor.net/">http://crispor.tefor.net/</ext-link>) to select the genomic sequence target in mouse PSEN1 (5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">caacgttatcaagtacctccccgaa</named-content>-3’), PSEN2 (5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">caacgtcctgggcgaccgtcgggcc</named-content>-3’) and NCT (5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">caccgcgttgagcaggcggacaca</named-content>-3’). Oligo pairs (Integrated DNA Technologies) encoding guide sequences were annealed and ligated into the plasmid pX330 (Addgene) for PSEN1 and PSEN2 and px459 for NCT following Zhang’s laboratory protocol (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.addgene.org/crispr/zhang/">https://www.addgene.org/crispr/zhang/</ext-link>). To generate PSEN1 and 2 dKO, MEFs were co-transfected with pX330-PSEN1 and pX330-PSEN2 using FugeneHD (Promega). The selection of dKO clones was done by serial dilution followed by western blot analysis. Once a PSEN1 and 2 dKO clone was selected, cells were transfected with the px459-NCT vector followed by three days of selection with puromycin to select for transfected cells. Cells were amplified and selection of independent NCT KO clones was done by serial dilution followed by WB analysis. The rescue of tKO MEFs was done in two steps. First, retroviral mNCT-SNAP or mNCT-GFP particles transduced tKO cells and selected with hygromycin (100 µl/ml). Selected cells were transduced again with either GFP- or mEOS3.2-hPSEN1 retroviral particles and selected with puromycin. Double transduced pools were FAC Sorted into four populations with different levels of each protein and checked by confocal and WB. We assessed the stoichiometry and integrity of the complex by blue native gel electrophoresis and co-immunoprecipitations on SPION-isolated PMs. For NCT KO, the same CRISPR strategy with the aforementioned NCT sequence was used. Rescue with NCT-SNAP was done in the same fashion as with tKO. For NCT KO NCT-SNAP/NCT-GFP, selected NCT KO NCT-SNAP MEFs were again transduced with mNCT-GFP and selected with puromycin. For cells expressing sheddases, we transduced sKO GFP-PSEN1 and sKO mEOS3.2-PSEN1 MEFs with hBACE1-SNAP lentiviral particles and selected with zeocin (200 µg/ml). Selected cells were then FAC Sorted to select low expression cells. For mADAM10-SNAP, sKO GFP-PSEN1 and sKO mEOS3.2-PSEN1 MEFs were transiently transfected with FugeneHD (Promega), following manufacturer’s recommendations. All cell lines were evaluated by WB and confocal microscopy. Cell lines were screened for mycoplasma yearly using MycoAlert mycoplasma detection kit (Lonza) and were authenticated by STR profiling (Microsynth AG).</p><p>For SNAP-tag labeling, we used the SNAP-Cell 647-SiR substrate (New England Biolabs) diluted in DMSO. About 1 hr prior to cell processing, cells were incubated with 0.15 µM SiR-SNAP in complete medium for 15 min at 37°C. Cells were washed three times with complete medium and incubated with fresh medium for 30 min to 1 hr at 37°C, after which cells could be further processed. Finally, and following labeling, cells were trypsinized and stained with DAPI for dead cell exclusion. Around 3*10<sup>6</sup> cells were sorted (BD FACSAria III; BD Biosciences), using the FACSDiva software or sterile sorted (BD Influx; BD Biosciences), using the BD FACS software. Four populations were defined according to the relative abundance of NCT-SiR and GFP- or mEOS3.2- (green) PSEN1: P5 (NCT low/PSEN1 low), P6 (NCT high/PSEN1 low), P7 (NCT low/PSEN1 high) and P8 (NCT high/PSEN1 high). The different populations were collected for subsequent culture and further validated using western blot analysis and confocal microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Purification of γ-secretase</title><p>Protease complexes were expressed in Hi5 insect cells using recombinant baculoviruses bearing the WT subunits of the human protease complex (NCT-GFP, PSEN1, APH1 and PEN2), as purified as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Szaruga et al., 2017</xref>.

The removal of structured artifacts was done by manually adjusting the intensity histogram. Masks of intensity peaks were made by the ImageJ plugin H-watershed. Coordinates of particle centroids were extracted and used in a costume-written MATLAB routine to calculate the nearest-neighbor distance.

critical in several diseases including Alzheimers. Most studies that characterised this multisubunit complex were based on fractionation and biochemistry. This study is unique in visualising single protein movements in the membrane and finds there are no preformed γ-secretase-substrate-mega-dalton complexes. This indicates the importance of membrane trafficking in the regulation of the activity of this protein complex.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Super-resolution microscopy reveals majorly monodisperse presenilin1/γ-secretase at the cell surface&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

We have previously published (Sannerud et al., 2016) that PSEN1 complexes are residing at the cell surface as well as in endosomal compartments, including early, recycling, and smaller amounts in late endosomes. To illustrate this, we have extended the same sample as displayed in Figure 1E with the co-localization of PSEN1/NCT with LAMP1 (new panel H in Figure 1—figure supplement 1; arrowheads in S1-H). We routinely use this marker as it is well established that LAMP1 traffics via the cell surface and endosomal compartments to LE/Lys vesicles. Also, in Figure 1E, we have additionally highlighted the co-localization of PSEN1-NCT at the cell surface (yellow arrowheads) and membrane ruffles (orange arrowheads). We have clarified this also in more detail in the legends to the figure and in Results section:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Confocal imaging revealed co-localized subunits at the cell surface, including membrane ruffles (Figure 1E), and in LAMP1-positive organelles (Figure 1—figure supplement 1H).”</p><p>2) In Figure 1I there are clearly two populations, one of which seems to overlap well with the theoretical random distribution. What is this second population and why is it not discussed explicitly, as it seems to encompass a large fraction of the molecules. Is it consistent with the statement thatPSEN1 and SNAP are associated?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this observation, on a second population being closer to a random distribution. In the case of the GFP-PSEN1/GFPnb pair this is a rather small population (16% of all), while for the GFP-PSEN1/NCT-SNAP pair this is slightly higher (30% of all). For both, these represents (minor) fractions with much larger distances of either GFPnb or NCT-SNAP to GFP-PSEN1. They likely correspond to GFPnb or NCT-SNAP that pair with GFP-PSEN1 of another complex that is not visible either due to GFP photobleaching or immature chromophores as reported (Ulbrich and Isacoff, 2007): herein, the expected fraction of fluorescent GFP at the PM for any given GFP construct is ~80%, which is in line with the ~80% of association either of GFPnb or NCT-SNAP to GFP-PSEN1. We have clarified this as such now in the text of the revised manuscript, Results section:</p><p>“We noticed a fraction of the experimental population that follows the random distribution in both cases, representing about 16% for GFPnb and 30% for NCT of the total population. These likely correspond to GFPnb or NCT-SNAP that pair with GFP-PSEN1 of another complex that is not visible, either due to GFP photobleaching or immature chromophores. Indeed, the expected fraction of fluorescent GFP at the PM for a given GFP construct is ~80%, which is in line with our observed association to GFPnb or NCT-SNAP by GFP-PSEN1 (Ulbrich and Isacoff, 2007).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 1 and elsewhere please state the length of the size bars in the images.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the length of the size bars in the respective panels of Figure 1 as well as throughout all other figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Why are the clusters that are so clearly visible in Figure 1—figure supplement 2B not seen in Figure 2A?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and there is a very logic explanation for this as the microscopy techniques used in both panels are very different. In panel 2A, we are using structured Illumination microscopy (SIM) on GFP. Here, all GFP molecules are excited at once during five grid rotations, after which, mathematical reconstruction allows to get 80-100nm lateral resolution. However, in panel S2B single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) is used, which is based in the repetitive detection of stochastically activated single molecules through many frames. After centroid localization of each detection, all detections are pulled to a single image. This creates artificial clusters, as widely reported, and especially for mEOS3.2 (Annibale et al., 2010, 2011). Many strategies have been explored to minimize the artifacts created by the multi-detection of a single molecule. However, these calculations are complex and labor extensive, thus we only used SMLM as control for PM sheet distribution versus entire cells. For the actual molecular counting of PSEN1, we preferred to use the for GFP well-established photobleaching and photon-counting techniques. Additional information was added to the Results section:</p><p><italic>“</italic>Of note, these clusters shown by PALM do not represent an equal number of mEOS3.2-PSEN1 molecules but result from the blinking property of mEOS3.2 giving rise to multiple localizations per molecule.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The PhotoGate approach assumes that 100% of the molecules are mobile. Was this validated independently?</p></disp-quote><p>In the PhotoGate approach, the central area is initially completely photobleached and then repopulated by diffusion from outside the central area. Therefore, only mobile spots can be analyzed. Together with the later result from Figure 3 where we show that about 20% of spots are immobile, the conclusions from the PhotoGate approach apply at least for the major fraction of 80% of total molecules. It is not excluded that the immobile fraction follows a different intensity distribution. We clarify this point further in the Results section:</p><p>“Hence, this method only allows us to study mobile complexes. Since these mobile complexes were not exposed…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) What explains the majority of single intensity features in the NCT-GFP/ GFP-PSEN1 experiments in Figure 2C-E?</p></disp-quote><p>We deduced the fraction of spots with double intensity by assuming the final intensity distribution (after photobleaching) is solely based on 1-GFP spots, and convolving this distribution with itself, which gives an estimate of the intensity distribution of spots containing 2 GFPs. A fit to the observed distribution before photobleaching yielded a fraction of 58% of 1-GFP spots and 42% of 2-GFP spots. In previous work, a 80% fraction of functional GFP and 20% non-functional GFP were observed, which results in 33% of 1-GFP spots and 67% of 2-GFP spots in a pure dimer (Ulbrich and Isacoff, 2007). The higher prevalence of 1-GFP spots in our experiments can be explained either by pre-bleaching during searching a cell and adjustment of the focus (leaving 59% of functional GFP), by 41% monomeric subunits (containing only 1 GFP, i.e. either NCT-GFP or GFP-PSEN1) , or a combination of both. Overall literature agrees that, in post-Golgi compartments, g-secretase subunits exist essentially in a complex. Therefore, the fraction of monomeric subunits that cannot be explained as a result of prebleaching events might originate from other pools such as the cortical ER, that is known to very closely appose to the PM. The ER harbors relatively most of the unassembled subunits further supporting this. We clarify this point in the text and adjusted Figure 2E to show the two populations of 1-GFP spots and 2-GFP spots more clearly. Adjustments to the text can be found in the Results section:</p><p>“We compared intensity histograms of the beginning and the end of the video, after which most GFPs are bleached and therefore, only complexes with a single functional GFP should be left (Figure 2E).

So far, we have not found evidence that the overall movement of PSEN/γ-secretase is oriented in a particular direction. We elaborated further in the Discussion and speculated on possible mechanisms that could drive PSEN1/γ-secretase diffusion, specifically regarding directed motion. As molecular motors are unlikely to act on plasma membrane protein diffusion, alternative explanations are provided through the “uniform flow” and the “conveyor belt” models. In the first one, particles diffuse with the membrane in a constant flow. Whereas in the conveyor belt, particles switch to direct diffusion transiently when “hopping on” the conveyor belt. This could be the underlying actin cytoskeleton for instance. In this regard, PSEN1 has indeed been reported to interact with filamin, which could anchor PSEN1 to actin filaments. Likewise, using the moss Physcomitrella patens as a model organism, the group of Rafi Kopan has linked PSEN function to the cytoskeleton. They found that in absence of PS, there were growth abnormalities related to cytoskeleton defects, pointing to a scaffolding role of PS of the cytoskeleton with adhesion molecules (Khandelwal et al., 2007). We have preliminary data that show an effect of latrunculinA on PSEN1 motility but these are currently too preliminary to include and with further experimentation, we will address this in more detail in a follow-up paper that could be considered as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>. Discussion about the underlying mechanisms for directed movement can be found in Discussion section:</p><p>“SptPALM revealed that PSEN1/γ-secretase changes motility during its diffusion, with frequent intervals of directed movement (Figure 3C). […] To explore directed motility of PSEN1/γ-secretase in relation to the actin cytoskeleton, more appropriate cellular models including migrating cells, or the neuronal growth cone might be considered.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Could the failure of secretase to colocalize with ADAM10 and BACE1 be the result of overexpression of the latter, which unlike the other molecules found to colocalize, were expressed heterologously?</p></disp-quote><p>This an important point raised by the reviewer. For γ-secretase subunits, we systematically use stable lentiviral rescue in the respective KO backgrounds followed by selection for low(est) expressing clones (as verified with antibodies and compared to endogenous wild-type expressions). As for APP and Cadherin, we first tried to use primary antibodies directed against the sheddases, but after testing many of the reported antibodies, for instance in ADAM10 KO cell lines, we realized that they all give a lot of unspecific labeling. Without the availability of antibodies with a high signal to noise ratio, it makes it merely impossible to perform reliable nearest neighbor distance analysis. As opposed to γ-secretase that requires stoichiometric expression, this is not the case for sheddases making exogenous expression using SNAP-tagged versions an acceptable alternative. Herein, we systematically imaged only the lowest expressing cells, exactly to avoid overexpression artifacts.</p><p>Of note, if ADAM10 or BACE1 should be higher overexpressed compared to endogenous, we argue that in this case, rather the opposite might occur: if the macrocomplex idea is true, we would expect to rather see an overlap with PSEN1/γ-secretase as they would outcompete the endogenous sheddases. As this is not observed, we are confident that our data support our current interpretation that PSEN1/γ-secretase is not being associated with the respective sheddases. This was further corroborated with our sptPALM analysis (Figure 5D,F), rather supporting the idea that there might be temporarily regulated encounters in particular areas where sheddases reside and may deliver the CTF for further processing by γ-secretase. To clarify this point we added some text in Results section:</p><p>“Of note, because of the lack of proper antibodies, we expressed SNAP-tagged ADAM10 or BACE1 in GFP-PSEN1 expressing sKO MEFs and limited our analysis only to those cells with the lowest expression to avoid overexpression artifacts.”</p><p><bold>References</bold></p><p>Annibale, P., M.
