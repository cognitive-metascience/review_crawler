However, if leaves age and yellow too early, it can limit how much energy the plant can harvest from light. Thus, it is crucial for plants to know when they should start the leaf aging process. This is also important for plant biologists because premature leaf yellowing can reduce both the yield and quality of crop plants.</p><p>Certain aging-related genes tightly control when and how leaves age. Like in many other organisms, plant DNA is packaged around proteins called histones. As such, one of the ways that plants regulate the activity of their genes is by chemically modifying the DNA or histones to alter how tightly the DNA is packaged. For example, to switch particular genes off, enzymes known as histone deacetylases remove an acetyl group from their histones. However, it is not clear how these enzymes know which genes to modify and how this helps to make sure that leaf aging happens at the appropriate time.</p><p>Chen et al. studied a histone deacetylase called HDA9 in a flowering plant named <italic>Arabidopsis.</italic> The experiments show that the HDA9 enzyme plays an important role in ensuring the leaves turn yellow at the right time. Without HDA9, the leaf aging process is delayed. HDA9 also needs the help of another protein called PWR that instructs HDA9 to remove acetyl groups from the histones of specific aging-associated genes in order to switch these genes off.</p><p>The next challenge is to understand how HDA9 and PWR sense developmental and environmental signals to trigger the histone modifications. It will also be important to decipher how this enzyme works with other regulators to trigger leaf aging at the right time.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17214.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17214.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>epigenetic regulation</kwd><kwd>chromatin targeting</kwd><kwd>histone deacetylase</kwd><kwd>plant aging</kwd><kwd>genome-wide profiling</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1RO1 GM114292</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Lloyd M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007015</institution-id><institution>University of Wisconsin-Madison</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Startup grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhong</surname><given-names>Xuehua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CAREER award, MCB-1552455</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhong</surname><given-names>Xuehua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>USDA and National Institute of Food and Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Hatch 1002874</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhong</surname><given-names>Xuehua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Alfred Toepfer Faculty Fellow</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhong</surname><given-names>Xuehua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic and biochemical studies reveal how a histone deacetylase acts together with other chromatin regulators to promote the onset of plant aging.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Age-dependent organ and tissue dysfunction is detrimental to all organisms. Leaf senescence is an integral part of the plant lifecycle. Although efficient senescence is important to increase plant viability in the next generation, premature senescence often causes a decrease in the yield and quality of crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avila-Ospina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Distelfeld et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo and Gan, 2014</xref>). Thus, theÂ knowledge of mechanisms underlying leaf aging has profound implications in many biotechnological applications, including increasing plant productivity and preventing post-harvest loss during transportation and storage. Regulation of leaf senescence is a complex process controlled by developmental and environmental signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Woo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schippers, 2015</xref>). Many senescence-associated genes (<italic>SAGs</italic>) and transcription factors have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gepstein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buchanan-Wollaston et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breeze et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo and Gan, 2012</xref>). However, their in vivo function in senescence remains largely unknown. For the relatively well-studied senescence-associated transcription factors, current knowledge of their function is mostly derived from knockout mutants, transgenic overexpressing plants, or identification of downstream target genes. Little is known how these transcription factors are regulated and function mechanistically in the global control of leaf senescence.</p><p>Epigenetic modification is an important gene regulatory mechanism in eukaryotic organisms and plays critical roles in diverse biological processes, including genome stability and integrity, normal growth and development, diseases, and stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kawashima and Berger, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matzke and Mosher, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pikaard and Mittelsten Scheid, 2014</xref>). Histone (de)acetylation plays important roles in genome expression, organization, and function through the coordinated activities of histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haberland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Verdin and Ott, 2015</xref>). While acetylation is often associated with active transcription, histone deacetylases (HDACs) are generally considered transcriptional repressors that remove acetylation and induce chromatin compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Verdin and Ott, 2015</xref>).</p><p>HDACs are highly conserved enzymes in eukaryotes. The flowering plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> has eighteen annotated histone deacetylases that are grouped into three families: twelve RPD3-like (REDUCED POTASSIUM DEPENDENCE 3), two SIR2 (SILENT INFORMATION REGULATOR 2), and four plant-specific HD2 (HISTONE DEACETYLASE 2) based on sequence similarity and cofactor dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pandey et al., 2002</xref>). Genetic studies have revealed theÂ critical function of HDACs in crosstalk between plant genomes and the environment in plant responses to diverse stresses at the cellular and organismal levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krogan and Long 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pikaard and Mittelsten Scheid, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Certain HDACs (e.g. HDA6 and HDA19) also function in genome integrity and gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murfett et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Probst et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">May et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Earley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vaillant et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pontvianne et al., 2013</xref>). Interplays between HDACs and other epigenetic modifications have also been documented. For example, HDA6 is important for DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aufsatz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Earley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">To et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blevins et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stroud et al., 2013</xref>). Functional disruption of HDACs often causes pleiotropic abnormalities in plant growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krogan and Long, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pikaard and Mittelsten Scheid, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). For instance, early studies using anÂ antisense approach to knockdown histone deacetylases suggest a potential role of histone deacetylation in leaf senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tian and Chen, 2001</xref>). HDA6 is implicated in leaf senescence by downregulation of two <italic>SAGs</italic> in the loss-of-function mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu et al., 2008</xref>). However, the underlying mechanism through which HDA6 and other HDACs act in leaf senescence is unknown.</p><p>Histone deacetylase 9 (HDA9) is a RPD3 type deacetylase, closely related to mammalian HDAC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pandey et al., 2002</xref>). Previous genetic mutational studies have established important roles of HDA9 in flowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kang et al., 2015</xref>), seed germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Zanten et al., 2014</xref>), and salt and drought stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). However, the composition, regulation, and mechanistic action of HDA9 are unknown.</p><p>In this study, we report the identification and characterization of a previous uncharacterized repressive complex containing HDA9 and a SANT domain-containing protein POWERDRESS (PWR) as novel regulators of leaf senescence. HDA9 promotes the onset of age-related and dark-induced leaf senescence by regulating the expression of genes involved in senescence. Our genome-wide profiling of HDA9 occupancy reveals that HDA9 directly binds to the promoters of key negative regulators and this binding requires PWR. PWR physically interacts with HDA9 and loss-of-function <italic>pwr</italic> mutants phenocopy <italic>hda9</italic>, indicating that this complex is biologically relevant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PWR is important for HDA9 nuclear accumulation as HDA9 protein level is significantly reduced in the nucleus in <italic>pwr</italic> mutants. Thus, we propose that PWR acts at multiple levels to regulate HDA9 function. To our knowledge, this is the first genome-wide study on targeting and regulating mechanism for a histone deacetylase in plants. Together, this study reveals an uncharacterized epigenetic complex involved in leaf senescence and provides mechanistic insights into how a histone deacetylase along with a chromatin-binding protein contribute to a robust regulatory network to promote the onset of plant aging.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PWR interacts with HDA9</title><p>To gain mechanistic insights into HDA9 action, we identified the protein complex associated with HDA9 by performing immunoaffinity purification followed by multidimensional protein identification technology mass spectrometry (IP-MS).

In this study, we found that many ABA-responsive genes were downregulated in <italic>hda9</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref>), indicating that the ABA signaling pathway is impaired in <italic>hda9</italic> during leaf senescence. This is consistent with a previous study showing insensitivity to ABA-mediated seed dormancy and germination inhibition in <italic>hda9</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Zanten et al., 2014</xref>). ABA is known to promote leaf senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jibran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khan et al., 2014</xref>) and loss-of-function of the ABA receptor PYL8 or PYL9 causes delayed leaf senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). Our ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses reveal that neither PYL8 nor PYL9 is a primary target of HDA9. Instead, we found that HDA9 directly binds and represses two negative regulators of the ABA signaling pathway, <italic>NPX1</italic> and <italic>AFP4/TMAC2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3âsource data 1B</xref>). NPX1 and AFP4/TMAC2 are proposed to act as negative regulators in ABA signaling because their overexpression reduces plant sensitivity to ABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang and Wu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2009b</xref>). Based on these findings, we propose that HDA9 promotes leaf senescence in part by repressing the negative regulators of the ABA signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Besides ABA, one negative regulator of the JA pathway, WRKY57, is also shown to be a direct target of HDA9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">FiguresÂ 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3âsource data 1B</xref>). WRKY57 is a transcription factor that represses JA-induced leaf senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that HDA9 may also regulate leaf senescence through the JA signaling pathway. Autophagy is an intracellular process for protein degradation and is associated with leaf longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avila-Ospina et al., 2014</xref>). APG9 is an essential component of the plant autophagy pathway and <italic>apg9</italic> mutants display early leaf senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanaoka et al., 2002</xref>).

Similar genome-wide localization patterns were reported for HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC6 in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2009</xref>) and HDA101 in maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yang et al., 2016</xref>).

Another possibility is that HDA9 may compete with more active HDAs for binding to the similar genomic regions. It is also unclear why silent genes are not the preferred targets of HDA9.

Supporting the relevance of HDA9-WRKY53 interaction, we found that HDA9 binding peaks are significantly enriched for WRKY binding motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). It is possible that WRKY53 recruits HDA9 to active genes to remove the acetylation marks added by HATs to maintain their proper expression levels during senescence.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Non-transcriptional functions of HDA9</title><p>Analogous to reports on mammalian and maize HDACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yang et al., 2016</xref>), our ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses also reveal that the majority of HDA9 bound genes do not alter gene expression in the absence of HDA9. Although the mechanism is unclear, several possibilities could account for this pattern. First, the ultimate gene expression level is determined by the combined actions of multiple redundant repressors or activators, exemplified by yeast Rpd3 and chromatin remodeling enzyme Isw2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fazzio et al., 2001</xref>). It is possible that other HDACs (e.g. HDA6 and HDA19) or transcriptional repressors function redundantly with HDA9 to regulate gene expression, and thus loss of HDA9 itself is insufficient to release the transcriptional repression of its targets. This may also provide an explanation for the low number of mis-regulated genes in <italic>hda6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">To et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blevins et al., 2014</xref>). In support of this notion, loss-of-function <italic>hda6</italic> mutations induce delayed leaf senescence and repress the expression of <italic>SAG12</italic> and <italic>SEN4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu et al., 2008</xref>). The molecular basis of HDA6 in leaf senescence is unclear. It will be interesting to explore the precise relationship between HDA9 with HDA6 in targeting and regulating gene expression in leaf senescence as well as other biological processes. Second, our GO analysis reveals that HDA9-bound genes that have no significant change in RNA transcripts in <italic>hda9</italic> are enriched for various developmental processes and environmental responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). It is possible that the association of HDA9 with the promoters of these developmental genes can rapidly induce the repression of their expression in response to certain internal and/or external signals. Indeed, many photosynthesis-related genes are reported to be upregulated in <italic>hda9</italic> seeds during imbibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Zanten et al., 2014</xref>). Third, HDA9 may act to regulate chromatin structure rather than acting through transcriptional regulation. We found that HDA9 binds 177 chromatin factors, including SWI/SNF chromatin remodelers, ATP-dependent helicases, methyl DNA binding proteins, Tudor/PWWP/MBT superfamily proteins, and WD-40 proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3âsource data 1C</xref>). Fourth, HDA9 may be recruited to the promoters of active genes to prevent promiscuous cryptic transcription as suggested by mammalian and maize studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, some of the HDA9 enriched loci may not be its <italic>bona fide</italic> targets. Further experiments will be required to determine the precise function and mechanism of HDA9 in the regulation of its target genes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Molecular action of PWR on HDA9 activity in leaf senescence</title><p>Our results suggest that HDA9, PWR and the WRKY53 transcription factor form a previously unknown complex that promotes leaf senescence. This complex may be analogous to HDAC3-SMRT/N-CoR repressor complex in animals. Although the function of HDAC3-SMRT/N-CoR in various cellular processes (e.g. development, differentiation, and diseases) has been well studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Karagianni and Wong, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shahbazian and Grunstein, 2007</xref>), its role in cellular senescence and aging remains unclear in mammals. Our ChIP assay showed that PWR and HDA9 are enriched at the same loci, and HDA9 binding to these loci requires PWR in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">FigureÂ 6âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). This is consistent with the role of SMRT/N-CoR in targeting HDAC3 to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guenther et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Karagianni and Wong, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">You et al., 2013</xref>). SMRT/N-CoR has an additional function in stimulating HDAC3 deacetylase activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guenther et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Watson et al., 2012</xref>). Despite extensive testing, we have been unable to find in vitro conditions that allow theÂ robust HDA9 deacetylase activity. Thus, it remains to be determined whether PWR promotes HDA9 catalytic activity. On the other hand, we discovered a potential role of PWR in HDA9 nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Contrast to a previous study showing that HDA9 predominantly localized in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kang et al., 2015</xref>), we found a significant fraction of HDA9 protein is present in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Such difference in observation may be due to the fact that mature leaves were examined in our experiment whereas the 10-day-old seedlings were used in the previous study. It will be interesting to examine whether HDA9 localizes differently in the cell during the different developmental stages.</p><p>PWR was previously reported to promote the expression of several miRNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yumul et al., 2013</xref>). MiRNA is also implicated in leaf senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Humbeck, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huo et al., 2015</xref>). We wonder whether the induction of senescence by PWR also partially depends on miRNA pathways. Although we cannot completely rule out this possibility, several lines of evidence suggest it is less likely. First, the expression of miRNA genes reported in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yumul et al., 2013</xref>) is not affected in <italic>hda9</italic> mutants according to our RNA-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 5âsource data 1</xref>). Second, <italic>hda9 pwr</italic> double mutant shows no further delay in leaf senescence than any of the <italic>hda9</italic> or <italic>pwr</italic> single mutants, suggesting that PWR and HDA9 act through the same pathway in promoting leaf senescence. Additionally, senescence-related genes regulated by HDA9 and PWR are largely the same group of genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 5âsource data 3</xref>). Thus, PWR promotes leaf senescence likely through its functional interaction with HDA9.</p><p>Taken together, our data provide molecular insights into the function and mechanism of how HDA9-PWR-WRKY53 complex integrates and coordinates multiple signaling pathways to regulate global gene expression during leaf senescence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant materials</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0) was used as wild type (WT) for all experiments.

Your article has been evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior Editor) and two reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>As you will see, both of the reviewers expressed concerns about how the data were interpreted in the manuscript, as well as the lack of supporting evidence for some conclusions. The reviewer 1 also pointed out a serious disconnect between the genome-wide data sets and the specific analysis for genes related to leaf senescence. These issues significantly weakened the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Chen et al. used combined biochemical, genomic, genetic and molecular approaches to implicate a SANT domain protein and a histone deacetylase in joint promotion of senescence. In addition, a WRKY transcription factor is implicated in tethering the co-repressor complex to target loci. Regulation of chromatin modifying enzyme activity is a topic of broad general interest of relevance for development and response to the environment alike. My enthusiasm for this study was dampened however by the lack of logical overlap between the individual findings as outlined below.</p><p>1) My biggest concern is that none of the genome-wide datasets produced are linked to the detailed molecular analyses. The authors identify 277 genes that are upregulated in both <italic>hda9</italic> and <italic>pwr</italic> mutants and then go on to study in detail the impact of HDA9 and PWR on four genes with a role in leaf senescence (WRKY57, APG9, CAT1, NPX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>)). However, none of these four genes are actually in the 277 gene list. I found <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> in particular very misleading in this regard. This begs the question what the purpose of the genomic datasets presented is â if in the end known candidate genes are studied. In addition, when I checked which of the 277 genes upregulated in both <italic>hda9</italic> and <italic><underline>pwr</underline></italic> are direct HDA9 targets, I found that only roughly one third are (91 genes). Given that HDA9 binds 8000/24000 loci, the 277 gene list is thus not enriched in HDA9-bound genes. Likewise, the genes upregulated in <italic>hda9</italic> mutants are not enriched in HDA9 bound loci.</p><p>2) This leads me to the second concern. Surprisingly the authors find that âgenome-wide â HDA9 binds to actively expressed genes, most of which are not differentially expressed in <italic>hda9</italic> mutants. While the latter can be attributed to redundantly acting HDACs, this nevertheless raises the question why HDA9 is present at active loci. Of note, the authors also report a global reduction in two active marks H3K9ac and H3K27ac in <italic>hda9</italic> mutants on Westerns. One explanation could be that HDA9 resides at genomic loci in an inactive, latent form that needs to be activated or unblocked to have enzymatic activity. Another possibility is that HDA9 binding may prevent binding of other, more active HDAs, to these loci. In either case, one would expect high levels of H3K9ac or H3K27ac at the HDA9 bound highly expressed loci. This should be tested- either genome-wide or at select HDA9 targets in this category. If indeed H3K9ac and H3K27ac levels are high at HDA9-bound loci, HDA9 binding is not directly linked to altered transcriptional output. A complementary approach, monitoring changes in histone acetylation levels genome-wide in <italic>hda9</italic> and <italic>pwr</italic> mutants relative to the WT, might also help to understand the role of HDA9 in gene regulation.</p><p>3) The title claims that PWR recruits HDA9 to chromatin. This conclusion needs further supporting data â for example PWR binding to the same region as HDA9 on HDA9 targets on the basis of ChIP -, given that HDA9-FLA levels are reduced in the nucleus of <italic><underline>pwr</underline></italic> plants, It seems the authors have tagged PWR plant lines in hand.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript titled &quot;POWERDRESS recruits HISTONE DEACETYLASE 9 to chromatin to promote ageing in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>&quot;, the authors identified physical association between histone deacetylase HDA9 and PWR and characterized their function by new genome-wide analysis including ChIP-seq and RNA-seq. These results suggest that PWR recruits HDA9 to its genomic targets and functions to promote leaf senescence associated with age and darkness through transcription factor WRKY53.</p><p>This manuscript reports a novel function for HDA9 and PWR in regulating leaf senescence associated with age and darkness in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and should be of interest for the readers of <italic>eLife</italic>. Overall the experiments were well designed and executed. The data presented are clear and support their conclusions. However, there are a few issues that should be further clarified before the manuscript is accepted for publication.</p><p>1) After the HDA9 ChIP-seq and <italic>hda9</italic>â RNA-seq analysis, the authors found that 95% of genes bound by HDA9 did not change gene expression when HDA9 is deleted. The authors interpreted it as either HDA9 is not a primary regulator of transcription for the majority of its targets or it is insufficient to regulate transcription. I think that it is most likely that gene expressions are regulated and repressed by multiple redundant or parallel repressors and eliminating one of them is usually not enough to derepress and activate transcription. There are such examples clearly described in yeast between HDAC Rpd3 and chromatin remodeling enzyme Isw2 (Fazzio et al., MCB, 2001).</p><p>2) The authors identified WRKY binding motif in HDA9 target sites. However, it is not clear whether the &quot;target sites&quot; simply means HDA9 ChIP-seq peak or it means those genes that both have HDA9 ChIP-seq peaks and altered gene expression in <italic>hda9</italic>. In either case, the exact numbers of genes containing the WRKY binding motif should be given with a p-value.</p><p>3) The authors compared the up-regulated and down-regulated genes in <italic>hda9</italic> and <italic>pwr</italic> mutants and found substantial overlaps. Fisher's exact test p-values should be given for this analysis to show whether the overlap was significantly higher than by chance.</p><p>4) The authors showed four genes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> as &quot;direct targets&quot; of HDA9. What exactly does it mean? Does it mean both HDA9 ChIP-seq peak and increased expression in <italic>hda9</italic> by RNA-seq?</p><p>5) Since the model is PWR recruiting HDA9 to target genes, one would predict that genes with both HDA9 ChIP-seq peaks and up-regulated by <italic>hda9</italic> mutation should show higher chance of PWR binding. This would provide further support for the model if proven true.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;POWERDRESS recruits HISTONE DEACETYLASE 9 to chromatin to promote aging in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and 1 reviewer.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined in the review below. Point 1 cannot really be addressed, however, given your response to the previous comments and the clarification of candidate gene selection criteria now added to the manuscript, it will be fine to leave it as is. Please pay attention to address the points 2 and 3 in your revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The revised manuscript is much improved by the additional data included.</p><p>I have a couple of comments and clarifications for the points I had raised before.</p><p>1) Overlap of genome-wide and gene-specific analyses</p><p>The new logic presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref> clarifies things. The fact remains that the authors elected to focus on three genes, of which, on the basis of the genome-wide analyses, two are direct HDA9 targets (bound and upregulated in <italic>hda9</italic>) and one of the two is also upregulated in <italic>pwr</italic> mutants (NPX1).</p><p>2) Role of HDA9 at active loci. Adding the H3K27ac ChIPseq strengthens the manuscript and, in particular, helps solidify the link between PWR and HDA9. In addition, HDA9 bound genes have higher H3K27ac than nonbound genes, supporting the idea that HDA9 resides at active loci. In <italic>hda9</italic> and <italic>pwr</italic> mutants there is perhaps a stronger increase in H3K27ac at HDA9 bound loci than at nonbound loci. Is that true? This could be tested statistically. One remaining question is how do the changes in H3K27ac in the mutant compared to the wild type link to the changes in gene expression in the same genetic backgrounds? The authors should include a Venn diagram for the overlap between genes bound by HDA9, upregulated in <italic>hda9</italic> and genes with significantly increased H3K27ac in <italic>hda9</italic>. This is very easily done with the available data.</p><p>Also, I apologize for a typo in my comment: should have read &quot; a global increase in two active marks&quot;.</p><p>3) PWR recruits HDA9. The additional PWR ChIP data is nice. However, the authors need to rephrase their conclusions. Nuclear HDA9 levels are reduced in <italic>pwr</italic> (HDA9-FLAG <italic>hda9 pwr</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), the genetic background used for ChIP-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Because the nuclear HDA9 levels are lower it is not clear whether the reduced HDA9 chromatin occupancy in pwr is due to failure to import HDA9 into the nucleus, failure to recruit HDA9 to genomic loci or both.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17214.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>[â¦]</italic></p><p><italic>As you will see, both of the reviewers expressed concerns about how the data were interpreted in the manuscript, as well as the lack of supporting evidence for some conclusions.

Likewise, the genes upregulated in hda9 mutants are not enriched in HDA9 bound loci.</italic></p><p>We appreciate these comments and apologize for the confusion. Of the four selected genes, <italic>NPX1</italic> (AT5G63320) is indeed among the 277 genes that are upregulated in both <italic>hda9</italic> and <italic>pwr</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 5âsource data 3</xref>). We chose specific genes for further studies when they fulfilled all three of the following criteria: a) they are bound by HDA9 by ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3âsource data 1</xref>); b) they are significantly upregulated in <italic>hda9</italic> by RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 5âsource data 1</xref>); and c) their roles in leaf senescence. Thus, our molecular analysis would be on HDA9 directly bound targets that had a transcriptional response in the senescence phenotype. Using these three criteria, we narrowed down to 11 genes and focused on four genes (<italic>WRKY57</italic>, <italic>APG9, CAT1, NPX1</italic>) for further investigation. We have now presented this selection strategy as a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1F</xref> for clarity. Three genes (<italic>WRKY57</italic>, <italic>APG9, NPX1</italic>) are also upregulated in the <italic>pwr</italic> mutant. While <italic>NPX1</italic> is significantly upregulated (Studentâs t test, p&lt;0.05), <italic>WRKY57</italic> and <italic>APG9</italic> are not defined to be significant based on our significance criteria. Thus, we performed RT-qPCR to further confirm their upregulation in <italic>pwr</italic> with additional biological replicates(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).</p><p>We believe that HDA9, like the other HDACs, is involved in many pathways. Leaf senescence is one of its multiple roles. The 277 genes upregulated in both <italic>hda9</italic> (total of 782, 35%) and <italic>pwr</italic> (total of 887, 31%) are indeed significant (Fisherâs exact test, p&lt;2.2e-16). Our GO analysis of differentially expressed genes in both <italic>hda9</italic> and <italic>pwr</italic> shows their significant enrichment in senescence related pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1H</xref>), consistent with our phenotypic and molecular analyses of HDA9 and PWR function in leaf senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Thus, we feel that our genomic data is useful to guide the functional studies.</p><p>The fact that 91 out of 277 genes (~33%) upregulated in both <italic>hda9</italic> and <italic>pwr</italic> are direct HDA9 targets is intriguing as HDA9 binds and regulates many transcription and chromatin factors, thus HDA9 may be at the top of a regulatory network (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3âsource data 1</xref>). Two-third of these 277 upregulated genes may be indirectly regulated by HDA9 via these factors.</p><p>We agree with this review that upregulated genes in <italic>hda9</italic> are not significantly enriched in HDA9-bound genes. As discussed in this manuscript, 95% of ~8,000 HDA9 binding genes do not exhibit a significant change in gene expression. We have further clarified it in our Discussion section, as illustrated below.</p><p>âAnalogous to reports on mammalian and maize HDACs (Wang et al. 2009; Yang et al. 2016), our ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses also reveals that the majority of HDA9 bound genes do not alter gene expression when HDA9 is deleted. [â¦]It is possible that other HDACs (e.g. HDA6 and HDA19) or transcriptional repressors function redundantly with HDA9 to regulate gene expression, and thus loss of HDA9 itself is insufficient to release the transcriptional repression of its targets.â.</p><p><italic>2) This leads me to the second concern. Surprisingly the authors find that âgenome-wide â HDA9 binds to actively expressed genes, most of which are not differentially expressed in hda9 mutants. While the latter can be attributed to redundantly acting HDACs, this nevertheless raises the question why HDA9 is present at active loci. Of note, the authors also report a global reduction in two active marks H3K9ac and H3K27ac in hda9 mutants on Westerns. One explanation could be that HDA9 resides at genomic loci in an inactive, latent form that needs to be activated or unblocked to have enzymatic activity.

A complementary approach, monitoring changes in histone acetylation levels genome-wide in hda9 and pwr mutants relative to the WT, might also help to understand the role of HDA9 in gene regulation.</italic></p><p>As suggested, we generated H3K27ac ChIP-seq in <italic>hda9</italic> and <italic>pwr</italic> mutants and showed global increase of H3K27ac in both mutants compared to the WT. These new data have been included in the Results section, as illustrated below.</p><p>âConsistent with immunoblotting, we identified 11,372 and 7,687 H3K27ac increased peaks in <italic>hda9</italic> and <italic>pwr</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). [â¦] Together, these results suggest that PWR and HDA9 mediate deacetylation of H3K27ac at similar genomic regions.â</p><p>We do not know exactly why HDA9 binds to the promoters of actively expressed genes.

[â¦] It is possible that other HDACs (e.g. HDA6 and HDA19) or transcriptional repressors function redundantly with HDA9 to regulate gene expression, and thus loss of HDA9 itself is insufficient to release the transcriptional repression of its targets.â</p><p><italic>2) The authors identified WRKY binding motif in HDA9 target sites. However, it is not clear whether the &quot;target sites&quot; simply means HDA9 ChIP-seq peak or it means those genes that both have HDA9 ChIP-seq peaks and altered gene expression in hda9. In either case, the exact numbers of genes containing the WRKY binding motif should be given with a p-value.</italic></p><p>We apologize for the confusion. We have clarified it in the text that the DNA-binding motifs were identified based on the HDA9 binding sequences. We have also added the p-value in the text as following: â1,328 HDA9 binding peaks (14%, p=1.9e-8) showed the significant enrichment of W-box motif (TTGAC/T), recognized by WRKY family transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), consistent with our observation that WRKY53 is co-purified with HDA9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, C</xref>).â</p><p><italic>3) The authors compared the up-regulated and down-regulated genes in hda9 and pwr mutants and found substantial overlaps. Fisher's exact test p-values should be given for this analysis to show whether the overlap was significantly higher than by chance.</italic></p><p>As suggested, we have added Fisherâs exact test p-value in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> (p&lt;2.2e-16) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> (p&lt;2.2e-16).</p><p><italic>4) The authors showed four genes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> as &quot;direct targets&quot; of HDA9. What exactly does it mean? Does it mean both HDA9 ChIP-seq peak and increased expression in hda9 by RNA-seq?</italic></p><p>Direct targets represent the genes that are bound by HDA9 by ChIP-seq and are upregulated in <italic>hda9</italic> by RNA-seq. We have clarified it in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) Since the model is PWR recruiting HDA9 to target genes, one would predict that genes with both HDA9 ChIP-seq peaks and up-regulated by hda9 mutation should show higher chance of PWR binding. This would provide further support for the model if proven true.</italic></p><p>Thanks for the suggestions. We have added new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> by performing PWR-FLAG ChIP-qPCR in different genomic regions of HDA9 targets as well as testing PWR enrichment in 11 randomly chosen HDA9 bound loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Additionally, we performed H3K27ac in <italic>pwr</italic> and compared the H3K27ac levels of HDA9 bound genes over non-HDA9 bound genes andfound that <italic>pwr</italic> induced H3K27 hyperacetylation is correlated with genome-wide HDA9 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

The fact remains that the authors elected to focus on three genes, of which, on the basis of the genome-wide analyses, two are direct HDA9 targets (bound and upregulated in hda9) and one of the two is also upregulated in pwr mutants (NPX1).</italic></p><p>Please see our previous responses.</p><p><italic>2) Role of HDA9 at active loci. Adding the H3K27ac ChIPseq strengthens the manuscript and, in particular, helps solidify the link between PWR and HDA9. In addition, HDA9 bound genes have higher H3K27ac than nonbound genes, supporting the idea that HDA9 resides at active loci. In hda9 and pwr mutants there is perhaps a stronger increase in H3K27ac at HDA9 bound loci than at nonbound loci. Is that true? This could be tested statistically. One remaining question is how do the changes in H3K27ac in the mutant compared to the wild type link to the changes in gene expression in the same genetic backgrounds? The authors should include a Venn diagram for the overlap between genes bound by HDA9, upregulated in hda9 and genes with significantly increased H3K27ac in hda9. This is very easily done with the available data.</italic></p><p><italic>Also, I apologize for a typo in my comment: should have read &quot; a global increase in two active marks&quot;.</italic></p><p>Thanks for the suggestions. Indeed, we found that HDA9 bound genes showed a significantly stronger increase of H3K27ac relative to non-HDA9 bound genes in both <italic>hda9</italic> and <italic>pwr</italic> (p&lt;2.2e-16) as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>.</p><p>As suggested, we performed the overlap analysis between HDA9 ChIP-seq, <italic>hda9</italic> RNA-seq, and <italic>hda9</italic> H3K27ac ChIP-seq datasets.

However, the authors need to rephrase their conclusions. Nuclear HDA9 levels are reduced in pwr (HDA9-FLAG hda9 pwr <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), the genetic background used for ChIP-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Because the nuclear HDA9 levels are lower it is not clear whether the reduced HDA9 chromatin occupancy in pwr is due to failure to import HDA9 into the nucleus, failure to recruit HDA9 to genomic loci or both.</italic></p><p>We appreciate this comment and have changed the title to âPOWERDRESS interacts with HISTONE DEACETYLASE 9 to promote aging in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>â.
