Animals lay down these plans as embryos, when signaling molecules bind to receptors on the surface of their cells.</p><p>These signaling molecules include related proteins called “Nodal” and “Growth and Differentiation Factors”. However, there has been much debate in the field of developmental biology about whether these proteins work together or independently during the early development of vertebrates.</p><p>Zebrafish are often used to study animal development, and Bisgrove et al. decided to test whether these fish need a Growth and Differentiation Factor known as Gdf3 by deleting it using genome editing. It turns out that zebrafish can survive and develop as normal without the gene for Gdf3, just as long as their mothers still had a working copy of the gene. Yet, when the offspring of mutant females did not inherit the instructions to make Gdf3 from their mothers, they died within a couple of days. This was true even if the offspring inherited a working copy of the gene from their fathers. Bisgrove et al. then went on to show that embryos from a mutant mother could be saved with an injection of short-lived RNA molecules that include the instructions to make some Gdf3 proteins. The injected mutant embryos could live to adulthood. This shows that Gdf3 is only needed during the embryo’s early development.</p><p>Further experiments suggested that Gdf3 does cannot activate its receptors on its own. Instead, it is likely that Gdf3 interacts with Nodal to form a two-protein complex that activates the receptors. Two other groups of researchers have independently reported similar findings.</p><p>Mutations affecting proteins very similar to Gdf3 have been found in people with congenital heart defects. By revealing the interaction between Gdf3 and Nodal, these new findings could help scientists to understand the genetic causes of this condition in more detail. Further studies using the mutant zebrafish could also be used to explore the causes of other developmental diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Nodal</kwd><kwd>axis formation</kwd><kwd>patterning</kwd><kwd>Gdf3</kwd><kwd>Vg1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2UM1HL098160</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yost</surname><given-names>H Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Maternal Gdf3 and Nodal are interdependent obligatory cofactors in the fundamental patterning of the vertebrate embryonic axis of zebrafish.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nodal, a member of the TGFβ superfamily of cell-cell signaling ligands, is essential in the establishment of vertebrate axis patterning, both the primary embryonic axis during gastrulation and the orthogonal left-right (LR) asymmetries in heart, brain and gut development. <italic>vg1</italic>, another member of the TGFβ family, was prototypically described as the first-known regionally localized RNA in a vertebrate oocyte, localized to the vegetal pole of the egg, and subsequently in early embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rebagliati et al., 1985</xref>). Humans and other mammals have two <italic>vg1</italic> orthologues, <italic>GDF1</italic> and <italic>GDF3</italic>, and zebrafish have a single orthologue, <italic>gdf3</italic>, previously known as <italic>dvr1</italic>.</p><p>Although <italic>gdf3</italic> (<italic>vg1</italic>) has been a target of considerable study for many years, genetic mutations for functional analysis have not been reported in zebrafish. Studies in <italic>Xenopus</italic> have suggested that maternal Vg1 is required for early zygotic expression of anterior mesendodermal genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Birsoy et al., 2006</xref>). Vg1 has been implicated in early Left-Right patterning, as overexpression of <italic>Xenopus</italic> Vg1 fusion proteins or mouse Gdf1 fusion proteins in specific early cell lineages can fully invert the LR axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hyatt et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hyatt and Yost, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wall et al., 2000</xref>). Vg1 is the only known member of the TGFβ family with this early LR patterning capability. At later stages of development, overexpression or grafts into lateral plate mesoderm that activate TGFβ family member Xenopus Nodal (<italic>Xnr1</italic>) in right lateral plate can also invert asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ohi and Wright, 2007</xref>). In mice, homozygous knockout mutations have altered asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rankin et al., 2000</xref>). In humans, genetic variants in <italic>GDF1</italic> have been implicated in complex congenital heart defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karkera et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), likely to be effects of upstream altered LR patterning. Similar to <italic>vg1</italic> in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, <italic>gdf3</italic> RNA and protein are abundantly stored in the oocyte and early embryo before zygotic gene activation in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Helde and Grunwald, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peterson et al., 2013</xref>). In zebrafish, Kupffer’s vesicle (KV), the ciliated organ of asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Essner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Essner et al., 2002</xref>), contains motile cilia that generate asymmetric fluid flow and LR patterning information that is transmitted to lateral plate mesoderm (LPM), which then conveys LR patterning information to the brain, heart and gut primordia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dasgupta and Amack, 2016</xref>). Zebrafish <italic>gdf3</italic> is expressed in tissues implicated in LR patterning including cells adjacent to the KV, in the LPM and in heart primordia. Morpholino knockdown of <italic>gdf3</italic> results in normal KV structure, KV cilia length and motility, and normal asymmetric KV fluid flow, but disruption of downstream LR patterning in the LPM. Thus, zebrafish Gdf3 was proposed to transmit LR information generated by KV cilia flow to LPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peterson et al., 2013</xref>), and the reasonable expectation was that mutants of <italic>gdf3</italic> in zebrafish would have LR patterning defects.</p><p>We engineered mutants in zebrafish to test the roles of <italic>gdf3</italic>. Surprisingly, homozygous zygotic mutants develop normally and do not show alterations in LR patterning. On the other hand, zebrafish mutants in which the maternal stores of Gdf3 are eliminated have a much more dramatic embryonic lethal phenotype, which we analyzed for a wide range of tissue specification and embryonic patterning pathways. Results from a series of epistasis experiments and cell-lineage targeted rescues of <italic>gdf3</italic> mutants indicate that Gdf3 functions as an obligate co-factor of Nodal, and that Nodal functions as an obligate cofactor of Gdf3. These results indicate that neither Nodal nor Gdf3 can function without the other in fundamental patterning of the vertebrate embryonic axis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Zygotic <italic>gdf3</italic> mutants are viable and fertile</title><p>We generated mutant alleles of <italic>gdf3</italic> by using TALENs designed to target genomic sequences encoding the first few amino acids of the pro-domain of Gdf3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Injection of 100 pg <italic>gdf3</italic> mRNA fully rescued over 90% of the MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> embryos, and these fully rescued embryos could survive until adulthood and survivors were fertile. For example, of 22 rescued MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> embryos selected for an inflated swim bladder at 6 days post-fertilization and raised to adulthood, 14 survived. From those, 5 mating pairs produced clutches of embryos with the MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> phenotype at 24 hpf, demonstrating fertility of both males and females that were derived from Gdf3 null embryos that received only a pulse of WT <italic>gdf3</italic> mRNA shortly after fertilization.</p><p>To assess whether both maternal and paternal contributions to the zygote were necessary for the <italic>MZgdf3</italic> phenotype, we performed reciprocal pairwise crosses of male and female MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> homozygotes to either Z<italic>gdf3</italic> heterozygotes or to wild-type fish and found that the mutant phenotype of the derived embryos was solely dependent on a <italic>gdf3<sup>−/−</sup></italic> maternal genotype; the paternal genome did not alter the phenotype.

There was a substantial decrease in the amount of PCR product from the 1000 cell stage to the 18-somite stage in each genotype, but we were unable to detect any substantial differences among samples prepared from the same time points across the three genotypes indicating that the mutant maternal RNA from MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> embryos was as stable as that from WT embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A,B</xref>).

WT <italic>gdf3</italic> transcript was detected in all stages of WT embryos (lanes C1-3) and was absent from cDNA derived from homozygous MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> embryos (serving to indicate that the WT primers do not amplify the maternal or paternal mutant allele; lanes C7-9). WT transcript was also undetectable in pre-ZGA stage embryos (1000 cell stage, lane 4) derived from a cross of a MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> mutant female by WT male, but was present in cDNA derived from post-ZGA stages (lanes C4, 5). The fact that there is less transcript detected at 90% epiboly and 18 somite stages of embryos derived from a MZ mutant female versus a WT female may reflect perdurance of maternal WT transcript from the WT female, that there is significantly less mesoderm in MZ mutant embryos in which to express gdf3, or that the paternal genome is expressed to a lesser extent in embryos lacking WT maternal transcript (or a combination thereof).

To examine whether TGFβ signaling components downstream of these receptors were functional in MZ<italic>gdf3</italic>, we injected RNAs encoding constitutively active (CA) constructs of <italic>Xenopus</italic> Alk4 and Alk2. Injection of CA-<italic>Alk4</italic> RNA into either WT or MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> embryos caused ectopic expression of both <italic>gsc</italic> and <italic>ta</italic> at shield stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K’, L’, N’, O’</xref>). At 24hpf, injected WT embryos were partially dorsalized, and injected MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> embryos were partially rescued having some notochord present and largely normal anterior morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M’, P’</xref>). Exogenous expression of CA-Alk2 had the effect of slightly reducing the extent of the dorsal margin <italic>gsc</italic> expression domain in WT embryos while the <italic>ta</italic> expression pattern was not noticeably altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Q’, R’</xref>). At 24 hpf, CA-Alk2 caused a severe ventralization of the embryo characterized by loss of dorsal structures such as the notochord, expanded and misshapen somites and a reduction in anterior structures including the brain and eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3S’</xref>). The absence of <italic>gsc</italic> expression in shield stage MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> was not rescued in embryos injected with CA-<italic>Alk2</italic>, but <italic>ta</italic> expression was expanded into the dorsal domain of the margin that normally lacked expression, indicating an expansion of more lateral or ventral mesoderm domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3T’, U’</xref>). Similar to CA-<italic>Alk</italic>2 injected WT embryos, MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> embryos at 24 hpf showed a phenotype consistent with ventralization, having further reduced anterior mesoderm and neural structures including the complete loss of eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3V’</xref>). A marker for ventral mesoderm specification, the transcription factor <italic>eve1</italic>, is expressed in ventral mesoderm during early gastrula stages in zebrafish. Expression of <italic>eve</italic>1 in shield stage embryos of WT or MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> injected with CA-<italic>Alk2</italic> was expanded from the ventral domain into more dorsal regions of the margin (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). These results indicate that the downstream components of the Nodal signaling pathway are intact and capable of activation in MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> mutants, and suggest that Gdf3 acts at the same level in the pathway as Nodal, as an agonist for the activation of Alk4 (Acvr1ba).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Gdf3 and Nodal must be co-expressed in dorsal midline lineages for normal development</title><p>We asked whether there was a lineage-specific requirement for the function of Gdf3 in the Nodal pathway by injecting <italic>gdf3</italic> or <italic>ndr2</italic> RNAs into a single cell at the 4–8 cell stage in WT and MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> embryos, with co-injection of <italic>eGFP</italic> RNA as a lineage tracer.

Strikingly, MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> embryos were only fully rescued when <italic>gdf3</italic>-expressing targeted cells had contributed to midline tissues including the notochord and prechordal plate mesoderm (37 of 131 embryos) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), or in midline and non-midline tissues (62 of 131). When targeted cells were confined to non-midline tissues (32 of 131), ectopic <italic>gdf3</italic> expression rescued only the posterior structures of MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> embryos, including posterior notochord, but did not rescue anterior structures such as the ventral brain and eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Results from analysis of shield stage embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J–Q</xref>) were consistent with the results presented above for 24 hpf embryos, and those presented for 1–2 cell injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Ectopic <italic>gdf3</italic> in wild-type embryos had no effect on expression of the dorsal midline marker <italic>gsc</italic>, irrespective of whether targeted cells were in the dorsal midline (4 of 69 embryos), contiguous and adjacent to the midline <italic>gsc</italic> domain (40 of 69), or not associated with the midline (25 of 69) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J–M</xref>). The ability of ectopic expression of <italic>gdf3</italic> to rescue <italic>gsc</italic> expression in presumptive shield stage MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> embryos was dependent on the location of the targeted cells. <italic>gsc</italic> expression was rescued when targeted cells were either in the midline (10 of 74 embryos, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O</xref>) or contiguous and adjacent to the midline (42 of 74, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4P</xref>).

The lineage-tracing rescue data analyed at shield stage and at 24 hpf correlate well. The proportion of non-rescued embryos is about 1/3 in both cases. The proportion of embryos with targeted cells in the midline at 24 hpf is greater than the proportion of embryos with targeted cells in the dorsal midline at shield stage, most likely due to the convergence of cells toward the midline during gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schier and Talbot, 2005</xref>).</p><p>In WT embryos, confinement of <italic>ndr2</italic>-expressing targeted cells to midline tissues (34 of 118 embryos) gave a relatively mild phenotype that included a kinked notochord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This is in striking contrast to hyperdorsalization phenotypes with extremely disorganized tissues in WT embryos in which targeted cells contributed to non-midline tissues (32 of 118) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), or from ubiquitous <italic>ndr2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3U</xref>). Distribution of <italic>ndr2</italic> targeted cells to subsets of both midline and non-midline tissues (52 of 118) resulted in intermediate phenotypes. When analyzed at the shield stage, in WT embryos <italic>ndr2</italic> induces ectopic expression of <italic>gsc</italic> in sectors that correspond to the targeted cells, regardless of whether targeted cells are located at the dorsal midline (11 of 64 embryos, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4S</xref>), adjacent to the midline (31 of 64, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4T</xref>), or at a location distant from the midline (22 of 64, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4U</xref>). In contrast to the effects of <italic>ndr2</italic> ectopic expression in WT embryos, targeted expression of <italic>ndr2</italic> in MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> embryos by injection at the 4–8 cell stage had no effect, that is, could not rescue, irrespective of whether targeted cells localized to prospective midline or non-midline tissues (n = 53 embryos: 11 midline, 17 non-midline, 25 broad expression) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H,I</xref>).

Zygotic <italic>gdf3</italic> homozygous mutant embryos have no apparent morphological phenotype, and can grow to viable and fertile adults. In contrast, embryos generated from fertilization of a <italic>gdf3</italic>-deficient mutant egg by a wildtype <italic>gdf3+</italic> sperm display the same embryonic lethal MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> mutant phenotype as those fertilized with sperm from a homozygous <italic>gdf3-</italic> mutant father. This indicates that zygotic expression of wildtype <italic>gdf3</italic>, confirmed by allele-specific RT-PCR, from the paternal genome after zygotic gene activation (ZGA, 4.2 hpf) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2014</xref>), is insufficient rescue the MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> mutant phenotype. The inability to rescue the MZ phenotype may reflect the timing and/or levels of zygotic expression. The embryonic lethal MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> phenotype can however, be rescued to grow to viable fertile adults when injected with <italic>gdf3</italic> RNA at the 1 cell to 2 cell stages, supporting the idea that Gdf3 is essential during early embryogenesis.</p><p>Although Vg1/Gdf3 has been implicated in left-right patterning by specific cell lineage-targeting overexpression experiments in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hyatt and Yost, 1998</xref>) and by morpholino knockdown in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peterson et al., 2013</xref>), the zygotic <italic>gdf3</italic> mutants had no discernable alterations in LR patterning. There are several ways to consider the divergent zygotic mutant and morpholino LR phenotypes. First, it is possible that <italic>gdf3</italic> morpholinos had off-target effects. However, the LR phenotype in <italic>gdf3</italic> morphants could be rescued by manipulation of downstream components of the LR pathway. For example, lowering the doses of Charon, thought to be an inhibitor of the transfer of LR information from Kupffer’s vesicle to LPM, rescued <italic>gdf3</italic> morphants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peterson et al., 2013</xref>). If the agent of LR information is an obligate heterodimer of Gdf3 and Nodal, then lowering the dose of the inhibitor of this agent would be expected to rescue the partial knockdown of a component of this agent, Gdf3. Second, it is possible that in this case morpholinos provides a more acute disruption of Gdf3 function during early development, revealing roles for Gdf3 in LR patterning that are masked in the more chronic disruption of function in genetic mutants. The ability of mutants to acquire ‘genetic compensation’ by which some of the functions of a mutation-targeted gene are masked, has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">El-Brolosy and Stainier, 2017</xref>) and is a topic of vigorous discussion. Third, it is possible that maternal stores of Gdf3 persist late enough into embryogenesis to participate in LR patterning and to mask loss of zygotically encoded <italic>gdf3</italic>. The dramatic phenotype of the MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> mutants which includes a loss of lateral plate mesoderm and other tissues involved in the transfer of LR patterning signals and the inability of post-ZGA expressed paternal WT <italic>gdf3</italic> to rescue the MZ phenotype preclude ready assessment of this possible role of <italic>gdf3</italic> in LR patterning.</p><p>The loss of gene expression domains marking, in particular, neural mesodermal and endodermal tissues originating in or near the embryonic shield indicates a central role of Gdf3 in maintaining/promoting embryonic organizer function during gastrulation and is consistent with a role for Gdf3 function in the Nodal signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2003</xref>). The results of exogenous expression of the receptor-promiscuous Activin ligand and constitutively active Alk4 receptors, and their partial rescue of the MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> phenotype, indicates that the TGFβ response pathway is intact in MZ<italic>gdf3</italic>, and that Gdf3 functions upstream of the Alk4 receptor, genetically placing its function at the same level as Nodal. The fact that exogenous Nodal (Ndr1 and Ndr2) could not activate transcription of the mesodermal transcription factors <italic>gsc</italic> or <italic>ta</italic>, nor rescue the loss of midline tissues in MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> indicates that Gdf3 function is an essential factor in the activation of the Nodal signaling pathway, and that addition of Nodal homodimers cannot overcome the deficit of Gdf3.</p><p>Our results indicate that Gdf3 and Nodal must be co-expressed in the prospective dorsal sector of the embryo to drive embryonic patterning. Strikingly, our genetic, epistasis and lineage targeting experiments indicate that either ligand cannot function without the other ligand, so that Gdf3 is an obligate cofactor of Nodal, and Nodal is an obligate co-factor of Gdf3. Members of the Nodal and Gdf families have been shown to co-immunoprecipitate, depending on the assay and the cells in which they are co-expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuerer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peterson et al., 2013</xref>), and co-expression in <italic>Xenopus</italic> animal cap assays induces a stronger and more distant response than either ligand alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>). Combining our genetic results and these previous biochemical experiments, we suggest that the functional ligand for the Nodal signaling pathway during early zebrafish development is an obligate heterodimer of Gdf3/Nodal (Gdf3/Ndr1 and/or Gdf3/Ndr2), and importantly, that homodimers of either Nodal/Nodal or Gdf3/Gdf3 are not functional in early embryonic patterning. There is precedent for this idea from studies of the role of the TGFβ family members <italic>bmp2</italic> and <italic>bmp7</italic> during zebrafish dorsoventral (DV) patterning.

While the varying number of Gdf and Nodal family members between fish and mammals may complicate comparing genetic and biochemical outcomes between mammals and zebrafish, it provides an interesting opportunity to explore the evolution of these co-factors and their signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of <italic>gdf3</italic> mutants</title><p>TALEN nucleases targeting <italic>gdf3</italic> were designed and constructed in conjunction with Timothy Dahlem at the Mutation Generation and Detection Core at the University of Utah (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Maternal Gdf3 is an Obligatory Cofactor in Nodal Signaling for Embryonic Axis Formation in Zebrafish&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript demonstrates that, in zebrafish, maternal expression of Gdf3, the homolog of <italic>Xenopus</italic> Vg1, is required for mesendoderm development and subsequently for specification of the left-right axis. It is notable that Vg1, the mouse homologs Gdf1/3, and zebrafish Gdf3 have been studied before, and that it has already been shown that these factors can bind to Nodal and enhance Nodal function. It has also been shown that Gdf1,3/Vg1 is required for early development, specifically for mesoderm development. The current work expands on these findings, giving more detail on some aspects, and, importantly, uses mutants rather than antisense approaches (as previously used in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and in zebrafish) to reach its conclusions, giving the current work a stronger basis than the prior work. This study will likely represent a useful and important addition for the community, especially regarding future experiments addressing receptor-ligand signaling complexity, the degree to which heterodimer TGFbeta/BMP-type family signaling ligands can move in tissue, their stability, signaling potency, overlap of expression domains as a driver of signaling-instructive functions, etc. In order for the current manuscript to provide this contribution in a definitive fashion, it will be essential for the authors to develop further several elements of their results, interpretation, and presentation, as described below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors claim that the MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> phenotypes are strikingly similar to the phenotypes of MZoep mutants, but further explanation of this similarity is needed to communicate the point clearly to the reader.</p><p>2) The authors do not provide the% rescue spectrum or mutant phenotype spectrum for many of the experimental manipulations. Is it true that 100% of the GDF3 RNA injected embryos are perfect recoveries of the normal phenotype, for example? This should be clarified throughout. In addition, the authors should comment on the variability in the severity of the phenotype between panels: the embryo in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, for example, is less severe than the embryo in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>. lefty1 over expression in the mutant appears to produce a more severe phenotype than the mutant alone, especially with regards to ta expression in panel 3C'. Is this just variability in the phenotype that is within the phenotypic range of nodal complete loss of function or is MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> less severe sometimes?</p><p>3) The authors remark that Vg1 is the &quot;only&quot; ligand that can invert the LR axis. Isn't it the case that Nodal can also invert this axis (Ohi and Wright 2007)?</p><p>4) The authors should examine additional LR asymmetries before concluding there are no LR defects, including analysis of early markers. Analysis of heart looping at 2 dpf is insufficient evidence of normal LR asymmetry establishment.</p><p>5) This early section: [&quot;Morpholino knockdown of <italic>gdf3</italic> results in.… disruption of downstream LR patterning.… zebrafish Gdf3 was proposed to transmit LR information generated by KV cilia flow to LPM (Peterson et al., 2013)&quot;] is poorly reconciled with the later Discussion point [&quot;Although Gdf3 has been implicated in left-right patterning.… by morpholino knockdown in zebrafish (Peterson et al., 2013), the zygotic <italic>gdf3</italic> mutants had no discernable alterations in LR patterning. Although possible, it seems unlikely that maternal stores of Gdf3 persist late enough into embryogenesis to participate in LR patterning.”]. Should it be more clearly raised as possible that the GDF3 morpholino results represent off-target effects? Similarly, how do the authors explain that &quot;In contrast to previous results with morpholinos in zebrafish, zygotic mutants of <italic>gdf3</italic> had normal LR patterning as assessed by scoring heart looping in clutches of embryos derived from heterozygous <italic>gdf3</italic> in-crosses at 48 hours post-fertilization&quot;? Does this represent inhibition of maternal contributions by the morpholinos?</p><p>Also, regarding the statement in the Discussion that &quot;Although possible, it seems unlikely that maternal stores of Gdf3 persist late enough into embryogenesis to participate in LR patterning:&quot; there are multiple examples of maternally loaded transcripts persisting for 2 to 4 dpf, so this isn't so unlikely. The authors should attempt to address the extent of maternal transcript persistence into zygotic development and when its implicated in LR patterning, as discussed.</p><p>6) The authors state that &quot;At 24 hpf, MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> embryos lack a notochord and spinal cord and structures associated with lateral plate mesoderm including the heart, and have greatly reduced anterior neural development reflected in the narrowed brain and reduced eyes,&quot; but this is not clearly shown and could be better supported by additional images and/or histological sections.</p><p>7) The authors state: &quot;To confirm that the MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> phenotype was due to a loss of wild-type <italic>gdf3</italic> gene product, we injected 1-2 cell MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> embryos with <italic>gdf3</italic> RNA and were able to completely rescue the <italic>gdf3</italic>- mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).&quot; Were a number of doses of GDF3 RNA attempted? As mentioned above, what was the spectrum of rescue in preliminary RNA dosing experiments that led to this final dose (100 pg)? If there are always 100% rescues, it would be important to add explanation of this to the paper; for example by stating that anything close to 100 pg capped synthetic RNA would work because the embryonic patterning response is controlled, essentially, by the expression domains and titers of Nodal ligand genes, such that ectopic GDF3 RNA alone cannot really have any signaling effect.</p><p>8) Regarding the RT-PCR included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>: This is not a quantitative assay and is lacking in internal controls, so the assertions about transcript levels may not be correct. If the authors did qRT PCR they could show that the transcript levels were the same. Without qPCR, the conclusion needs softening. Also, the assay does not discriminate between maternal and paternal alleles, which could very easily be done by using allele specific primers. A primer specific to the mutant deletion allele would identify the maternal allele, while a primer specific to the WT allele would identify the paternal allele. Using these primers in a quantitative assay would allow the authors to definitively address the extent of the maternal and zygotic contributions, and in a non-quantitative assay could address the question of when zygotic transcription of <italic>gdf3</italic> initiates. Considering the lack of a LR defect in zygotic mutants, it is possible that maternal <italic>gdf3</italic> persists that can heterodimerize with Nodal to specify the LR axis, so this is important to address.</p><p>9) <italic>lft1</italic> and <italic>lft2</italic> expression was examined at 90% epiboly, a timepoint long after they function in regulating mesendoderm formation, so results at this stage cannot be used to indicate that lefty is not overexpressed and the cause of the loss of mesendoderm. The authors should either test earlier stage embryos or omit this conclusion.</p><p>10) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the midline expression vs. non midline expression is not readily apparent. The use of the lateral view and the stage displayed do not make midline vs. non midline expression obvious. The authors should either show higher magnifications in addition to the current images or midline expression during gastrulation stages, so that it is clear whether the expression is in the midline. Also, the authors remark that the embryo in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> is mostly &quot;undifferentiated mesoderm&quot; without showing evidence for this.</p><p>11) The authors remark that &quot;Expression of dvr1 RNA in a portion of the blastoderm of MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> was also capable of rescuing <italic>gsc</italic> expression in shield stage embryos (data not shown).&quot; These data should be included in the supplement.</p><p>12) The first sentence of Discussion states &quot;Gdf3 is required during the first few hours of embryonic development, before zygotic gene activation,&quot; but no evidence in the results is provided for a function prior to zygotic gene activation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Maternal Gdf3 is an Obligatory Cofactor in Nodal Signaling for Embryonic Axis Formation in Zebrafish&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Didier Stainier (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>All of the reviewers agreed that the manuscript has been improved through revision; however, there are still some remaining points that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The authors cannot state that Gdf3 function is required prior to ZGA without actually testing the timing of its FUNCTION. Just because <italic>gdf3</italic> is expressed maternally and its function depends on this maternal expression does not mean that it functions prior to zygotic genome activation. Many maternal transcripts persist beyond ZGA and function AFTER ZGA. This is an incorrect assumption on the authors' part and the text should be adjusted accordingly. If Gdf3 functions exclusively with Nodal in mesendoderm development and Nodal function is strictly zygotic, then that also supports a role for Gdf3 post-ZGA.</p><p>2) Related to the claim made in the second paragraph of the Discussion: It seems that the post-ZGA paternal <italic>gdf3</italic> expression is minimal and may be below its normal WT level based on the non-quantitative RT-PCR performed in MZ mutant embryos. This is reflected in the Results section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C</xref>, lanes 4 and 5), which qualitatively shows much lower levels of WT <italic>gdf3</italic> via RT-PCR at the 1000-cell stage and the 18-somite stage. The authors use this evidence (subsection “The maternal genome, not the paternal genome, dictates the phenotype of embryos”, last paragraph) to conclude that WT zygotic <italic>gdf3</italic> expression cannot rescue. However, it seems likely (this again is not a quantitative assay) that <italic>gdf3</italic> is expressed at lower levels in MZ embryos than WT embryos. This is mostly relevant to the LR function of <italic>gdf3</italic> and whether zygotic expression could potentially rescue the LR defect in MZ<italic>gdf3</italic> mutants. The authors should modify the text to reflect this point.</p><p>3) It was difficult to determine if the authors feel that Nodal-GDF heterodimers are as likely to play a role in zygotic stages in mammalian embryos (there being &quot;probably&quot; less maternal deposition in a mouse embryo, for example). The authors might feel that they have already covered this objectively, but it would be helpful if they could explicitly state whether they think that the evidence from mouse mutants created so far is consistent or inconsistent with this really fascinating story from zebrafish.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28534.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors claim that the MZgdf3 phenotypes are strikingly similar to the phenotypes of MZoep mutants, but further explanation of this similarity is needed to communicate the point clearly to the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>Done: We have expanded the description and comparison to the nodal-pathway mutant phenotypes (paragraph 9 in Results section) and referenced <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> for more detailed phenotypic analyses (also, see response to Essential revisions #6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors do not provide the% rescue spectrum or mutant phenotype spectrum for many of the experimental manipulations.

This indicates that wildtype Gdf3 expressed from the paternal genome after zygotic gene activation (ZGA, 4.2 hpf) (Lee et al., 2014) is not sufficient to rescue the mutant phenotype.” In stark contrast to <italic>the failure to rescue</italic> by post-ZGA expression, the <italic>MZgdf3</italic> egg can be rescued by pre-ZGA expression via mRNA injection.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All of the reviewers agreed that the manuscript has been improved through revision; however, there are still some remaining points that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The authors cannot state that Gdf3 function is required prior to ZGA without actually testing the timing of its FUNCTION. Just because gdf3 is expressed maternally and its function depends on this maternal expression does not mean that it functions prior to zygotic genome activation. Many maternal transcripts persist beyond ZGA and function AFTER ZGA. This is an incorrect assumption on the authors' part and the text should be adjusted accordingly. If Gdf3 functions exclusively with Nodal in mesendoderm development and Nodal function is strictly zygotic, then that also supports a role for Gdf3 post-ZGA.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, we cannot definitively state that Gdf3 functions pre-ZGA. We have modified the first sentence of the Discussion to reflect this. Nodal function in zebrafish is not strictly zygotic – this has been discussed in more detail in the final paragraph of the Discussion. (Also addresses reviewer comment 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to the claim made in the second paragraph of the Discussion: It seems that the post-ZGA paternal gdf3 expression is minimal and may be below its normal WT level based on the non-quantitative RT-PCR performed in MZ mutant embryos. This is reflected in the Results section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C</xref>, lanes 4 and 5), which qualitatively shows much lower levels of WT gdf3 via RT-PCR at the 1000-cell stage and the 18-somite stage. The authors use this evidence (subsection “The maternal genome, not the paternal genome, dictates the phenotype of embryos”, last paragraph) to conclude that WT zygotic gdf3 expression cannot rescue. However, it seems likely (this again is not a quantitative assay) that gdf3 is expressed at lower levels in MZ embryos than WT embryos. This is mostly relevant to the LR function of gdf3 and whether zygotic expression could potentially rescue the LR defect in MZgdf3 mutants. The authors should modify the text to reflect this point.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises the possibility that there is less paternal <italic>gdf3</italic> expression in embryos derived from MZ mutant versus WT females. This may be the case. The higher levels of expression in WT embryos versus Gdf3-/- X WT embryos during the ages where paternal expression is expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C</xref>, lanes 2, 3 versus lanes 4, 5) may also reflect signal from maternal RNA from the WT female that has perdured into later stages, in addition to transcript from the paternal genome. It is also important to note that much of the mesoderm that normally expresses zygotic <italic>gdf3</italic> is missing in embryos derived from MZ mutant eggs, so it would not be surprising that less transcript is generated than in wildtype with abundant mesoderm.</p><p>We have amended the text in the Results (subsection “The maternal genome, not the paternal genome, dictates the phenotype of embryos”, last paragraph) to reflect these possibilities.</p><p>The complete loss of lateral plate mesoderm and other tissues essential for the transfer of LR patterning information precludes any assessment of rescue of LR patterning in MZgdf3 mutants.</p><p>We have added statements to the Discussion to clarify this (paragraph 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It was difficult to determine if the authors feel that Nodal-GDF heterodimers are as likely to play a role in zygotic stages in mammalian embryos (there being &quot;probably&quot; less maternal deposition in a mouse embryo, for example). The authors might feel that they have already covered this objectively, but it would be helpful if they could explicitly state whether they think that the evidence from mouse mutants created so far is consistent or inconsistent with this really fascinating story from zebrafish.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added statements to the final paragraph of the Discussion which more clearly address the specific contributions of each of the Gdf and Nodal paralogues in mice and zebrafish and referenced the relevant mutant studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
