Here, we identify bile acids as natural ligands for MRGPRX4. MRGPRX4 is expressed in human dorsal root ganglion (hDRG) neurons and co-expresses with itch receptor HRH1. Bile acids elicited Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in cultured hDRG neurons, and bile acids or a MRGPRX4 specific agonist induced itch in human subjects. However, a specific agonist for another bile acid receptor TGR5 failed to induce itch in human subjects and we find that human TGR5 is not expressed in hDRG neurons. Finally, we show positive correlation between cholestatic itch and plasma bile acids level in itchy patients and the elevated bile acids is sufficient to activate MRGPRX4. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that MRGPRX4 is a novel bile acid receptor that likely underlies cholestatic itch in human, providing a promising new drug target for anti-itch therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>MRGPRX4</kwd><kwd>bile acids</kwd><kwd>orphan GPCR</kwd><kwd>chronic itch</kwd><kwd>cholestasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Department of the Central Committee of the CPC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Junior Thousand Talents Program of China</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yulong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chinese Institute for Brain Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z181100001518004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yulong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006920</institution-id><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Internal funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Wenqin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Bile acid and it's receptor MRGPRX4, but not TGR5, is one of the ligand-receptor pairs for chronic itch in patients with liver diseases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic itch, or pruritus, is a severe and potentially debilitating clinical feature associated with many dermatological and systemic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koch et al., 2018</xref>), severely affecting quality of life and potentially leading to lassitude, fatigue, and even depression and suicidal tendencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tajiri and Shimizu, 2017</xref>). The most well-characterized itch receptors are the H1 and H4 histamine receptors (HRH1 and HRH4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thurmond et al., 2008</xref>). Although antihistamines, which act by inhibiting histamine receptors, are generally effective at relieving itch symptoms induced by inflammation and allergens, these compounds are usually ineffective at treating chronic itch caused by systemic diseases and most skin disorders. To date, no effective treatment is available for treating histamine-resistant itch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tajiri and Shimizu, 2017</xref>).</p><p>A high percentage of patients with systemic liver failure develop itch with cholestatic symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beuers et al., 2014</xref>). For example, the prevalence of itch is as high as 69% among patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, and severe itch is an indication for liver transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Imam et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, itch occurs in more than half of pregnant woman with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, a condition that has been associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery, perinatal mortality, and fetal distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jenkins and Boothby, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Several medications have been tested for treating cholestatic itch, including ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), cholestyramine, and rifampicin; however, these compounds either are ineffective or induce severe side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Imam et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, safe and effective treatments for cholestatic itch are urgently needed, and identifying the underlying molecular mechanisms—particularly the receptor and ligand—is the essential first step.</p><p>Although the link between cholestasis and itch was first described more than 2000 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kremer et al., 2011</xref>), the detailed mechanisms underlying cholestatic itch remain unidentified. To date, a handful of molecules have been proposed as the pruritogens that mediate cholestatic itch, including bile acids, bilirubin, lysophosphatidic acid, autotaxin, and endogenous opioids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beuers et al., 2014</xref>). With respect to the cognate receptor for the pruritogen, a few receptors have been proposed, albeit based primarily on rodent models. For example, the membrane-bound bile acid receptor TGR5 has been reported to mediate bile acid‒induced itch in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alemi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lieu et al., 2014</xref>). However, a recent study found that administering TGR5-selective agonists failed to elicit an itch response in mouse models of cholestasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cipriani et al., 2015</xref>), and TGR5-specific agonists in recent clinical trials have not been reported to have itch side effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hodge et al., 2013</xref>), raising doubts regarding whether TGR5 is indeed the principal mediator for cholestatic itch. Recently, Meixiong et al. reported that mouse Mrgpra1 and human MRGPRX4 can be activated by bilirubin, a compound that serves as one of the pruritogens in cholestatic itch in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meixiong et al., 2019a</xref>). Meixiong et al. also reported that MRGPRX4 can be activated by bile acids and showed that humanized MRGPRX4 transgenic mice exhibited itch in response to bile acid injection and in a mouse model of cholestasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meixiong et al., 2019b</xref>). However, evidence in demonstrating the direct role of MRGPRX4 in mediating cholestatic pruritus in human subjects is still weak. In addition, whether bile acid receptor TGR5 participates in cholestatic itch in human also remains unclear.</p><p>Through a different strategy, we also identified that MRGPRX4 is the receptor activated by bile acids. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive molecular, cellular, behavioral and clinical evidences that MRGPRX4 is a bile acid receptor for cholestatic itch in human. We specifically focused our search on genes that are selectively expressed in the human dorsal root ganglia (DRG), where the cell bodies of primary itch-sensing neurons are located. Our screening identified that bile acids from bile extract could activate MRGPRX4, one of the G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) highly expressed in human DRGs. We further showed that MRGPRX4 is expressed selectively in a small subset of human DRG neurons, and bile acids directly trigger intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase in human neurons and action potentials in MRGPRX4 transfected rat DRG neurons. In addition, intradermal injection of both bile acids and the MRGPRX4-specific agonist nateglinide induce detectable itch in human subjects, and this bile acid-induced itch is histamine-independent. We also investigated the role of another bile acid receptor, TGR5, in cholestatic itch in human. Surprisingly, application of specific agonist for TGR5, previously implicated in cholestatic itch in mice, failed to elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in cultured hDRG neurons, nor did it induce pruritus in human subjects. In situ hybridization and immunostaining results revealed that unlike mouse TGR5 (mTGR5) expressing in mouse DRG neurons, hTGR5 is selectively expressed in satellite glial cells, likely accounting for the inter-species difference in function. Finally, we found that plasma bile acid levels are well correlated with itch sensation in cholestatic patients and that this elevated bile acid level is sufficient to activate MRGPRX4. Taken together, our results provide compelling evidence that the ligand-receptor pair of bile acids and MRGPRX4 is likely to be one of the critical mediators for human cholestatic itch.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MRGPRX4 is activated by bile extract</title><p>DRG neurons are primary somatosensory neurons that express a variety of receptors and ion channels for detecting both extrinsic and intrinsic stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belmonte and Viana, 2008</xref>). To identify a receptor in mediating cholestatic itch in human, we reason that this candidate receptor could be expressed in human DRG neurons and activated by bile extracts. Since the majority of itch receptors identified to date belong to the G protein‒coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dong and Dong, 2018</xref>), we analyzed two published transcriptomics datasets compiled from a variety of human tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Flegel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Flegel et al., 2015</xref>), specifically focusing on GPCRs. Among the 332 transcripts that are enriched in the human DRG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), we identified the following seven highest-enriched GPCRs: GPR149, MRGPRX4, GPR139, GPR83, MRGPRE, MRGPRX1, and MRGPRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Next, we cloned and expressed these candidate receptors in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>), finding that all seven receptors were expressed at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). We measured the activation of each receptor by bovine bile extract using two reporter assays, the Gs-dependent luciferase assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hall et al., 2012</xref>) and the Gq-dependent TGFα shedding assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Inoue et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>). No signal was detected with the Gs-dependent luciferase assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Interestingly, bile extract elicited a significant increase in reporter activity in cells expressing MRGPRX4 measured using the TGFα shedding assay, but had no effect on cells expressing the other six GPCRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). These results suggest that MRGPRX4 is activated by one or more compounds present in bile extract, and that MRGPRX4 likely signals through the Gq but not the Gs pathway. Further experiments revealed that bovine, porcine, and human bile extract activate MRGPRX4 to a similar extent in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>); in contrast, extracts obtained from bovine brain, spleen, heart, kidney, and liver tissues induced no detectable signal on MRGPRX4-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that MRGPRX4 is potently activated by bile extract and active compound(s) is/are highly enriched in bile extract.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48431.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MRGPRX4 is activated by bile extract.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Flow chart for the strategy used to identify GPCRs enriched in human DRG.

Here, we systematically test pruritic effect of bile acids on human and whether bile acid- induced itch shows some features similar to that of cholestatic itch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). We found that 500 μg (25 μl) of DCA induced a significant itch sensation that peaked within 5 min and declined slowly over time; in contrast, control injections with vehicle did not induce an itch response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a1, a2</xref>). Moreover, itch intensity induced by DCA was in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b1, b2</xref>). We also found that less potent MRGPRX4 agonists, including CA, CDCA, taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA), and LCA, also induced a weaker—albeit still significant—itch sensation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c1, c2</xref>). Given that antihistamines are largely ineffective for treating cholestatic itch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beuers et al., 2014</xref>), we tested whether itch induced by bile acids can be blocked by antihistamines. We found that pretreating subjects with an antihistamine prevented histamine-induced itch but had no effect on DCA-induced itch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d1, d2</xref>), suggesting that itch induced by bile acids does not involve histamine signaling. Taken together, these results indicate that bile acids trigger an itch sensation with features similar to cholestatic itch.</p><p>In mice, the membrane bile acid receptor TGR5 has been reported to mediate bile acid‒induced itch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alemi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lieu et al., 2014</xref>). To test whether bile acid-induced itch in human is also mediated by TGR5, we chose a non-bile acid TGR5 agonist compound 15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Högenauer et al., 2014</xref>), which is nearly 70-fold more potent than DCA in activating human TGR5 and does not activate human MRGPRX4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b,c</xref>). Intradermal injections of 10 μg (25 μl) of compound 15 did not induce detectable itch in humans, whereas DCA, as the positive control, induced significant itch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a1, a2, d</xref>). These results suggest that TRG5 is not the receptor mediating bile acid-induced itch. Furthermore, we examined the expression of TGR5 in the human, monkey, and mouse DRG tissues. Very surprisingly, although the amino acid sequence of TGR5 is relatively conserved between rodents and primates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1a</xref>), we found the different expression pattern of TGR5 in DRG tissues. In human and monkey, both in situ hybridization and immunostaining revealed that TGR5 is highly expressed in satellite glial cells surrounding DRG neurons but not the primary sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e,g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1d,e</xref>), while in mouse, the same in situ probe and antibody detected the expression of TGR5 in mouse DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f,h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1c</xref>), similar to the previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alemi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lieu et al., 2014</xref>).

We therefore compared bilirubin and DCA with respect to binding and activating MRGPRX4 in HEK293T cells. We found that compared to bile acids, bilirubin is a less potent, partial agonist of MRGPRX4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a</xref>). Given the structural differences between bilirubin and DCA, we then tested whether bilirubin is an allosteric modulator of MRGPRX4. Indeed, we found that bilirubin can potentiate the activation of MRGPRX4 by DCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9b</xref>), and—conversely—DCA potentiate the activation of MRGPRX4 by bilirubin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9c</xref>). In addition, we also compared the activity of bilirubin and DCA to MRGPRX4 in cultured rat DRG neurons. Similar to the results in HEK293T cells, DCA induced larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in MRGPRX4-expressing neurons compared to bilirubin, and the DCA-responsive neurons was about 2.5-fold more than bilirubin-responsive neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9d–g</xref>).

MRGPRX4 is selectively expressed in a small subset of human DRG neurons. Bile acids triggered a robust Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in a subset of hDRG neurons as well as rat DRG neurons expressing MRGPRX4 exogenously. Both bile acids and an MRGPRX4-specific agonist induced itch in human. Bile acid-induced itch in human wass histamine independent, which is consistent with that antihistamines are largely ineffective for treating cholestatic itch. Surprisingly, application of agonist for TGR5 failed to elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in cultured hDRG neurons, nor did it induce pruritus in human subjects. More interestingly, we found that the expression pattern of TGR5 was different between mouse and human: hTGR5 was selectively expressed in satellite glial cells, while mTGR5 was expressed in DRG neurons, likely accounting for the inter-species difference functionally. We also found that plasma levels of bile acids were well correlated with the itch intensity of itchy patients with liver diseases. Importantly, a mixture of bile acids with components and concentrations similar to that of cholestatic itchy patients—but not healthy volunteers—was sufficient to activate MRGPRX4. Our data indicate that bile acids are the major pruritogens in MRGPRX4-mediated cholestatic itch, while bilirubin facilitates the activation of MRGPRX4 by bile acids and may also contribute to cholestatic itch in pathological conditions.</p><p>Based on all these evidences, we propose a new working model for cholestatic itch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>): patients with cholestasis usually display increased plasma levels of bile acids and bilirubin, which are precipitated in the skin and activate MRGPRX4 in itch-related primary fibers, thereby triggering itch in these patients.

Bilirubin, a yellow compound that causes the yellow discoloration in jaundice, has not been considered a likely candidate pruritogen though, because the clinical observations find that itch often precedes the appearance of jaundice, particularly in patients with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Geenes and Williamson, 2009</xref>) and patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kremer et al., 2011</xref>). Our results suggest that bile acids is full agonist of MRGPRX4, and bilirubin is a partial agonist potentiating the activation of MRGPRX4 by bile acids. This notion is consistent with our finding that the correlation between bile acid levels and itch intensity is stronger than the correlation between bilirubin levels and itch intensity. Based on these findings, we propose that bile acid is the major contributor to cholestatic itch, and bilirubin serves to increase bile acid‒induced cholestatic itch under pathological conditions.</p><p>Here, we provide important evidence that MRGPRX4 is sufficient for mediating bile acid‒induced itch, and thus should play an important role in cholestatic itch. Since specific antagonist for MRGPRX4 is currently unavailable, we could not determine whether MRGPRX4 is necessary for bile acids induced itch in human. Future studies will be designed to further examine the role of MRGPRX4 in cholestatic itch using to-be-developed pharmacological and/or human genetic approaches. For example, several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in the human <italic>MRGPRX4</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lek et al., 2016</xref>), and it would be interesting to screen for loss-of-function and gain-of-function <italic>MRGPRX4</italic> variants. Characterizing the correlation between these functional variants or expression level of MRGPRX4 in DRG neurons with itch intensity in cholestatic patients and healthy subjects with bile acid‒induced itch could help to further delineate the relationship between MRGPRX4 activity and cholestatic itch and explain the observed discrepancy between bile acids levels and cholestatic itch intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beuers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Düll and Kremer, 2018</xref>). These experiments will also help to determine whether MRGPRX4 is the main molecular receptor for mediating cholestatic itch, or whether other GPCRs, such as lysophosphatidic acid receptors and serotonin receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beuers et al., 2014</xref>), and unidentified receptors also play roles in cholestatic itch.</p><p>Our current understandings about mechanisms underlying somatosensation in the mammalian system are mainly derived from studies of rodents. Despite the great value and insights we gained using rodent models, notable failures have happened in translating results obtained in rodents into effective and safe clinical treatments in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hill, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mogil, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hug and Weidner, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taneja et al., 2012</xref>). The bile acid receptors we study here is a great example demonstrating the species differences between rodent and human somatosensory systems. Although TGR5, a bile acid membrane receptor, was previously reported to be expressed in mouse DRG neurons and mediate bile acid‒induced itch in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alemi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lieu et al., 2014</xref>), our expressing characterizations as well as functional assays revealed that TGR5 is not expressed in human DRG neurons and doesn’t directly mediate itch sensation in human. Instead, primate MRGPRX4 gains the novel function of bile acid sensitivity during evolution. Therefore, it is crucial to study and validate the mechanism of cholestatic chronic itch and develop the correspondent treatment within the context of human physiology.</p><p>In summary, we found that the membrane-bound GPCR MRGPRX4 is a novel bile acid receptor and may serve as an important molecular mediator of chronic itch in patients with systemic liver diseases. Our results suggest that MRGPRX4 is a promising molecular target for developing new treatments to alleviate devastating chronic itch in these patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MRGPRX4</td><td valign="top">hORFeome Database</td><td valign="top">Genbank Accession: KJ900052</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">TGR5</td><td valign="top">hORFeome Database</td><td valign="top">Genbank <break/>Accession: KJ895655</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HEK stable cell line for TGFα shedding assay</td><td valign="top">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22983457">22983457</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Self-generated according to reference paper</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Screen Quest Fluo-8 No Wash Calcium Assay Kit</td><td valign="top">AAT Bioquest</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: 36316</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Fluo-8, AM</td><td valign="top">AAT Bioquest</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: 21083</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Deoxycholic acid</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: D2510</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">U73122</td><td valign="top">Selleck</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: S8011</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Nateglinide</td><td valign="top">J and K Scientific</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: 586681</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Bilirubin ditaurate</td><td valign="top">J and K Scientific</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: F-H130</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Compound 15</td><td valign="top">custom- synthesized</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Verified by HPLC <break/>and mass spectrum</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Histamine</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: H7250</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit polyclonal anti-hMRGPRX4</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Cat #: ab120808</td><td valign="top">IHC (1:200)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit polyclonal anti-hTGR5</td><td valign="top">Thermofisher</td><td valign="top">Cat #: PA5-27076 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2544552">AB_2544552</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IHC (1:200-1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse monoclonal <break/>anti-NeuN (clone A60)</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: MAB377 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2298772">AB_2298772</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IHC (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Myc</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: C3956 <break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_439680">AB_439680</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IHC (1:200) <break/>FACS (1:50)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Sheep polyclonal anti-Digoxigenin-AP</td><td valign="top">Roche</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: 11093274910 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2734716">AB_2734716</ext-link></td><td valign="top">ISH (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">RNAscope Fluorescent Multiplex Assay</td><td valign="top">Advanced Cell Diagnostics</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: 320293 UM</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">P3 Primary Cell 4D-NucleofectorTM X Kit L</td><td valign="top">Lonza</td><td valign="top">Cat. #

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Diana M Bautista (Reviewer #3). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work by Yu and colleagues, the authors examine the important question of why patients with liver disease often times develop cholestatic pruritus. Previous studies have shown that bile acids can trigger acute itch in mice via TGR5 signaling in a subset of mouse DRG neurons (Alemi et al., 2013) and that MRGPRX4 is activated by bilirubin (Meixiong et al., 2019) and bile acids (Meixiong et al, 2019). Here the authors probe the molecular mechanisms by which bile acids promote itch in human subjects and DRG neurons. To address the specific receptor for itch-inducing substances, they examined orphan G-protein coupled receptors that are highly expressed in human sensory afferents identified via public expression databases. Specifically, they identified 7 highly expressed GPCRs which they expressed in heterologous cells and assayed for sensitivity to bile extracts using G-protein coupled assays.</p><p>In this approach they focused on MRGPRX4 as a candidate receptor because of its lone sensitivity to bile acids in a Gq-dependent assay. Although this is a significant finding, as the authors point out, MRGPRX4 was recently shown by Meixiong et al. to be activated by bile acids and lead to itch when the human receptor was expressed in mice. Nonetheless, the authors expand upon these and other previous findings to fully define the role of Mrgprx4 in human tissues, as well as identify the specific ligands that may act on this receptor to induce itch. They show that bile acids are more robust activators of MRGPRX4, and itch in human subjects, compared to bilirubin, and that bilirubin potentiates bile acid activation of MRGPRX4. The inclusion of human and primate assays is a strength, as are their findings suggesting a difference in Mrgprx4 function and expression in human versus rodent dorsal root ganglia. Overall this is a comprehensive and well done study that will be of importance to the field.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In Figure 2B the authors focus on fractions 4 and 6 when clearly fractions 2, 3, and 5 have high activity. It is unclear why this was done. Can the authors examine the potential for itch inducing substances in these fractions, or at least confirm that the relevant compound DCA found in fraction 4 is also in these other active fractions?</p><p>2) In Figure 3K the expression of the P180A mutant is clearly 3-fold higher than the other mutants, a point that should be evaluated or discussed.</p><p>3) In addition to the RNAscope representative images in Figure 4F, some examples of the entire section should be displayed showing colocalization of MRGPRX4 with other genes as this is the main method used to define the MRGPRX4 neuronal population.</p><p>4) It's unclear how the representative Fluo-8 images in Figure 4H, left panel, are related to the small pseudocolor images under the traces Figure 4H, right panel. Full pseudocolor images of the DRGs with and without bile acids should be included (same as the format of Figure 4H, left panel).</p><p>5) In prior work, bilirubin was shown to not only trigger calcium influx via MRGPRX4 but also action potential firing in rodent neurons. Does bile acid activation of MRGPRX4 drive excitability of DRG neurons? Since the manuscript only reports relative fluo-8 fluorescence changes, the magnitudes of the bile-acid evoked calcium responses in neurons are unknown. Please discuss this point.</p><p>6) Do adult and embryonic DRG neurons display similar MRGPRX4 expression patterns and bile acid responses? Is the data currently pooled in the summary figures? If so, some statistical analyses should be performed to ensure there are no age-specific differences before combining the data.</p><p>7) The bilirubin modulation data should be included as a main figure in the manuscript.</p><p>8) What antibodies and criteria were used to define satellite glia cells in the IHC experiments?

We have noticed that the fractions 2, 3 and 5 also have high activity. Using <sup>1</sup>H-NMR, we found that fractions 2, 3 also contained the characteristic peaks of bile acids (Figure 2—figure supplement 1), suggesting that the activity may come from the bile acids in these fractions. Due to the limited amount of material, we haven’t been able to test fraction 5 using <sup>1</sup>H-NMR, but we suspect the activity of this fraction may also come from bile acids. We modified text to explain this point in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 3K the expression of the P180A mutant is clearly 3-fold higher than the other mutants, a point that should be evaluated or discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for noticing this finding. In this experiment, we generated stable cell lines expressing wild-type and mutant receptors via piggyBac transposon system. The gene is randomly inserted into the genome of the HEK293T cell lines. Thus, both insertion sites and copy numbers could significantly affect the expression level. The P180A mutant gene might be inserted into a favorable genomic site or multiple copies of the gene might be inserted into the genome, which leads to much higher membrane expression level than WT. Nevertheless, P180A mutant still shows less response to DCA. We hope reviewers could agree that P180 in MRGPRX4 is an important amino acid residue for bile acid sensing. We have added the discussion to the manuscript as the reviewer suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In addition to the RNAscope representative images in Figure 4F, some examples of the entire section should be displayed showing colocalization of MRGPRX4 with other genes as this is the main method used to define the MRGPRX4 neuronal population.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the good suggestion. There is a technical reason we didn’t include the low magnification pictures in the initial submission. MRGPRX4 signals in most positive DRG neurons are rather weak (have ~20 small fluorescent dots, indicated by arrow heads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> and as shown in the Figure 4F of the main text), and it is hard to tell a real positive neuron from background (big fluorescent dots positive for all three channels (indicated by arrows), which unfortunately exist for RNAscope in situ technique, especially for the weak probe channel) at the low magnification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> upper row). We thus mostly took high magnification images to be sure. Therefore, we have included a large-scale image of the DRG section, in which triple RNAscope in situ hybridization of <italic>TRPV1, H1R1</italic>, and <italic>MRGPRX4</italic> were performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). As the reviewers can see, the TRPV1+ (usually more than 100 positive dots per cells) and H1R1+ (usually more than 50 to 100 positive dots per cells) neurons are easy to tell (indicated by arrowheads), but it is much harder to tell positive MRGRPX4+ neurons at this low magnification.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48431.024</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Representative large-scale RNAscope images of human DRG.</title><p>Each fluorescent dot indicated by an arrowhead represents one single mRNA transcript.

Full pseudocolor images of the DRGs with and without bile acids should be included (same as the format of Figure 4H, left panel).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this good suggestion and we apologize for the unclear presentation. We have included a representative full pseudocolor image to show the responses of all imaged DRG neurons when applying DCA and other compounds (Figure 5G, Figure 5—figure supplement 2A). The circled cells on the left panel correspond to the representative traces and small pseudocolor images on the right panel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In prior work, bilirubin was shown to not only trigger calcium influx via MRGPRX4 but also action potential firing in rodent neurons. Does bile acid activation of MRGPRX4 drive excitability of DRG neurons? Since the manuscript only reports relative fluo-8 fluorescence changes, the magnitudes of the bile-acid evoked calcium responses in neurons are unknown. Please discuss this point.</p></disp-quote><p>Since the expression percentage of MRGPRX4 is relatively low (6-7%) in human DRG neurons, and the quality of adult human DRG tissues from schwannoma patients, which were used for calcium imaging in this manuscript, are very limited, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to detect bile acid induced firing in the MRGPRX4-positive human DRG neurons. Alternatively, we electrically transfected MRGPRX4 in cultured rat DRG neurons and detected bile acid-induced action potentials of in MRGPRX4-expressing rat DRG neurons but not in non-transfected control cells by electrophysiology (Figure 5E, F, Figure 5—figure supplement 1E, F), demonstrating that activation of MRGPRX4 by bile acid could drive excitability of DRG neurons. In addition, we compared the activity of bilirubin and DCA to MRGPRX4 in cultured rat DRG neurons. Similar to the results in HEK293T cells. DCA showed stronger activity than bilirubin as it induced larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> response both in amplitude and percentage in MRGPRX4-expressing neurons (Figure 9D-G). We have included these results in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Do adult and embryonic DRG neurons display similar MRGPRX4 expression patterns and bile acid responses? Is the data currently pooled in the summary figures? If so, some statistical analyses should be performed to ensure there are no age-specific differences before combining the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point and we apologize for the confusion. Given that the difficulties to obtain the human DRG tissues, we haven’t directly examined the MRGPRX4 expression patterns in the embryonic DRG tissues. Nevertheless, the percentage (5.2%,Figure 5H) of cultured embryonic DRG neurons responding to bile acids is close to expression percentage (6-7%) of MRGPRX4 in the adult DRG tissues. For cultured adult DRG cells, the percentage responding to bile acids varied from batch to batch (3.3-18.2%, Figure 5—figure supplement 2D1-3). The adult DRG tissues are derived from schwannoma patients undergoing surgical excision (as described in the Materials and methods), so the different tissue qualities may contribute to the huge variability. We agree that it is not appropriate to combine the adult and embryonic data together for statistical analysis. We have statistically analyzed each culture separately (Figure 5G, HFigure 5—figure supplement 2) and revised our text to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The bilirubin modulation data should be included as a main figure in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for digging out and highlighting the bilirubin modulation data. We have included this part as a main figure (Figure 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) What antibodies and criteria were used to define satellite glia cells in the IHC experiments? Please provide this information.</p></disp-quote><p>We mainly used morphological criteria to define human and monkey satellite glia cells. We tried immunostaining of a few antibodies (TLR4 for human and monkey satellite glia cells, HTA125, eBioscience; GPAP for mouse satellite glia cells, GFAP, AB_2313547 Aves Labs), which may stain satellite glia cells based on literatures<sup>1,2</sup>, but none of them work for the human and monkey DRG satellite glia cells at our hand. This could be due to different tissue fixation and processing condition. We used fresh frozen for human DRGs, which works nicely for RNAscope in situ hybridization and antibody staining of MRGPRX4 and TGR5. Instead, we co-labeled human DRG neurons with NeuN antibody. We found that TGR5 immunostaining signal does not overlap with NeuN but surrounding these neurons and that TGR5 in situ signals also surround big negative DRG neuron soma. Given the size and morphology of satellite glia cells published before<sup>3</sup>, we believe that the surrounded cells are satellite glia cells. Of course, if we had a good antibody to specifically label human/monkey satellite glia cells, we would be able to provide even stronger evidence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The title should be changed to avoid the word &quot;novel&quot; because MRGPRX4 has already been implicated as a receptor that mediates cholestatic itch.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we should avoid the word “novel” in title since MRGPRX4 has already been implicated as a receptor that mediates cholestatic itch.
