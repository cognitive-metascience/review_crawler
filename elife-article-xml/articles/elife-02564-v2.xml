How Yki activates target gene transcription is poorly understood. Here, we identify Nuclear receptor coactivator 6 (Ncoa6), a subunit of the Trithorax-related (Trr) histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase complex, as a Yki-binding protein. Like Yki, Ncoa6 and Trr are functionally required for Hippo-mediated growth control and target gene expression. Strikingly, artificial tethering of Ncoa6 to Sd is sufficient to promote tissue growth and Yki target expression even in the absence of Yki, underscoring the importance of Yki-mediated recruitment of Ncoa6 in transcriptional activation. Consistent with the established role for the Trr complex in histone methylation, we show that Yki, Ncoa6, and Trr are required for normal H3K4 methylation at Hippo target genes. These findings shed light on Yki-mediated transcriptional regulation and uncover a potential link between chromatin modification and tissue growth.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02564.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02564.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02564.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells need to work together for a multi-celled organism, such as a plant or an animal, to thrive. Many complicated signaling pathways therefore exist that allow cells to communicate with one another and to control their own activity in response to the signals that they receive. One such pathway, called the Hippo signaling pathway, regulates when cells grow and divide, which allows organs and tissues to develop correctly and helps to prevent cancerous tumors from forming.</p><p>Signaling pathways often control the activity of cells by affecting how particular genes are expressed from DNA. One way of doing this is to activate or inactivate proteins called transcription factors, which bind to sections of DNA to alter the expression of nearby genes. In fruit flies, the Hippo signaling pathway stops cells from dividing by inactivating Yorkie, a protein that binds to and activates certain transcription factors. However, exactly how Yorkie is able to activate these transcription factors was unclear.</p><p>For transcription factors to function correctly, they must be able to reach the stretch of DNA where they bind. Therefore, another way to alter gene expression is to change how the DNA is packaged in a cell. This can be done by modifying the proteins that the DNA is wrapped around, which are called histones, for example by using enzymes called methyltransferases to add methyl groups to these proteins.</p><p>Qing, Yin et al. looked at the Hippo signaling pathway in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and found that the Yorkie protein only activates transcription factors when another protein called Ncoa6—which is part of a methyltransferase—binds to it. Furthermore, when the Ncoa6 protein was bound directly to the transcription factor, the tissue grew normally even when the Yorkie protein was not present. These findings reveal the importance of histone modifications in controlling tissue growth, and could provide a new direction in the search for cancer treatments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02564.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02564.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Hippo signaling</kwd><kwd>transcription factor</kwd><kwd>growth control</kwd><kwd>histone methylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qing</surname><given-names>Yun</given-names></name><name><surname>Yin</surname><given-names>Feng</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Yonggang</given-names></name><name><surname>Guo</surname><given-names>Pengfei</given-names></name><name><surname>Schozer</surname><given-names>Frederick</given-names></name><name><surname>Deng</surname><given-names>Hua</given-names></name><name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>Duojia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH EY015708</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qing</surname><given-names>Yun</given-names></name><name><surname>Yin</surname><given-names>Feng</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Yonggang</given-names></name><name><surname>Guo</surname><given-names>Pengfei</given-names></name><name><surname>Schozer</surname><given-names>Frederick</given-names></name><name><surname>Deng</surname><given-names>Hua</given-names></name><name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>Duojia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Elucidating the molecular mechanism by which the Hippo signaling effector Yorkie (Yki) functions as a transcriptional coactivator in growth control reveals the importance of a histone-modifying enzyme for this process.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Hippo signaling pathway has recently emerged as a central mechanism in organ size control, tissue regeneration, and stem cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Harvey and Tapon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badouel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Halder and Johnson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barry and Camargo, 2013</xref>). Initially discovered in <italic>Drosophila</italic> for its critical role in restricting imaginal disc growth, the Hippo pathway comprises several tumor suppressor proteins acting through a core kinase cascade that ultimately phosphorylates and inactivates the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huang et al., 2005</xref>). Consistent with its essential role in normal development and tissue homeostasis, YAP, the mammalian counterpart of Yki, encodes a bona fide oncogene and is overexpressed and/or activated in a wide spectrum of human cancers. Elucidating the molecular mechanism by which Yki functions as a transcriptional coactivator is not only relevant for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of growth control but also has important implications for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting the Hippo pathway in cancer and regenerative medicine.</p><p>Posttranslational modifications of histones are important features of transcriptional regulation in all eukaryotes. A particularly prevalent modification involved in transcriptional activation is histone H3 methylation. <italic>Drosophila</italic> contains three COMPASS (complex of proteins associated with Set1)-like histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase complexes, each defined by a distinct methyltransferase subunit, namely, Trithorax (Trx), Trithorax-related (Trr), and dSet1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mohan et al., 2011</xref>). Previous genetic analysis has implicated Trx in the maintenance of Hox gene transcription and Trr in ecdysone receptor (EcR)-mediated gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sedkov et al., 2003</xref>). Nuclear receptor coactivator 6 (Ncoa6) is a specific subunit of the Trr complex in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mohan et al., 2011</xref>). Although its <italic>in vivo</italic> function remains undefined in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the mammalian Ncoa6 orthologue (also known as NRC, ASC-2, TRBP, PRIP, and RAP250) is essential for embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kuang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zhu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mahajan et al., 2004</xref>). The mammalian Ncoa6 has been shown to potentiate the activity of nuclear hormone receptors and other DNA-binding transcription factors, at least in part, by recruiting the H3K4 methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mahajan and Samuels, 2008</xref>). Interestingly, like YAP, the mammalian Ncoa6 is a pro-survival and anti-apoptotic gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mahajan et al., 2004</xref>) and is amplified in multiple cancer types such as breast, colon, and lung cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we identify Ncoa6 as a Yki-binding protein that is required for transcriptional regulation by the Hippo signaling pathway. We provide evidence showing that the transcriptional coactivator function of Yki depends on its ability to interact with Ncoa6 and that the Trr methyltransferase complex is functionally required for Hippo-mediated growth and gene expression. We further show that Yki, Ncoa6, and Trr are required for normal H3K4 methylation at Hippo target genes. Thus, Yki functions as a transcriptional coactivator, at least in part, by recruiting a H3K4 methyltransferase and altering the chromatin state of target genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We recently reported a genome-wide RNAi screen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2R+ cells using a luciferase reporter driven by a minimal Hippo Responsive Element (HRE) from the Hippo target gene <italic>diap1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Koontz et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2R+ cells were transfected with Yki- and Sd-expressing vectors, together with HRE-luciferase reporter and Pol III-Renilla expression vector as an internal control. Transfected cells were then seeded into individual dsRNA-containing 96-well plates. After RNAi depletion, HRE-luciferase reporter activity was measured and normalized to the Renilla control. This RNAi screen allowed us to uncover both positive and negative regulators of the HRE-luciferase reporter. We have previously characterized a negative regulator from the screen, Tgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Koontz et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we focus on the positive transcriptional regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement1</xref>).</p><p>One of the positive regulators identified in our primary screen is Nuclear receptor coactivator 6 (Ncoa6), which was confirmed by repeating the RNAi experiment in triplicate using re-synthesized dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement1</xref>). We were particularly interested in Ncoa6 since it contains three PPxY sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which represent a well-established ligand binding motif for WW domains. Since Yki contains two WW domains, we hypothesized that Ncoa6 may potentiate Yki-mediated transcriptional activation through physical interactions with Yki. Indeed, epitope-tagged Ncoa6 and Yki coimmunoprecipitated with each other in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2R+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This interaction was abolished by mutating the three PPxY motifs in Ncoa6 (Ncoa6<sup>3m</sup>) or the two WW domains in Yki (Yki<sup>WM</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that the Ncoa6–Yki interaction was mediated by Ncoa6's PPxY motifs and Yki's WW domains. In agreement with this conclusion, we found that wild-type Ncoa6, but not Ncoa6<sup>3m</sup>, promoted nuclear accumulation of Yki in S2R+ cells in co-transfection assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Of note, a recently published Hippo pathway protein–protein interactome included Ncoa6 as one of 245 proteins that were co-immunopreciated by Yki (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kwon et al., 2013</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02564.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ncoa6 physically interacts with Yki and regulates HRE activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic protein structure of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ncoa6 and its human orthologue, which contain three and two PPxY motifs, respectively.

Conversely, knockdown of Ncoa6 exacerbated the small eye size induced by Sd overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J–K</xref>). To further investigate the genetic interactions between Ncoa6 and the Hippo pathway, we used Mosaic Analysis with a Repressible Cell Marker (MARCM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lee and Luo, 1999</xref>) to examine the requirement of Ncoa6 in <italic>hpo</italic> mutant clones.

Since Sd is the primary DNA-binding transcription partner for Yki (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Koontz et al., 2013</xref>), we reasoned that fusing the DNA-binding domain of Sd with Ncoa6 may directly target Ncoa6 to Hippo target genes and therefore stimulate their transcription in a Yki-independent manner (i.e., bypassing the genetic requirement for Yki). We tested this hypothesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing discs using the MARCM technique. As reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huang et al., 2005</xref>), <italic>yki</italic> mutant clones grew poorly and the rarely recovered clones always showed decreased Diap1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). MARCM clones expressing a fusion protein between the DNA-binding domain of Sd and Ncoa6 (SdDB-Ncoa6) resulted in rounded clone morphology and dramatically increased Diap1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Significantly, the SdDB-Ncoa6 fusion protein, but not wild-type Ncoa6, rescued the growth defect and the decreased Diap1 levels in <italic>yki</italic> mutant clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>). In fact, <italic>yki</italic> mutant clones with SdDB-Ncoa6 overexpression were indistinguishable in clone size and Diap1 expression compared to wild-type clones with SdDB-Ncoa6 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>). Thus, the SdDB–Ncoa6 fusion protein exhibits gain-of-function activity in a Yki-independent manner. Consistent with this notion, the SdDB-Ncoa6 fusion protein robustly stimulated the HRE-luciferase reporter in S2R+ cells in a manner that was not suppressed by co-expression of Wts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), in contrast to Wts' ability to suppress the HRE-luciferase reporter activity stimulated by the co-transfection of Sd, Yki, and Ncoa6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02564.008</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Fusion of Ncoa6 with the DNA binding domain of Sd bypasses Yki to stimulate Hippo target gene and tissue growth.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>E</bold>) Wing discs containing GFP-marked MARCM clones (green) of WT control (<bold>A</bold>), <italic>yki</italic><sup><italic>B5</italic></sup> (<bold>B</bold>), SdDB-Ncoa6 overexpression (<bold>C</bold>), <italic>yki</italic><sup><italic>B5</italic></sup> with SdDB-Ncoa6 overexpression (<bold>D</bold>), and <italic>yki</italic><sup><italic>B5</italic></sup> with Ncoa6 overexpression (<bold>E</bold>),were stained for Diap1 (red).

Since Ncoa6 has been reported to be a specific subunit of the Trr methyltransferase complex, we examined whether Trr, the catalytic subunit of this methyltransferase complex, is also required for Hippo-mediated growth control and gene expression. Similar to Ncoa6, expression of UAS-trr RNAi by the <italic>dpp</italic>-Gal4 driver resulted in a significant decrease in the width of the <italic>dpp</italic>-expression domain in adult wings and a corresponding decrease in the Hippo target genes <italic>diap1</italic> and <italic>fj</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,D,G</xref>). Like Ncoa6, Trr knockdown suppressed eye overgrowth induced by Yki overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,F</xref>) and aggravated the small eye phenotype caused by Sd overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J,L</xref>), although it did not visibly suppress eye overgrowth induced by Wts RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). We also used MARCM to examine the requirement of Trr in <italic>hpo</italic> mutant clones. Similar to Ncoa6, Trr knockdown suppressed the overgrowth as well as the elevated Diap1 expression in <italic>hpo</italic> mutant clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–F</xref>). Taken together, these results implicate the Trr methyltransferase complex in Hippo-mediated growth control and target gene expression.</p><p>The Trr methyltransferase complex in <italic>Drosophila</italic> mainly affects histone H3K4 monomethylation with subtle effect on H3K4 di- or trimethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Herz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kanda et al., 2013</xref>). To determine if Yki, Ncoa6, and Trr regulate growth in the Hippo pathway by modulating histone H3K4 methylation, we first examined the global levels of histone H3K4 methylation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal discs. It was reported previously that RNAi knockdown of Trr (using the <italic>en-</italic>Gal4 driver) led to a strong decrease in H3K4me1 in the posterior compartment of the wing imaginal discs, while it had marginal effects on H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mohan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Herz et al., 2012</xref>). It was also showed that RNAi knockdown of Ncoa6 in the posterior compartment of the wing imaginal disc resulted in a weak reduction in H3K4me1 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Herz et al., 2012</xref>), which we confirmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement1</xref>). We further examined H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 levels in these imaginal discs, and observed a very subtle decrease in H3K4me3 levels and no detectable changes in H3K4me2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). However, when we examined mutant clones of <italic>yki</italic> in the wing imaginal discs, we could not detect any changes in the global levels of H3K4me1, H3K4me2, or H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement1</xref>).</p><p>Given the negligible effect of Yki on global levels of H3K4 methylation, we investigated whether Yki modulates local H3K4 methylation on Hippo target genes. It is well established that H3K4 monomethylation marks enhancers and actively transcribed introns, while H3K4 trimethylation is enriched at active promoters and transcription start site (TSS)-proximal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Heintzman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kharchenko et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, a previous genome-wide analysis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells revealed that <italic>diap1</italic> and <italic>ex</italic>, two well-characterized Hippo target genes, display such differential enrichment of H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 at the respective region of each gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Herz et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To examine the contribution of Yki, Ncoa6, and Trr to H3K4 methylation at these Hippo target genes, we knocked down each protein in S2R+ cells and performed ChIP analysis with antibodies against H3K4me1 and H3K4me3. RNAi knockdown of Yki, Ncoa6 or Trr resulted in a decrease of H3K4me3 in the TSS-proximal region of <italic>diap1</italic> and <italic>ex</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), which normally showed the strongest enrichment of H3K4me3 marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Herz et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). RNAi knockdown of Yki, Ncoa6 or Trr also led to a decrease of H3K4me1 in the intronic HRE of <italic>diap1</italic> and an upstream region of <italic>diap1</italic> or <italic>ex</italic> which normally showed the strongest enrichment of H3K4me1 marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Herz et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms by which Yki regulates tissue growth and target gene expression has important implications for developmental and cancer biology. Previous studies have established that Yki functions primarily as a coactivator for Sd and that Yki promotes tissue growth by antagonizing Sd's repressor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Koontz et al., 2013</xref>). Our current study has extended the previous work by identifying Ncoa6 as a Yki-binding cofactor that is required for the expression of Yki target genes. The ability of the SdDB-Ncoa6 fusion protein to rescue the growth and transcriptional defects in <italic>yki</italic> mutant clones highlights the importance of Ncoa6 recruitment in the transcriptional output of the Hippo pathway. Our results further suggest that Ncoa6 recruits the Trr methyltransferase complex to Hippo target genes and that Yki regulates target gene transcription by modulating local H3K4 methylation. Consistent with this view, a recent genome-wide chromatin-binding analysis revealed a correlation between Yki-bound chromatin and peaks of H3K4me3 modification in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing discs and embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Oh et al., 2013</xref>). We note that, besides the H3K4 methyltransferases, the mammalian Ncoa6 has been reported to potentiate the activity of transcription factors by interacting with histone acetyltransferase CBP/p300 and several RNA binding proteins (CAPER, CoAA and PIMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mahajan and Samuels, 2008</xref>). Whether these additional mechanisms also contribute to the function of Ncoa6 in Yki-mediated growth control requires further investigation. Given the biological and clinical significance of the Hippo pathway, further studies into the molecular mechanism of Ncoa6 will advance our understanding of developmental growth control and facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Molecular cloning and mutagenesis</title><p>A full-length Ncoa6 cDNA corresponding to the BDGP annotated RD transcript was generated from mRNA of <italic>Drosophila</italic> third instar larvae, using SuperScript(R) III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq High Fidelity (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Senior editor Janet Rossant and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Senior editor and the two reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Senior editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors identify Ncoa6, a subunit of the H3K4 methyltransferase Trr complex, as a novel Yorkie-interacting protein. Given how Yorkie functions as a transcriptional co-activator is not well understood, this manuscript provides an important advance in the field. Thus, the potential impact is high.</p><p>However, although the authors demonstrate that Ncoa6 is required for normal growth and Hippo target gene expression, in vivo evidence that Trr complex are functionally required for Hippo-mediated growth and gene expression is completely lacking in this manuscript. It would be important to examine whether knock-down of Ncoa6 and Trr suppress (i) eye over-growth (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and (ii) elevation of Diap1 expression in the wing disc (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), in hippo or warts mutant clones/tissue. We believe that performing the additional above experiments would significantly improve the manuscript.</p><p>Other issues to address:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>As a minor point, the authors mention that FLAG-Ncoa6 is localized in the nucleus.

Ncoa6 is in the nucleus at all times, and overexpression of Ncoa6 with a mutation in the PPxY motifs causes Yki to be largely localized in the cytoplasm.</p><p>What is the localization of Yki in this system without ectopic Ncoa6?

In this revision, we have conducted additional experiments to investigate the role of the Trr complex in normal growth and Hippo target gene expression. Specifically, we have added data showing that 1) knockdown of Ncoa6 and Trr suppresses eye overgrowth caused by Yki overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D-F</xref>); 2) knockdown of Ncoa6 suppresses eye overgrowth caused by Wts knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G-H</xref>); 3) knockdown of Ncoa6 and Trr suppresses Diap1 expression in <italic>hpo</italic> mutant wing clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Accordingly, we have slightly modified the title of the manuscript in the revision. We hope that these additional experiments have significantly improved our manuscript.</p><p><italic>Other issues to address</italic>:</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>As a minor point, the authors mention that FLAG-Ncoa6 is localized in the nucleus</italic>. <italic>How can Ncoa6 that is only present in the nucleus promote nuclear translocation of HA-Yorkie that is present in the cytoplasm?</italic></p><p>Yorkie, like many other phospho-regulated transcription factors in the cells, shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Thus, its steady-state subcellular localization in a cell reflects the equilibrium of nuclear import/retention and cytoplasmic export/retention. Any conditions that increase nuclear retention, as by the overexpression of the nuclear FLAG-Ncoa6 protein, would shift the equilibrium to the nucleus. Conversely, conditions that increase cytoplasmic retention, as by the binding of the cytoplasmic protein 14-3-3, would shift the localization towards the cytoplasm. In order to better convey the point that the snapshot of Yki localization in our co-transfection experiment is the equilibrium of a dynamic process, we use “nuclear accumulation” instead of “nuclear translocation” in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>: The authors show nicely that Flag-Ncoa6 binds to Yki in IP experiments, and that the interaction depends on the motifs of Ncoa6.

Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we examined whether knocking down Ncoa6 affects Yki localization and the results were mixed. We found that Ncoa6 knockdown in S2R+ cells led to decreased nuclear localization of HA-Yki, although it had no obvious effect on endogenous Yki. This data is included for your perusal at the end of this letter (Figure A–B). I should emphasize that the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> were intended to further support the physical interactions between Yki and Ncoa6 – they were not intended to imply that endogenous Yki is localized to the nucleus based on Ncoa6 interactions.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>: The authors nicely show that knockdown of Ncoa6 with RNAi via dppGal4 leads to a suppression of growth in the adult wing, and a reduction of the dpp domain in the larval wing disc.
