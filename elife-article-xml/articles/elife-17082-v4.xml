The characteristic elevated C&gt;T mutation rate in CpG sites has been related to 5-methylcytosine (5mC), an epigenetically modified base which resides in CpGs and plays a role in transcription silencing. In brain nearly a third of 5mCs have recently been found to exist in the form of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), yet the effect of 5hmC on mutational processes is still poorly understood. Here we show that 5hmC is associated with an up to 53% decrease in the frequency of C&gt;T mutations in a CpG context compared to 5mC. Tissue specific 5hmC patterns in brain, kidney and blood correlate with lower regional CpG&gt;T mutation frequency in cancers originating in the respective tissues. Together our data reveal global and opposing effects of the two most common cytosine modifications on the frequency of cancer causing somatic mutations in different cell types.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17082.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17082.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17082.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A molecule called DNA encodes genetic information inside our cells. Random changes to the DNA sequence, known as mutations, can occur in any cell. Most mutations are harmless, but some can lead to disease – most prominently cancer. Like how car accidents can happen more often on some roads than others, mutations are more frequent in some parts of the DNA. Cytosine, one of the four letters of the genetic code, usually accumulates more mutations than the other three letters.</p><p>Cytosine can be decorated with distinct ‘marks’ to form either methyl-cytosine or hydroxymethyl-cytosine. Methyl-cytosine is known to mutate relatively easily, and is the most common type of mutation observed in most cancers. However, little was known about how easily hydroxymethyl-cytosine mutates.</p><p>Modifications of cytosine are distributed differently in cells from different tissues. To test whether hydroxymethyl-cytosine mutates more or less often than methyl-cytosine in human cells, Tomkova et al. used the cytosine mutations measured in human brain, kidney and blood cancer samples.

Apart from positive and negative selective pressure, a number of factors can influence regional mutation frequencies, such as chromatin organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schuster-Böckler and Lehner, 2012</xref>), replication timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koren et al., 2012</xref>), metabolic load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ames et al., 1993</xref>) and exposure to different mutagens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Poon et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, highly transcribed regions generally exhibit lower mutation frequencies due to the influence of transcription-coupled repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lawrence et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to the regional distribution of mutations, the local nucleotide contexts and mutation types (referred to as <italic>mutational signatures</italic>) have been investigated extensively since they provide critical clues about the mechanism of mutagenesis. For example, consensus motifs for cytidine deaminases (such as APOBEC and AID) were found enriched at mutational hot-spots, suggesting that activity of these enzymes could be the potential cause of those mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nik-Zainal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>). The most frequent mutational signature found in the majority of cancers is C to T transition in a CpG dinucleotide context (CpG&gt;T) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexandrov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lawrence et al., 2013</xref>). This relates to the fact that cytosines in CpG dinucleotides are frequently methylated to form 5-methylcytosine (5mC). The rate of spontaneous deamination of 5mC into T is four fold higher than the rate of deamination of C into U (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lindahl and Nyberg, 1974</xref>). In the germline of vertebrates, this likely facilitated a general depletion of CpGs outside of CpG islands which are largely unmethylated.</p><p>The genomes of all examined vertebrate species feature DNA methylation, and loss of DNA methylation is incompatible with normal development in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Okano et al., 1999</xref>). DNA methylation plays a role in gene expression, most notably by repressing one allele of imprinted genes. Moreover, it is involved in maintenance of genome stability, alternative splicing, X chromosome inactivation and suppression of retrotransposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klose and Bird, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jones, 2012</xref>). In 2009, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) was indisputably shown to exist in DNA of brain and other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kriaucionis and Heintz, 2009</xref>). It was concurrently shown that ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes are able to convert 5mC into 5hmC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tahiliani et al., 2009</xref>). Unlike 5mC, which is observed at similar levels in many cell types, the abundance of 5hmC varies widely. 5hmC was observed to be particularly enriched in brain cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kriaucionis and Heintz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lister et al., 2013</xref>) and detectable in embryonic stem cells and all examined tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tahiliani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Globisch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Szwagierczak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu and Zhang, 2011</xref>). 5hmC and higher oxidised states of methyl-cytosine have been proposed to play a role in de-methylation via ineffective re-methylation after replication or directly by thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tahiliani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">He et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maiti and Drohat, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hu et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to demethylation, 5hmC has been implicated in transcriptional regulation, and a number of DNA binding proteins recognising 5hmC have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mellén et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spruijt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takai et al., 2014</xref>). 5hmC is found depleted in primary tumours and TET2 is frequently mutated in myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myelogenous leukaemia and T-cell lymphoma, indicating that 5hmC plays a role in carcinogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism by which 5hmC affects carcinogenesis is poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rasmussen and Helin, 2016</xref>).</p><p>5hmC is an important intermediate during demethylation in zygotes and ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tahiliani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Inoue and Zhang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wossidlo et al., 2011</xref>), but the vast majority of 5hmC is found as a stable, long-lived modification in adult mouse tissue that undergoes little cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bachman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brazauskas and Kriaucionis, 2014</xref>). Thus, we hypothesised that – similar to 5mC – long-lived 5hmC could have a substantial influence on the mutability of DNA. Little is known about the mutational properties of 5hmC, in part because until recently there has been a lack of information on the precise location of 5hmC in the genome. With the development of techniques for single-nucleotide resolution mapping of 5mC and 5hmC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Booth et al., 2014</xref>), it is now possible to differentiate mutation rates at 5mC and 5hmC sites. Recently, Supek et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Supek et al., 2014</xref>) reported elevated C&gt;G transversion rates at 5hmC sites, using 5hmC maps from human and mouse embryonic stem cells. However, these findings are limited by the fact that embryonic stem cells differ substantially from the somatic tissues in which mutations were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schultz et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A large proportion of mutations observed in any cancer genome originate in its pre-cancerous cell of origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nik-Zainal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stephens et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tomasetti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu et al., 2015</xref>) and will have been influenced by its epigenetic landscape. The publication of single-base resolution maps of 5mC and 5hmC occupancy in samples of human brain, kidney and blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pacis et al., 2015</xref>) now enables us to interrogate the tissue-specific effect of cytosine modifications on somatic mutation rates in unprecedented detail.</p><p>Since 5hmC has been shown to be most abundant in human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li and Liu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nestor et al., 2012</xref>), we have initially focussed on assessing the relationship between mutability and DNA modifications in brain cancers. Based on a DNA sequencing data from five brain cancer types encompassing 665 patients, we show that the dominant mutational signature in brain cancers is CpG&gt;T, which is modulated by the modification state of cytosine. Strikingly, the CpG&gt;T mutation frequency of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine is reduced nearly two-fold compared to the methylated state. We find that the ratio of 5hmC to 5mC in 100 kb genomic intervals correlates with CpG&gt;T mutation frequency even after accounting for confounding factors like gene density or CpG islands. When we expand our analysis to include mutations and 5hmC maps from kidney and myeloid lineage of blood cells, we observe a clear tissue-specific effect of 5hmC on mutagenicity. Finally, we measured 5mC and 5hmC levels using methodology of high accuracy in eight different human tissue types and show that reduced 5hmC levels associate with an increased proportion of CpG&gt;T mutations in cancers of the corresponding tissue. Together, our findings suggest that hydroxymethylation has a significant influence on the likelihood of mutations at CpG sites across many human tissue types.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We compiled base-resolution maps of 5mC and 5hmC frequency in brain, kidney and myeloid cells from publicly available sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pacis et al., 2015</xref>). All three data sets are based on bisulfite (BS) and 'Tet-assisted bisulfite' (TAB) sequencing, respectively. BS-Seq detects any modified cytosine (i.e., does not distinguish 5mC and 5hmC) whereas TAB-Seq specifically detects 5hmC. The combination of the two methods allows an estimation of the levels of both 5mC and 5hmC for all sufficiently covered cytosines. As 5hmC predominantly occurs in a CpG context, we focussed the analysis on CpG sites. Sequencing reads come from heterogeneous populations of cells. Hence, a single locus usually cannot be assigned a single state (C, 5mC or 5hmC). Instead, we estimated the frequency of modification, hydroxymethylation and methylation per site using the percentage of BS-Seq reads that showed a modification (referred to as <italic>mod level</italic>), the percentage of TAB-Seq reads that showed hydroxymethylation (referred to as <italic>5hmC level</italic>) and their difference (<italic>5mC level = mod level – 5hmC level</italic>), respectively.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>5hmC sites in brain exhibit lower frequency of CpG&gt;T mutations than 5mC sites</title><p>Since brain tissue has been shown to exhibit particularly high levels of 5hmC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we first investigated the relationship between the regional distribution of 5hmC, 5mC and mutagenesis in brain tumours.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, C&gt;A or C&gt;G transversions are an order of magnitude less frequent than C&gt;T transitions in both 5mC and 5hmC sites. The relationship between C&gt;A and C&gt;G mutations and 5hmC varied between cancer types. In GBM and LGG the frequency of C&gt;A mutations was significantly higher in 5mC<sub>high</sub> compared to 5hmC<sub>high</sub> sites, but in NRB, MDB and PA we detected no significant difference. The frequency of C&gt;G mutations in 5mC<sub>high</sub> sites differed significantly from 5hmC<sub>high</sub> sites only in MDB, PA and GBM. In MDB and PA, 5hmC<sub>high</sub> sites were slightly enriched for C&gt;G mutations, whereas in GBM an enrichment was observed at 5mC<sub>high</sub> sites. Since C&gt;T transitions are the most common somatic mutation type in brain and the difference in C&gt;T mutations between 5mC<sub>high</sub> and 5hmC<sub>high</sub> sites is more consistent among cancer types than in the C&gt;A and C&gt;G transversions, we focus mainly on C&gt;T mutations in the remainder of this report.</p><p>We confirmed that C&gt;T mutations are significantly depleted at 5hmC sites across a wide range of thresholds in definitions of 5mC<sub>high</sub> and 5hmC<sub>high</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>). In fact, more stringent definitions of 5hmC (e.g., 5hmC<sub>high</sub>: <italic>5hmC level / mod level</italic> ≥ 0.7) result in even greater differences (42–59%) in C&gt;T mutation frequencies between 5mC<sub>high</sub> and 5hmC<sub>high</sub> sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>), but these definitions would reduce the number of sites too much for our subsequent statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Reduced 5hmC mutability in brain is not accounted for by genomic regions or gene expression</title><p>We next examined whether the decreased frequency of C&gt;T transitions at 5hmC vs. 5mC sites might be an indirect effect of 5hmC being associated with genomic regions of lower mutability. Levels of 5mC and 5hmC vary across genomic regions. For example, 5hmC density is elevated in highly expressed genes in brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mellén et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lister et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wen et al., 2014</xref>). The observed decrease in C&gt;T mutation frequencies might therefore be attributable to higher gene expression, which would correlate with higher transcription coupled repair. We therefore performed the analysis described above separately for regions with high vs. low gene expression in human brain (see Materials and methods). There was a lower overall mutation frequency in highly expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>), but both highly and lowly expressed genes exhibited significantly lower C&gt;T transition rates at 5hmC sites compared to 5mC sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>).

Hence, to correct for any regional variation, we performed the analysis on groups of sites generated by pairing the modified CpGs: each 5hmC site was paired with the nearest yet unpaired 5mC site from an equivalent genomic and sequence context (an approach adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Supek et al., 2014</xref>, see Materials and methods). Thereby we compared the mutation frequencies of two groups (one group comprising 5mC sites and one group comprising 5hmC sites) containing the same number of loci (6801374 cytosines in each group). As a result of this experimental setup, a substantial fraction of mutated 5mC sites were excluded, greatly reducing the statistical power of this 'paired' analysis. Nevertheless, the frequency of C&gt;T mutations in 5hmC remained significantly lower than in 5mC in both exomes and genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–F</xref>), supporting that the difference between 5mC and 5hmC mutation frequency is not caused by regional differences.</p><p>To ensure that there is no confounding bias in the spatial distribution of mutations around 5mC or 5hmC sites, respectively, we plotted mutation frequencies in a 2 kb radius up and downstream of modified loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>, Materials and methods). The mutation frequency differed substantially in the aligned positions of DNA modifications but was indistinguishable in the surrounding area. In conclusion, regional mutation rate variability is unlikely to account for the difference in C&gt;T mutational load in 5mC and 5hmC sites.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Relative 5hmC correlates with CpG&gt;T mutation frequency</title><p>The 5mC and 5hmC frequency at each base reflect the prevalence of each modification within the sequenced cell population. We hypothesised that if 5hmC had a direct effect on C&gt;T mutation likelihood, we would observe an increase in mutation frequency with decreasing 5hmC occupancy. To test this, we formally defined 5hmC<sub>rel</sub> as the ratio of the proportion of reads supporting 5hmC, relative to the proportion of reads supporting any modification at a particular cytosine (5hmC<sub>rel</sub> = <italic>5hmC level / mod level</italic>). We then divided brain CpG sites into bins according to their 5hmC<sub>rel</sub> level and computed the fraction of mutated sites in each bin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Notably, the correlation was present in all the tested brain cancer types in exome- and whole genome-sequenced samples. A regression slope test confirmed significance of this relationship in all the cancer types. To confirm that the results are not influenced by an uneven distribution of information across bins, we performed quantile binning so that each bin contains an approximately equal number of positions (see Materials and methods).

Consequently, we expected the association between mutation frequency and 5hmC to be highest when mutation and modification data are derived from matching tissue types. To test this hypothesis, we used a GLM on genomic windows of 100 kbp to predict CpG&gt;T mutation rate from a combination of 5hmC<sub>rel</sub> maps of all three tissues. Strikingly, for each cancer type, the best predictor came from the same tissue type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting that tissue differences in 5hmC are reflected in the CpG&gt;T mutation landscape. The same results were obtained in all available replicates of the 5hmC<sub>rel</sub> maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Finally, we added a 5hmC<sub>rel</sub> map derived from embryonic stem cells (ESC) as an additional predictor, to compare our findings to previously reported results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Supek et al., 2014</xref>). As we anticipated, the ESC-derived 5hmC levels have substantially lower predictive power on CpG&gt;T mutation rate than any of the tissue-derived maps.</p><p>While base-resolution maps of 5hmC for human tissue are still rare, there is a wide range of BS-Seq data sets available in public databases. Given our findings thus far, we predicted that tissues with high levels of 5hmC relative to 5mC would exhibit fewer CpG&gt;T mutations in modified sites than tissues with low total 5hmC. To test this hypothesis, we measured total levels of 5mC and 5hmC using High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC-UV) in DNA of eight human tissue types for which BS-Seq maps are publicly available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). In order to account for unrelated cancer-type specific differences in CpG&gt;T mutability, we normalised the mutation frequency in modified sites by the mutation frequency in unmodified sites. The analysis of association between genomic 5hmC and enrichment of CpG&gt;T mutations revealed a strong negative correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) in all tissue types except lung. Interestingly, this difference seems to stem from smoking-related effects. Lung cancer mutation data from heavy smokers revealed a markedly lower frequency of CpG&gt;T mutations in modified sites, relative to other mutations. It has been reported that the typical C&gt;A mutational signature associated with smoking was found significantly enriched in CpGs outside CpG islands, suggesting that it preferentially occurs at modified CpG sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pleasance et al., 2010</xref>). Accordingly, our data indicate that CpG&gt;T mutations might also be differentially affected by smoking-related mutagens.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we have established a link between the landscape of DNA modifications and the mutational profile of somatic human cells. Our measurements indicate that 5hmCs carry between 28 and 53% fewer mutations than methylated cytosines in brain. This results in a mutational load at 5hmC sites that is comparable to that of unmodified cytosines in CpG dinucleotides. This effect is not only observable in brain, but also in kidney cancers and myeloid leukaemias. The relationship between 5hmC and CpG&gt;T mutation rate can be detected at the scale of the exome as well as genome-wide and is independent of other region-specific influences on mutation frequency. We show that the relative impact of hydroxymethylation on mutagenesis decreases proportionally to the level of 5hmC in the tissue, suggesting that it represents a general property of this DNA modification.</p><p>Two possible scenarios could explain the striking difference in mutability between 5mC and 5hmC. Firstly, spontaneous and enzymatic deamination reactions of 5hmC could be less favourable than 5mC. As a consequence, fewer new mutation events would be expected at 5hmC sites. Indeed, cytosine deaminases (namely, AID and APOBEC1-3) have 4.4–38x lower activity on sites with 5hmC compared to 5mC, supporting this possibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nabel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rangam et al., 2012</xref>). Secondly, deamination of 5mC produces thymine whereas 5hmC deaminates to 5-hydroxymethyluracil (5hmU). This atypical base in DNA could be more efficiently recognised and replaced by the DNA glycosylases initiating base-excision repair (BER). Determining the relative contribution of DNA glycosylases to the lower mutation rate would be challenging, since some of these enzymes recognise several types of mismatches. TDG and MBD4 excise both T and 5hmU when mis-paired with G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hardeland et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cortellino et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hashimoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moréra et al., 2012</xref>), whereas SMUG1 does not repair T:G but has a robust activity for 5hmU:G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nilsen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kemmerich et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, there might be more efficient repair of 5hmU in the genome. Further genome sequencing efforts might identify patients with rare inactivating mutations in BER and/or mismatch-repair pathways that could be valuable for future investigations of the relationship between DNA repair and cytosine mutability.</p><p>It has previously been suggested that 5hmC levels increase the frequency of C&gt;G mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Supek et al., 2014</xref>). As part of this analysis, only a very small (albeit statistically significant) decrease of C&gt;T mutations in 5hmC sites in both SNPs and cancer SNVs was observed. There are two factors that could explain why we observe very different effects sizes for C&gt;T and C&gt;G mutations in 5hmC sites. Firstly, Supek et al. consider all sites with as little as one 5hmC read to be hydroxymethylated, whereas we require the level of 5hmC to exceed 5mC. In fact, when examining the effect of variation in these thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>), we noticed that the results for C&gt;G fluctuate substantially across the range of tested cut-off values (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>). Secondly, we present evidence that tissue-specific changes in 5hmC patterns have great influence on the extent of correlation between 5hmC and mutability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Specifically, 5hmC genomic localisation in embryonic stem cells was a poor predictor of CpG&gt;T mutations in brain, kidney and blood, compared to the respective tissue-specific 5hmC patterns.</p><p>The best predictor of CpG&gt;T mutations in any of the three tested tissues was the 5hmC<sub>rel</sub> map from the corresponding anatomical site. This provides evidence that the slow accumulation of CpG&gt;T mutations in the pre-cancerous tissue was strongly influenced by the DNA modification landscape. However, any bulk tissue sample encompasses a mixture of different cell types. Mounting evidence suggests that solid tumours originate from a defined subset of cells within any one tissue type. For example, glioblastomas were proposed to originate from stem or progenitor cell types enriched in the subventricular zone, while medulloblastomas have mixed cells of origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Visvader, 2011</xref>). Those cell types are of low abundance in normal tissue biopsies. The fact that we observe a clear inverse relationship between CpG&gt;T mutations and the location of 5hmC in multiple tissue types suggests that the DNA modification landscape in cancer-progenitor cells is sufficiently similar to the tissue average to be informative about the mutation frequencies in cancer.</p><p>Under this assumption we predict that the impact of DNA modifications on the frequency of CpG&gt;T mutations is likely to be bigger than measured here, since the terminally differentiated cells that make up the bulk of the tissue may have diverged further from cancer-progenitor cells. Advancements in the identification of cancer origins and isolation of single cells, combined with single-cell bisulfite sequencing, will enable an improved assessment of the impact of DNA modifications on mutability.</p><p>The strong correlation between relative 5hmC levels in a tissue and the mutability of modified cytosine also points towards a shared underlying mutagenic process. The notable deviation of smoking-induced lung-cancers supports this hypothesis. We speculate that a yet undefined smoking-induced mutagenic mechanism preferentially affects unmethylated CpG sites. More experimental work will be needed to elucidate the biochemical causes for this phenomenon. In the future, the linear relationship between 5hmC levels and CpG&gt;T mutation rate could thus be used to identify other environmental mutagens with a differential effect on modified cytosines.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Code</title><p>Most of the analyses were performed using Matlab.

Outliers were classified in the following way: <italic>y ≥ quantile(y, 0.999) + 2.5 * (quantile(y, 0.999) – quantile(y, 0.001))</italic>. Out of 17,605 genes, 10 were classified and removed as outliers: ASPN, BBOX1, CCL4, ESPN, FOLH1, HLA-DPB1, IDH1, NLRP6, S100P, and TP53. The same GLM model as above was used. To calculate the relative contribution of one predictor variable over the other, two models were fitted with either one or both predictor variables and the difference in D<sup>2</sup> was used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>HPLC measurements of total 5hmC and 5mC in eight tissues</title><p>10μg of genomic DNA (amsbio; D1234003, D1234004, D1234035, D1234086, D1234090, D1234122, D1234142, D1234148, D1234149, D1234152, D1234171, D1234188, D1234200, D1234206, D1234226, D1234227, D1234246, D1234248, D1234260, D1234274, HG-101) was treated with 1U RNase A (Thermo Scientific), purified by phenol chloroform ethanol precipitation and incubated overnight in hydrolysis solution (45 mM NaCl, 9 mM MgCl2, 9 mM Tris pH 7.9, ≥250 U/ml Benzonase (sigma), 50 mU/ml Phosphodiesterase I, ≥20 U/ml Alkaline phosphatase, 46.8 ng/ml EHNA hydrochloride, 8.64 µM deferoxamine). Protein components were removed by centrifugation through Amicon centrifugal filter unit (3 kDa cut-off, Millipore) before samples were lyophilised and resuspended in buffer A. Nucleosides were resolved with an Agilent UHPLC 1290 instrument fitted with Eclipse Plus C18 RRHD 1.8 μm (2.1 × 150 mm column) and detected and quantified with Agilent 1290 DAD fitted with a Max-Light 60 mm cell. Buffer A was 100 mM ammonium acetate, pH 6.5; buffer B was 40% acetonitrile, and the flow rate 0.4 ml min−1. The gradient was between 1.8–100% of 40% acetonitrile with the following steps: 1–2 min, 100% A; 2–16 min 98.2% A, 1.8% B; 16–18 min 70% A, 30% B; 18–20 min 50% A, 50% B; 20–21.5 min 25% A, 75% B; 21.5–22.5 min 100% B; 22.5–24.5 min 100% A. Relative abundance of 5mC and 5hmC were established by detection of adenosine at 280nm allowing determination of total cytosine by extinction coefficient calculation using standards.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Jakub Tomek, Pijus Brazauskas and David Severson for helpful discussions. SK and BS-B are funded by Ludwig Cancer Research.

Your full submission has been evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior editor) and three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers.</p><p>Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we felt that your manuscript requires major alterations that are unlikely to be accomplished within the time frame typically allotted for revised <italic>eLife</italic> manuscripts. We therefore regret to inform you that your work, in its present form, will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, we would be happy to consider a new submission if you can demonstrate that 5hmC causes a strong and general reduction of C&gt;T mutations associated with 5mC.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The main claim of the manuscript is that hydroxylation of methylcytosine (hmC) lowers the C&gt;T transition rate of methylated cytosine (mC) in brain (cancer) cells approximately 2-fold. The authors support this claim by re-analyzing published data for the localization of DNA hydroxymethylation (BS/TAB-Seq in normal brain tissue, Wen et al., Genome Biol 2014) and for substitution rates (inferred from brain cancers, Alexandrov et al., Nature 2013). The phenomenon of less elevated transition rates in lineages leading to cancer at hydroxymethylated bases in normal brain cells is somewhat supported, but support would be bolstered by additional analyses.</p><p>Overall, the paper appears methodologically sound, but I am concerned by discrepancies with published data, and the biology doesn't quite add up. A paper published last year and cited here (Supek at al., PLoS Genetics 2014) reported elevated levels of C&gt;G transversions associated with hmC in human and mouse. The same paper also found modest but significant reduction of C&gt;T transitions in both species, interpreted as an expected outcome of the chemical differences between hmC and mC. This important result isn't mentioned by the authors, who report a much greater reduction – the main novel finding of this paper. Unlike the published result, the authors' analysis relies on a single human brain hmC dataset, and the substitution rates in cancer lineages are not obviously matched to bulk modification levels of an individual brain. Although the authors claim the matching of datasets is a strength of their analysis, it is actually somewhat of a weakness because the samples are not directly comparable.</p><p>It is noted that &quot;all brain cancer types individually displayed a significant (28-53%) reduction of C&gt;T mutations in 5hmChigh sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>), making it highly improbable that the observation is an artefact of tissue type or sequencing method&quot;, however a similar result across the board makes it suspect of a systematic artifact, potentially caused by reliance on a single hmC dataset. I think it is very important for the authors to perform their analyses with additional hmC datasets.</p><p>I find the author's functional claims problematic. hmC modification decreases in most cancer lineages measured (Ficz and Gribben, Genomics 2014), so how can hmC continue to lower mutation rates if it is increasingly lost in the proliferating cancer cells? Even if it were only acting early in cancer development when hmC would presumably still be high, wouldn't its mutational signature be quickly overwhelmed by subsequent mutations occurring on non-hydroxymethylated cytosines? Furthermore, the most mitotically active cells, neuronal progenitors and neural stem cells, have the least hmC (Wen and Tang, Genomics 2014) – yet, aren't these thought to be more likely to give rise to the cancer lineages?</p><p>More generally, the argument that elevated hmC protects long-lived cells like neurons is odd, because these cells are not in obvious need of special protection from mutations. Mutations have the greatest potential for harm when arising in cells that give rise to many other cells. Primary adult brain tumors overwhelmingly arise from glial cells. Elevated levels of hmC in long-lived cells would seem to argue against a function in reducing mutations, or at least not for such a function.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>General Assessment</p><p>The authors analyze the relationship between the distribution of hydroxymethylation and mutational patterns in brain cancer exomes and whole genomes. Authors make a nice effort to collect a large sample size of brain cancer samples. The paper is well written and I do not see any major methodological pitfall in most of their analyses. However, I am skeptical about the generality about their findings, and also feel that some of their claims should be toned down or strengthened by additional analyses.</p><p>1) The title and some of the Discussion indicates that the findings in this paper may represent a universal mutational trend. However, their findings clearly cannot be generalized to all somatic mutations. In this respect the title should be changed to specify that the patterns were observed in brain cancers.</p><p>Specifically, if 5hmC is intrinsically linked to lower C&gt;T mutability, this pattern should be also observed in other cancer types as well as in non-cancer context. As cited in this paper, reduced C&gt;T pattern was not consistently observed in a previous study (Supek et al.) using population variation and SNPs from several cancer types. Authors mention that this discrepancy is due to specific 5hmC patterns of each tissue. However, to claim that C&gt;T mutation is universal authors need to discard specific mutational biases in brain cancer. For example, one might come up with an alternative explanation that the repair machineries for 5mC mismatch is specifically impaired in brain cancers, and consequently they are highly mutable in these specific cell types. A scenario such as this can be easily tested by comparing expression patterns of genes involved in 5mC and 5hmC repair machineries for different cell types. Second, it might be necessary to confirm that the discrepancies are not because of different methodological approaches. Authors could follow 5hmC – 5mC context matching procedure from the previous study and/or analyze population-based SNP data themselves. Finally, even though germline 5hmC maps are not yet available, one can infer those patterns using the existing maps and using the principles of parsimony. For example, the cytosines that are hydroxymethylated in both ESC and a differentiated tissue such as cortex may be inferred to be hydroxymethylated in germline and should associate with less C&gt;T SNP at the population level (having a larger number of 5hmC maps would increase the confidence of the inference). In contrast, brain-specific 5hmC (5mC in ESC) are expected to show less C&gt;T mutations in brain cancers, but more C&gt;T at population-level (since these positions are expected to be 5mC in germlines).</p><p>2) In addition, it is stated in the Abstract that the levels of 5hmC have 'predictive' power for mutation frequencies, in particular non-synonymous mutation frequencies. However, without the total R2 of the model it is impossible to judge the predictive power of their models. Moreover, the differences in R2 of models including or excluding 5hmC levels are so small (in the other of 1/1000th, per <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), it is a stretch to state that the '5hmC levels are predictive of lower non-synonymous mutation frequency' (as in the Abstract).</p><p>3) The authors conjecture that a potential (additional) role of hydroxymethylation may be to 'protect' some cell types from mutations. The authors relate to the abundance of hydroxymethylation in long-lived neurons and such a potential role. However, as authors acknowledge in the Discussion, this must be taken with caution since the biological significance as well as tissue-wide distribution of hydroxymethylation is still poorly understood. Authors might also acknowledge that an additional caveat of this work is that the sample studied is heterogeneous. The frontal cortex is composed of not only long-lived neurons but also shorter-lived glial cells. To directly test their hypothesis, it might be necessary to compare sorted cell types with close developmental origin and biological function but with different division rates.</p><p>4) Regarding the analysis on driver genes, authors show that cancer driver genes show more 5hmC/total methylated than non-drivers genes. I feel this analysis alone is not sufficient to delineate the relationship between 5hmC and occurrence of cancer driver mutations.</p><p>The comparison between drivers and non-drivers might not be fair, since they might show different mutation rates in cancer. To test the role of 5hmC in genome stability and progression in cancer, would not it be more relevant to test if drivers are enriched for 5hmC compared to passenger genes (i.e., genes that also accumulate mutations in cancer, while not as drivers)?</p><p>If the presence of 5hmC is linked to low mutability at key genes, a testable prediction using ESC 5hmC map would be to show that the genes that are active in development show enrichment for 5hmC.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17082.053</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>The main claim of the manuscript is that hydroxylation of methylcytosine (hmC) lowers the C&gt;T transition rate of methylated cytosine (mC) in brain (cancer) cells approximately 2-fold.

We now identify and discuss the likely reason for the differences between our observations and Supek et al. In particular, we show that differences in thresholds defining 5hmC sites have a major influence on the correlation with C&gt;G mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>), and that embryonic stem cell 5hmC maps (which were used by Supek et al.) are significantly less correlated with somatic mutations than tissue-matched maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p><italic>Unlike the published result, the authors' analysis relies on a single human brain hmC dataset, and the substitution rates in cancer lineages are not obviously matched to bulk modification levels of an individual brain.

These additional data sets also show a clear tissue-specific correlation with CpG&gt;T mutations in corresponding cancer types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>). The best explanation for this observation is that the majority of these mutations accumulated in “normal” tissue before the onset of carcinogenesis.

All data independently validate our hypothesis that higher 5hmC frequency reduces the likelihood of CpG&gt;T mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p><italic>I find the author's functional claims problematic. hmC modification decreases in most cancer lineages measured (Ficz and Gribben, Genomics 2014), so how can hmC continue to lower mutation rates if it is increasingly lost in the proliferating cancer cells?

If the mutational signature was dominated by CpG&gt;T mutations that occurred <italic>during</italic> cancer growth, we would expect little correlation with patient age. However, we found good correlation between age and CpG&gt;T mutations in modified sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Moreover, mutations at 5hmC sites accumulated slower than at 5mC sites. This supports the argument that the majority of CpG&gt;T mutations occurred before the onset of tumorigenesis (i.e. before any cancer-associated decrease in 5hmC). Clock-like kinetics of CpG&gt;T mutations was observed by others, suggesting that this is a universal mutational process occurring in normal somatic cells (Alexandrov et al. 2015, Nat Genet.). We have amended the manuscript with further references on this question (subsection “5hmC sites in brain exhibit lower frequency of CpG&gt;T mutations than 5mC sites”).</p><p><italic>Furthermore, the most mitotically active cells, neuronal progenitors and neural stem cells, have the least hmC (Wen and Tang, Genomics 2014) – yet, aren't these thought to be more likely to give rise to the cancer lineages?</italic></p><p><italic>More generally, the argument that elevated hmC protects long-lived cells like neurons is odd, because these cells are not in obvious need of special protection from mutations.

In particular, we show that differences in thresholds defining which sites are considered 5mC and 5hmC, respectively, have a major influence on the correlation with C&gt;G mutations. We found that when applying thresholds as reported by Supek et al., we can confirm an increase in C&gt;G mutations at “5hmC” sites. However, we believe that the thresholds we applied are a more conservative choice, as we discuss in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Furthermore, we also show that 5hmC maps from embryonic stem cells used by Supek et al. are significantly less correlated with somatic mutations than tissue-matched maps.

Out of 6,501,153 loci that qualify as 5hmC<sub>high</sub> in brain, only 78,789 (1.2%) overlap with ESC 5hmC<sub>high</sub> loci. The overlap between all four maps was even smaller, containing only 296 5hmC<sub>high</sub> loci. As a result, the diminished statistical power restricts the ability to observe any effects. However, our new analysis on maps from three tissues addresses the reviewer’s point that ‘a larger number of 5hmC maps would increase confidence’. In fact, we show a clear tissue-specific correlation with CpG&gt;T mutations in the corresponding cancer types.</p><p><italic>2) In addition, it is stated in the Abstract that the levels of 5hmC have 'predictive' power for mutation frequencies, in particular non-synonymous mutation frequencies. However, without the total R2 of the model it is impossible to judge the predictive power of their models. Moreover, the differences in R2 of models including or excluding 5hmC levels are so small (in the other of 1/1000th, per <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), it is a stretch to state that the '5hmC levels are predictive of lower non-synonymous mutation frequency' (as in the Abstract).</italic></p><p>The Abstract now does not refer to the predictive power of 5hmC anymore. In general, we have updated this analysis in several aspects. Firstly, we now use the more appropriate D<sup>2</sup> measure (instead of R<sup>2</sup>), since we use <italic>generalised</italic> linear models (GLM). Secondly, we simulated data to test how the D<sup>2</sup> of a “perfect” predictor of mutation rate would be affected by different window sizes and patient numbers. We show that for the given number of patients and the specific window size that we use in our analysis, the D<sup>2</sup> is <italic>expected</italic> to be relatively low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In both our simulated data and additional GLM analyses on genomic windows, the values of D<sup>2</sup> increase with larger sized windows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). For instance, in 3Mbp windows in the real data, the D<sup>2</sup> is as high as 0.45 for a single predictor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) The authors conjecture that a potential (additional) role of hydroxymethylation may be to 'protect' some cell types from mutations. The authors relate to the abundance of hydroxymethylation in long-lived neurons and such a potential role. However, as authors acknowledge in the Discussion, this must be taken with caution since the biological significance as well as tissue-wide distribution of hydroxymethylation is still poorly understood. Authors might also acknowledge that an additional caveat of this work is that the sample studied is heterogeneous. The frontal cortex is composed of not only long-lived neurons but also shorter-lived glial cells. To directly test their hypothesis, it might be necessary to compare sorted cell types with close developmental origin and biological function but with different division rates.</italic></p><p>We have carefully considered this point and agree with the reviewer that more data will be needed to address this particular question adequately. Hence, we decided to remove this tangential part of the analysis and instead focus on the central point of 5hmC mutation rate across cell types. Please see also the response to Reviewer 1 regarding neuronal cells.</p><p><italic>4) Regarding the analysis on driver genes, authors show that cancer driver genes show more 5hmC/total methylated than non-drivers genes. I feel this analysis alone is not sufficient to delineate the relationship between 5hmC and occurrence of cancer driver mutations.</italic></p><p><italic>The comparison between drivers and non-drivers might not be fair, since they might show different mutation rates in cancer. To test the role of 5hmC in genome stability and progression in cancer, would not it be more relevant to test if drivers are enriched for 5hmC compared to passenger genes (i.e., genes that also accumulate mutations in cancer, while not as drivers)?</italic></p><p><italic>If the presence of 5hmC is linked to low mutability at key genes, a testable prediction using ESC 5hmC map would be to show that the genes that are active in development show enrichment for 5hmC.</italic></p><p>This paragraph has been removed as the manuscript now focuses on more in-depth analysis of 5hmC mutation rate across tissue types.</p></body></sub-article></article>
