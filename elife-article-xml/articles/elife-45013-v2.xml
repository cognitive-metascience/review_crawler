In the prevailing view, threat probability estimates are relayed to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) to organize fear output. A straightforward prediction is that vlPAG single-unit activity reflects fear output, invariant of threat probability. We recorded vlPAG single-unit activity in male, Long Evans rats undergoing fear discrimination. Three 10 s auditory cues predicted unique foot shock probabilities: danger (p=1.00), uncertainty (p=0.375) and safety (p=0.00). Fear output was measured by suppression of reward seeking over the entire cue and in one-second cue intervals. Cued fear non-linearly scaled to threat probability and cue-responsive vlPAG single-units scaled their firing on one of two timescales: at onset or ramping toward shock delivery. VlPAG onset activity reflected threat probability, invariant of fear output, while ramping activity reflected both signals with threat probability prioritized.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45013.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain is hard-wired to detect and respond to threats. Catching sight of a spider or a snake, or hearing an unfamiliar sound in the house at night, can make you freeze momentarily. Multiple regions of the brain contribute to this process. According to the textbook view of threat detection, the amygdala and prefrontal cortex estimate the size of the threat. They then send this information to an area called the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG). The vlPAG responds by triggering a fear response such as freezing.</p><p>But some studies suggest that the vlPAG may do more than just trigger a fear response. To test this idea, Wright and McDannald trained rats to associate three different 10-second tones with different probabilities of receiving a mild electric shock to the foot. One of the tones was followed by a foot shock 100% of the time. Another tone was followed by a foot shock 37.5% of the time, while the third was never followed by a foot shock. The first tone thus signaled danger, the second uncertainty, and the third safety.</p><p>Wright and McDannald recorded vlPAG activity as the rats heard each of the tones. The recordings revealed two distinct groups of vlPAG neurons. Both groups responded most to the tone that signaled danger, less to the tone that signaled uncertainty, and least to the tone that signaled safety. However, they responded at different times. One group of neurons was most active at the start of the tone. The activity of this group depended upon the degree of threat, and not upon whether the rat showed a fear response. The second group of neurons increased its activity over the course of each tone. The activity of this group mainly reflected the degree of threat, but also represented the rat's fear response to a lesser extent.</p><p>The vlPAG thus helps to signal the size of a threat, rather than simply generating a fear response. This distinction is important because people with anxiety disorders tend to overestimate threats, and many treatments for anxiety target the brain regions involved in threat estimation. Future studies should examine how the vlPAG works together with other areas, including the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex, to evaluate threats. Understanding this circuit in full could ultimately lead to better treatments for phobias and anxiety.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single-unit</kwd><kwd>threat</kwd><kwd>fear</kwd><kwd>conditioned suppression</kwd><kwd>midbrain</kwd><kwd>associative learning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH117791</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McDannald</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA034010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McDannald</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-unit activity in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray, a brain region implicated in organizing fear output, is found to reflect threat probability, a more versatile threat signal.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>When confronted with potential harm, an estimate of threat probability must be made and followed by an appropriate fear response.

In the canonical fear circuit, threat probability estimates (the stored associative strength of cue and foot shock, forÂ example a danger cue in Pavlovian fear conditioning) originate in amygdalar nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duvarci and Pare, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fanselow and LeDoux, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maren et al., 2013</xref>). Amygdalar threat estimates are sent to the vlPAG, which in turn organizes behavioral components of fear output, most notably freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Perusini and Fanselow, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tovote et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dejean et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Koutsikou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Walker et al., 1997</xref>). While the vlPAG contributes to diverse fear and pain-related processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Assareh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bellgowan and Helmstetter, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Parsons et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McNally et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Johansen et al., 2010</xref>), the view of the vlPAG as a node for fear output is so prevalent, it is commonly presented in introductory neuroscience textbooks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bear et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carlson and Birkett, 2017</xref>).</p><p>A series of studies have uncovered a vlPAG population showing short-latency increases in firing to a danger cue. This characteristic would be expected of neurons organizing fear output. Yet in these studies, robust relationships between vlPAG single-unit activity and freezing were observed in a minority of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tovote et al., 2016</xref>), weakly observed at danger cue onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Watson et al., 2016</xref>), or mixed with activity that purely reflected the danger cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ozawa et al., 2017</xref>). At best, freezing only partially accounted for vlPAG activity. If not freezing, then what aspect of fear do vlPAG neurons signal? Here we test the hypothesis that vlPAG neurons signal threat probability.</p><p>We drew from learning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rescorla, 1968</xref>) to devise a fear discrimination procedure in which three cues predict unique foot shock probabilities: danger (p=1.00), uncertainty (p=0.375) and safety (p=0.00). This behavioral approach was essential as previous studies utilized procedures in which a single cue predicted foot shock with certainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tovote et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Watson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ozawa et al., 2017</xref>), precluding the ability to observe neural activity reflecting threat probability. We measured fear output using conditioned suppression of reward seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rescorla, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bouton and Bolles, 1980</xref>) over the entire cue and in one-second cue intervals. Using this procedure, we have found that suppression non-linearly scales to shock probability. So while suppression is strong to danger, intermediate to uncertainty and weak to safety; uncertainty produces more suppression than would be expected given its shock probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Walker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ray et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DiLeo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wright et al., 2015</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berg et al., 2014</xref>). Concurrent with fear discrimination, we recorded vlPAG single-unit activity. Indeed, the vlPAG could potentially signal fear output via conditioned suppression of reward seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arico et al., 2017</xref>), a long-established measure of fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Estes and Skinner, 1941</xref>)Â thatÂ correlates with freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bouton and Bolles, 1980</xref>). The non-linear relationship between behavior and shock probability permitted us to determine whether vlPAG single-unit activity was better captured by fear output or threat probability.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Six male, Long Evans rats were trained to nose poke in a central port in order to receive a food pellet from a cup below.

Here we use hypothetical nose poke data from four trial types to account for this finding. (<bold>A</bold>) For all trial types, the baseline nose poke rate is 10 (pokes/unit time). (<bold>B</bold>) Nose poke rate during each 1 s interval of the 10 s cue is shown for the four trial types. In trial type 1 (blue), nose poking is perfectly distributed across all ten intervals (five pokes/unit time). In trial type 2 (green), nose poking alternates between 0 pokes/unit time and 10 pokes/unit time every 1 s interval. In trial type 3 (orange), nose poking spikes to 25 pokes/unit time in two intervals, but is zero in all other intervals. In trial type 4 (pink), nose poking is confined to a single interval (50 pokes/unit time). (<bold>C</bold>) These four trial types produce equivalent levels of nose poking when rate over the total cue is considered (five pokes/unit time). (<bold>D</bold>) As expected, calculation of a suppression ratio for the total cue produces identical ratios for each trial type (suppression ratioÂ =Â 0.333). (<bold>E</bold>) Calculation of a suppression ratio for each interval, for each trial type, mirrors the pattern of nose poking. The suppression ratio calculation is designed for maximal sensitivity in detecting decreases in poking. A suppression ratio of 1.0 is found [(10-0) / (10Â +Â 0)Â =Â 1.0] when no poke occurs in an interval. Extreme increases in poking (Trial Type 4, First Interval) are not weighted equivalently to extreme decreases, yielding suppression ratios that fall well short of â1.0 [(10-50) / (10Â +Â 50)Â =Â â0.667]. (<bold>F</bold>) Calculating a suppression ratio for each interval, then averaging the 10 intervals, only produces a ratio equivalent to the total cue if nose poke rates are perfectly distributed across the entire 10 s cue (as in Trial Type 1, suppression ratioÂ =Â 0.333). Of course, the natural nose poking behavior of a rat will never match this fixed schedule. As nose poking becomes imperfectly distributed over the 10 s cue, the mean suppression ratio across all intervals increases [TT4 (0.83)Â &gt;Â TT3 (0.71)Â &gt;Â TT2 (0.50)]. For this reason, suppression ratios calculated in short time intervals (<bold>F</bold>) produce inflated suppression ratios compared to the total cue (<bold>D</bold>). However, inflation is uniform for danger, uncertainty and safety trials, making suppression ratios in short intervals valuable for detected relative differences in suppression ratios.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-45013-fig1-figsupp2-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s3" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45013.006</object-id><label>Figure 1âfigure supplement 3.</label><caption><title>Firing and behavior for every recorded neuron.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A heat plot for normalized firing rate in 1 s intervals is shown for each neuron (y axis, nÂ =Â 245) prior to and following cue onset for each trial type (danger, uncertainty shock, uncertainty omission and safety).

For each single-unit, we calculated the normalized firing rate for each trial (32 total: six danger, six uncertainty shock, 10 uncertainty omission, and 10 safety), in 1 s bins over the 10 s cue. For each trial, we calculated fear on two time scales: total fear (suppression ratio for the entire 10 s cue) and interval fear (suppression ratio for the specific 1 s interval). The corresponding shock probability was assigned for each trial (dangerÂ =Â 1.00, uncertaintyÂ =Â 0.375 and safetyÂ =Â 0.00). Total fear, interval fear and threat probability were used as regressors to explain trial-by-trial variance in single-unit firing.

To examine this, we performed single-unit linear regression for normalized firing in the first 1 s cue interval maintaining the probabilities for danger (1.00) and safety (0.00), but incrementing the probability assigned to uncertainty from 0 to 1 in 0.125 steps (0.000, 0.125, 0.250, 0.375, 0.500, 0.625, 0.750, 0.875, and 1.000).

Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tovote et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Watson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ozawa et al., 2017</xref>), we found a population of Onset neurons with short-latency excitation to danger. Consistent with the most recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ozawa et al., 2017</xref>), we found a Ramping population that increased activity over danger presentation. Onset activity reflected an estimate of threat probability, invariant of fear output. Ramping activity reflected threat probability and fear output, though probability emerged earlier and was stronger overall. While vlPAG signals for fear output could potentially emerge at the ensemble level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jones et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>), these multi-unit codes would be composed of single-units primarily signaling threat probability. Activity reflecting fear output may be found in other vlPAG populations, such as neurons showing inhibition of firing to cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tovote et al., 2015</xref>), or in non-cue-responsive single-units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Insanally et al., 2019</xref>). Yet, this would still mean that signals for threat probability and fear output co-exist in the vlPAG.</p><p>It is important to note that these results are correlative and that Onset neuron activity may not play a causal role in fear output. Previous work has found that short-latency, excitatory responses to danger are largely observed in vlPAG VGlut2Â +neurons, and that excitation of this population is sufficient to produce freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tovote et al., 2016</xref>). Though all Onset neurons fell into the low firing cluster, we cannot conclude these were VGlut2Â +neurons. Moreover, inhibition of vlPAG GABA neurons also promotes freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tovote et al., 2016</xref>). These neurons have comparatively higher baseline firing rates and respond to danger cues through inhibition of neural activity. A causal, vlPAG signal for fear output may be observed in a GABAergic/cue-inhibited population, in concert with or independent of a glutamatergic/cue-excited population. At the same time, it is clear how the observed Onset signal could play a causal role in fear output. Blocking vlPAG Onset activity to danger and uncertainty would equate neural activity to that for safety, removing the threat impetus for suppression of reward seeking, freezing and related defensive behaviors.</p><p>Before further discussing implications, we consider some alternative accounts for the observed firing patterns. Perhaps vlPAG neurons signaling fear output are anatomically distinct from those recorded here. We intentionally recorded from caudal vlPAG, the subregion preferentially activated by fearful contexts in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carrive et al., 1997</xref>). VlPAG manipulations that disrupt fear-related behaviors typically include this more caudal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Oca et al., 1998</xref>), and high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging reveals caudal vlPAG activation specific to aversive stimuli in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Satpute et al., 2013</xref>). We observed threat probability signaling in all recording locations (bregma â7.62 â â7.98). The vlPAG stretchesÂ ~0.7 mm beyond our most caudal recording site. It is therefore possible that neurons signaling fear output are restricted to the extreme caudal vlPAG.</p><p>Maybe the vlPAG signals fear output, but we did not measure the relevant output. Previous studies have failed to find robust relationships between vlPAG activity and cued freezing. Here we used conditioned suppression of rewarded nose poking to provide an objective measure of fear on two timescales and to perhaps better capture vlPAG activity. This measure of fear did not capture Onset neuron firing, and only partially captured Ramping neuron firing at the end of cue presentation. Further, Onset and Ramping activity were not merely driven by nose poke cessation or withdrawal from the port.</p><p>If not freezing, conditioned suppression, or nose poke cessation then perhaps another measure of fear? Danger cues elicit active fear responses: escape-like behaviors such as darting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Greiner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gruene et al., 2015</xref>). However, darting is prevalent in females, but less so in males. Further, the males used in this study had extensive experience with fear discrimination, and at no point was escape from the foot shock possible. Danger cues increase arterial blood pressure and reduce heart rate, however, neither of these abilities has been linked to vlPAG function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Helmstetter and Tershner, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">LeDoux et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wilson and Kapp, 1994</xref>). Danger cues also enhance startle, perhaps more in line with Onset population firing. Yet, dorsal, rather than ventrolateral, PAG subregions have been implicated in startle behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Walker et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhao et al., 2009</xref>). Of course, many other fear behaviors are possible: piloerection, hyperventilation, changes in body temperature, vocalization, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Iwata and LeDoux, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gallego et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vianna and Carrive, 2005</xref>). Problematic is that most fear behaviors are initiated at cue onset and maintained until the aversive event occurs. We did not observe a substantial population of neurons with these temporal firing characteristics, making the vlPAG a poor candidate for sustained fear output. Above all, any potential behavior signaled by Onset neurons must closely match shock probability, confounding this behavior signal with probability itself.</p><p>The present findings are best understood through comparison to the account of vlPAG function outlined in the predatory imminence continuum (PIC), a highly influential theory of defensive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fanselow and Lester, 1988</xref>). Organizing features of the PIC are time and degree of threat. As predation becomes more imminent (pre-encounter â post-encounter â circa-strike), the form and intensity of defensive behaviors change. Cued fear is argued to capture post-encounter defenses: immobility elicited when predators are nearby. In the neural instantiation of PIC, the amygdala integrates information about environmental stimuli (auditory cues here), nociceptive information (foot shock) and time to produce a signal for degree of threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fanselow and Lester, 1988</xref>). This amygdala-derived signal is relayed to the vlPAG to organize fear output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fanselow, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fanselow, 1994</xref>). Implicit in the PIC model, is that the vlPAG does not contain information about degree of threat â only the resultant fear output. Yet, we find that single vlPAG neurons contain detailed information about time and degree of threat.</p><p>These results require more careful consideration of the role of the vlPAG in the fear circuit and the PIC. Rather than signaling fear output, vlPAG Onset neurons signal threat probability. This information <italic>could</italic> be used to organize a variety of fear responses, but these neurons do not intrinsically signal fear output. For example, vlPAG projections to the central amygdala (CeA) and rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) could inform fear output via freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vianna et al., 2008</xref>), while projections to midline/intralaminar thalamus could rapidly relay threat probability estimates to a larger fear network (basolateral amygdala, prelimibic cortex, infralimbic cortex, insular cortex, etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vertes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krout and Loewy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buchanan and Thompson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sengupta and McNally, 2014</xref>), promoting a variety of threat-related processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Faull et al., 2016</xref>). In this way, rapid threat probability estimates generated by vlPAG Onset neurons may be more akin to brainstem-derived signals for rapid detection of visual threats, which are distributed to a wider brain network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liddell et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Neurons responsive toward the end of cue presentation were more heterogeneous, in terms of their baseline firing rate and their signaling. Ramping neurons prioritized threat probability but also signaled fear output. However, Ramping activity could not drive fear output in full. Differential fear to safety, uncertainty and danger was observed even in the first second of cue presentation, when these neurons were unresponsive. Unlike Onset neurons, Ramping neurons showed selective firing throughout the delay period, only diminishing once foot shock had been delivered. Ramping neurons may provide a threat probability estimate that increases as threat draws nearer and peaks when threat is imminent. Ramping neurons may help sustain threat estimates in the absence of explicit stimuli, such as in trace conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McEchron et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">BÃ¼chel et al., 1999</xref>), or estimate more precisely <italic>when</italic> the noxious event will occur. Shifts toward PAG-centric activity are apparent in humans, as capture becomes imminent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mobbs et al., 2007</xref>)Â orÂ natural threats draw closerÂ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mobbs et al., 2010</xref>; with the caveat that neither of these studies could specify the PAG subregion activated.</p><p>Ramping neurons may also provide two forms of feedback: the estimated probability of foot shock and a readout of fear output on that trial. Either type of information could be compared to that trialâs outcome, particularly for uncertainty trials on which shock can be present or absent. This could be used to adjust estimates of threat probability and fear output on <italic>future</italic> encounters with the cue. This is broadly consistent with a central role for the vlPAG in feedback processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McNally et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ozawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yeh et al., 2018</xref>). Even more, this Ramping signal could alter or reduce foot shock processing through descending control of dorsal horn nociceptive inputs via endogenous opioid circuits. This behavioral phenomenon, conditioned analgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">MacLennan et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fanselow and Bolles, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chance et al., 1978</xref>), may be related to a more general phenomenon of placebo analgesia. VlPAG activation is consistently observed in studies of placebo analgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tracey, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eippert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wager and Atlas, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Petrovic et al., 2002</xref>) and our observation of increasing neural activity toward presentation of a noxious event may provide a suitable neural substrate for this process. Perhaps most remarkable is that although independent, between the Onset and Ramping populations, the vlPAG contains an estimate of threat probability from the time of first encounter up through the noxious event itself. The vlPAG may not signal fear output per se, but is rich with information that would inform a variety of fear processes and behaviors.</p><p>If fear output via conditioned suppression is non-linear, and vlPAG activity scales linearly to threat probability, how does the vlPAG fit into the fear circuit? An ultimate explanation for non-linear fear output may be that threat systems evolved to avoid predation, not to precisely match degree of defensive behavior to threat probability. Erring on the side of greater fear to uncertain threats may promote survival. A proximate explanation may be that fear output is the summed product of multiple threat signals. VlPAG output to the RVM may instruct fear output to match threat probability. If this were the only threat signal, then vlPAG activity would in fact reflect fear output. We speculate that additional threat signals govern fear output. For example, neurons in the retrorubral field (RRF) project to the RVM, as well as the CeA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zahm and Trimble, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deutch et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Von Krosigk and Smith, 1991</xref>). Preliminary data from our laboratory suggest that RRF neurons are primarily responsive to danger and uncertainty, but weight uncertainty similarly to danger (dangerÂ =Â uncertaintyÂ &gt; safety). RRF neurons may signal threat probability plus uncertainty-induced stress, or may favor cue-shock contiguity over contingency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rescorla, 1967</xref>). Summation of vlPAG-derived and RRF-derived threat signals by RVM neurons would produce a non-linear fear output like that observed in our discrimination procedure.</p><p>The results pose questions about the specific relationship between the vlPAG and the CeA. VlPAG threat probability signals may be trained up by the CeA, but become CeA-independent with sufficient training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ozawa et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with this interpretation, the CeA is essential to the acquisition of conditioned suppression with limited training, but that more extended training mitigates the effects of CeA lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McDannald, 2010</xref>). This is not to say that we would expect the CeA to become inessential following extensive fear discrimination training. Updating threat probability should occur when environmental stimuli become more or less predictive of noxious events. We anticipate the CeA is essential to updating vlPAG threat probability signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McNally et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ozawa et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>It is near universally accepted that the amygdala is a key node of dysfunction in stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rauch et al., 2000</xref>) and anxiety disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Etkin and Wager, 2007</xref>). This may be driven in part by technical considerations: whole-brain fMRI can detect amygdala BOLD signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Johnstone et al., 2005</xref>), while detecting subregion-specific PAG BOLD signals requires a more deliberate approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Satpute et al., 2013</xref>). Perhaps the primary intellectual driver is that the amygdala is theorized to be a privileged cite of integration/learning in the fear circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mahan and Ressler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Admon et al., 2013</xref>). The present findings illustrate that the amygdala is not privileged in this regard, and mark the vlPAG as likely node of dysfunction in psychiatric disorders of stress and anxiety. Appreciation for the vlPAG as a site of integration will hasten mapping of a more complete fear circuit. Deliberate study of vlPAG function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arico et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Assareh et al., 2017</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rozeske et al., 2018</xref>)Â and dysfunction in psychiatric diseaseÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yeh et al., 2018</xref>), will be essential to developing effective therapies for disorders characterized by exaggerated threat estimation and aberrant fear.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifier</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-Tryptophan Hydroxylase Raised in Sheep</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">Cat #

All rats were implanted with drivable microelectrode bundles. Data are reported from six rats; three rats did not yield units and one rat had incorrect electrode placement. All rats were single-housed throughout the duration of the experiment on a 12 hr light cycle (lights off at 6:00pm) and maintained at 85% of their free-feeding body weight with standard laboratory chow (18% Protein Rodent Diet #2018, Harlan Teklad Global Diets, Madison, WI) except during an 11 day, post-surgery recovery period where animals had <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to standard chow. <italic>Ad libitum</italic> access to water was always available in the home cage.

All wires were electrically connected to a nano-strip omnetics connector (A79042-001, Omnetics Connector Corp., Minneapolis, MN) on a custom 24-contact, individually routed and gold immersed circuit board (San Francisco Circuits, San Mateo, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Surgery</title><p>Stereotaxic surgery was performed aseptic conditions under isoflurane anesthesia (1â5% in oxygen). Carprofen (i.p., 5 mg/kg) and lactated ringers solution (~2â5 mL) were administered preoperatively. The skull was scoured in a crosshatch pattern with a scalpel blade to increase efficacy of implant adhesion. Five screws were installed in the skull to further stabilize the connection between the skull, electrode assembly and a protective head cap (screw placements: two anterior to bregma, two between bregma and lambda aboutÂ ~3 mm medial to the lateral ridges of the skull, and one on the midlineÂ ~5 mm posterior of lambda). A 1.4 mm diameter craniotomy was performed to remove a circular skull section centered on the implant site and the underlying dura was removed to expose the cortex. Nichrome recording wires were freshly cut with surgical scissors to extendÂ ~2.0 mm beyond the cannula at aÂ ~15Â° angle. Just before implant, current was delivered to each recording wire in a saline bath, stripping each tip of its formvar insulation. Current was supplied by a 12 V lantern battery and each Omnetics connector contact was stimulated for 2 s using a resistor-equipped lead. Machine grease was placed by the cannula and on the microdrive.</p><p>For implantation dorsal to the vlPAG, the electrode assembly was slowly advanced at a 20Â° angle to the following coordinates from cortex (anterior-posterior: â8.00 mm, medial-lateral: â2.45 mm and dorsal-ventral: â5.52 mm). Once in place, stripped ends of both ground wires were wrapped around a sixth screw inserted previously to ground the electrode (anterior-posterior: â8.00 mm, medial-lateral:Â +2.45 mm). The microdrive base and a protective head cap surrounding the electrode assembly were cemented in place at the end of the procedure using orthodontic resin (C 22-05-98, Pearson Dental Supply, Sylmar, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Behavior apparatus</title><p>The apparatus for Pavlovian fear conditioning consisted of two individual chambers with aluminum front and back walls retrofitted with clear plastic covers, clear acrylic sides and top, and a grid floor. Each grid floor bar was electrically connected to an aversive shock generator (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT) through a grounding device. This permitted the floor to be grounded at all times except during shock delivery. An external food cup and a central nose poke opening, equipped with infrared photocells were present on one wall. Auditory stimuli were presented through two speakers mounted on the ceiling.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Nose poke acquisition</title><p>Prior to discrimination sessions, rats were food-deprived to 85% of their free-feeding body weight and were fed specifically to maintain this weight through the behavioral procedure. Starting on P59, rats were shaped to nose poke for pellet delivery in the experimental chamber using a fixed ratio schedule in which one nose poke yielded one pellet. Shaping sessions lasted 30 min or until approximately 50 nose pokes were completed. Over the next 3 days, rats were placed on 5 days of variable interval (VI) schedules in which nose pokes were reinforced on average every 30 s (day 1), or 60 s (days 2 through 5). For the remainder of behavioral testing, nose pokes were reinforced on a VI-60 schedule independent of all Pavlovian contingencies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Pre-exposure</title><p>In two separate sessions, each rat was pre-exposed to the three cues to be used in Pavlovian discrimination. Auditory cues consisted of repeating motifs of broadband click, phaser or trumpet.

Each session consisted of 32 trials, with a mean ITI of 3.5 min. Auditory cues were 10 s in duration and consisted of repeating motifs of a broadband click, phaser, or trumpet. Each cue was associated with a unique probability of foot shock (0.5 mA, 0.5 s): danger, p=1.00; uncertainty, p=0.375; and safety, p=0.00. Auditory identity was counterbalanced across rats. Foot shock was administered 2 s following the termination of the auditory cue on danger and uncertainty shock trials. This was done in order to observe possible neural activity during the delay period not driven by an explicit cue. A single session consisted of six danger trials, ten uncertainty no-shock trials, six uncertainty shock trials, and ten safety trials. The order of trial type presentation was randomly determined by the behavioral program, and differed for each rat, each session. After the eighth session, rats were removed from discrimination, given full food and received stereotaxic surgery. Following recovery, discrimination (identical to that described above) resumed with single-unit recording. Animals received discrimination every other day with recording.

During recording sessions, a 1x amplifying head stage connected the Omnetics connector to the commutator via a shielded recording cable (head stage: 40684â020 and Cable: 91809â017, Plexon Inc, Dallas TX). Analog neural activity was digitized and high-pass filtered via amplifier to remove low-frequency artifacts and sent to the Ominplex D acquisition system (Plexon Inc, Dallas TX). Behavioral events (cues, shocks, nose pokes) were controlled and recorded by a computer running Med Associates software. Timestamped events from Med Associates were sent to Ominplex D acquisition system via a dedicated interface module (DIG-716B). The result was a single file (.pl2) containing all time stamps for recording and behavior. Single-units were sorted offline with a template-based spike-sorting algorithm (Offline Sorter V3, Plexon Inc, Dallas TX). Timestamped spikes and events (cues, shocks, nose pokes) were extracted and analyzed with statistical routines in MATLAB (Natick, MA). Neural activity was recorded throughout the 500 ms shock delivery period. However, we cannot be certain that shock artifact did not disrupt spike collection, so we do not present activity from this period.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="s4-10-1"><title>Calculating suppression ratios</title><p>Fear was measured by suppression of rewarded nose poking, calculated as a ratio: (baseline poke rate â cue poke rate) / (baseline poke rateÂ +cue poke rate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rescorla, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pickens et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anglada-Figueroa and Quirk, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arico and McNally, 2014</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McDannald and Galarce, 2011</xref>). A ratio of â1â indicated high fear, â0â low fear, and gradations between intermediate levels of fear. Use of the suppression ratio permitted the objective measure of relative fear in 1 s intervals across the cue, as well as total fear over the entire 10 s cue presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wright et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>K-means clustering</title><p>The following characteristics were determined for each neuron: baseline firing rate, half the duration of the mean waveform and amplitude ratio of the mean waveform. Duration was determined by measuring the time (ms) from peak depolarization to the trough of after-hyperpolarization and dividing by two. Amplitude ratio was calculated using (n â p) / (nÂ +Â p), in which p=initial hyperpolarization (in mV) and nÂ =Â maximal depolarization (in mV). This approach has been used to successfully separate neuron types in the ventral tegmental area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Roesch et al., 2007</xref>). K-means clustering used these three firing characteristics to partition the 245 recorded neurons into two clusters (kÂ =Â 2). Two clusters were chosen because previous studies have found that two neuron types, glutamatergic vGluT2 neurons and GABAergic Gad1 neurons, comprise the majority of vlPAG neurons, and these neurons can be differentiated by baseline firing rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tovote et al., 2016</xref>). ANOVA for cluster results found that only baseline firing rate contributed to cluster membership (F<sub>1,243</sub> = 829, p&lt;0.001). Neither amplitude ratio nor duration reached significance (FsÂ &lt;0.2, psÂ &gt;0.6).

Mean firing rate over the 320 bins was calculated by averaging all trials for each trial type. Mean differential firing was calculated for each of the 320 bins by subtracting mean baseline firing rate (2 s prior to cue onset), specific to that trial type, from each bin. Mean differential firing was Z-score normalized across all trial types within a single neuron, such that mean firingÂ =Â 0, and standard deviation in firingÂ =Â 1. Z-score normalization was applied to firing across the entirety of the recording epoch, as opposed to only the baseline period, in case neurons showed little/no baseline activity. As a result, periods of phasic, excitatory firing contributed to normalized mean firing rate (0). For this reason, Z-score normalized baseline activity is below zero in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A &amp; C</xref>. Z-score normalized firing during cue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>) and post-cue periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>), was analyzed with ANOVA using bin and trial-type as factors. F and p values are reported, as well as partial eta squared and observed power.</p><p>For post hoc cue firing analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D</xref>), cue correlation analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> all), and cue regression analyses, it was necessary to calculate normalized firing in 1 s intervals. To do this, differential firing in the interval of interest (for example, first cue 1 s interval) was calculated for each individual of the 32 trials in a single session. Differential firing in this interval was then Z-score transformed. This process was repeated for each interval of interest. This done in order to maximize the distribution of firing within a single interval. Importantly, statistical outcomes were identical if a single Z-score transformation was applied to all intervals at once. An identical approach was used to Z-score normalize firing in 500 ms intervals for post-cue firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Determining observed and expected cue firing patterns</title><p>The analysis for Onset neurons (nÂ =Â 29) utilized mean normalized firing to each cue (danger, uncertainty and safety) in the first 1 s interval; analysis for Ramping neurons (nÂ =Â 14) utilized firing in the last 1 s interval. Relative firing to the three cues was used to categorize each Onset and Ramping neuron: (d &gt; u &gt; s), (d &gt; s &gt; u), (s &gt; u &gt; d) or (u &gt; d &gt; s). Counting the number observed in each category determined the actual number for each population. In order to determine the number in each category expected by chance, each neurons firing pattern was shuffled and the number of neurons in each category counted. Shuffling and counting neuron category was repeated 1000 times for each population. Box and whisker plots for each category/population were constructed showing the median, 25<sup>th</sup> percentile, 75<sup>th</sup> percentile and most extreme non-outliers. The actual number and expected statistics are reported plotted together in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D/H</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Population and single-unit firing analyses</title><p>Population firing was analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with trial type and bin (100 ms) as factors. ANOVA for cue firing contained three trial types (danger, uncertainty and safety). Uncertainty trial types were collapsed because they did not differ for either suppression ratio or firing analysis. This was expected, during cue presentation rats did not know the current uncertainty trial type. ANOVA for post-cue firing contained four trial types (danger, uncertainty shock, uncertainty omission and safety). Uncertainty trial types were split because shock was delivered during the period. F statistic, p value, observed power and partial eta squared are reported for effects and interactions. Interval firing was compared within a population using a two-tailed, dependent samples t-test. Identical firing analyses were performed for the post-cue period, only now four trial types were used (danger, uncertainty shock, uncertainty omission and safety).</p><p>The sliding window analysis for the Ramping population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) employed a two-tailed, dependent samples t-test. Ramping population danger firing was compared to safety firing in 1 s intervals, with the window advancing in 100 ms steps across cue presentation. The p value for each comparison was recorded, and the first window with p&lt;0.05 was termed the interval of departure (when danger and safety firing significant differed). The same analysis was performed for uncertainty and safety. Change in firing from interval of departure to the final 1 s window was calculated by subtracting the departure firing rate from the last 1 s window firing rate and dividing by time between these two periods.</p><p>Biases in single-unit firing to the three cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) were determined using the sign test comparing z firing to danger vs. uncertainty, and uncertainty vs. safety. The relationship between firing was determined using the Pearson correlation coefficient.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Single-unit, linear regression</title><p>Single-unit, linear regression was used to determine the degree to which fear output and threat probability explained trial-by-trial variation in firing of single neurons in a specific time interval. The cue analysis used 1 s intervals, while the post-cue analyses used 500 ms intervals. Shorter intervals were used in the post-cue analysis to accommodate the 500 ms foot shock duration. For each regression, all 32 trials from a single session were ordered by type. Z-firing was specified for the interval of interest. The interval fear regressor was the suppression ratio for that specific interval/trial, while the total fear regressor was the suppression ratio for the entire cue, for that specific trial. The probability regressor was the foot shock probability associated with the specific cue. Regression (using the regress function in MATLAB) required a separate, constant input. To better visualize the organization of the regression input, the complete regression input for first interval firing of an Onset neuron is shown below. Identical regression analysis was performed for the post-cue period, only now 500 ms intervals were examined and the total fear regressor was removed. This interval was used to accommodate the 500 ms shock period and the total fear regressor was removed because it only sampled behavior from the 10 s cue period.</p><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable1"

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Geoffrey Schoenbaum as the Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Satoshi Ikemoto (Reviewer #2) and Laura Bradfield (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study the authors recorded from PAG neurons during a fear discrimination task. Three cues predicted certain, uncertain, and no shock. They measured fear during the 10s cues as suppression behavior, demonstrating discriminative fear responding. However the degree of the difference between the certain and uncertain shock was larger than the difference in suppression, especially early, which was quite similar for these two cues. Subsequent analyses of unit firing revealed populations of onset and ramping neurons that seemed to reflect the fear response as shown previously. However a more careful analysis regressing firing on probability of shock versus behavior showed that onset neurons were primarily reflecting probability and ramping neurons reflected a combination of the two. These data nicely show that contrary to current proposals in simpler tasks, the firing of PAG neurons is not simply reflective of behavioral or fear output and instead reflects a more careful assessment of the actual probability of shock or danger.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall the reviewers were very positive. The report provides novel information on how PAG responses correlate with shock probability versus behavioral output, information somewhat contradictory to current ideas that PAG drives the response. However all three reviewers shared the general concern that the conclusion did not consider some possible alternatives or problems in the approach. Reviewer #1 suggests that it assumes a linear relationship between shock probability and behavior; reviewer #2 worries that there is not a sufficient exploration of the probability space for a regression analysis, and reviewer #3 raises the possibility that other factors, like stress, might add to the fear from shock probability. These concerns might be addressed with additional analyses (population comparisons or analyses of specific units showing that many discriminate different probability cues when behavior does not). However, to some extent they mostly require some mention in the Discussion. Being clear that suppression is what is measured (in Abstract and elsewhere) as fear may also be helpful. In addition to this, reviewer #3 also made the point that the recording study is correlational. Some discussion regarding whether these signals are generated in PAG or received from upstream areas like amygdala, and whether they are prominent enough to guarantee output downstream would be a useful addition.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>Please look through the paper and try to smooth out any complex writing like that identified by reviewer 2. Please see the individual reviews, which are provided in their entirety below, for other suggestions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this study the authors recorded from PAG neurons during a fear discrimination task. Three cues predicted certain, uncertain, and no shock. They measured fear during the 10s cues as suppression behavior, demonstrating discriminative fear responding. However the degree of the difference between the certain and uncertain shock was larger than the difference in suppression, especially early, which was quite similar for these two cues. Subsequent analyses of unit firing revealed populations of onset and ramping neurons that seemed to reflect the fear response as shown previously. However a more careful analysis regressing firing on probability of shock versus behavior showed that onset neurons were primarily reflecting probability and ramping neurons reflected a combination of the two. These data nicely show that contrary to current proposals in simpler tasks, the firing of PAG neurons is not simply reflective of behavioral or fear output and instead reflects a more careful assessment of the actual probability of shock or danger. Overall I thought the study was creative and the analysis was careful and the results clear. I have only a few suggestions.</p><p>1) The initial screen seemed to identify neurons that had heightened activity to any of the cues. Were all the neurons selective for the proper order or was there variability in preferred cues?</p><p>I think the supplementary figure showing the variance captured by different regressors was convincing. Some display of this might be in the main text.</p><p>One alternative or clarification that I think might be helpful also is for the authors to more clearly explain how their task allows them to dissociate the two ideas about what PAG neurons are encoding. Assuming I am correct this is both simple as well as an elegant solution to the problem. It should be made clear I think to help the reader understand how it is done. Relatedly a small caveat may need to be put in the Discussion to the effect that their conclusion (I think) assumes a linear relationship between firing and behavior. Since they have another variable â threat â that provides a much better correlation I accept this as a reasonable assumption here. But I think if I am correct that it should be mentioned.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors investigated neural activity of the vlPAG with respect to behavioral suppression induced by shock-associated cues. They focused on two types of neurons: ones that responded to the onset of cue associated with shock and those that displayed ramping responses to shock. They found that activities of both types of neurons were better correlated with the probability of shock delivery rather than cue-induced suppression.</p><p>My concern is that a key finding of the study depends on a linear regression analysis containing a measurement variable with only three values: threat probabilities of 0, 0.375, and 1.0. I would have felt more confident if the experiment had more probability values.</p><p><italic>Minor Comments:</italic> </p><p>Writing is hard. It sometimes requires effort to understand. Here are examples:</p><p>âramping activity prioritized threat probability over fear output.â</p><p>âvlPAG signals for fear output may reside in other functional populations, such has neurons showing inhibition of firing to danger cues [Tovote, Fadok and Luthi, 2015].â</p><p>âYet, this would still require that adjacent populations for threat probability and fear output exist within the vlPAG.â</p><p>Abstract</p><p>The key dependent measure, conditioned suppression, should be mentioned in the Abstract section. Remember that this is a primary scientific report. Although theoretical constructs such as &quot;fear&quot; can be mentioned, the concrete measure of fear should be identified in Abstract.</p><p>Results</p><p>Throughout the Results section, t-tests were conducted as post-hoc comparisons after ANOVAs. Are the familywise error rates controlled?</p><p>Discussion</p><p>An observation with statistical data is described for the first time in the Discussion section. Such information should be reported in the result section. In addition, the authors discussion is not coherent. The authors first state that their electrophysiological observation was performed in the caudal vlPAG. Then, they state that the neural activity of the caudal vlPAG is not different from those of the rostral subregion. Explain how they can tell subregional difference when they focused on the caudal subregion.</p><p>Perhaps, it is important to discuss the present findings in light of the findings that selective lesions of vlPAG is sufficient to disrupt freezing. It does not seem to be difficult to explain how the loss of neurons coding threat probability can disrupt behavioral expression of fear.</p><p>The authors state &quot;We did not observe a substantial population of vlPAG neurons with these temporal firing characteristics (Figure 1âfigure supplement 3), making the vlPAG a poor candidate for signaling most forms of sustained fear output&quot;. This statement is based on the assumption that much larger neural populations are needed to control behavior. However, research on neural ensemble suggests that the loss of only a handful neurons is sufficient to affect behavior. For example, Koya et al., 2009, found that only 2 â 3% of neurons are responsible for mediating context-specific sensitization induced by cocaine administration (Nat Neurosci, 12(8), 1069-1073. doi: http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v12/n8/suppinfo/nn.2364_S1.html).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Wright and McDannald present a comprehensive and elegant set of experiments showing that, contrary to the currently prevailing view, single-unit signalling in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) appears to reflect threat probability independently of fear output. They used three distinct auditory cues that predicted footshock with certainty (p = 1), uncertainty (p =.375) or not at all (i.e. safety, p = 0). They found that two distinct populations of vlPAG neurons: onset and ramping neurons, primarily reflected threat probability rather than fear output (as measured by conditioned suppression of an appetitively-trained nose-poke behaviour). Overall I think this article is superb, extremely well-written and easy to follow, a very interesting topic, and a thoughtful discussion of results.</p><p><italic>Minor Comments:</italic> </p><p>There are a couple of very minor points I would like to suggest for improvement. None of the concerns are substantive.</p><p>1) The most pressing issue I would like to see addressed is the fact that although electrophysiological recording of single-units is extremely informative, it does not actually provide us with causal data, only correlational. Indeed, the authors acknowledge and deal with this in the discussion, there addressing most of the notes I had made to myself whilst reading the manuscript, which was very satisfying. However, there's one more possibility I would like to see addressed, and that is that the firing patterns they are observing in vlPAG neurons represent information being received from the amygdala, rather than a signal that is being transferred to downstream targets. In other words, does the amygdala code for threat probability, send this information to vlPAG where it then translates it into the necessity for a particular fear response. Unfortunately this is impossible to test with ephys, but I would like to see it mentioned as a possibility, and possibly argued against if the authors see it as unlikely.</p><p>2) Further, it is worth noting that uncertainty in and of itself is a stressor, which could explain the fact that the fear output towards the uncertainty cue is higher than might be expected. It could be that the amygdala is encoding the threat probability and that information is being conveyed to the vlPAG, but that the additional stress from uncertainty is being encoded elsewhere in the brain and added to the fear output response at some unknown mediating output structure.</p><p>3) In the Results it would be really helpful to see how many rats/neurons etc. were included in the study as I had to search through to find this information.</p><p>4) In Figure 1âfigure supplement 3, the authors suggest (at least as I understand it) that there is no relation between normalised firing rate and suppression ratio in the overall population of neurons, but from looking at the graph it appears that there might be at least a weak negative correlation? That is, when normalised firing rate was lowest, in the danger condition, suppression ratio appears to be at its highest (indicating high fear), and vice versa for the safety conditions. Is that correct or am I missing something?</p><p>5) In the last paragraph of the subsection âRamping neurons signal threat probability through delay until shock receiptâ, Figures 1E and 1F are referred to, I believe this should say Figures 6E and 6F.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45013.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[â¦] 1) The initial screen seemed to identify neurons that had heightened activity to any of the cues. Were all the neurons selective for the proper order or was there variability in preferred cues?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent idea. To address this, we have performed a new analysis to address this question and the results are reported in Figure 4D/H (subsection âPopulation biases are evident in vlPAG single-unitsâ). Separately for Onset and Ramping populations, we counted the number of neurons showing the ordered firing pattern (danger &gt; uncertainty &gt; safety). We also counted the number of neurons showing the next 3 most common firing patterns. We shuffled each neuronâs normalized firing rate to danger, uncertainty and safety and then counted the number of neurons for each pattern type. This process was repeated 1000 times to generate a distribution from the shuffled firing data. This would tell how often we would expect each pattern to occur by chance. The actual values were then compared to the distributions. The number of Onset and Ramping neurons showing the ordered firing pattern (danger &gt; uncertainty &gt; safety) fell entirely outside of the shuffled distribution, while neurons with all other firing patterns fell within the distribution. The results reveal that the ordered firing pattern was greater than would have been expected by chance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think the supplementary figure showing the variance captured by different regressors was convincing. Some display of this might be in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to address a concern of reviewer 2, we performed a new analysis in which we asked if the relative firing pattern to danger, uncertainty and safety by Onset (subsection âOnset neurons signal threat probabilityâ) and Ramping neurons (subsection âRamping neurons prioritize threat probability over fear outputâ) was better captured by a probability other than 0.375. The result of this analysis was a âtuning curveâ showing that Onset neurons were best captured by the actual shock probability while Ramping neurons were slightly shifted right (now reported in Figure 5). As a part of this analysis, one can visualize the result of the âbinaryâ regression result in which safety and uncertainty were both assigned probabilities of 0.000. We have made sure to point this out in the Results section and have kept the full description of the binary regression in the supplement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One alternative or clarification that I think might be helpful also is for the authors to more clearly explain how their task allows them to dissociate the two ideas about what PAG neurons are encoding. Assuming I am correct this is both simple as well as an elegant solution to the problem. It should be made clear I think to help the reader understand how it is done. Relatedly a small caveat may need to be put in the Discussion to the effect that their conclusion (I think) assumes a linear relationship between firing and behavior. Since they have another variable â threat â that provides a much better correlation I accept this as a reasonable assumption here. But I think if I am correct that it should be mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the non-linear behavior output we observed must be reconciled with the linearly scaled activity we observe in the vlPAG. We have now devoted a significant portion of the Discussion to this problem (tenth-twelfth paragraphs). Briefly, we think that a vlPAG-derived threat signal is but one of multiple signals that ultimately control fear output. We have evidence that a threat signal originating from the retrorubral field weights uncertainty much more like danger. Summing these two threat signals would better approximate the non-linear behavior output we see in our discrimination procedure.</p><p>We also agree that understanding this non-linearity is key to understanding the results. For this reason we now also describe the non-linearity of fear output in the Introduction to better set up the reader for the analyses we perform in the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[â¦] My concern is that a key finding of the study depends on a linear regression analysis containing a measurement variable with only three values: threat probabilities of 0, 0.375, and 1.0. I would have felt more confident if the experiment had more probability values.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid concern. To address this, we have performed a new regression analysis in which we incremented the probability assigned to uncertainty from 0.000 to 1.000 in 0.125. We report the Î² coefficient for threat probability for each increment in Figure 5E/J (subsection âRamping neurons prioritize threat probability over fear outputâ). The result is a âtuning curveâ showing the uncertainty probability that best captures the relative firing pattern of each population. For Onset neurons, this analysis revealed the actual probability of 0.375 to be the âpeakâ of the tuning curve. This provides further evidence that Onset neurons are tuned to shock probability. For Ramping neurons, the peak was shifted right, consistent with more mixed signaling of threat probability and fear output. We are grateful for this suggested analysis as we feel it confirms and extends the regression findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>Writing is hard. It sometimes requires effort to understand. Here are examples:</p><p>âramping activity prioritized threat probability over fear output.â</p><p>âvlPAG signals for fear output may reside in other functional populations, such has neurons showing inhibition of firing to danger cues [Tovote, Fadok and Luthi, 2015].â</p><p>âYet, this would still require that adjacent populations for threat probability and fear output exist within the vlPAG.â</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that those sections, and others, were difficult to read. We have revised them and have carefully read through the remainder of the manuscript. In addition, we have solicited the help of our new postdoc, Jasmin Strickland â someone with extensive knowledge of behavior but not involved in writing this manuscript â to read all sections for clarity. We have revised sections she found difficult to understand. She is acknowledged for her contribution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Abstract</p><p>The key dependent measure, conditioned suppression, should be mentioned in the Abstract section. Remember that this is a primary scientific report. Although theoretical constructs such as &quot;fear&quot; can be mentioned, the concrete measure of fear should be identified in Abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree. We now describe conditioned suppression as our measure of fear in the Abstract. We also note the experiment was performed with male, Long Evans rats.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results</p><p>Throughout the Results section, t-tests were conducted as post-hoc comparisons after ANOVAs.

In revising the manuscript, we found that we had not performed these corrections for the paired t-tests in the interval suppression ratio figure (Figure 1D) as well as the single-sample t-tests in the interval regression figures (Figure 5D/I and Figure 6C/D). We have now corrected for multiple tests in all of these figures. The statistical patterns did not change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion</p><p>An observation with statistical data is described for the first time in the Discussion section. Such information should be reported in the result section. In addition, the authors discussion is not coherent. The authors first state that their electrophysiological observation was performed in the caudal vlPAG. Then, they state that the neural activity of the caudal vlPAG is not different from those of the rostral subregion. Explain how they can tell subregional difference when they focused on the caudal subregion.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fair point. We have moved all stats reported in the Discussion to the Results. We apologize for the poor wording re: rostral and caudal. The vlPAG has an extensive anterior/posterior extent. In comparison to the full extent, all of our recordings came from the caudal portion. Our recordings centered on bregma levels -7.62 and -7.98. We meant to state that there was no difference in the signals obtained from these two recording levels. We also note that the vlPAG extends nearly to -8.70, and that because we did not record from this most extreme caudal extent, it is possible that neurons signaling fear output reside there. We have clarified this point in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Perhaps, it is important to discuss the present findings in light of the findings that selective lesions of vlPAG is sufficient to disrupt freezing. It does not seem to be difficult to explain how the loss of neurons coding threat probability can disrupt behavioral expression of fear.</p></disp-quote><p>We definitely agree and have added this to the manuscript (Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors state &quot;We did not observe a substantial population of vlPAG neurons with these temporal firing characteristics (Figure 1âfigure supplement 3), making the vlPAG a poor candidate for signaling most forms of sustained fear output&quot;. This statement is based on the assumption that much larger neural populations are needed to control behavior. However, research on neural ensemble suggests that the loss of only a handful neurons is sufficient to affect behavior. For example, Koya et al., 2009, found that only 2 â 3% of neurons are responsible for mediating context-specific sensitization induced by cocaine administration (Nat Neurosci, 12(8), 1069-1073. doi: http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v12/n8/suppinfo/nn.2364_S1.html).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have removed all language suggesting the small number of high firing rate cue-responsive neurons diminishes their possible role in behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>There are a couple of very minor points I would like to suggest for improvement.

We are only reporting a correlate, and we have not determined whether our observed neurons contribute to fear output. The question concerning the amygdala-vlPAG relationship is a valid one. We favor an interpretation in which central amygdala inputs train up the vlPAG, and with sufficient training vlPAG activity becomes independent. In support, Ozawa and colleagues have shown that inhibiting CeA inputs to the vlPAG has no impact on activity at cue onset and only partially reducing vlPAG ramping activity (Ozawa et al., 2017). Further, Lee and colleagues have shown that the CeA is required for the acquisition of conditioned suppression with minimal training trials, but that with more extensive fear conditioning, the CeA is no longer required (Lee et al., 2005). I observed a similar pattern for the CeA in one of my dissertation experiments (McDannald, 2010). This discussion is now included in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Further, it is worth noting that uncertainty in and of itself is a stressor, which could explain the fact that the fear output towards the uncertainty cue is higher than might be expected.

That is, when normalised firing rate was lowest, in the danger condition, suppression ratio appears to be at its highest (indicating high fear), and vice versa for the safety conditions. Is that correct or am I missing something?</p></disp-quote><p>We included Figure 1âfigure supplement 3 so that neural activity, and two indicators of fear output (nose poke rate and suppression ratio), could be visualized in once place. From our view, the main takeaways are (1) the two measures of fear output strongly resemble one another. This means that by using a ratio, we werenât fundamentally changing the data. (2) Behavior was very consistent across all recording sessions. That is, the behavior in sessions from which we recorded Onset neurons (neurons 1-29 on y axis) was virtually identical to the other recording sessions. This means that the correlate we observed was not due to sampling odd or outlier behavioral sessions. (3) It is also apparent from this figure that almost no neurons are uniquely safety-responsive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the last paragraph of the subsection âRamping neurons signal threat probability through delay until shock receiptâ, Figures 1E and 1F are referred to, I believe this should say Figures 6E and 6F.</p></disp-quote><p>The error has been corrected.</p></body></sub-article></article>
