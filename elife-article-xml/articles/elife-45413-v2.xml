architecture and organization. Quantification of junctions of mammalian epithelia requires laborious manual measurements that are a major roadblock for mechanistic studies. We designed Junction Mapper as an open access, semi-automated software that defines the status of adhesiveness via the simultaneous measurement of pre-defined parameters at cell–cell contacts. It identifies contacting interfaces and corners with minimal user input and quantifies length, area and intensity of junction markers. Its ability to measure fragmented junctions is unique. Importantly, junctions that considerably deviate from the contiguous staining and straight contact phenotype seen in epithelia are also successfully quantified (i.e. cardiomyocytes or endothelia). Distinct phenotypes of junction disruption can be clearly differentiated among various oncogenes, depletion of actin regulators or stimulation with other agents. Junction Mapper is thus a powerful, unbiased and highly applicable software for profiling cell–cell adhesion phenotypes and facilitate studies on junction dynamics in health and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>image analysis</kwd><kwd>computer vision</kwd><kwd>tissue cohesion</kwd><kwd>cell-cell contacts</kwd><kwd>software development</kwd><kwd>junction regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/M026310/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Braga</surname><given-names>Vania MM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M022617/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Braga</surname><given-names>Vania MM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C1282/A11980</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Braga</surname><given-names>Vania MM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>VIDI 016.156.327</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huveneers</surname><given-names>Stephan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002761</institution-id><institution>Prime Minister's Office, Brunei Darussalam</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPLL/A/4:A[2010]/J1(703)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mohd Naim</surname><given-names>Noor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01HL141855-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gorelik</surname><given-names>Julia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG/17/13/33173</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gorelik</surname><given-names>Julia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Junction Mapper is a powerful new semi-automated software that provides a fingerprint of cell–cell contact morphometry and receptor density alterations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tight contacts with neighbours to form a cohesive sheet of cells is a fundamental property of multicellular organisms and underpins organ development and function. Conversely, signalling pathways necessary to maintain junctions are often targeted by pathogens and underlie key mechanisms of diseases of the vasculature, heart and different epithelial organs.</p><p>Attachment to neighbouring cells has a distinct configuration in different cell types and is dynamically remodelled in homeostasis and diseases. In epithelial tissues, the characteristic cell–cell adhesion site appears as a straight and tense or stiff junction, represented by an apparent contiguous, adjoining staining of E-cadherin receptors (the epithelia-specific cadherin protein). Following stimuli such as growth factor treatment or oncogene expression in epithelial cells, the dynamic nature of cell–cell contacts is manifested in a variety of ways: disturbances in the configuration of the contacting interface between cells, fragmentation of cadherin staining or thinning out of the distribution of receptors from contacting cell borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braga et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Erasmus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frasa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lozano et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nola et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>However, a linear junction appearance does not apply to other cell types that also require strong cell–cell attachment. Intercalated discs, specialised junctions in cardiomyocytes, sustain considerable mechanical stress with heart beating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ehler, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vermij et al., 2017</xref>). Extensive remodelling of the intercalated discs composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Estigoy et al., 2009</xref>) and architecture is observed in cardiac `aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sessions and Engler, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tribulova et al., 2015</xref>), diabetes-induced cardiopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adeghate and Singh, 2014</xref>), arrythmogenic cardiomyopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calore et al., 2015</xref>) and cardiac hypertrophy and failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lyon et al., 2015</xref>). During vascular homeostasis, endothelial cell–cell contacts may have a similar appearance as epithelial junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dejana and Orsenigo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Malinova and Huveneers, 2018</xref>). Upon stimulation with inflammatory agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Radeva and Waschke, 2018</xref>), endothelial contacts undergo adjustments to increase permeability, changing from a linear to a zig-zag configuration and the appearance of gaps between cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Malinova and Huveneers, 2018</xref>). Collectively, the above data demonstrate that distinct patterns of junctions are stimulus-dependent and reflect the specific destabilization (or strengthening) of cadherin receptors at contact sites in various cell types.</p><p>Despite the extensive scientific progress in our understanding of how cell–cell contacts are modulated, how these distinct phenotypes of junction modulation are fully attained is still unclear. A major road block to furthering mechanistic studies on junction regulation is the restricted capability and efficiency of the quantitative image analysis currently available. Existing imaging platforms (i.e. Cell Profiler) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carpenter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McQuin et al., 2018</xref>) are fantastic resources for cell biologists. For <italic>Drosophila</italic> or nematode epithelia, several software are available for quantification of morphogenesis that robustly detect cell boundaries during morphogenesis (i.e. during dorsal closure or germ band extension) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Curran et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sumi et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, for mammalian epithelial cells, available systems are not always suitable for the precise delineation of cell borders and the output of current pipelines is mostly morphometric parameters (i.e. cell size, shape, number or texture) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McQuin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yin et al., 2013</xref>). Cell–cell borders of mammalian cells are particularly difficult to detect because of cytoplasmic noise, irregular shapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Held et al., 2011</xref>) and variable junction phenotypes, particularly when junctions are severely disrupted. This hitherto prevents an objective approach to analyse regulation of cell–cell contacts of mammalian cells and tissues.</p><p>Nevertheless, previous computer vision studies of mammalian junctions report the automated quantification of a single heterotypic junction (e.g. tumour-immune cell contact or host-pathogen contact) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graus et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Merouane et al., 2015</xref>), morphometry of mammary gland spheroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Härmä et al., 2014</xref>) or dynamics of VE-cadherin contacts during cell rearrangements in angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bentley et al., 2014</xref>). Disruption of cell–cell contacts has been assessed in high-throughput manner by coupling junction segmentation with cell tracker and endothelia stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Seebach et al., 2015</xref>), cadherin intensity at junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Erasmus et al., 2016</xref>) or indirectly, by increased inter-nuclear distance as cells scatter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Loerke et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Notwithstanding these successful studies, available methodology does not enable quantification of distinct patterns of organization of receptors or junction morphometry that are readily identified by the human eye. In addition, manual methods available for junction quantification rely on intensity levels and thresholding, which are not appropriate to detect junction attributes such as alterations in shape, length, fragmentation or continuity of cell–cell contacts. Non-intensity-based attributes of junctions are usually defined visually and/or painstakingly analysed via laborious user-dependent quantification of individual junctions. For example, the switch between a straight to undulated cell–cell contact occurs without apparent changes in receptors levels at contact sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Otani et al., 2006</xref>). In this case, rather than alterations of receptor levels at junctions, it involves impaired signalling of the small GTPase Cdc42 to modulate the amount of contraction, making cell–cell contacts less stiff and tense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Otani et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>To address the above issues, we developed a semi-automated pipeline, Junction Mapper, which can fully capture the distinct patterns of junction perturbation by diverse stimuli in various cell types. It can efficiently (i) identify cell boundaries and cell–cell corners, (ii) describe phenotypes of junction architecture and (iii) quantify parameters that reflect the distribution and organization of junctional markers along the contacting interface. To broaden the software suitability to different models, we validate the robustness of the Junction Mapper software in endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes that show distinct receptor organization and architecture when compared to epithelial cells. The repertoire of parameters distinguishes subtle differences of junction disruption and provides a fingerprint for each stimulus, with insights into modes of action and how efficient and functional junctions are.</p><p>We envisage that the analytical capabilities of Junction Mapper will be invaluable for the scientific community to perform quantitative image analysis in mechanistic and translational studies of cell–cell contacts. Most importantly, the generation of tools to facilitate unbiased phenotype identification will be a major step forward to understand how junction dynamics are modulated in homeostasis and pathologies of different tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In normal epithelia, a junction between neighbouring cells usually appears as a straight, taut line, with E-cadherin receptors uniformly distributed along the contacting interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Our previous software defines an E-cadherin mask to calculate the intensity specifically around junctions as a percentage of thresholded area of the whole original image. The E-cadherin mask is also used to subtract an ROI from an image of a distinct marker (i.e. F-actin), so that mostly the signal localized at contacts is considered. Junction Mapper implements novel quantification tools (corners, length and area) and a variety of novel primary and secondary parameters expressed per individual junction.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Junction Mapper – overview of quantification process.</title><p>The original grey scale image stained for a junctional marker (E-cadherin) is uploaded in the program, which identifies the edge map of each cell semi-automatically to define the cell boundaries onto which measurements are made (skeleton, one pixel wide). This is superimposed onto the images to allow correction of missing boundaries and small errors interactively by the user. The image is then segmented to identify each cell to be quantified. A threshold is set to remove non-specific staining, and the skeleton is dilated (pixels) to select the area to be quantified that includes all staining at cell–cell contacts. Finally, cell corners are defined automatically or manually. Thresholded images are then quantified using the dilated mask and results are shown in Excel files as individual measurements of specific junctions as defined by the pairing of two different corners.

The software detects the contacting interface between two cells and obtains a skeletonized edge map (summarised stepwise in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; see Materials and methods). Although semi-automated, users can adjust the outline manually by removing incorrect or adding missing lines, with subsequent refinement of the line location and geometry by the software algorithm (detailed in Appendix 1). A dilation step is applied (user controlled) to define the area to be quantified around the skeletonized map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To identify individual junctions for further quantification, the software then automatically identifies each cell–cell corner (i.e. point of contact between three or more cells, see its mathematical definition in Appendix 1). The number and location of corners in each cell can also be manually adjusted by the user (Appendix 1).</p><p>Images obtained at different resolutions can be used for analyses in Junction Mapper (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). However, the highest quality images possible should be used, as resolution may impact the ability to detect individual clusters of the junction marker. For defining the automated skeletonized edge of each image, a suitable signal-to-noise ratio is necessary to ensure enough contrast to differentiate staining at junctions from the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The higher the Peak Signal to Noise ratio, the easier it is for the program to automatically delineate the cell outline skeleton. For efficient skeleton definition the ratio should be above 22 dB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Using the automated skeleton as a start point, the user can refine the cell outline map by manually drawing or removing lines to close any gaps or correct deviations, particularly in cells with reduced staining at cell–cell contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1 to 2</xref>). The higher the fragmentation of junctions in the image, the more user input is necessary to define the final skeleton outline for quantification.</p><p>User-controlled threshold selection is done by inspection of the image with a slider component on the software interface (Appendix 1). Thresholding aims to reduce background without removing pixels from contact areas. The skeleton obtained is then projected onto the original thresholded image to segment the area of interest and proceed with quantification of each junction for up to two different junctional markers per image (see below). The measurement of the different parameters is performed simultaneously and automatically, in an unbiased manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The output per junction is produced as an Excel file that contains the selected image, skeleton and the quantification of pre-designed measurements and parameters (see below).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Primary parameters and validation</title><p>We envisage that different phenotypes of junction perturbation may require a distinct set of parameters to appropriately capture the disruption features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Towards this goal, we propose a variety of parameters to be used as <italic>bona fide</italic> readouts and measure information that is based on intensity, area and length of the interface and cell–cell contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; Appendix 2). The following concepts are defined and used herein. Interface is the contacting membrane between two neighbouring cells and delimited by cell–cell corners. A cell–cell contact or junction is the region of the interface covered by adhesion receptors (e.g. cadherin staining). Junctions may or may not extend to the whole of the interface (corner-to-corner), and can appear fragmented or dotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Area is the dilated region around the skeleton and is set to encompass the width of a junctional marker staining (which can vary in thickness). Contour is the length measurement of the outline of the skeleton between defined points (interface or junction). Finally, the straight-line length is defined as the shortest distance (Euclidian distance) between corners that form the boundaries of one junction or interface.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Junction Mapper – parameters.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram highlighting the concepts that underpin the primary parameters measured by the software. An image of a cell with a hypothetical disruption of E-cadherin at cell–cell contacts is shown: stars mark the corners delimiting each contacting interface, and rhombus shapes mark the edges of each fragment of cadherin staining that we define as junctions. In each cell, measurements are made to assess the properties of each interface (corner-to-corner) and each junction (may be adjoining or disrupted in multiple fragments): the hypothetical length (straight line interface length or Euclidian distance between two points), the contour (connection of brightest pixels along the curvature of the staining/interface) and area (defined dilated region around cell–cell borders).

A key innovation of the Junction Mapper is its ability to quantify junction marker staining that is not contiguous and that does not extend to both corners. New parameters assess area or contour occupied by fragments of the junctional staining (Fragmented Junction Contour and Junction Area). To validate the length-based measurements, individual contacts disrupted by H-Ras expression were quantified and, as predicted, decreasing values for the contour of the interface, junction or fragmented junction were revealed for each assessed junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>). Although measurements of contacts of control cells also decline between these three parameters, they did not decline to the same extent as the ones of junctions from expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The area-based measurements Interface Area and Junction Area of the same junctions followed similar pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We envisage that the primary parameters are useful to show extension or retraction of the contacting interface/junctions, increased fragmentation of the staining of junction marker or fluctuations of global staining intensity at cell–cell contacts.</p><p>We next assessed the impact of user-defined settings (dilation and threshold) on the primary parameters. The variable dilation settings define areas for quantification and permits the user to account for different thickness of the staining at cell–cell contacts, wavy or undulated junctions. Increasing the dilated area did not affect the length of contacting interface or fragmented junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>), but positively correlated with E-cadherin intensity and area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Similarly, larger dilation values better captured the amount of VE-cadherin present in endothelial junctions as they acquire a zig-zag conformation after thrombin stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E–F,H</xref>). A trade-off is necessary between the amount of dilation and thresholding, so that the contribution of cytoplasmic staining is minimized with larger dilation values.</p><p>The effect of thresholding was tested using the same images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–B,E–F</xref>). Of note is that the precise outline of VE-cadherin zig-zag staining was not recognized by the edge map produced (red line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E–F</xref>). Increasing the threshold applied to the original images decreased the measured cadherin area and intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D, H</xref>) and the length of junction fragments was severely reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C,G</xref>; see definition in Appendix 2). The interface contour values were not affected by thresholding, as the interface is delimited by corners and independent of intensity values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C,G</xref>). Taken together, we concluded that the primary parameters measure the length and area of various features as predicted and are selectively modulated by user-controlled settings in accordance to their definition (Appendix 1).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Secondary parameters</title><p>The availability of a repertoire of parameters is a unique advantage of the software for mapping distinct phenotypes. Secondary parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="C1">Scheme 1</xref>, Appendix 2) are derived from the primary metrics above and aim to normalise the measurements to the size of each junction or contacting interface (length or area). The Linearity Index measures how straight an interface between two cells is, as proposed by Takeichi and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Otani et al., 2006</xref>). Coverage Index is a length measurement of the percentage of the interface length that is covered by the junction marker staining and has been previously used manually in the lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lozano et al., 2008</xref>). Three different parameters quantify the distribution of a junctional marker along the interface. First, Interface Occupancy, measures the area occupied by the marker within the Interface Area of each junction. Second, Junction Protein Intensity per Interface area calculates the fluorescence intensity within the Interface Area. Finally, Cluster Density is the junction protein intensity level within the area delimited by its staining (i.e. Fragmented Junction Area, which considers any fragmentation of the staining; additional parameters are described in Appendix 2). We predict that the secondary parameters are more useful to compare the accumulation or removal of specific markers, their density and relative changes when comparing across different samples.</p><fig id="C1" position="float"><label>Scheme 1.</label><caption><title>Secondary parameters.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Novel parameters were defined to normalise the quantifications with respect to the area or length of contacts. The secondary parameters assess the configuration of the contacting interface (Interface Linearity Index), how much the staining of a junction marker occupies the interface length (Coverage Index) or area (Interface Occupancy). The distribution of junction marker is measured in two ways: their intensity levels within the area occupied by the junction fragments (Cluster Density) or the contacting interface (E-cadherin intensity at interface area). Detailed information of the calculation of parameters is described in Appendix 2.

The manual quantification used straight-line measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lozano et al., 2008</xref>), rather than the more precise contour measurement by Junction Mapper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="C1">Scheme 1</xref>). Using either quantification, manual or Junction Mapper, a significant statistical difference was observed between values of control and Rac1-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2C</xref>). Lower values were obtained with the manual quantification method as predicted when using straight-lines for measurement. However, when controls values were compared between the two methods, no statistical difference was obtained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2C</xref>).</p><p>Thus, the parameters give results as expected from previous manual methods. In addition, the reproducibility of secondary parameters was assessed in independent biological replicates by the same user. Across biological replicates of cells overexpressing active Rac1, the absolute values obtained for each sample were slightly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="C1">Scheme 1B-D</xref>). However, the overall result is the same between replicates: a reduction of Coverage Index and Interface Occupancy of E-cadherin at junctions from Rac1 expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="C1">Scheme 1B-D</xref>). Comparison of control values between biological replicates (or between Rac1 expressing cells) was not statistically different.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>User-bias validation</title><p>The robustness of Junction Mapper with respect to user bias was tested by: (i) defining the skeleton and corners and (ii) quantifying the same samples by different users. First, the quality control of skeleton and corners is subjective (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3A-B</xref>). Confluent epithelial monolayers with clearly defined junctions and corners produced less output variability from different users than images with disrupted contacts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3A-D</xref>). We found that a particular hot spot for differences was the identification of cell corners in disrupted contacts, where corners are often not covered by cadherin staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3B</xref>). Second, pair-wise comparison of primary parameters of matched epithelial junctions obtained independently by two users showed significant differences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3C-D</xref>).</p><p>However, when secondary parameters were calculated, the profiles obtained by the two users were similar, aside the absolute values being different (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3E-F</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). This can be explained by the fact that the user-dependent variability partially auto-correct itself, as values are normalised to the interface and junction area or length which are non-reciprocally impacted by user bias. For example, a larger dilation setting will generate a larger junction area containing a higher number of E-cadherin pixels; when cluster density is calculated (E-cadherin intensity/fragmented junction area), the ratio will not differ extensively between different users.</p><p>We conclude that, in addition to the impact of dilation and thresholding settings, Junction Mapper results are impacted by user influence on the cell edge map. This influence is stronger in cell images with disrupted cell–cell contacts, where higher frequency of inaccurate corner and skeleton detection occurs. Hence more manual edge correction is required the more robust secondary parameter measurements should be considered. Furthermore, absolute comparisons can not be made between experiments. Instead, normalization of secondary parameters to controls in each replicate will facilitate comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Distinct oncogenes trigger different patterns of junction disruption in epithelia</title><p>We addressed whether Junction Mapper parameters could identify distinct features and patterns of junction disruption by different stimuli.

At cell–cell contact sites, the challenge remains to translate the regulation of junctional components into functional and appropriately shaped cell–cell contacts. Junction Mapper facilitates the profiling of cell–cell contact behaviour with a variety of novel parameters in a fast, robust and reliable manner. Collectively, the parameter repertoire indicates how effective cell–cell adhesion is, identifies altered patterns of receptor distribution and guides experimental design to unravel the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p><p>Junction Mapper provides a semi-automated computer vision solution with broad applicability. The most innovative aspects of Junction Mapper are, first, the measurement of receptor density and occupancy, via the normalization of the junction marker intensity, length and area to the available contacting interface and cell–cell contact area. Second, the automatic quantification of fragmented staining at a junction, which has not been feasible previously and, third, the correlation of the parameters from two junctional markers along the same junction. Underpinning the above aspects is the ability of Junction Mapper to detect cell borders and corners when considerable disruption is observed. Machine learning algorithms certainly have the potential to improve and automate segmentation success, especially of highly fragmented contacts. However, the availability of training image datasets with boundaries manually-generated is still a bottleneck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Häring et al., 2018</xref>). One possible use of the software is therefore the generation of precise cell outline skeletons that can be used to train machine-learning algorithms in the future.</p><p>While semi-automation has been implemented during the image processing by Junction Mapper, user contribution is necessary and essential to perform the quality control of skeleton outline, corner positioning and setting up the dilation and threshold levels in a given dataset. User bias is particularly relevant in images with very disrupted and irregular junctions, and absolute values are not suitable for comparison across experiments in some cases. However, user bias can be minimized. Analysis of biological replicates or independent analysis by different users show that (i) the secondary parameters are more robust against user bias and (ii) obtained results are similar across replicates when comparing control and treated samples.</p><p>The software can detect both major and minor changes at junctions in different experiments. Unexpected and distinct profiles emerge from junction disruption by oncogenes that potently remove E-cadherin from contacts. The junctional defects caused by H-Ras<sup>G12V</sup> or Src<sup>Y527F</sup> illustrate the novel parameters that measure junction fragmentation and the specific density of E-cadherin in remaining fragments. In contrast, the perturbation profile induced by expression of Rac1<sup>Q61L</sup> is not appropriately quantified by intensity alone and may be better assessed by ‘Interface Occupancy’, ‘Coverage Index’ and ‘Cluster Density’. Among the repertoire of pre-defined parameters, we find that a subset is highly likely to assess the features of a particular junction phenotype. Phenotypes not yet analysed could present additional possibilities to improve the Junction Mapper repertoire in future studies.</p><p>Junction Mapper analysis confirms mild phenotypes previously observed with manual, threshold-based quantifications of whole images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Erasmus et al., 2016</xref>), that indicate either an increase (EEF1A siRNA) or a decrease (CIP4 or VAV2 siRNA) in the intensity levels of E-cadherin. In addition, new Junction Mapper parameters uncover distinct features, that is that EEF1A depleted cells have higher E-cadherin occupancy and augmented cluster density when compared to controls. The profiling with new parameters underscores the potential of Junction Mapper to differentiate among distinct, subtle modes of junction perturbation. Yet, the conceptual significance of such alterations remains to be consolidated in future experiments and with additional biological replicates.</p><p>The plasticity of endothelial junctions is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Radeva and Waschke, 2018</xref>), but their unique responses to different stimuli have been challenging to quantify (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Häring et al., 2018</xref>). The remarkable zig-zag pattern of thrombin-stimulated endothelial junctions correlates with increased vascular permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Malinova and Huveneers, 2018</xref>) but it is not recognized by the automated skeleton definition. Using area-based parameters, we find that the contacting interface is occupied more efficiently, with higher density of VE-cadherin receptors at endothelial junctions upon thrombin treatment. Thus, it seems that the increased levels of VE-cadherin at junctions may promote stronger endothelial adhesion, which is relevant to sustain elevated intracellular tension and contractility induced by thrombin stimulation. These results are consistent with the role of mechanical tension in receptor modulation and integrity of multicellular tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2010</xref>), and merit further experimentation.</p><p>Because of the fragmented and undulated nature of cardiomyocyte contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ehler, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vermij et al., 2017</xref>), quantitative imaging tools specifically designed for intercalated discs have not been available or systematically used. At steady state, our data show that, in control cardiomyocytes, intercalated discs have clusters of cadherin receptors that are far apart. Hypertrophic stimulus <italic>in cellulo</italic> (neonatal rat cardiomyocytes) potently increases the levels of β-catenin at contacting interfaces, consistent with what was reported in hamster and human hypertrophic hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Masuelli et al., 2003</xref>). Connexin 43 is a major connexin isoform found in cardiomyocytes and its total protein and mRNA levels are augmented by hypertrophic signals <italic>in cellulo</italic> (i.e. phenylephrine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Salameh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stanbouly et al., 2008</xref>) or in human hearts with compensated left-ventricular hypertrophy by pressure-overloading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kostin et al., 2004</xref>). The initial profiling analysis with Junction Mapper suggest that the formation of gap junctions is enhanced after hypertrophy stimulation <italic>in cellulo</italic>, confirming the broadening of intercalated disc area and higher number of GAP junctions in compensated hypertrophic hearts of human patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kostin et al., 2004</xref>). Although hypertrophic stimulus increases both β-catenin and connexin 43 levels at intercalated discs, these markers are regulated in distinct ways. The β-catenin cluster density is decreased leading to a more contiguous distribution, while connexin 43 is localised in clusters of higher density.</p><p>Clearly, further investigation is necessary to ascertain the profiling and biological significance of the phenotypes observed in different models. The quantification of very fragmented and zig-zagged junctions such as those in endothelia and cardiomyocytes is a challenge that Junction Mapper has begun to address, but improvements in future computation studies are welcomed. The complexity of these junctions also requires more user input to quality control the definition of the skeleton and corners. In addition, the ability of Junction Mapper to quantify junctions in a stratified epithelium, where the added complexity of multiple epithelial cell layers provides an additional challenge, remains to be tested.</p><p>We foresee the potential of Junction Mapper in distinct research areas, due to its innovative and in-depth approach to quantify cell–cell contacts. The detailed fine mapping of junction properties forms a basis to distinguish between disassembly mechanisms and infer cellular processes such as intracellular trafficking, receptor clustering or modulation of contraction at junctions. As multiple cellular processes contribute to junction stability, the fingerprinting of junction phenotypes after different stimuli is a powerful tool in pathway inference and guides rescue and translational experiments. Despite its limitations, Junction Mapper’s broad dynamic range, repertoire of novel parameters and applicability to quantify junctions in various cell types will have a significant impact on studies in numerous model systems.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Source data</title><p>Numerical data used to prepare graphs in each figure.

The Junction Mapper code has been deposited in GitHub (license GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/Junction_Mapper">https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/Junction_Mapper</ext-link>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Junction_Mapper">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Junction_Mapper</ext-link>) and the software, instructions and its documentation can be downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dataman.bioinformatics.ic.ac.uk/junction_mapper">https://dataman.bioinformatics.ic.ac.uk/junction_mapper</ext-link>. The software uses algorithms that are mostly available open access, with some added innovation (i.e. fragmented length calculation). The novelty of Junction Mapper lays in the integration of distinct measurements, calculations of new parameters and consolidation of all parameters in a single system. In addition to junction measurements, we also developed a ‘Nucleus Tool’ to quantify the inter-nuclei distances of scattering epithelial cells – this tool will be described elsewhere.</p><p>The parameters and software to quantify junction phenotypes were built on the concept of our prior segmentation image analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Erasmus et al., 2016</xref>) based on intensity thresholding and whole image output obtained for the epithelial monolayer. Briefly, the labelling with a junctional marker (i.e. cadherin or a generic ‘junction marker 1’) is used to delineate the borders between cells and to form a mask to extract only the pixels found at contact sites for quantification. The mask can then be used to segment additional co-stained proteins that localise at junctions.</p><p>We address the bottlenecks in quantification of phenotypes that are not measurable by intensity only. Segmentation of images was performed to delineate where cell–cell contacts are (cell skeleton) and identify the corners between three or more contacting epithelial cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). The cell skeleton is calculated in the following way. The original grey scale image of the ‘junction marker 1’ edges is interactively edited using blurring and sharpening filters to emboss the edges using the program GUI. The image is then binarized using an averaging filter (of the target pixel local neighbourhood) alongside a threshold and this binary image of cell edges is then super-imposed upon the original cell image stained for the junctional marker. Super-imposition of the skeleton and grey-scale image allows cell boundaries of each cell to be fine-tuned or re-adjusted automatically using dilation, skeletonisation and maximum intensity within a neighbourhood algorithm. Edges can also be drawn on and removed from the image manually during this interactive process. The result is well-characterised edges that correspond to the real cell boundaries with a minimal amount of effort from the user. It has so far proved very hard to obtain reliable cell boundaries on a wide range of images and conditions without an interactive element. The program is designed to make this task as quick and efficient as possible. The image skeleton can then be dilated by the user (1 to 9 pixels, depending on image amplification and junction width) to set the area that fully contains the junctional marker staining. Corners between contacting cells are automatically identified and can be added or corrected manually. For junctions that are severely perturbed, providing a labelling for the whole cell facilitates the positioning of its corners and skeleton.</p><p>These spatial demarcations (skeleton, corners and area) are then used to calculate the primary parameters as described below (Figure S2). A minimal threshold is applied to avoid losing any signal at the cell–cell interface. The length and area of (i) contacting membrane between cells (Interface Contour (unit pixels) and Interface area (unit pixels<sup>2</sup>), respectively) was calculated using the skeleton between two neighbouring corners on the cell outline. The length and area of the specific staining of a junctional marker (Junction Contour (unit pixels) and Junction Area (unit pixels<sup>2</sup>), respectively) were measured between the outermost above-threshold pixels of the staining observed along the contacting interface.</p><p>To evaluate distinct perturbations of junctions, primary parameters calculated the sum of the length of individual staining fragments of the junctional marker along the interface between cells (Fragmented Junction Contour, unit pixels). The Euclidian distance between corners was used to calculate the length of an optimal, straight interface between two cells (Straight-line Interface Length, unit pixels). For estimation of the optimal junction length, the parameter Straight-line Junction Length is derived from the Euclidian distance between the outermost above-threshold pixels of the staining of a junctional marker, which may or may not coincide with the distance between the corners. Additional primary parameters quantify more specifically the junctional marker: ‘junction marker 1’ Area (number of above the threshold pixels within dilated edge area, in pixels<sup>2</sup>) and ‘junction marker 1’ Intensity (within the dilated edge area, in arbitrary units or A.U.).</p><p>Secondary parameters were derived to assess different phenotypes of perturbed contacts by normalizing measurements per length or area of each junction or contacting interface (Figure S3). First, the software calculates how straight an interface or junction is using two parameters: (i) Interface Linearity Index (ratio between Interface Contour and Straight-line Interface Length, unitless) and (ii) Junctional Linearity index (ratio between Junction Contour and Straight-line Junction Length, unitless). Second, to estimate the proportion of the interface between cells that is covered by adhesion receptors, two parameters are calculated: (i) a length-based parameter, Coverage Index (ratio between Fragmented Junction Contour and Interface Contour, unit %) and (ii) an area-based parameter, Interface Occupancy (ratio between Junctional area and Interface area, unit %). The latter would be more appropriate to account for variable thickness of the junctional marker staining. Third, secondary parameters that address the specific distribution of junctional markers between neighbouring cells are: ‘junction marker 1’ intensity per interface area (ratio between ‘junction marker 1’ Intensity and Interface Area, unit A.U./pixel<sup>2</sup>) and Cluster Density (ratio between ‘junction marker 1’ and Junction area, unit A.U./pixel<sup>2</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Software validation</title><p>Validation of the length and area measurements of the interface, junctions and fragmented junctions was performed on selected junctions. The impact of user-controlled settings (dilation and thresholding) was tested by increasing the dilation or thresholding values during the analyses and comparing the effects on primary parameters of selected junctions. The coverage index was validated manually using FIJI and the active Rac1 expressing data set, on the same junctions quantified by Junction Mapper. The manual calculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lozano et al., 2008</xref>) has been traditionally done using the Euclidian distance (straight-line length) rather than the more precise contours measured by Junction Mapper. To estimate the impact of different users subjectivity on the data obtained with Junction Mapper, a random subset of images from three different data sets (siCIP4, H-Ras, endothelial cells) was analysed independently by a separate user without knowledge of the settings used for analysis by user A. Each user independently set up the corners, skeleton corrections, dilation and thresholding.</p><p>For estimation of signal to noise ratio required for the skeleton recognition by Junction Mapper, random noise was added to the original (high quality) image using Fiji (Gaussian (normally) distributed with a mean of zero and standard deviation of 25; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/gui/process/noise">https://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/gui/process/noise</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferreira and Rasband, 2012</xref>). The quality of images was then estimated using the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) expressed in decibels (dB). The PSNR was calculated with the SNR Fiji plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sage and Unser, 2003</xref>) by comparing original image to the images with added noise to the junction marker channel, since only this channel was used to create the skeleton.

A summary of the image dataset and user-controlled values used in each experiment can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Images obtained from different experiments were subjected to quality control before quantification: junctions were excluded if they have blurry areas, artefacts or large gaps between cells. Regions were also excluded that contained (i) junctions of cells overlapping or on top of each other (different focal plane) (ii) multinucleated cells (iii) cells that were not fully surrounded by neighbours (i.e. at the border of the image or epithelial colony), (iv) junctions of cells overexpressing high levels of protein. As values are obtained per junction and a junction is shared by two cells, duplicated measurements of junctions are removed from the dataset.</p><p>For expression of different oncogenes, junctions were classified as those between (i) control cells (between two non-transfected cells), (ii) between two expressing cells (ee) or (iii) junctions shared by one expressing and a non-expressing cell (en). For the analyses of endothelial cells - junctions in blurry parts of the picture, with artefacts or large gaps between junctions and junctions at the border of a endothelial colony were excluded. For cardiomyocytes, the same criteria were applied as for endothelial cells and the parts of the image where the staining seemed very scattered and chaotic, with no clear trace of a junction were also excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Normality test was performed in each dataset using Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test and Shapiro-Wilk test. Data from Src<sup>Y527F</sup>, H-Ras<sup>G12V</sup> and Rac1<sup>Q61L</sup> experiments were analysed using ANOVA with the Games-Howell post-hoc test from the ‘userfriendlyscience’ in RStudio. Despite the data being non-parametric, the large number of junctions in each sample (&gt;100 junctions) allows for the use of ANOVA with Games-Howell post-hoc test, which corrects for unequal sample sizes and variances between groups and for data with non-parametric distribution. Significance was set at p&lt;0.05. Data with a single treatment group and control group (this includes siRNA experiments in epithelial cells, cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells) were non-parametric and hence were analysed using the Mann-Whitney U-test in GraphPad PRISM.

To use the Junction one tool, select the appropriate tab in the image. In order to obtain the edge map and use it to calculate the junction parameters, a number of steps are performed via the Junction one tool as outlined below:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Step 1: Edge Detection</p></list-item><list-item><p>Step 2: Produce Binary Edge Map</p></list-item><list-item><p>Step 3: Finesse the edge map</p></list-item><list-item><p>Step 4: Select cells to be analysed</p></list-item><list-item><p>Step 5: Select Individual Cell to Analyse</p></list-item><list-item><p>Step 6: Define corners of cell</p></list-item><list-item><p>Step 7: Measure different parameters at cell-cell contacts</p></list-item></list><sec id="s8-5-1"><title>Step 1: Edge detection</title><p>In order to get meaningful results from Junction Mapper, it is very important to construct an accurate representation of the cell boundary. Cell images can be taken with varied magnifications and image quality. Junction Mapper is sufficiently flexible to perform well on many different image types. The first step is to emboss the edges of the cells by using the tools on the panel. There are three filters on the right side panel:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><bold>Gaussian</bold> - blurs cell edges</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Median</bold> - makes edges more uniform and removes spot noise</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Sharpen</bold> - makes edges stand out more</p></list-item></list><fig id="app1fig3" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 3.</label><caption><title>Screenshot of the edge detection function main menu.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-45413-app1-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s8-5-2"><title>Step 2: Produce Binary Edge Map</title><p>The Grey Scale Dilate function can be used to fill any holes in the cell edge detected. The number of repetitions of these filters and the order and combinations that they are applied in is user-controlled and should be guided by the resultant image itself, which is displayed after every operation. Once the edges are well defined, the user should select the Apply Adaptive Threshold, which will binarize the image. The C value and filter size parameters to this operation are chosen from a dialog box that appears when this control is selected. The C value chosen depends on the quality and contrast of the image (higher contrast, higher C value), whilst the size of the filter selected should be slightly bigger than half of the average edge width in pixels. The result of the Apply Adaptive Threshold function is a binary image that is used as the basis to build the edge map. Existing edge maps saved previously can also be loaded into the system at this stage.</p><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Control name</th><th valign="top">Algorithm used</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gaussian</td><td valign="top">Image is convolved with a 5 × 5 Gaussian kernel with values: <break/>{{1,4,7,4,1},{4,16,26,16,4},{7,26,41,26,7},{4,16,26,16,4},{1,4,7,4,1}};</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Median Filter</td><td valign="top">Median Filter applied to image with a 5 × 5 kernel</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sharpen Filter</td><td valign="top">Image is convolved with a 3 × 3 sharpening filter, kernel has values: <break/>{{−1,–1,−1},{−1,12,–1},{−1,–1,−1}}</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Grey Scale Dilate</td><td valign="top">Performs a grey scale dilation operation on the edge image in a 3 × 3 neighbourhood by replacing the target pixel with the largest grey <break/>scale value in the local neighbourhood</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Adaptive Threshold</td><td valign="top">Binarizes the grey scale edge image by using an adaptive thresholding technique.

The first step is usually to dilate the image two or three times (to join the detected edges) and then skeletonise (to create a single pixel wide edge). Trailing Edges and Remove Small Objects can be used to removed imperfections and misalignments in the binary image. The user should then check the accuracy of the edge map by using the Edge Map Toggle function to see how closely the map follows the edges in the original image. This function rotates the background on which the skeleton is drawn between blank, Junction one channel and Junction two channel allowing the user to assess the accuracy of the skeleton produced. Minor adjustments can be made by using the Local Maxima for Edges function and then Dilating (to join edges) and Skeletonise the result to get a single pixel wide edge. The Local Maxima for Edges can be used to move the edge to the brightest grey scale values in the vicinity of the current edge, based on the grey scale values in the original grey scale Junction one image. The local neighbourhood of the original Edge image is inspected around each skeleton pixel location and a ‘1’ binary value assigned to the maxima in this window. This operation can be performed on decreasing neighbourhood sizes in conjunction with the dilate and skeletonize functions to build a more accurate edge map. Edges can also be manually added or removed by the user by selecting the Add or Remove check buttons and clicking on the image itself. Click left to add a point and then click again to add a line between the points. This can be repeated to rapidly create an edge. Click with the right-hand button to stop the edges being added. Some of the functions will only work when the binary image is displayed (dilate, local maxima). When the edge map corresponds to the edges of the cells in the image (cells to be measured) click the <bold>Finish</bold> button.

As pointed out by the authors in the Introduction of the manuscript quantification of different mammalian junctional parameters is often rather time consuming as for many programs finding borders and, often, correcting borders, can until now mostly be done manually. Automated analysis is not trivial and in general requires a strong background in image bioinformatics/analysis or access to a core facility that provides such analysis. The exciting point of the work presented here is that this program provides a general and very accessible platform to quantify junctions in a semi-automatic manner to obtain multiple parameters. Moreover, proper detection of fragmented junctions is an even more complex problem which the authors have apparently solved. The program provides reasonable output parameters and the detection quality and sophistication of junctional staining appears to be outstanding judged by the data presented on both epithelial junctions as well as the already much harder endothelial junctions. Finally, the experiments that were performed convincingly demonstrate the applicability of the program and its sensitivity of detecting minor and specific alterations. Taken together, this manuscript provides convincing and exciting evidence that junction mapper is a great open software to quantitatively analyze junctions, and that allows laboratories not specialized in junctional imaging to also more precisely analyze and assess junctional phenotypes.</p><p>I have two comments that need to be addressed:</p><p>1) The last author is a well-known specialist on keratinocytes, which in vivo and in culture form multi-layered epithelia upon prolonged induction of differentiation. Although the authors have used keratinocytes, it seems they only used early time points after differentiation when these cells did not form multilayers yet. The multi-layering provides an extra complexity to the proper quantification of junctions. Can the program deal with this complexity? If so, would be very nice to include an example. If not, please also more stringently then discuss the limitations of the program.</p><p>2) One important point does need to be clarified. It is not exactly clear from the figures, legends or Materials and methods how the statistics were done. The authors name all the appropriate tests but it is not clear e.g. whether means of technical replicates or the collective number of junctions were used for statistical test. Clearly, the high number of junctions that can be analyzed here is an advantage. However, the variance between experiments is not shown and it is not clear whether the statistics take that into account.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>1) This manuscript describes a novel semiautomated software, 'Junction Mapper,' for analyzing cell junctions on parameters such as defining the junctional interphase, intensity, and length. Currently, analyzing cell junctions is often done manually which can be time consuming and laborious, even when using automated software, it is usually tailored to a specific cell type or unable to automatically distinguish nuances of perturbed or fragmented junctions. The authors evaluate their software's performance in several cell types, and in multiple conditions to evaluate its ability to detect a range of phenotypes (from severe to mild). This manuscript presents a new tool that address these significant problems and has the potential to be widely applied. However there are numerous flaws and oversights in this presentation that significantly dampen my enthusiasm. There is also a lack of rigor in evaluating the algorithms as presented which makes it difficult to assess the utility of the software thereby raising a major concern.</p><p>2) First, the availability of the software and test data sets is not clear. Nor is the computing language or platform that the software is written in. This is a major oversight. Second, the microscopy needs to be fully described. There are not scale bars on images. Are these max intensity projections, single confocal slices, widefield images, deconvovled? What is the resolution? The quality of the input will impact the ability of the algorithms to function and this needs to be defined.</p><p>3) How do different user selected parameters impact the output from the program? Since the skeleton can be manually adjusted, does the specific skeleton have an impact on the results? These factors need to be considered and quantified for their impact on the final measurements.</p><p>4) Input parameters need to be discussed – dilation and threshold level are important parameters to disclose for each analyzed data set. How do these impact final measurements?</p><p>5) The process of interactive editing, blurring, and sharpening is not shown nor well described. Is this process done manually on every image? Can it be automated for a data set? Seeing these steps, including when manual adjustment is required would be helpful. The reader has no feel for how often user intervention is required (every cell, every image, every border?).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript describes the development of software for quantifying the phenotype of cell-cell contacts from high resolution images. The authors have been able to produce an impressive data set with the tool. However, the new tool is not validated sufficiently, and the methods are not adequately described. This is particularly important, as by the studying design, the biological ramifications of the analysis were not probed.</p><p>1) In the Introduction (third paragraph), the authors make the claim that the software developed for analysis of Drosophilia or nematode epithelia are not applicable to mammalian cells. Image analysis algorithm performance are typically based of the nature of the structures to be analyzed and the quality of data. There is no reason for these parameters to be fundamentally different in all mammalian cells. If the authors, are trying to say that tools for analysis of epithelial cells may not be directly applicable to other cells types or in all possible treatments (points made later), they should be more explicit here. Also, the (Held et al., 2011) does not describe the analysis of cell-cell contacts and does not seem to support the authors point.</p><p>2) The development of a new algorithm for image analysis is typically associated with several key endeavors. First is validation. Validation must be performed on data where the ground truth is known. For a &quot;first-of-kind&quot; algorithm this is often associated done with simulated data or data that was analyzed by hand. By this standard definition, the Junction Mapper is not validated. This must be corrected for the manuscript to be considered for publication. It seems that the data shown in Figure 6 may be appropriate for this task, as the data was previously analyzed by hand? This reviewer notes that citations within the manuscript are validated in this manner (i.e. Held et al., 2011). Also, the section in the Materials and methods described &quot;Software validation&quot; actually discusses exclusion criteria and naming procedures.</p><p>3) Additionally, there is typically an analysis of when the algorithm begins to fail. This is often done in terms of data with varying signal to noise. The limitations of this of the Junction Mapper are not tested. While it would be preferred that a formal analysis of the performance of the algorithm be performed, at a minimum image quality (which is often reported as signal to noise ratios) requirements (or at least typical image characteristics) should be provided so that users know the criteria for the suitability of the algorithm are met being attempting to use it.</p><p>4) The Materials and methods also lack sufficient detail. According to the manuscript, the Junction Mapper is a novel stand alone software. This means specific algorithms for background estimation, skeletonization, segmentation, and parameter calculation were used. Precise definitions (including formulae) or citations to the utilized algorithms need to be provided. Also, formulae describing how the parameters were calculated need to be added. Also, how corners were identified needs to be explained in greater detail. If corners are manually detected, then it is improper to state the Junction Mapper detected them. Additionally, are all junctions analyzed at once or individually? If different segmentation parameters are used on different junctions, are the results actually directly comparable? This reviewer also notes that the required details are not available in the often-cited previous work of Erasmus et al., 2016. This is understandable as that was a highly biological study, but that reference should not be used to described methodological details.</p><p>5) In several places the authors make claims that junctions that are straighter are more tensed. This is not true, as the junctions could also be stiffer, and therefore deform less. As no measurements of junctional tension were made, these statements should be removed.</p><p>6) The algorithm seems to assume constant width for the junctions. This will likely lead to substantial errors in area estimations. Have the authors given thought to this issue? Are the errors inconsequential? Can the algorithm be readily updated to avoid this artefact?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Junction Mapper is a novel computer vision tool to decipher cell-cell contact phenotypes&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors took a lot of effort to address the points that were raised by the reviewers. I do not have the proper expertise to judge whether the authors have sufficiently addressed the points of reviewers 2 and 3.</p><p>1) In response to point 2, the authors now describe which statistical tests are used and clarify for which figure panels they used biological or technical replicates. The authors now state that the statistics and the tests used are in Supplementary file 5. Unfortunately, I was unable to find Supplementary file 5 in the present submission, making it impossible whether the statistics were done properly. Importantly, the authors still do not clearly state in the legends and/or Materials and methods the number of replicates on which the data shown are based on. Throughout the manuscript, each measured junction is called a sample and the number of analyzed junctions are now provided in the figures. However, for the statistics the authors should provide information on the number of replicates, meaning number of independent experiments or biological samples, in the figure or legend to clearly show that differences and significance levels are due to the high number of junctions but not because of experimental variation.</p><p>2) For siRNA experiments the section on statistical analysis says that only one control and knockdown group was analyzed. If this is not a misunderstanding, then even high number of analyzed junctions from one experiment do not allow strong conclusions as experimental variation upon knockdown of CIP4, EEFA1A or VAV2 has not been assessed. For physiological relevant conclusions one would expect a set of at least 3 independent experiments. I do understand that the authors want to test their very interesting tool for which they provide many different experimental tests. However, the authors should then acknowledge and tune down mechanistic conclusions. For experiments concerning HUVEC cells, there is no information on the number of biological replicates on which the data are based.</p><p>3) Thus, at present the way the data are presented now, provides nice evidence that the program allows for quantification of high number of junctions to potentially detect small differences. If the authors want to use the experiments shown in the manuscript to validate the usefulness as well as limits of the software, this approach with limited number of repetitions seems valid but then this has to be made more clearly throughout the manuscript. Not all of the data sets are sufficiently comprehensive to univocally demonstrate a biological relevant junctional outcome upon treatment or knockdown and this should be acknowledged. Having said this, I feel if the authors were able to address the concerns of reviewer 2 and 3, they should be provided the opportunity to properly address and include in the manuscript the comments above.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Overall this tool has the potential to be useful for researchers, and the authors have now included many more rigorous definition of the method and treatments of the parameters both in definition and in comparison of data processed in different ways. This strengthens the manuscript. However, I am still not sure this is sufficient to fully describe the bounds of the junction mapper approach.</p><p>1) Most scientific conclusions as presented come from comparisons of values in control/disrupted. When looking at effects of user inputs the graphs are shown for each treatments individually but what are the changes with different thresholds/dilations between treatments (i.e. Figure 3—figure supplements 2 and 3)? Would different biological conclusions be drawn if you push the dilation or threshold &quot;too far&quot;?</p><p>2) Authors point out a central issue and why this analysis is challenging – If there is no staining at a cell corner then where the program or user places the junction is arbitrary. Without a second marker of plasma membrane rather than junction this will always be an issue these measurements regardless of what automated algorithm is deployed or with user definition.</p><p>3) The authors show secondary characteristics are more robust to error in corner selection and that individual users get same direction of changes but not same absolute values, which does show the value added here. This should be emphasized in the Discussion.</p><p>4) For the noise quantification, there should be a metric for measurement accuracy, or deviation from the ground truth. Guidance for user on minimum S/N needed for robust quantification. There is also no information on type of noise added (shot noise, dependent on pixel intensity is dominant noise in most microscopy images and is recommended here). The goal would be for a user to know if a junction has sufficient S/N to be analyzed.</p><p>5) This leads me to the quantification of the type &quot;ee&quot; boarders in the H-Ras<sup>G12V</sup> overexpressing cells. There appears to be greatly reduced e-cad staining at the boarders (it is difficult to see by eye any in the examples shown). In this case, how are the interfaces defined? Does this lower signal to noise negatively impact the program? How confident should we feel about comparing images with different S/N levels?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript is greatly improved and nearly ready for publication.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45413.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ notes: the authors’ response after being formally invited to submit a revised submission follows.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] I have two comments that need to be addressed:</p><p>1) The last author is a well-known specialist on keratinocytes, which in vivo and in culture form multi-layered epithelia upon prolonged induction of differentiation.

However, the complexity of stratified epithelium images (en face or transversal sections (see Figure 3A from Sevilla et al., 2007) means that a potential analysis using Junction Mapper will not be meaningful. For example, it will be very much dependent on the angle of the section, variations in cell sizes and the amount of incomplete outlines of individual cells, which makes comparison across samples difficult. It also remains to be tested whether Junction Mapper can quantify junctions in pseudo-stratified epithelia.

For some experiments (Src expression and endothelial cells), biological replicates were analysed separately.

The test data sets are from our own labs, unpublished data and from published papers; i.e. from Erasmus et al., 2016 – these are referred to in the text. The software was developed using Java and is available as an open access standalone, downloadable format (information added in the subsection “Software development”). A new supplementary table containing detailed information of the acquisition of images for each dataset was added (Supplementary file 1).

The process is done in each image because of image-to-image variability and the extent of junction disruption when stimulated. We addressed the concerns in two ways: (i) a new supplementary figure shows the precise steps to obtain the skeleton and corners (Figure 2—figure supplement 2) and (ii) instructions on how the software operates are included in a custom-made video downloadable package of Junction Mapper from a dedicated website.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) In the Introduction (third paragraph), the authors make the claim that the software developed for analysis of Drosophilia or nematode epithelia are not applicable to mammalian cells.

Nevertheless, in an experiment, when the percentage of rescue is computed with either our previous and current method, similar results are obtained: a mild reduction of E-cadherin intensity at junctions compared to controls after depletion of TRIP10 or VAV2 (20-30%) while EEF1A shows a 50% increase in E-cadherin intensity at junctions (Figure 6).<sup>[2]</sup> We provided validation in several ways and revised the text accordingly:</p><p>- Length-based and area-based parameters are measured as predicted, i.e. with increasing shorter values for the interface, junctions and fragmented junction staining (new Figure 3B).</p><p>- Dilation manipulation interferes with area-based measurements, but not length-based parameters Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><p>- Increasing levels of thresholding interferes with intensity and pixel area as well as the length of fragments of junction markers (Figure 3—figure supplement 3).</p><p>- The validation of the secondary parameter Coverage Index by manual quantification as described in our previous paper (i.e. Supplementary file 2).<sup>[3]</sup></p><p>- Comparison of quantification by an independent user (new Supplementary file 3 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1; please see points 3, 4 and 6 below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Additionally, there is typically an analysis of when the algorithm begins to fail.

The work on Erasmus et al. defines the obtention of the E-cadherin mask as a tool to calculate the intensity specifically around junctions as% thresholded area of the whole image. It also defines the Ecadherin mask to subtract an ROI on an image of a distinct marker (i.e. F-actin), so that only the signal localized at contacts is considered. Junction Mapper builds from this work and improves with novel quantification tools (corners, length and area), calculation of fragments at junctions and a variety of novel primary and secondary parameters.

The variable width of staining at junctions can be fully captured by the dilation step (user defined) and will depend on the amplification of the image. The dilation steps increase the numbers of pixels at each side of the skeleton line (range 0 to 9 pixels) and determines automatically the area in which quantification will be done (ROI). The influence of varying the dilation for different parameters is now shown in new Figure 3—figure supplement 2. The dilation value is manually set up and kept constant for each dataset (i.e. H-Ras, Rac1, etc).

In the analysis, we keep the threshold at a minimum to avoid loss of signal at junctions (subsection “Software development”, fourth paragraph). Very high thresholding levels are clearly not appropriate for the analyses, as too much signal is lost (i.e. threshold 100-150, Figure 3—figure supplement 3). Similarly, very high dilation settings may not detect any further increase in measurement values in stimulated samples, but not in controls, in some (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A-D), but not all experiments (Figure 3—figure supplement 2E-H).</p><p>As shown in our validation experiments, different users, using distinct dilation and thresholding settings obtain different absolute values for the parameters using Junction Mapper (Figure 7—figure supplement 1; Supplementary file 3). However, the conclusions are statistically similar when compared with controls quantified under the same conditions. As the settings are applied to both control and treated images, we expect that the results are not changed overall. Higher threshold levels will remove intensity at junctions and cytoplasm in both control and treated groups. Conversely, we expect that by increasing dilation much wider than the junctional staining, the background or noise will be computed as junctional signals for all samples (control and treated).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Authors point out a central issue and why this analysis is challenging – If there is no staining at a cell corner then where the program or user places the junction is arbitrary. Without a second marker of plasma membrane rather than junction this will always be an issue these measurements regardless of what automated algorithm is deployed or with user definition.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct: a membrane or cell marker is very helpful to guide corner positioning. This can be done using cytoskeletal staining (i.e. F-actin) or a marker that labels the whole cell; i.e. Cell Mask. The above point is stressed in the third paragraph of the subsection “Software development”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors show secondary characteristics are more robust to error in corner selection and that individual users get same direction of changes but not same absolute values, which does show the value added here. This should be emphasized in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion – this information is now discussed in the subsection “User-bias validation” and in the first paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) For the noise quantification, there should be a metric for measurement accuracy, or deviation from the ground truth. Guidance for user on minimum S/N needed for robust quantification. There is also no information on type of noise added (shot noise, dependent on pixel intensity is dominant noise in most microscopy images and is recommended here). The goal would be for a user to know if a junction has sufficient S/N to be analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the recommendation. We performed the determination of peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) in the original images compared to those where noise was artificially added using FIJI. Our quantification showed that a PSNR above 21.72dB +/- 0.67 is optimal and generally measured in the original images (cardiomyocytes and keratinocyte samples). Reducing the PSNR values to below 16.00dB (epithelia) or 18.00dB (cardiomyocytes) severely compromises the performance of the software. This information is now added to the subsection “Software validation” and in the Results. The PSNR values were added to each modified image (original and modified, Figure 2—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) This leads me to the quantification of the type &quot;ee&quot; boarders in the H-Ras<sup>G12V</sup> overexpressing cells. There appears to be greatly reduced e-cad staining at the boarders (it is difficult to see by eye any in the examples shown). In this case, how are the interfaces defined? Does this lower signal to noise negatively impact the program? How confident should we feel about comparing images with different S/N levels?</p></disp-quote><p>As stated in point 2 above, for severely perturbed junctions, the junctional remains, staining of neighbouring cells and with a second marker are helpful to delineate the borders. The visualization is also much better in the computer screen. Of note is that we find that samples that are severely disrupted are not easily rescued, as the perturbation goes too far. The experimental design is best when the expression/stimulus is carefully optimized to significantly disrupt in a quantifiable manner, but not completely abolish the junctional staining. The potential of the Junctional Mapper software is to be able to analyse high numbers of junctions and then obtain the sample variability in a statistically significant manner.</p></body></sub-article></article>
