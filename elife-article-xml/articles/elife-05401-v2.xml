It was first identified as a neurotrophic factor and later as the most potent natural antiangiogenic factor, a stem cell niche factor, and an inhibitor of cancer cell growth. Numerous animal models demonstrated its therapeutic value in treating blinding diseases and diverse cancer types. A long-standing challenge is to reveal how PEDF acts on its target cells and the identities of the cell-surface receptors responsible for its activities. Here we report the identification of transmembrane proteins PLXDC1 and PLXDC2 as cell-surface receptors for PEDF. Using distinct cellular models, we demonstrate their cell type-specific receptor activities through loss of function and gain of function studies. Our experiments suggest that PEDF receptors form homooligomers under basal conditions, and PEDF dissociates the homooligomer to activate the receptors. Mutations in the intracellular domain can have profound effects on receptor activities.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05401.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05401.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05401.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many cells in our body release signals that trigger responses in other cells. A protein called PEDF is a signal released from a variety of cells that can prevent the formation of new blood vessels, protect cells in the retina and brain from damage and stop cancer cells from growing. Experiments using model animals have also demonstrated that PEDF could be used to treat a variety of eye diseases that lead to blindness and many types of cancer.</p><p>PEDF is found in tissues including the brain, eye, liver, heart and lung, but it was not known how cells sense this signal. Cells are expected to have specific proteins called receptors on the cell surface membrane to detect PEDF and transmit the signal into the cell; however, the identity of these receptors has remained a long-standing unsolved puzzle.</p><p>Cheng, Zhong, Kawaguchi et al. have now identified two human proteins that act as receptors for PEDF. These proteins—known as PLXDC1 and PLXDC2—span the cell surface membrane, and bind to PEDF on the outside of the cell. PLXDC1 and PLXDC2 are expressed on different types of cells that respond to PEDF. Furthermore, PEDF was unable to act upon cells that had been engineered to make less of these two receptors.</p><p>This study also revealed that each receptor can play different roles in different cell types. For example, exposing one type of cell from blood vessels to PEDF would normally kill them, but cells without PLXDC2 (but not those without PLXDC1) could survive PEDF treatment. Furthermore, PEDF treatment protects a type of neuron against environmental damage, and this activity depends on PLXDC1, but not PLXDC2.</p><p>How do the receptors transmit the PEDF signal from the outside of the cell to the inside of the cell? Cheng, Zhong, Kawaguchi et al. found that when PEDF is not present, both PLXDC1 and PLXDC2 form complexes containing more than one copy of either receptor. When PEDF binds to the receptors, it causes these complexes to disassemble and this activates further downstream signaling events inside the cell.</p><p>Understanding PEDF receptors and their mechanisms will open the way to developing new drugs that target these receptors to treat human diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05401.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05401.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>membrane receptor</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd><kwd>human disease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Hui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Claude Pepper Older Americans Independence Center (UCLA)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Hui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two membrane proteins that belong to a new type of cell-surface receptor mediate the transmembrane signaling for a secreted factor that has broad therapeutic value.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Employing physiological pathways to impede pathological processes has been a fruitful approach in developing effective therapeutics for human disease. There exists a natural factor that can inhibit pathogenesis of several major diseases and has surprisingly diverse therapeutic value. This factor is called Pigment Epithelium-Derived Factor (PEDF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dawson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tombran-Tink and Barnstable, 2003</xref>) and was originally identified as a strong protective factor for neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tombran-Tink and Barnstable, 2003</xref>). It was also initially known as EPC-1, a factor that is downregulated by more than 100-fold in aged compared to young human fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pignolo et al., 1993</xref>). In an unbiased search for new antiangiogenic factors, PEDF was identified as the most potent endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dawson et al., 1999</xref>). PEDF inhibits endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis even in the presence of strong proangiogenic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dawson et al., 1999</xref>). It specifically targets new vessel growth without affecting pre-existing vessels. In numerous animal models, PEDF has been shown to have potent therapeutic effects in treating several major human diseases through its neurotrophic, anti-angiogenic, antitumorigenic and antimetastatic activities. In addition to treating major blinding diseases such as ischemia-induced retinopathy, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stellmach et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Semkova et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miyazaki et al., 2011</xref>), PEDF has been shown to inhibit the growth of a wide variety of cancer types including melanoma, neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, hepatoblastoma, Lewis lung carcinoma, chondrosarcoma, gastric carcinoma, glioma, Wilm's tumor, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doll et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernandez-Garcia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Broadhead et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, PEDF has also been identified as a stem cell niche factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pumiglia and Temple, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ramirez-Castillejo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andreu-Agullo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elahy et al., 2012</xref>) and an anti-inflammatory factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zamiri et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2006b</xref>).</p><p>PEDF is widely expressed in many tissues such as the eye, brain, spinal cord, bone, liver, heart and lung. PEDF is also naturally present in the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Petersen et al., 2003</xref>). PEDF level was found to decrease during cellular senescence and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pignolo et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tombran-Tink et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Francis et al., 2004</xref>) and in many pathological conditions. A significant decrease in PEDF level in the eyes has been observed in patients with age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy, two major blinding diseases characterized by neovascularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ogata et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Spranger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holekamp et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ogata et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boehm et al., 2003</xref>). PEDF levels were also found to decrease with age in human eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ogata et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith and Steinle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Steinle et al., 2008</xref>). PEDF expression has been inversely related to metastasis in a variety of cancer types such as gliomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guan et al., 2003</xref>), lymphangiomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sidle et al., 2005</xref>), hepatoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matsumoto et al., 2004</xref>), melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Orgaz et al., 2009</xref>), lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2006a</xref>), pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Uehara et al., 2004</xref>), and prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Halin et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>A long-standing challenge has been to understand how PEDF acts on different cell types and its fundamental transmembrane mechanisms. Uncovering the transmembrane pathways of PEDF would lead to a better understanding of its fundamental mechanisms and the development of new therapeutic strategies. After many years of effort in trying both existing and new strategies on a variety of native tissues and cell types, we were unable to identify the PEDF receptor, likely due to its low abundance and transient nature of expression. Since PEDF's actions do not match any well-characterized receptors, we reasoned that its receptor is likely new and uncharacterized. We tested human orphan receptors and transmembrane domain proteins of unknown function for their ability to bind native PEDF on the cell surface and found two transmembrane domain proteins that confer cell-surface PEDF binding and have other properties expected of PEDF receptors. These two membrane proteins both have a large extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain, and share about 50% homology. These two membrane proteins are called plexin domain containing 1 (PLXDC1) and plexin domain containing 2 (PLXDC2). Gene and protein expression studies have revealed overlapping but distinct tissue expression patterns of PLXDC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">St Croix et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gaultier et al., 2010</xref>) and PLXDC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leighton et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McMurray et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miller-Delaney et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boheler et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cell-surface binding of PEDF mediated by PLXDC1 and PLXDC2</title><p>A prerequisite for a cell-surface receptor is the ability to confer cell-surface binding to the extracellular ligand.

We used three cell types that respond robustly and reproducibly to PEDF as cellular models to study PEDF receptors: macrophage cell RAW267.4, endothelial cell SVEC4-10, and neuronal cell 661W. These three cell types represent three distinct cellular targets of PEDF. We found that both PLXDC1 and PLXDC2 are expressed in these three cellular models, consistent with previous knowledge that both RAW267.4 and SVEC4-10 cells express PLXDC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gaultier et al., 2010</xref>). In macrophage RAW267.4, PEDF is known to stimulate secretion of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zamiri et al., 2006</xref>). To perform loss of function studies, we screened for siRNAs that can effectively knockdown PLXDC1 or PLXDC2 expression in RAW26.4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The most effective siRNA was used in subsequent functional assays. We found that knocking down of either PLXDC1 or PLXDC2 led to a substantial decrease in PEDF response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Conversely, transfection of either receptor into macrophages further augments PEDF-induced secretion of IL-10 without increasing basal activity (basal activity is defined as receptor activity without PEDF treatment) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Either receptor lacking the cytoplasmic domain no longer has this activity, consistent with role of the cytoplasmic domain in cellular signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Tyrosine 481 in human PLXDC1 is a highly conserved residue in the cytoplasmic domain and is a potential phosphorylation site. PLXDC1 with a mutation of this single residue in the cytoplasmic domain (Y481F) has highly enhanced PEDF-mediated response without increasing the basal activity of the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). One potential mechanism is that phosphorylation of this residue dampens receptor signaling and the mutation prevents this inhibition. PLXDC1 transfected cell shows about 100% increased activity in response to 2 nM PEDF as compared to control cells, while PLXDC1-Y481F cells showed about 400% increased activity in response to PEDF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This profound stimulatory effect on PEDF signaling by mutating a single intracellular conserved residue in PLXDC1 supports its role in PEDF signaling.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05401.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The roles of PLXDC1 and PLXDC2 in PEDF-induced IL-10 secretion by macrophage cell RAW267.4.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) siRNA-mediated knockdown of PLXDC1 or PLXDC2 substantially suppresses PEDF-stimulated IL-10 secretion.

What is the consequence of PEDF's binding to these receptors? To answer this question, we performed further mechanistic studies on PEDF/receptor interaction. We hypothesized that PEDF might affect the oligomerization states of the receptors. We found that PLXDC1 and PLXDC2 form homooligomers in the absence of PEDF. We designed experiments to compare homooligomerization and heterooligomerization and found that PLXDC1 and PLXDC2 preferentially form homooligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using deletion series of the extracellular domains, we identified domain D as an important domain for oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We noticed that the last residue in the cytoplasmic domain of both PLXDC1 and PLXDC2 is a conserved cysteine. Since intracellular cysteines are in the reduced state, we tested whether copper phenanthroline-induced thiol oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>) could crosslink these cysteines. Indeed, we found that copper phenanthroline promoted the formation of covalent dimers, consistent with the close proximity of the two cysteines on the cytoplasmic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This covalent dimer can be cleaved under reducing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), consistent with its linkage through a disulfide bond catalyzed by copper phenanthroline.

PLXDC1 and PLXDC2 represent a receptor family of their own that has two members in human. Through both loss of function and gain of function studies using three distinct cellular models that respond robustly to PEDF, we showed that both receptors have the expected properties of PEDF receptors in transducing PEDF signal and have cell type-specific roles. How does PEDF activate its cell-surface receptors? Our experiments suggest that these receptors form homodimers under basal conditions, and the dimerization functions to inhibit self-activation. PEDF activates its receptors through dissociation of the dimer. PEDF's ability to dissociate the receptor dimer was demonstrated using three independent techniques. Without oligomerization provided by the extracellular domains, the cytoplasmic domain of the PEDF receptor is sufficient to activate downstream signaling. We also showed that modulating the cytoplasmic domain strongly affects receptor signaling. For example, a mutation in a conserved tyrosine residue in the cytoplasmic domain of PLXDC1 greatly enhanced PEDF-induced and PLXDC1-dependent IL-10 secretion from macrophages. Structure and function analysis revealed an important PEDF-interacting domain and a dimerization domain in the receptors.</p><p>PLXDC1 and PLXDC2 are homologous membrane proteins with overlapping but distinct expression patterns in physiological and pathological conditions, as revealed by gene and protein expression studies.

PLXDC1 was also found to be highly expressed in the endothelial cells of another human disease- diabetic retinopathy- and is highly specific to diseased blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yamaji et al., 2008</xref>). PLXDC1 is also expressed on the macrophage cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gaultier et al., 2010</xref>) and is downregulated by LRP-1, a large membrane protein involved in endocytosis of a variety of cell surface receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herz et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Herz and Strickland, 2001</xref>). In contrast, PLXDC2, but not PLXDC1, was found as one of the genes that increase in expression during cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schwarze et al., 2005</xref>), as one of the E2F1 target genes repressed by serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hallstrom et al., 2008</xref>), as a gene negatively correlated with malignant cell transformation in tumors and its disturbance increases tumor volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McMurray et al., 2008</xref>), and as a candidate axon guidance molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leighton et al., 2001</xref>). Microarray analysis also revealed PLXDC2, but not PLXDC1, as one of the markers of adult stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Noh, 2006</xref>). Proteomic analysis also revealed PLXDC2 on the cell surface of human pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boheler et al., 2014</xref>). PLXDC2 is also known as a mitogen for neuroprogenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miller-Delaney et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, expression patterns of both PEDF and PLXDC2 have been previously linked to cellular growth states. PEDF expression correlates with G0 growth arrest in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pignolo et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2003</xref>) and has been demonstrated to induce cell cycle arrest of glioma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). The correlation between PLXDC2 and cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miller-Delaney et al., 2011</xref>), senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schwarze et al., 2005</xref>), transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McMurray et al., 2008</xref>) and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hallstrom et al., 2008</xref>) has been noted in several studies. Consistent with these earlier reports, our study identified PLXDC2 as playing the dominant role in a PEDF-induced endothelial cell death model.</p><p>From a different perspective, this study identified the extracellular ligand for two membrane proteins and showed that they function as cell-surface receptors that can transduce an extracellular signal. These receptors represent a new type of cell-surface receptor. They oligomerize in the basal state and are activated by ligand-induced dissociation. Mechanistically, they behave oppositely from many known single transmembrane domain signaling receptors that are activated by ligand-induced dimerization. However, detailed mechanisms can be complex, as exemplified by the human grown hormone receptor. For a long time after its original discovery more than two decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leung et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cunningham and Wells, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cunningham et al., 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">1991a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">1991b</xref>), the growth hormone receptor was hypothesized to be activated by ligand-induced receptor dimerization, as revealed by classic studies. A recent study suggested that its conformational change is similar to that of scissors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brooks et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>PEDF receptors have at least two mechanisms to diversify their function and regulation. First, both human PLXDC1 and PLXDC2 have several isoforms. Second, receptors can couple to different immediate downstream molecules. The immediate downstream molecules that transduce the PEDF receptor signal (the equivalent of G-proteins for G-protein coupled receptors) are still unknown. As shown by G-protein coupled receptors, distinct cellular responses can be governed not only by distinct cell-surface receptors, but also by distinct downstream molecules. Because PEDF is a multifunctional factor, understanding the fundamental mechanisms of its transmembrane receptors in different cellular contexts will help to develop potent and specific small molecule-based therapeutics in treating diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>PEDF purification from conditioned media</title><p>To purify PEDF, we performed large-scale transfection of human PEDF cDNA into HEK293T cells using Jetprime reagent (Polyplus-transfection SA, Illkirch, France).

The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of binding buffer before elution using buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5 with 100, 200, 300, or 400 mM NaCl. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using polyethyleneimine column was performed to further purify PEDF. Briefly, buffer exchange for the Q fraction containing PEDF was performed for three times by diluting with 10 vol of column buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 8.4) and concentrating in an Amicon Ultra-4 filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA) before being loaded onto the HPLC system. HPLC was performed using the Agilent 1100 series liquid chromatography system with a diode-array detector.

The final volume of each concentrated elution was 0.5 ml. The presence of PEDF was confirmed by both total gel staining and Western blot analysis. Protein sterilization was achieved using Ultrafree Durapore 0.22 μm filter (Millipore). We also produced PEDF with a 6XHis tag followed by the HA tag at the N-terminus after the secretion signal and PEDF with an 8XHis tag at the C-terminus of PEDF. We found that tagging significantly diminishes the biological activity of PEDF. Therefore, all biological assays were performed using untagged PEDF. The negative effect of epitope tagging on PEDF is likely one of the reasons that PEDF receptors are difficult to identify.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Engineering cDNAs for PLXDC1 and PLXDC2</title><p>The domains for human PLXDC1 (numbered according to the full length receptor with the secretion signal) were: domain A (19–127), domain B (128–242), domain C (243–292), and domain D (293–359). We also created chimeras containing the transmembrane domain (TM) of another single transmembrane protein DCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stein and Tessier-Lavigne, 2001</xref>) and the C-terminus of the receptors. The DCC TM domain was fused to the secretion signal of alkaline phosphatase and Rim tag at the N-terminus and the cytoplasmic tail of PLXDC1 or PLXDC2 at the C-terminus. A monoclonal antibody has been produced against the Rim tag, which has 14 residues (NETYDLPLHPRTAG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Illing et al., 1997</xref>). The most likely positions of phosphorylation sites in the cytoplasmic domains of human PLXDC1 and PLXDC2 were identified through PhosphoSite Plus, a bioinformatics resource to identify potential protein phosphorylation sites (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phosphosite.org/staticUsingPhosphosite.do">http://www.phosphosite.org/staticUsingPhosphosite.do</ext-link>). Residue numbers are according to human isoform 1. The secretion signal for alkaline phosphatase (AP) followed by the Rim tag was engineered at the N-terminus of each extracellular domain.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Receptor binding assay</title><p>PEDF was biotinylated using sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce, Rockford, IL) after overnight dialysis in PBS at 4°C. After biotinylation, free biotin was removed by further overnight dialysis in PBS at 4°C and the degree of biotinylation was assessed by visualizing the shifting of molecular weight in SDS-PAGE gels after incubation with streptavidin. The advantage of biotinylation is that biotin is a tag much smaller than peptide tags or fusion protein tags and is less likely to interfere with biological activities. In addition, biotin is added after protein production and folding and allows sensitive detection. However, excessive biotinylation can inactivate proteins due to the modification of key lysine residues. To prevent excessive biotinylation, the ideal degree of biotinylation is about 90%, as judged by shifting in molecular weight after binding to streptavidin. Biotinylated PEDF (20 nM) was added to transfected or control cells grown on a fibronectin-coated dish in HBSS with 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 and 2 mg/ml BSA at room temperature for 1 hour. After two continuous washes with HBSS, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, the cells were fixed using freshly made 4% paraformaldehyde in HBSS, pH 7.5 for 20 min. The cells were heated in HBSS at 65°C for 1 hr to inactive endogenous AP activity. After blocking in 5 mg/ml BSA in PBS for 1 hour, the cells were incubated with streptavidin-AP diluted in 5 mg/ml BSA in PBS. After four washes using PBS, AP activity was visualized using NBT/BCIP (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Receptor dimer crosslinking catalyzed by copper phenanthroline [Cu (II) Phe]</title><p>Membranes were prepared from HEK293 cells transfected with the receptors using PBS and 5 mM EDTA, which helps to keep free cysteine residues in the reduced state. After one wash using PBS, the membrane was resuspended in PBS and incubated with or without PEDF for 3 hr at room temperature. Oxidation-induced disulfide bond formation was catalyzed by 0.5 mM Cu (II) Phe. After 5 min, EDTA was added to each reaction to 50 mM to stop the oxidation reaction. The membranes were spun down, resuspended and boiled in SDS loading buffer with or without DTT for loading onto a SDS-PAGE gel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Assay to visualize the dissociation of receptor extracellular domain by PEDF</title><p>We developed a live cell-based assay to study the ability of PEDF to dissociate receptor complexes. PLXDC1 extracellular domain with a Rim tag following the N-terminal secretion signal of alkaline phosphatase is cotransfected into COS-1 cells with wild-type PLXDC1 with no tag. The Rim-tagged extracellular domain of PLXDC1 associates with the cell surface through its interaction with the extracellular domain of the full length PLXDC1. 1 day after transfection, the cells were washed once with HBSS and incubated overnight at 37°C in SFM with 5 mg/ml BSA with or without 50 nM PEDF. The next day cell surface associated Rim tagged protein is assessed through live cell staining by anti-Rim antibody by incubating with antibody diluted in SFM with 5 mg/ml BSA for 60 min at 37°C. After antibody binding, the cells were washed with HBSS and fixed in freshly made 4% paraformaldehyde in HBSS, pH 7.5 for 20 min. Rim antibody was detected through immunostaining using anti-mouse secondary antibody. Fluorescent signals were quantified using Nikon NIS Elements AR Analysis software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Cell death assay</title><p>The survival of SVEC4-10 endothelial cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) upon PEDF treatment was analyzed by the MTT assay. Briefly, SVEC4-10 cells were grown in 10% FBS in DMEM containing penicillin and streptomycin until confluency. Cell death was initiated by splitting confluent SVEC 1:10 in serum free media (SFM) and 1 mg/ml BSA with or without 20 nM PEDF. PEDF was added before cell addition. Trypsin used in cell splitting was neutralized by defined trypsin inhibitor (Gibco) and removed by spinning down the cells. Cell viability was assessed 24 hr later after cell plating. MTT assay was done by incubating cells with 100 μg/ml MTT reagent (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) in SFM for 3 hr at 37°C. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to each well after MTT was removed. The absorbance of the purple color from the formazan formed was measured and quantified using POLARstar Omega (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany) at 534 nm. For cell death assay on siRNA transfected cells, cell plating in SFM (with or without PEDF addition) was done after two rounds of 48-hour transfection. For cell death assay on DNA transfected cells, the cells were split at 1:15 ratio 16 hours before transfection and were transfected using Jetprime reagent (about 40–50% confluency during transfection). Cell plating in SFM and 1 mg/ml BSA (with or without PEDF addition) was done 16 hours after transfection. All assays were performed in 96-well plates in triplicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Assay for neurotrophic activity of PEDF</title><p>We found that PEDF protects cone-derived 661W cells from hydrogen peroxide-mediated oxidative damage. 661W cells were grown in 10% FBS, 40 μg/l of hydrocortisone 21-hemisuccinate, 40 μg/l of progesterone, 32 mg/l of putrescine, 40 μl/l of β-mercaptoethanol in DMEM containing penicillin and streptomycin and treated with 10 nM PEDF for 20 hours. After addition of 2.5 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 1 hr (to achieve about 90% cell death in control cells the next day), the media was replaced with fresh media and the cells were continuously grown for 24 hours. Cell survival was quantified using the MTT assay as described above. For siRNA transfected cells, 10 nM PEDF was added after two rounds of 48-hour transfection. For DNA transfection, the cells were split at 1:5 ratio 16 hours before transfection and were transfected using Jetprime reagent. Four hours after transfection, the media was changed to fresh media and PEDF was added.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Assay for IL-10 secretion by macrophage</title><p>Macrophage cell line RAW267.4 (ATCC) was grown in RPMI1640 media with 10% FBS (Gibco Certified Performance Plus FBS), penicillin and streptomycin. For DNA transfection, the cells were split at 1:6 ratio 16 hours before transfection and were transfected using Jetprime reagent. Eight hours after transfection, the media was changed to fresh media and PEDF was added. PEDF-induced IL-10 secretion from macrophages was assayed using mouse IL-10 ELISA kit from Southern Biotech 18 hours after PEDF addition. For siRNA transfection, media was changed to fresh media and PEDF was added after two rounds of 48-hour transfection. All final assays were performed in 96-well plates in triplicate. We found that longer culture of RAW267.4 cells without cell replating leads to more responsiveness to PEDF. Since siRNA experiments need longer cell culture time, cells are consistently more responsive to PEDF than cells in DNA transfection experiments, which are done only 1 day after transfection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>siRNA-mediated knockdown</title><p>After screening many siRNA transfection reagents including X-tremeGENE (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), siTran (Origene, Rockville, MD), Jetprime (Polyplus-transfection SA), RNAiMAX (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), and GenMute (SignaGen, Rockville, MD), we found that the most effective siRNA transfection reagent is RNAiMAX. Since the three cell types (RAW267.4, SVEC4-10 and 661W) that were used as cellular models to study PEDF receptors are all mouse cells, siRNAs targeting mouse genes were tested. For mouse PLXDC1, siRNAs tested included Dharmacon D-060224-01 (siRNA-1), Dharmacon D-060224-02 (siRNA-2), Dharmacon D-060224-03 (siRNA-3), Dharmacon D-060224-04 (siRNA-4), Invitrogen 4390771-s90877 (siRNA-5), Invitrogen 4390771-s90878 (siRNA-6), Dharmacon smart pool L-060224-01 (siRNA-7) and Origene 866091-SR46066C (siRNA-8). For mouse PLXDC2, siRNAs tested included Dharmacon D-059538-01 (siRNA-1), Dharmacon D-059538-02 (siRNA-2), Dharmacon D-059538-03 (siRNA-3), Dharmacon D-059538-04 (siRNA-4), Invitrogen 4390771-n380220 (siRNA-5), Invitrogen 4390771-n380229 (siRNA-6), Dharmacon smart pool L-059538-01 (siRNA-7), and Origene 866094-SR416812C (siRNA-8). For mouse LRP-1, siRNAs tested included Origene SR423695A-866095 (siRNA-1) and SR423695B-866096 (siRNA-2). Control siRNA was from Invitrogen. The most effective siRNA was transfected through reverse transfection using RNAiMAX in antibiotic free culture medium at 50 nM concentration with a cell splitting ratio of 1:5. To achieve a high transfection rate and knockdown effect, reverse transfection was performed twice consecutively following the manufacturer's protocol. At 48 hr after transfection, the cells were reverse transfected again using the same siRNA for the second round of knockdown. Functional assays were performed 48 hours after the second round of reverse transfection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Gene expression analysis</title><p>Gene expression levels were analyzed by RT-PCR. Briefly, total RNA was extracted from cells with a kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Total RNA concentration was measured by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific). Total RNA was then used to generate cDNA by using ThemoScript Reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies). Mouse PLXDC1 was amplified by 5′-GGAGGCAGAAGGCAAGACATGCG-3′and 5′-CGTGGAGGCCGAGCAGTGCTGA-3′. Mouse PLXDC2 was amplified by 5′-CTGCCAGCCGGGATCTGTGGGTTAACATAGACC-3′ and 5′-GGGAAGTGGAGTCATCTCCACAGCTGAGATGTTGG-3′.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Copurification studies</title><p>Rim-tagged proteins were purified using the anti-Rim antibody- conjugated to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham/GE Healthcare). Briefly, cells were washed once with HBSS and lysed in well with 1% Triton X-100 in HBSS and protease inhibitors for 30 min on ice. Cell lysate was spun at 16,000×<italic>g</italic>, 4°C for 10 min to remove insoluble materials. Cell lysate was applied to anti-Rim antibody conjugated beads, and rotated for 4 hr at 4°C. The beads were washed three times using 0.1% Triton X-100 in HBSS by spinning down at 1000×<italic>g</italic> for 30 s and eluted in 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1 M Glycine, pH = 2.3 for 15 min at room temperature. Tris (pH 9.5) was added to 0.1 M to neutralize the elution before the samples were analyzed. HA-tagged proteins were detected using a monoclonal anti-HA antibody. To compare homooligomerization and heteroligomerization, anti-Rim purification was performed 24 hr after cells were transfected with Rim-tagged PLXDC1 (20%), HA-tagged PLXDC1 (40%) and untagged PLXDC2 (40%) in one experiment and Rim-tagged PLXDC2 (20%), HA-tagged PLXDC2 (40%) and untagged PLXDC1 (40%) in another experiment. Copurified receptors were detected either by anti-HA antibody or antibody specific to PLXDC1 or PLXDC2. Polyclonal antibodies against the N-terminal peptide of human PLXDC1 (SPQPGAGHDEGPGSGWAAKGTVRG) and the N-terminal peptide of human PLXDC2 (KPGDQILDWQYGVTQAFPHTE) were produced by conjugating the peptides to KLH before immunization of rabbits (Genemed Synthesis, San Antonio, TX). Antibodies were purified from rabbit crude sera using the corresponding peptide conjugated to Affigel (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Real-time analysis of PEDF-mediated dissociation of receptor oligomerization by fluorescence resonance transfer (FRET)</title><p>CFP and YFP proteins were fused to the C-terminus of PLXDC1 and PLXDC2 to detect oligomerization of PEDF receptors. Three glycine linkers were added between YFP/CFP and the C-terminal tail of PLXDC1 or PLXDC2. FRET analysis was performed similarly as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kawaguchi et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, membranes were prepared from HEK293 cells that coexpress PLXDC1-CFP and PLXDC2-YFP. CFP-YFP FRET was measured in black flat bottom 96-well plates (Microfluor 2, Thermo Scientific) using simultaneous dual emission optics in POLARstar Omega with excitation filter 422-20 and emission filters 470-12 and 530-10. The background signal of each reaction was measured before PEDF was added to the membrane suspension to initiate the reactions. The signal from each time point was the average of 20 measurements. After all the measurements were done, the signals were calculated as the ratio of emissions at 530 nm over emissions at 470 nm to observe the dynamic change in FRET. To crosslink the C-terminal free cysteine using BMOE (Pierce), membrane preparations were made in PBS and 5 mM EDTA. BMOE was added to the membrane suspension at a concentration of 2 mM. The reaction was carried out at room temperature for 1 hour. Concentrated DTT solution was added to 5 mM to quench the reaction. After incubation at room temperature for 10 min, 1 ml of HBSS/HEPES (HBSS with 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5) was added to the membrane suspension. After the membranes were pelleted down, the resulting membrane pellets were washed once and resuspended in HBSS/HEPES for FRET measurement.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Supported by the Early Career Scientist Award of Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HS) and UCLA Claude Pepper Older Americans Independence Center (HS).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Charles Sawyers (Senior editor) and 2 reviewers, one of whom, Michael Brown, served as Reviewing editor.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Reviewer 1 raised the following major issue: The current paper presents the discovery of a pair of cell surface receptors for PEDF, a peptide that is reported to exert a bewildering array of different actions on various cells and pathologic processes. The authors provide evidence for a novel mechanism of action whereby the two receptors (PLXDC1 and PLXDC2) are present in an inactive heterodimer in the basal state. PEDF binds to either PLXDC1 or PLXDC2, which causes the heterodimer to dissociate, thereby allowing each of the receptors to transmit regulatory signals.</p><p>The authors use a variety of cell types and a variety of cell biological methods to establish the mode of action of PEDF. In general, the experiments are well performed. The binding experiments involve overexpression, which always has the potential to create artificial interactions. However, the RNAi-mediated knockdown experiments support the model.</p><p>A concern regarding the proposed dimer dissociation mechanism is that it requires that each cell type express stoichiometrically equal amounts of both receptors. If one of the isoforms is expressed in excess it should be free to signal in the absence of PEDF. This conclusion seems inconsistent with the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, 2D and 2E</xref> in which overexpression of PLXDC1 does not increase IL-10 secretion in RAW 267.4 cells in the absence of added PEDF. A similar discrepancy occurs in the experiment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> in which knockdown of neither PLXDC1 nor PLXDC2 causes the death of SVEC4-10 cells in the absence of added PEDF.

We proposed that PEDF dissociates receptor homooligomers (e.g., PLXDC1 dimers) to activate the receptor. Because our model involves homooligomers, not heterooligomers, the model is not affected by their stoichiometry. We did not study or discuss heterooligomers in the original manuscript. However, whether these receptors preferentially form homooligomer or heterooligomer is an interesting question. We have performed a new experiment to answer this question and found that both PLXDC1 and PLXDC2 prefer to form homooligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>). This result is consistent with the homooligomer model we proposed in the original manuscript. We agree with Reviewer 1’s comment that a model that depends on heterooligomer formation is problematic due to the requirement of strict stoichiometry in the expression of both receptors in all cell types.</p><p><italic>[T]he case made for LRP1 as a co-receptor for PLXDC1 and 2 is solely based on data shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>and that evidence is weak.

We originally included these experiments because a previous study identified PLXDC1 as a membrane protein downregulated by LRP-1 (Gaultier et al, 2010). However, due to the extremely large size of LRP-1, detailed mapping of its interaction with PLXDC1 and PLXDC2 is a separate topic that demands systematic work in the future. siRNA-2 for LRP-1 in the Figure reproducibly knocked down LRP-1 expression by more than 80%. We also tried PEA-10 cells (Lrp-1 +/-) and PEA-13 cells (Lrp-1 -/-), but encountered the difficulty that currently no PEDF-related assay has been established in these cellular models.</p></body></sub-article></article>
