However, tumors may induce NK cell conversion into ILC1-like cells that are limited to the tumor microenvironment and whether this conversion occurs beyond this environment remains unknown. Here, we describe <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> infection converts NK cells into ILC1-like cells that are distinct from both steady-state NK cells and ILC1s in uninfected mice. These cells were Eomes-dependent, indicating that NK cells can give rise to Eomes<sup>–</sup> Tbet-dependent ILC1-like cells that circulate widely and persist independent of ongoing infection. Moreover, these changes appear permanent, as supported by epigenetic analyses. Thus, these studies markedly expand current concepts of NK cells, ILCs, and their potential conversion.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>NK cells</kwd><kwd>ILC</kwd><kwd>toxoplasma</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30DK108472</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Eugene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI120606</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oltz</surname><given-names>Eugene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI134035</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Colonna</surname><given-names>Marco</given-names></name><name><surname>Oltz</surname><given-names>Eugene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI11852</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oltz</surname><given-names>Eugene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA188286</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oltz</surname><given-names>Eugene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI128845</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yokoyama</surname><given-names>Wayne M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> infection leads to conversion of natural killer cells into cells resembling innate lymphoid cells, group 1, that circulate widely, disrupting current notions suggesting that these cells have distinct lineages.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) comprise diverse populations. Like T and B cells, they are derived from common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) but do not undergo antigen receptor recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Spits and Cupedo, 2012</xref>). ILCs are tissue-resident within mucosal sites where they participate in tissue homeostasis and survey for pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sojka et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gasteiger et al., 2015</xref>), although recent studies showed that inflammation can induce ILC2 mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). ILC classification was initially based on their cytokine production, with type 1 ILCs (ILC1s) producing IFNγ, ILC2s producing IL-5 and IL-13, and ILC3s producing IL-17 and IL-22. ILC classification was subsequently corroborated by distinctive markers and developmental requirements.</p><p>Prior to the discovery of ILCs, NK cells were the only known innate CD3<sup>–</sup> lymphocytes. Their classification within the larger scheme of ILCs has been challenging, in particular due to their strong resemblance to ILC1s while also maintaining important distinctions. For example, mouse ILC1s and NK cells both express NK1.1 and NKp46 and produce IFNγ, and as such were initially classified together as Group 1 ILCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Spits et al., 2013</xref>). However, grouping NK cells with ILC1s was confounded by several discordant features. Whereas ILC1s are restricted to organs, and CD49a expression is a faithful marker of tissue-resident populations under steady-state conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sojka et al., 2014a</xref>), most NK cells freely circulate. These cells also differ in their developmental requirements, with NK cells requiring Eomes for development, while Eomes is not expressed in ILC1s and is dispensable for development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daussy et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, ILC1s are completely Tbet-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daussy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sojka et al., 2014a</xref>), whereas NK cells require Tbet only for maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Townsend et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gordon et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with their differential requirements for T-box transcription factors, NK cells and ILC1s arise at different branch points downstream of the CLP. While NK cells originate from NK cell precursor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rosmaraki et al., 2001</xref>), other ILCs further differentiate along a pathway that includes the common helper innate lymphoid progenitor (CHILP) and ILC precursor (ILCP), which do not have NK cell potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klose et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Constantinides et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Given the many ways in which NK cells and ILC1s differ, ILC classification was recently revised so that NK cells and ILC1s are now considered distinct ILC lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vivier et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Constructing clear definitions of NK cells and ILC1s is complicated, however, by their plasticity and heterogeneity upon stimulation, which can alter the features that discriminate between them under steady state conditions. For example, within the tumor microenvironment or upon in vitro culture with TGF-β, NK cells may downregulate Eomes and resemble ILC1s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cortez et al., 2016</xref>). However, these cells are found only in the tumor microenvironment in vivo and it is not clear if they can persist in the absence of tumor. Moreover, NK cells and ILC1s become activated under similar circumstances, such as murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Weizman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dadi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yokoyama, 2013</xref>). As it is currently difficult to assess NK cells independently of ILC1s, changes undergone by either population may be masked by the presence of the other. Independent examination of each population, especially in settings known to stimulate NK cells and ILC1s, is required to better understand these cells and their relationship to each other.</p><p>Both NK cells and ILC1s respond to infection with <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, an intracellular parasite that infects a third of the global population and is a natural pathogen in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Montoya and Liesenfeld, 2004</xref>). During acute infection, rapidly replicating tachyzoites disseminate systemically, triggering dendritic cells to produce IL-12, which subsequently stimulates NK cells to produce IFNγ and ILC1s to produce IFNγ and TNFα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klose et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goldszmid et al., 2012</xref>). Tachyzoites eventually differentiate into slowly replicating bradyzoites, which are primarily encysted within cells of the central nervous system and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yarovinsky, 2014</xref>). As <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection elicits activation of both NK cells and ILC1s, herein we sought to investigate how NK cells and ILC1s respond to gain better insight into inflammation-induced changes. Indeed, we found that ILC1s become permanently heterogeneous after infection, largely owing to the surprising conversion of NK cells into ILC1-like cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>T. gondii</italic> infection results in expansion of ILC1-like cells</title><p>Following administration of anti-NK1.1, acute infection with the type II Prugniaud (Pru) strain of <italic>T. gondii</italic> resulted in increased parasite load and higher mortality rates as compared to isotype control-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goldszmid et al., 2007</xref>). Since anti-NK1.1 affects both NK cells and ILC1s and both have been previously implicated in the immune response to <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goldszmid et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klose et al., 2014</xref>), we sought to investigate how NK cells and ILC1s respond to infection. Here, we assessed these populations by following expression of Eomesodermin (Eomes) and CD49a among CD3<sup>–</sup> CD19<sup>–</sup> NK1.1<sup>+</sup> NKp46<sup>+</sup> cells, as NK cells express Eomes and not CD49a while ILC1s express CD49a but not Eomes at steady-state. In the uninfected spleen, the vast majority of NK1.1<sup>+</sup> NKp46<sup>+</sup> cells were NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). There was a small population of spleen cells resembling ILC1s in uninfected mice, even though ILC1s are primarily found in other organs including the liver and small intestine and are generally tissue-resident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sojka et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fuchs et al., 2013</xref>), whereas cells in the spleen are generally circulating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gasteiger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sojka et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peng et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, over the course of infection, NK cells decreased both as a proportion of NK1.1<sup>+</sup> NKp46<sup>+</sup> cells and in absolute number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). By contrast, there was an increase in cells resembling ILC1s that was clearly evident at 21-day post-infection (p.i.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>). Since ILC1 markers were established for ILC1s in uninfected mice, we have termed these cells resembling ILC1s as ‘ILC1-like cells.’ Notably, ILC1-like cells from infected mice mostly expressed Ly6C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,D</xref>), a marker that correlates with NK cell maturity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Omi et al., 2014</xref>) and is expressed by MCMV-induced memory NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sun et al., 2012</xref>) and is not expressed by the vast majority of ILC1-like cells present in the spleen under steady-state conditions.

This suggested that the ILC1-like cells from infected mice may not uniformly circulate and rather they might preferentially migrate to the liver despite originating in the spleen. Alternatively, the adoptive transfer studies may be revealing properties of heterogeneous populations of cells. To further evaluate these issues, we studied the liver, which contains a large population of ILC1s in uninfected mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sojka et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peng et al., 2013</xref>), in more detail directly following primary infection. Infection decreased the frequency of liver NK cells among NK1.1<sup>+</sup> NKp46<sup>+</sup> cells, although the total NK cell number did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>). Notably, we observed that infection resulted in a striking population of liver Eomes<sup>+</sup> CD49a<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>). The frequency and absolute number of ILC1s also did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>).

Interestingly, Ly6C was expressed at a higher percentage by cells with an ILC1 phenotype (Eomes<sup>–</sup> CD49a<sup>+</sup>) in the infected spleen (~80%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) than in the infected liver, where only half of such cells expressed Ly6C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), suggesting heterogeneity among liver cells resembling ILC1s.

Eomes<sup>+</sup> CD49a<sup>+</sup> cells were also present among counterpart WT cells, though at lower frequencies. These data suggested that ILC1-like cells in infected mice may be derived from Eomes<sup>+</sup> cells, that is, NK cells.</p><p>To better assess the heterogeneity induced by <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection and the role of Tbet in this process, we performed single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) on sorted WT (CD45.1<sup>+</sup>) or <italic>Tbx21</italic><sup>-/-</sup> (CD45.2<sup>+</sup>) NK1.1<sup>+</sup> NKp46<sup>+</sup> cells from uninfected and d35-infected WT:<italic>Tbx21<sup>-/-</sup></italic> chimeras. We chose to examine the liver for this analysis for several reasons: 1) infection appears to induce a novel ILC1-like subset that is common to the liver and spleen; 2) the liver contains ILC1s under steady-state, allowing for direct comparison of steady-state ILC1s and <italic>T. gondii</italic>-induced ILC1-like cells; and 3) the infected liver uniquely contains a <italic>Tbx21</italic><sup>-/-</sup> Eomes<sup>+</sup> CD49a<sup>+</sup> population. Using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis, we grouped the cells into 17 clusters, C1-C17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In the uninfected WT sample, C1 was the largest cluster, whereas C1 was diminished in the infected WT and <italic>Tbx21<sup>-/-</sup></italic> samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>). C1 cells expressed <italic>Eomes</italic> and <italic>Itgam</italic> but did not express <italic>Cd27</italic> or <italic>Itga1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,G</xref>), consistent with C1 being mature NK cells, which are indeed the predominant NK1.1<sup>+</sup> NKp46<sup>+</sup> cells present in the steady-state liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). C3 was the second largest cluster in the uninfected WT sample, and C3 cells did not express <italic>Eomes</italic> or <italic>Ly6c2</italic>, expressed <italic>Itga1</italic>, <italic>Cd27</italic>, and <italic>Cxcr6</italic>, and were absent in <italic>Tbx21<sup>-/-</sup></italic> samples, indicating that C3 comprised ILC1s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Two closely related clusters, C10 and C11, were unique to the infected WT sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>). Cells in C10 and C11 expressed <italic>Itga1</italic>, <italic>Ly6c2</italic>, and <italic>Klrg1</italic>, and did not express <italic>Eomes</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,G</xref>). This specificity to infection, Tbet-dependence, and gene expression identified these cells as <italic>T. gondii</italic>-induced ILC1-like cells. Interestingly, these two clusters indicated heterogeneity even within the <italic>T. gondii</italic>-induced ILC1-like population. The t-SNE analysis placed C10 closer to mature NK cells (C1) and C11 closer to ILC1s (C3). Comparison of C10 and C11 revealed that C10 expressed signature NK cell genes at higher levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robinette et al., 2015</xref>), whereas C11 expressed higher levels of signature ILC1 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Interestingly, C10 also highly expressed <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> whereas C11 did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,G</xref>). We corroborated these findings with flow cytometric analysis that showed that Ly6C<sup>+</sup> ILC1-like cells in the infected liver contained both a CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> CXCR6<sup>–</sup> population that expressed higher levels of Zeb2, mirroring the C10 phenotype, and also a CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>–</sup> CXCR6<sup>+</sup> population that mirrors C11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>). Furthermore, C10 expressed lower levels of <italic>Il7ra</italic> than C3 and C11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). As IL-7 receptor signaling is required for ILC1 development but not for NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klose et al., 2014</xref>), this finding is suggestive of discrete developmental origins of C10 and C11, which we further discuss below. C5 was also increased in the infected samples, and these cells co-expressed <italic>Eomes</italic> and <italic>Itga1</italic>, and were especially prominent in the infected <italic>Tbx21<sup>-/-</sup></italic> sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,G</xref>), suggesting that this cluster includes the Eomes<sup>+</sup> CD49a<sup>+</sup> cells that arose in the liver after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B</xref>).

Although an Eomes fate-mapping mouse, that is, <italic>Eomes<sup>Cre</sup></italic>, could be used to identify a cell-intrinsic role for Eomes, this was not possible due to the ubiquitous expression of Eomes during development (data not shown). Another approach would be to examine Eomes downregulation following adoptive transfer of congenic NK cells prior to infection but this was hindered due to the inability to find transferred cells after 14 d.p.i. (data not shown), possibly due to the high turnover of cells during infection. Rather, we used mixed bone marrow chimeras to examine a cell-intrinsic or cell-extrinsic requirement for Eomes during ILC1-like cell expansion. In uninfected mixed bone marrow chimeras reconstituted with WT cells and either <italic>Eomes<sup>f/f</sup></italic> or <italic>Eomes</italic> cKO cells, the contributions of <italic>Eomes<sup>f/f</sup></italic> and <italic>Eomes</italic> cKO cells to CD49a<sup>+</sup> cells were comparable, consistent with CD49a<sup>+</sup> cells being Eomes-independent ILC1s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).

Therefore most <italic>T. gondii</italic>-induced ILC1-like cells are ex-NK cells.</p><p>We postulated that STAT4 may play a role in the expansion of ILC1-like cells because STAT4 and IL-12 signaling is critical for NK cell and ILC1 activation during <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hunter et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cai et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klose et al., 2014</xref>). To test the relevance of this signaling in vivo, we infected WT:<italic>Stat4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mixed bone marrow chimeras. Indeed, STAT4-deficient ILC1-like cells were diminished following infection, while chimerism of NK cells and ILC1s remained equal between uninfected and infected chimeric mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>), suggesting that <italic>T. gondii</italic>-induced ILC1-like cells were dependent on STAT4. Additionally, in vitro culture of splenocytes from infected mice resulted in an increased frequency of ILC1-like cells following culture in IL-2 and IL-12, compared to culture in IL-2 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that IL-12 may contribute to ILC1-like cell expansion.

We found widespread chromatin remodeling in ILC1-like cells, which clustered separately from NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E,F</xref>). Most differentially accessible regions fell within intronic and intergenic regions, consistent with categorization as putative enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>We organized differentially accessible regulatory elements (REs) into a non-redundant peak set containing six groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Groups 1, 3, and 5 contained REs that were uniquely more accessible in uninfected NK cells, NK cells from infected mice, and ILC1-like cells, respectively. Groups 2, 4, and 6 contained REs that were shared between two groups. Group 2 encompassed REs that were more accessible in both NK cell groups relative to ILC1-like cells, and accounted for the largest fraction of peaks, showing that NK cells from both uninfected and infected mice share many epigenetic features. Group 4, which contained REs that were more accessible in both NK cells and ILC1-like cells from infected mice relative to uninfected NK cells, was the second largest group, suggesting that infection may induce epigenetic changes common to both populations.</p><p>We directly compared the REs in groups 3 and 5 to identify additional differences between NK cells and ILC1-like cells following infection. Analysis of transcription factor binding motifs revealed motifs that were significantly enriched in each population, such as NF-κb in group 3, whose motif was present in 13.2% of REs, and Klf4 in group 5, whose motif was present in 25.8% of REs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We also identified the specific loci that contained the most differentially accessible REs, and noted that the presence of more accessible REs generally correlated with greater gene expression. Notably, many of the epigenetic features shared by memory NK cells and memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lau et al., 2018</xref>) were among the loci that gained accessibility in ILC1-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

Overall, our data suggest that <italic>T. gondii</italic> induces the conversion of NK cells into ILC1-like cells in a process that encompasses changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Infection with <italic>T. gondii</italic>, a natural mouse pathogen, causes the expansion of a novel ILC1-like subpopulation that stably persists even after acute infection resolves. These ILC1-like cells are heterogeneous, due to contributions from both ILC1s and NK cells, though NK cells give rise to most ILC1-like cells by means of Eomes downregulation. These findings disrupt current notions surrounding NK cells and ILC1s, which were recently established as discrete ILC lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vivier et al., 2018</xref>), and exemplify the limitations of categorizing NK cells and ILC1s based solely on their phenotypes under steady-state conditions.</p><p>Previous studies indicated that Eomes downregulation may occur in NK cells within the tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gill et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2017</xref>) and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cortez et al., 2016</xref>). Akin to the intermediate ILC1s (intILC1s) described within tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2017</xref>), we found <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection induced Eomes<sup>+</sup> CD49a<sup>+</sup> NK cells in the liver, which are possibly intermediates between NK cells and ex-NK cells. However, our findings differ in several significant ways. The tumor studies indicated that Eomes<sup>–</sup> NK cells were restricted to tumors and emphasized the importance of the microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gill et al., 2012</xref>), concluding that within tumors, Eomes downregulation transiently silences NK cells to hamper immunosurveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Silver and Humbles, 2017</xref>). There was no evidence presented that these Eomes<sup>–</sup> cells can circulate, though they proliferate when adoptively transferred into lymphocyte-deficient hosts. Moreover, it is not clear if these cells persist in the absence of tumor. By contrast, <italic>T. gondii</italic>-induced ILC1-like cells are disseminated throughout the circulation, retain the ability to produce IFNγ, do not produce TNFα, and are maintained in the absence of ongoing stimulus.</p><p>Our findings further indicate a permanent transformation of <italic>T. gondii</italic>-induced ILC1-like cells rather than a transient response to inflammation, a notion that is further bolstered by the observations that ILC1-like cells possess a unique gene expression profile. Moreover, <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection induced epigenetic modifications in NK cells and ILC1-like cells, although our analysis did not specifically examine each of the different individual NK and ILC1-like subsets we identified by scRNA-seq. However, these modifications were extensive and could not be readily explained by heterogeneity in the ILC1-like cells that we discovered by scRNA-seq. Nonetheless, our studies go beyond just the differences between tumor-induced and <italic>T. gondii</italic>-induced Eomes downregulation. Our findings indicate that DX5 and CD49a expression to identify NK cells and ILC1s may not always faithfully reflect Eomes expression, as is the case during early <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection. Moreover, although there is clear evidence supporting conversion from NK cells to Eomes<sup>–</sup> NK cells, such as intILC1s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2017</xref>), there is a general inability to distinguish between preexisting ILC1s and de novo converted ILC1s. Indeed, this may explain discrepancies that currently exist within the field, such as the conflicting report that ILC1-like cells confer protection against certain tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dadi et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, our studies suggest that ILC1s may be more heterogeneous than currently thought, as they can arise from distinct precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vivier et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection, IL-12 is critical for NK cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gazzinelli et al., 1993</xref>) and our data suggest that it can have long-lasting effects. This parallels the requirements for development of memory and memory-like NK cells induced by MCMV and cytokine stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cooper et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Romee et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to IL-12 dependence, MCMV-induced memory NK cells and <italic>T. gondii</italic>-induced ILC1-like cells share Ly6C expression, as well as alterations in their receptor repertoire, although ILC1-like cells primarily express the inhibitory receptor NKG2A while MCMV-induced memory NK cells are Ly49H<sup>+</sup>. Moreover, memory and memory-like NK cells have few markers that differentiate them from resting NK cells, whereas NK cells converted by <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection lose expression of Eomes and gain expression of Ly6C, KLRG1, CX<sub>3</sub>CR1, and Nrp-1, with scRNA-seq revealing global transcriptional differences that identify them as a discrete subpopulation.</p><p>The persistence of ILC1-like cells after clearance of infection is reminiscent of classical immune memory and suggests that ex-NK cells play a role beyond what has been attributed to NK cells and ILC1s in <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection thus far. One possibility is that ILC1-like cells are an inflammatory subpopulation, such as the inflammatory ILC2s that gain circulatory capacity in response to activation by cytokines or infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). These inflammatory ILC2s can be distinguished from tissue-resident ILC2s based on their increased expression of KLRG1 and S1P receptors, features that are also characteristic of <italic>T. gondii</italic>-induced ILC1-like cells, but not steady-state tissue-resident NK cells. Most ILC1-like cells express CX<sub>3</sub>CR1, which has previously been shown to regulate NK cell recruitment into the circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ponzetta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sciume et al., 2011</xref>). Another possibility is that ILC1-like cells may provide a protective role in subsequent <italic>T. gondii</italic> infections, as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denkers et al., 1993</xref>), although this finding remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goldszmid et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, we have not been able to show that repeated injection of an avirulent <italic>T. gondii</italic> strain confers NK1.1-dependent protection against subsequent lethal re-challenge. Regardless, we have observed ILC1-like cell expansion following repeated exposure to avirulent <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains, and future studies may illuminate how gaining circulatory capacity affects the functionality of ILC1-like cells, and how these cells may contribute to subsequent immune responses to <italic>T. gondii</italic>.</p><p>In summary, we found that <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection induced permanent changes to NK cells and ILC1s, including conversion of NK cells into ILC1-like cells. Our studies indicate that the current system of ILC classification, based on their phenotype and development under steady state conditions, may not apply following inflammation. Rather, plasticity may give rise to populations that resemble one another at first glance, but actually represent the convergence of multiple developmental paths to form interrelated populations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">D-Luciferin, Potassium Salt</td><td valign="top">Gold Biotechnology</td><td valign="top">Cat#LUCK-1G; CAS 115144-35-9</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Sulfadiazine</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">Cat#S8626-25G</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Uracil</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">Cat#U1128</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Percoll</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">Cat#P1644</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Recombinant murine IL-12</td><td valign="top">Pepro Tech</td><td valign="top">Cat#210–12</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Recombinant mouse IL-18</td><td valign="top">MBL</td><td valign="top">Cat#B002-5</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Recombinant murine IL-15</td><td valign="top">Peptro Tech</td><td valign="top">Cat#210–15</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">DNase I</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">Cat#10104159001</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Collagenase Type IV</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">Cat#C5138-100mg</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set</td><td valign="top">eBioscience</td><td valign="top">Cat#00-5523-00</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">EasySep Magnet</td><td valign="top">BD Biosciences</td><td valign="top">Cat#1800</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">EasySep Mouse Streptavidin Rapidspheres Isolation Kit</td><td valign="top">BD Biosciences</td><td valign="top">Cat#19860</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Nextera Index Kit</td><td valign="top">Illumina</td><td valign="top">Cat#FC-121–1011</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">SMARTer PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit</td><td valign="top">Clontech</td><td valign="top">Cat#634926</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Human: HFF</td><td valign="top">John C.

Your article has been reviewed by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Chris Hunter (Reviewer #1); Jinfang Zhu (Reviewer #2); Eric O Long (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Natural Killer (NK) and the ILC1 subset of innate lymphoid cells share related functions in host defense but have been argued to arise from distinct pathways. Park et al. present new evidence challenging this concept. They show that murine <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> infection promotes the differentiation of NK cells into an ILC1-like cell population which is stable and long-lasting, even after the infection has been cleared. These <italic>T.gondii</italic> induced cells, unlike Eomes<sup>+</sup>CD49a<sup>-</sup> NK cells, are Eomes-CD49a<sup>+</sup>T-bet+ and therefore resemble ILC1 cells. The authors additionally show that their differentiation involves Eomes down regulation and is STAT-4 dependent, However, in common with NK cells and distinct from ILC1 the <italic>T. gondii</italic> induced &quot;ILC-like&quot; population circulates to blood and lungs. Finally, the authors employ single cell RNA-seq to examine the heterogeneity of the major <italic>T. gondii</italic> induced innate lymphocyte populations and their NK vs ILC relatedness as assessed by gene expression. Together, their observations establish a previously unappreciated developmental link between NK and ILC1 cells in the context of infection.</p><p>The three reviewers and editor agree that this is an important contribution that sheds new light on the developmental relationship of NK and ILC1 cells, a scientific issue that has received considerable attention in the innate immunity field. Although extensive, most of the criticisms raised can be addressed by revisions to the manuscript. One additional experiment is requested to provide a missing control.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers had a major concern about how this new population of <italic>T. gondii</italic> induced innate cells should be referred to in the manuscript. Based on the single cell RNA-seq data, these cells (cluster 10) are still closer to NK cells than to ILC1s (Figure 5F and Figure 6—figure supplement 1E) despite their loss in Eomes expression and acquisition of CD49a expression. Thus, one could easily think of them as &quot;Eomes negative NK&quot; or &quot;ex-NK&quot; cells rather than ILC1s, and to simply refer to them as Eomes-CD49a<sup>+</sup> ILC1 cells may be misleading. For this reason, the authors should modify the title of the paper and change their designation throughout the manuscript. We suggest &quot;ILC1-like&quot; as a good descriptor. In addition, although it is clear that the &quot;Eomes negative NK&quot; cells that are generated during <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection are transcriptionally and epigenetically distinct from the NK cells in the steady state and NK cells after infection (Figure 7 and Figure 8—figure supplement 1), these &quot;Eomes negative NK&quot; cells referred to as &quot;<italic>T. gondii</italic>-induced ILC1s&quot; were not directly compared with classical ILC1s. Based on the single cell RNA-seq data, these cells may not express many of the ILC1-related signature genes. Therefore, again, the authors need to be cautious in referring to them as ILC1 cells.</p><p>A second concern was that the NK 1.1 depletion shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 was performed with a PBS rather than isotope matched immunoglobulin control which is considered unacceptable. The authors should repeat at least once with proper control Ig to make sure this is not issue. It is not necessary to repeat entire survival curve just experiments shown in A and B and initial survival to make sure there is no death in controls vs. antibody treated.</p><p>1) Figure 3E-H is focused on the liver, where populations of memory and tissue-resident NK cells reside. Do the authors have data sets for the liver in Figure 3A-C? Do they express Ly6C? Including them in the bar graph of Figure 3C would be useful to identify if the liver trends with the lungs or with the brain (both sites of parasite infection/replication)…or alternatively authors should continue to focus on the lung throughout the entirety of Figure 3.</p><p>2) The conclusion of Figure 3F is that &quot;Eomes expression generally remained the same&quot;. However, for the representative flow plot of liver NK cells, the authors chose the lowest% of Eomes negative, while in the bar graph the rest of the points show that 20-50% of Eomes<sup>+</sup> NK cells became Eomes-ve after transfer and migration to the liver. Please reword statement appropriately as Eomes expression is really not the same when the data are pooled.</p><p>3) The interesting point of Figure 3G is the upregulation of CD49a on Eomes<sup>+</sup> NK cells post-infection. However, this population is eliminated from the subsequent histograms showing Ly6C expression. It may be of interest to note whether Ly6C expression by Eomes<sup>+</sup>CD49a<sup>+</sup> cells is more similar to ILC1s or NK cells, or occurs at an intermediate level (which would make sense if that population is being seeded from both NK cells and ILC1s).</p><p>4) There are a lot of data represented in Figure 4C-D, without much rationale or interpretation provided in the text suggesting that items may be more appropriate for a supplemental figure.</p><p>5) The CD45.2/.1 appears to be switched on Figure 6—figure supplement 1A.</p><p>6) Although the contour plots don't show outliers, the bottom panel of Figure 3E says 3.66%, but there's nothing in the gate, which is a bit misleading.</p><p>7) The% of Eomes cKO during infection is missing in Figure 6D (bottom).</p><p>8) The marker Ly6C figures prominently in most of the paper. What is the significance of its expression and of its induction by <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection? Please provide background.</p><p>9) A recurrent problem is insufficient description of Figures. In several cases (e.g. Figure 4, Figure 5A), the source of cells used for analysis is not given in the Figure, the legend or the text. It would help to include the source of cells, eg liver or spleen, in each of these places.</p><p>10) As suggested above it would strengthen the manuscript if the authors should characterize the Eomes<sup>+</sup>CD49a<sup>+</sup> cells found in the liver after <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection in a greater detail. Do they also express Ly6C?</p><p>11) In Figure 3F, ~30% of &quot;ILC1s&quot; re-express Eomes upon transfer; this should be discussed.</p><p>12) Figure 3D, the cell labels appear to be switched. Please check.</p><p>13) IL-7Ris an important marker to distinguish NK cells from ILC1s but the cells in cluster 10 do not express IL-7R as shown in Figure 5F. How about IL-2Rb? If possible the dependence of these NK/ILC1 subsets on IL-7 and/or IL-15 should be either tested or discussed.</p><p>14) Figure 3G is confusing. While there are 3 subsets for the combination of CD49a and Eomes expression (upper flow plots) only 2 are shown on the lower panels for Ly6C expression. What are they? Are the colors supposed to match between the top and low panels? Even so, it is not clearly visible.</p><p>15) Subsection “Expansion of ILC1s among circulating cells”. &quot;Ly6C was expressed by a higher percentage.&quot; Percentage of what?</p><p>16) A number of different markers were used to distinguish among cell subsets, as for example in Figure 4. In many cases, no reason is given for the choice of markers. On what basis were they selected? Besides a phenotypic distinction of subsets, do they contribute to an understanding of the function of these different cells? Please clarify in each case.</p><p>17) In Figure 4D, lower panels, p values are indicated for different comparisons between markers. The main comparisons should be between uninfected and infected cells, and between NK and ILC1. For what reason are NK cells from uninfected mice compared to ILC from infected mice for every marker measured?</p><p>18) Figure 5G, the color gradient, used to presumably show expression level or frequency, does not allow visual discrimination. A different color scale is needed. Some scales go up to 2, others up to 5. What do they indicate?</p><p>19) Subsection “NK Cells downregulate Eomes during <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection”, &quot;the numbers of CD49a<sup>+</sup> and CD49a<sup>+</sup> Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells were significantly reduced in Eomes cKO compared to Eomes f/f controls (Figure 6A,B).&quot; That result is in 6B. Figure 6A is very different, it shows that the frequency of these cells is higher in Eomes cKO. This difference is not explained. In contrast, the experiment with bone marrow chimeras shown in Figure 6D is very clear. Why are changes in the relative cell frequencies so different from changes in cell numbers?</p><p>20) The columns in Figure 7D are not defined. The corresponding legend is dense. It looks like columns may have been grouped as NK-uninf, NK-inf and ILC1. Does each column represent a different mouse?</p><p>21) Subsection “Eomes downregulation within NK cells accompanies extensive transcriptional and epigenomic changes”. &quot;NK cells share many epigenetic features…&quot; Share with whom?</p><p>22) Subsection “Eomes downregulation within NK cells accompanies extensive transcriptional and epigenomic changes”. &quot;Somewhat surprisingly&quot; Since <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection has a large impact on both NK cells and ILC1 cells, why are epigenetic changes common to both populations surprising?</p><p>23) Sequencing analysis shows there are two genes for Ly6C.

Based on the single cell RNA-seq data, these cells (cluster 10) are still closer to NK cells than to ILC1s (Figure 5F and Figure 6—figure supplement 1E) despite their loss in Eomes expression and acquisition of CD49a expression. Thus, one could easily think of them as &quot;Eomes negative NK&quot; or &quot;ex-NK&quot; cells rather than ILC1s, and to simply refer to them as Eomes-CD49a<sup>+</sup> ILC1 cells may be misleading. For this reason, the authors should modify the title of the paper and change their designation throughout the manuscript. We suggest &quot;ILC1-like&quot; as a good descriptor. In addition, although it is clear that the &quot;Eomes negative NK&quot; cells that are generated during T. gondii infection are transcriptionally and epigenetically distinct from the NK cells in the steady state and NK cells after infection (Figure 7 and Figure 8—figure supplement 1), these &quot;Eomes negative NK&quot; cells referred to as &quot;T. gondii-induced ILC1s&quot; were not directly compared with classical ILC1s. Based on the single cell RNA-seq data, these cells may not express many of the ILC1-related signature genes. Therefore, again, the authors need to be cautious in referring to them as ILC1 cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this helpful suggestion. We too had trouble with the best descriptor for these cells and agree that the suggested descriptor is a good one. We have changed the title and the text throughout the paper to now refer to the <italic>T. gondii</italic>-induced cells as “ILC1-like cells,” rather than ILC1s.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A second concern was that the NK 1.1 depletion shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 was performed with a PBS rather than isotope matched immunoglobulin control which is considered unacceptable. The authors should repeat at least once with proper control Ig to make sure this is not issue. It is not necessary to repeat entire survival curve just experiments shown in A and B and initial survival to make sure there is no death in controls vs. antibody treated.</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated the experiments shown in Supplementary Figure 1A-B, comparing the effects of NK1.1-depletion with an isotype control antibody (mouse IgG2a isotype control, clone MAR 18.5). (Note that the original description of PK136 as an IgG2b is incorrect. We and others found that it is an IgG2a, and thus is the right control.) The Materials and methods section and figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A) have been updated, as well as the description of this experiment (Introduction).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Figure 3E-H is focused on the liver, where populations of memory and tissue-resident NK cells reside. Do the authors have data sets for the liver in Figure 3A-C? Do they express Ly6C? Including them in the bar graph of Figure 3C would be useful to identify if the liver trends with the lungs or with the brain (both sites of parasite infection/replication)… or alternatively authors should continue to focus on the lung throughout the entirety of Figure 3.</p></disp-quote><p>Original Figure 3 was a large figure with data from different organs that apparently was difficult to follow. For example, the original panels for Figure 3A-C showed markers on cells from lung and blood, and not liver whereas the remaining panels showed other organs. By taking the suggestion of the reviewer, we have thus divided original Figure 3 into two separate figures. New Figure 3 now discusses the lung and blood, while new Figure 3—figure supplement 1 shows other organs. New Figure 4 now focuses on the liver specifically. All other figures have been renumbered to account for this additional figure. Where cited in the rebuttal below, we refer to the new figure numbers, unless otherwise noted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The conclusion of Figure 3F is that &quot;Eomes expression generally remained the same&quot;. However, for the representative flow plot of liver NK cells, the authors chose the lowest% of Eomes negative, while in the bar graph the rest of the points show that 20-50% of Eomes<sup>+</sup> NK cells became Eomes-ve after transfer and migration to the liver. Please reword statement appropriately as Eomes expression is really not the same when the data are pooled.</p></disp-quote><p>We rephrased to instead stress how the Eomes expression is high in most transferred NK cells as compared to the transferred ILC1s which mostly remained Eomes-negative (subsection “Expansion of ILC1-like cells among circulating cells”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The interesting point of Figure 3G is the upregulation of CD49a on Eomes<sup>+</sup> NK cells post-infection. However, this population is eliminated from the subsequent histograms showing Ly6C expression. It may be of interest to note whether Ly6C expression by Eomes<sup>+</sup>CD49a<sup>+</sup> cells is more similar to ILC1s or NK cells, or occurs at an intermediate level (which would make sense if that population is being seeded from both NK cells and ILC1s).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added Ly6C expression by Eomes<sup>+</sup> CD49a<sup>+</sup> cells to Figure 4D, as well as a bar graph comparing expression of Ly6C by Eomes<sup>+</sup> CD49a<sup>–</sup>, Eomes<sup>+</sup> CD49a<sup>+</sup>, and Eomes<sup>–</sup> CD49a<sup>+</sup> cells (Figure 4G). Indeed, Ly6C is expressed at intermediate levels in the Eomes<sup>+</sup> CD49a<sup>+</sup> population, suggesting that the Eomes<sup>+</sup> CD49a<sup>+</sup> population may be an intermediate. We have added interpretation of the data to the text and updated the figure legends correspondingly (subsection “Expansion of ILC1-like cells among circulating cells”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There are a lot of data represented in Figure 4C-D, without much rationale or interpretation provided in the text suggesting that items may be more appropriate for a supplemental figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added additional discussion of the significance of the markers CD27 and CD11b as maturation markers (subsection “ILC1-like cells are distinct from NK cells and ILC1s”) and moved these figures to a supplemental figure (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The CD45.2/.1 appears to be switched on Figure 6—figure supplement 1A.</p></disp-quote><p>This was indeed the case. It has been fixed (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Although the contour plots don't show outliers, the bottom panel of Figure 3E says 3.66%, but there's nothing in the gate, which is a bit misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>There are actually points visible within the gate (Figure 4B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The% of Eomes cKO during infection is missing in Figure 6D (bottom).</p></disp-quote><p>The percentage has been added to the figure (Figure 7D – 10.3%).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The marker Ly6C figures prominently in most of the paper. What is the significance of its expression and of its induction by T. gondii infection? Please provide background.</p></disp-quote><p>Previously characterized instances of Ly6C expression by NK cells has been added to the text as well as mention that Ly6C is not expressed by ILC1s in steady-state, at the first mention of Ly6C in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) A recurrent problem is insufficient description of Figures. In several cases (e.g. Figure 4, Figure 5A), the source of cells used for analysis is not given in the Figure, the legend or the text. It would help to include the source of cells, e.g liver or spleen, in each of these places.</p></disp-quote><p>The source of cells has been added to the legend and text (Results section and figure legends).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) As suggested above it would strengthen the manuscript if the authors should characterize the Eomes<sup>+</sup>CD49a<sup>+</sup> cells found in the liver after T. gondii infection in a greater detail. Do they also express Ly6C?</p></disp-quote><p>See response to comment 3 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) In Figure 3F, ~30% of &quot;ILC1s&quot; re-express Eomes upon transfer; this should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added discussion of this observation to the text (subsection “Expansion of ILC1-like cells among circulating cells”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Figure 3D, the cell labels appear to be switched. Please check.</p></disp-quote><p>The cell labels were indeed switched and are now correct (Figure 4A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) IL-7Ris an important marker to distinguish NK cells from ILC1s but the cells in cluster 10 do not express IL-7R as shown in Figure 5F. How about IL-2Rb? If possible the dependence of these NK/ILC1 subsets on IL-7 and/or IL-15 should be either tested or discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added discussion of the Il7r expression pattern to the text (subsection “<italic>T. gondii</italic> infection induces heterogeneity of NK cells and ILC1s”). Il2rb was highly expressed by all clusters (for reviewers’ reference see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) and did not distinguish between clusters and thus was not discussed (same expression level was also seen by flow cytometry of CD122).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47605-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Figure 3G is confusing. While there are 3 subsets for the combination of CD49a and Eomes expression (upper flow plots) only 2 are shown on the lower panels for Ly6C expression. What are they? Are the colors supposed to match between the top and low panels? Even so, it is not clearly visible.</p></disp-quote><p>The 3 subsets refer to Eomes<sup>+</sup> CD49a<sup>–</sup> cells, Eomes<sup>+</sup> CD49a<sup>+</sup> cells, and Eomes<sup>–</sup> CD49a<sup>+</sup> cells. The original figure showed Ly6C expression by Eomes<sup>+</sup> CD49a<sup>–</sup> and Eomes<sup>–</sup> CD49a<sup>+</sup> cells only, but has been revised to show Ly6C expression of Eomes<sup>+</sup> CD49a<sup>+</sup> cells, in response to comments 3 and 10 above (Figure 4D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Subsection “Expansion of ILC1s among circulating cells”. &quot;Ly6C was expressed by a higher percentage.&quot; Percentage of what?</p></disp-quote><p>We intended to compare Ly6C expression by ILC1-like cells in the spleen versus the liver. This is now clarified in the text (subsection “Expansion of ILC1-like cells among circulating cells”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) A number of different markers were used to distinguish among cell subsets, as for example in Figure 4. In many cases, no reason is given for the choice of markers. On what basis were they selected? Besides a phenotypic distinction of subsets, do they contribute to an understanding of the function of these different cells? Please clarify in each case.</p></disp-quote><p>Discussion of the significance of the markers KLRG1, DNAM-1, CD11b, and CD27 were added (subsection “ILC1-like cells are distinct from NK cells and ILC1s”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) In Figure 4D, lower panels, p values are indicated for different comparisons between markers. The main comparisons should be between uninfected and infected cells, and between NK and ILC1. For what reason are NK cells from uninfected mice compared to ILC from infected mice for every marker measured?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we primarily intended to compare the ILC1-like cells from infected mice with the NK cells in infected mice, and the ILC1s in uninfected mice. This has now been corrected (Figure 5, Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) Figure 5G, the color gradient, used to presumably show expression level or frequency, does not allow visual discrimination. A different color scale is needed. Some scales go up to 2, others up to 5. What do they indicate?</p></disp-quote><p>The Seurat package in R was used for this analysis and this visualization strategy is widely used to show how gene expression is distributed within tSNE plots. Overall, gray indicates lower gene expression and red represents higher levels of gene expression. The limits of the scale varies for each gene shown as the scale is automatically set to maximize contrast between low and high gene expression for each gene, to optimize visual discrimination. The color actually depicts Log2(UMIs+1) and this label has been added next to the scales (Figure 6G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) Subsection “NK Cells downregulate Eomes during T. gondii infection”, &quot;the numbers of CD49a<sup>+</sup> and CD49a<sup>+</sup> Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells were significantly reduced in Eomes cKO compared to Eomes f/f controls (Figure 6A,B).&quot; That result is in 6B. Figure 6A is very different, it shows that the frequency of these cells is higher in Eomes cKO. This difference is not explained. In contrast, the experiment with bone marrow chimeras shown in Figure 6D is very clear. Why are changes in the relative cell frequencies so different from changes in cell numbers?</p></disp-quote><p>In the figure (Figure 7A), the cells are pregated on CD3<sup>–</sup> CD19<sup>–</sup> NK1.1<sup>+</sup> NKp46<sup>+</sup> cells. As conventional NK cells are absent in Eomes cKO mice, the frequency of NK1.1<sup>+</sup> NKp46<sup>+</sup> cells that are Ly6C<sup>+</sup> CD49a<sup>+</sup> is higher, although the cell number does not change. This has been further clarified in the text (subsection “NK cells downregulate Eomes during <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20) The columns in Figure 7D are not defined. The corresponding legend is dense. It looks like columns may have been grouped as NK-uninf, NK-inf and ILC1. Does each column represent a different mouse?</p></disp-quote><p>The columns are labeled above by color, with each column representing a separate mouse (biological replicates). The labels correspond to the legend shown in Figure 8A, as does the entirety of what is now Figure 8. This was clarified in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>21) Subsection “Eomes downregulation within NK cells accompanies extensive transcriptional and epigenomic changes”. &quot;NK cells share many epigenetic features…&quot; Share with whom?</p></disp-quote><p>We intended to state that NK cells from uninfected mice and NK cells from infected mice share many epigenetic features. This has been clarified (subsection “Eomes downregulation within NK cells accompanies extensive transcriptional and epigenomic changes.”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>22) Subsection “Eomes downregulation within NK cells accompanies extensive transcriptional and epigenomic changes”. &quot;Somewhat surprisingly&quot; Since T. gondii infection has a large impact on both NK cells and ILC1 cells, why are epigenetic changes common to both populations surprising?</p></disp-quote><p>We have deleted “somewhat surprisingly” (subsection “Eomes downregulation within NK cells accompanies extensive transcriptional and epigenomic changes.”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>23) Sequencing analysis shows there are two genes for Ly6C. Does the analysis of phenotypes with anti-Ly6C antibody detect both? What is the significance of having two genes?</p></disp-quote><p>There are two distinct genes that encode Ly6C (Ly6c1 and Ly6c2). Currently there are no antibodies that are able to distinguish between the two, and there are no known differences in regulation or expression pattern of the two genes. The significance of there being two discrete genes is not known.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>24) Subsection “T. gondii infection results in ILC1 expansion.”. A symbol that is neither an &quot;a&quot; nor a Greek letter α appears in &quot;a-NK1.1&quot;. What is it? The context suggests it is an antibody that causes depletion of NK1.1+ cells in mice. If so, it should be described. What does the symbol represent? The symbol appeared again on subsection “T. gondii-induced ILC1s are distinct from NK Cells and ILC1s” in &quot;TNFa&quot;. It should be replaced by the Greek letter α.</p></disp-quote><p>The symbol in “a-NK1.1” was supposed to refer to “anti,” and has been replaced with “anti.” The alpha symbol (α) is now used in TNFα (Introduction, Results section, Discussion section, Materials and methods section and figure legends).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>25) Visually, Figure 8—figure supplement 1C does not convey a clear message. How were the subsets defined? What could be their biological relevance?</p></disp-quote><p>The groups are explained in the text in subsection “Eomes downregulation within NK cells accompanies extensive transcriptional and epigenomic changes”. To clarify their significance, their definitions were reiterated in the figure legend and representative schematics of each group were added as Figure 8—figure supplement 1D, with corresponding changes to the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>26) The two comparisons made from the ATAC-seq analysis in Figure 7G for Eomes and Figure 8—figure supplement 1F for T-bet show small differences. Is there a way to express a statistical significance? The changes do not look convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, there was one peak in the Tbx21 locus that was incorrectly highlighted. This highlighted peak has been unhighlighted (Figure 8—figure supplement 1F). Otherwise, significantly different peaks were identified using the getDiffExpression program in Homer, using a Log2FC cutoff of 1 and FDR cutoff of 0.05. These details were added to the Materials and methods section. For the reviewers’ reference, zoomed in images showing all biological replicates with the adjusted p-values for comparison of NK cells from infected mice versus ILC1-like cells at the Eomes and Tbx21 loci are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47605-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>27) The legend to Figure 8—figure supplement 1E does not adequately explain the Figure. What does the figure show?</p></disp-quote><p>This figure (now Figure 8—figure supplement 1F) incorporates RNA-seq data with ATAC-seq data to correlate gene expression levels to accessibility. For each locus, each differentially accessible peak is symbolized by a point. The position of the bottom point along the y-axis indicates Log2FC of gene expression by RNA-seq, comparing ILC1-like cells with NK cells from infected mice. The shading of each point represents the Log2FC of each peak’s accessibility, again comparing ILC1-like cells with NK cells from infected mice. Details were added to the figure legend to further clarify. This figure is based off of what was shown in “Epigenetic control of innate and adaptive immune memory” by Lau et al., 2018 in their Figure 6B.</p></body></sub-article></article>
