Despite their critical location in our visual system and evidence that they are dynamically gated for dark/light adaptation, the full impact that rod–cone GJs can have on cone function is not known. We recorded the photovoltage of mouse cones and found that the initial level of rod input increased spontaneously after obtaining intracellular access. This process allowed us to explore the underlying coupling capacity to rods, revealing that fully coupled cones acquire a striking rod-like phenotype. Calcium, a candidate mediator of the coupling process, does not appear to be involved on the cone side of the junctional channels. Our findings show that the anatomical substrate is adequate for rod–cone coupling to play an important role in vision and, possibly, in biochemical signaling among photoreceptors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01386.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01386.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01386.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>People can see in a range of light levels—from dim moonlight to bright midday sun—because our eyes contain two types of light-sensitive cells: rods and cones. Rods are more plentiful than cones, and while they are sensitive at low light levels, rods can only provide grey-scale vision. Further, bright light can rapidly ‘dazzle’ the ability of rods to see in near-darkness, and they are slow to recover when this happens. In contrast, cones need bright light to function, but allow us to see in colour.</p><p>The signals received by rods and cones are sent through the optic nerve to the brain, where they are interpreted as vision. However, ‘gap junctions’ that connect the rods and cones allow for electrical and chemical ‘crosstalk’ between these cells, before the signals then travel along the optic nerve. Furthermore, even though it is thought that the connections between rods and cones are regulated in response to light, the body’s daily rhythms and other biochemical signals, their importance for vision is not known.</p><p>Now, Asteriti et al. have taken tissue slices from the retinas at the back of mice eyes, and measured the electrical signals generated when cones are exposed to light. This revealed that the rod-cone coupling is strong enough to make the cones responsive to dim light, just like rods. Moreover, the cones also recovered slowly after being exposed to flashes of bright light. When chemical inhibitors were used to block the gap junctions, the cones stopped behaving like rods and became less sensitive to dim light.</p><p>The findings of Asteriti et al. show that rod-cone coupling is sufficient to play an important role in vision. The next challenge is to find out what this role is, and how it might be affected by different physiological conditions, including stress and injury.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01386.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01386.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>photoreceptor</kwd><kwd>gap junction</kwd><kwd>rod</kwd><kwd>cone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Pisa</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cangiano</surname><given-names>Lorenzo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electrophysiological recordings show that cones in the eyes of mice are able to receive strong input from rods via gap junctions, supporting the view that this route plays an important role in vision.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In darkness, sparse single photon signals are relayed to retinal ganglion cells via a high gain/high convergence pathway formed by rods, rod bipolar cells, amacrine AII cells, and cone bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nelson, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dunn et al., 2006</xref>). However, rod signals can bypass rod bipolar cells and enter directly into the cone pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DeVries and Baylor, 1995</xref>). The earliest opportunity for this crossover is represented by rod–cone gap junctions (GJs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raviola and Gilula, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsukamoto et al., 2001</xref>). GJs are assemblies of channels made by the docking of pairs of connexon hemichannels on adjacent cells, each formed by six connexin subunits. Cones contact nearby photoreceptors mainly at the tips of thin <italic>telodendria</italic>, which emerge from their synaptic pedicles, where they express connexin isoform 36 (Cx36) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O’Brien et al., 2012</xref>), while the isoform expressed by rods has not been conclusively identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feigenspan et al., 2004</xref>). The rod–cone junctional plaques are very small, each containing few connexon channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raviola and Gilula, 1973</xref>), and although rod signals were recorded in cat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nelson, 1977</xref>) and in macaque cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schneeweis and Schnapf, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hornstein et al., 2005</xref>), the extent to which rod–cone coupling contributes to mammalian vision remains unclear. On the one hand, psychophysical and electroretinographic (ERG) experiments, in humans, detected putative correlates of rod–cone coupling (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sharpe and Stockman, 1999</xref>), and ganglion cell and ERG recordings, in mice lacking Cx36, supported the view that rod–cone coupling is relevant for dim light vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deans et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Volgyi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abd-El-Barr et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Seeliger et al., 2011</xref>); on the other hand, alternative mechanisms could explain the human data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sharpe and Stockman, 1999</xref>), and recordings in cone bipolar cells in Cx36 knockout mice suggested that rod–cone coupling plays a marginal role in rod signal flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pang et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2012</xref>).</p><p>Highly relevant to this debate is the fact that rod–cone GJs appear to be dynamically regulated: measurements of the extent of tracer diffusion in the outer rodent retina from the surface of a cut made with a razor blade (a technique referred to as ‘cut-loading’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ribelayga et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ribelayga and Mangel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2013</xref>), and ERG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heikkinen et al., 2011</xref>) suggest that endogenous neuromodulators, light, and circadian clocks influence the level of coupling (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schneeweis and Schnapf, 1999</xref>) similarly to other retinal GJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lasater and Dowling, 1985</xref>). However, cut-loading cannot discriminate between rod–rod, rod–cone and cone–cone GJs, and it does not provide information on the absolute strength of coupling, but only on its relative changes. Therefore, the possibility that the impact of coupling on vision is strongly context-dependent raises three pressing questions: (<italic>i</italic>) what is the maximum level of rod–cone coupling? (<italic>ii</italic>) how strongly are cones influenced by rod input under these conditions? (<italic>iii</italic>) what is the level of coupling under different physiological states? Here we investigated the first two of these questions in mouse, a mainstay of current retina research and one in which direct proof of rod input in cones is still lacking. This important gap in our knowledge is explained by the fact that mouse cones were only recently shown to be accessible for patch clamp recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cangiano et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cangiano et al.

As expected, the first dim G flash evoked a large response, the bright<sub>a</sub> G flash evoked a saturating response consisting of a fast peak and plateau (for an analysis of the currents involved, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Della Santina et al., 2012</xref>), and dim G flash sensitivity recovered slowly after the saturating flash. Rod responses run down in kinetics during patch recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cangiano et al., 2012</xref>), a process that also alters their time course of recovery from saturating flashes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A1</xref>, cf. black and gray records). Thus, the kinetics protocol was also delivered in a number of rods recorded in loose seal mode, as with this technique, light response kinetics can be stable for several hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A2</xref>). The time course of the response to the kinetics protocol of rods in the initial minutes of patch recordings (n = 19, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A1</xref>, black records, taken before a significant amount of rundown occurred) was similar to that in loose seal recordings (n = 17), as shown in a graph of the normalized dim flash response amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In cones, the kinetics protocol evoked a spectrum of response types depending on the cone and on the time from seal (see below). Some cones responded only to the bright<sub>a</sub> G flash (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, top), the expected behavior for uncoupled cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

This similarity in the time course of recovery after the bright flash emerges from comparing graphs of normalized dim flash response amplitudes during the kinetics protocol in rods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, n = 11).

The net change in their response to the kinetics protocol was a scaled version of the typical rod response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The rapid time course of this process implied that it began with the recording itself. It did not depend on the repeated exposure of the photoreceptor to light, since it occurred also when single deliveries of the kinetics protocol were separated by several minutes of uninterrupted darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). A response amplitude vs flash strength graph, obtained in two time ranges in the same cone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), highlights how cones acquired light sensitivity at intensities normally covered by rods. Note that collecting each full flash response curve of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> required ∼10 min, a time comparable to the time course of the spontaneous increase; therefore, different flash strengths were unavoidably delivered at different levels of progress of the phenomenon. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows, in simplified form, the evolution of dim G flash response amplitude in 50 cones. Its rate of increase varied greatly among cones. When possible we estimated the dim G flash response amplitude prior to patching, by extrapolating to time zero the values observed in the first minutes of recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, short red horizontal bars). Based on these estimates, it appears that most cones responded to dim G flashes already before patching, although response amplitudes were generally modest when compared to those expressed during the recordings. If the dim flash sensitivity of cones is due to rod input, then these observations imply that rod–cone junctional conductance is not hardwired, but it is modifiable in a wide range.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01386.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Cones shift toward a rod-like phenotype during recording.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Response of a cone to the kinetics protocol delivered at 1, 6, 12 and 17 min after obtaining the seal (records are not averages; V<sub>dark</sub> ≈ −44 mV).

We chose instead a more limited approach of delivering the spectral protocol in cones sensitive to dim flashes, while they are depolarized well beyond the reversal potential of their photoresponse. This was done both in current clamp (CC) and voltage clamp (VC). In CC, we imposed V<sub>Cone(DARK)</sub> &gt; E<sub>OS</sub> by constant current injection. In all five cones tested, we observed that the bright<sub>b</sub> flash responses reversed in polarity (i.e., depolarizing) and actually became larger than in control conditions. In contrast, four of these cones had their dim flash responses reduced in amplitude to the point of being no longer distinguishable from noise, while the remaining one retained a small hyperpolarizing response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). This result suggests that in these conditions, V<sub>Rod(DARK)</sub> was slightly below or anyway near E<sub>OS</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, middle and bottom rows). In VC, the photocurrent responses of a cone to the spectral protocol were recorded at holding potentials (V<sub>Cone(HOLD)</sub>) of −40 mV and +60 mV. At the depolarized potential, bright flash photoresponses were reversed and of much larger amplitude, while the dim flash responses became undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). This suggests that also in this case (VC recording) V<sub>Rod(DARK)</sub> was close to E<sub>OS</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, middle row). Again, it is possible that the absence of dim flash responses was partly due to a voltage-dependent reduction of the junctional conductance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Blocking GJs reverts cones to their intrinsic phenotype</title><p>As a further confirmation of the results obtained thus far, we tested the specific GJ blocker meclofenamic acid (MFA), previously known to be effective at GJs containing Cx36 in AII amacrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Veruki and Hartveit, 2009</xref>).

To shed light on the nature of this interaction, we examined whether the mechanism underlying the coupling process in photoreceptors is related to phenomenologically similar ones found in other systems expressing Cx36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zoidl et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Del Corsso et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Veruki et al., 2008</xref>). Two possible drivers of the spontaneous coupling increase emerging from these studies were (<italic>i</italic>) dialysis of the cell by the pipette, and (<italic>ii</italic>) an increase in intracellular calcium, both occurring as a consequence of <italic>whole cell</italic> recordings (‘Discussion’). However, the fact that we observed this phenomenon in perforated patch clamp recordings, a technique known to cause minimal disturbance to the intracellular environment, makes it unlikely that in mouse cones, it is caused by pipette-cell dialysis (we could exclude an unintended rupture of the patch membrane, since the amphotericin-B present in our pipette solution would have perforated the cell membrane, depolarizing it close to 0 mV and shunting the photovoltages—effects that we indeed observed when going whole cell at the end of recordings to stain the neurons with Lucifer Yellow, LY). Nonetheless, we examined the remote possibility that amphotericin-B (nominally 400 µM) formed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Romero et al., 2009</xref>) and that the diffusion of calcium ions from the pipette into the cone led to an opening of GJs (Ca<sup>2+</sup> traces are normally present in the high purity water used for intracellular solutions). In four of five cones recorded with 1 mM EGTA in the pipette (<italic>EGTA zero Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>perforated patch</italic> solution), we observed the same progressive increase in coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, blue lines).</p><p>These results effectively rule out an involvement of pipette Ca<sup>2+</sup> but leave open the possibility that an increase in free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in the cone, promoted by the pipette, drives the coupling process. We thus performed whole cell recordings (i.e., without amphotericin-B) with the goal of dialyzing cones with a low Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffered solution. Seals were made on cone pedicles (as confirmed by LY staining, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11E</xref>) to ensure a rapid and effective ‘Ca<sup>2+</sup> clamp’ on the cone side of the junctional contacts (located on short telodendria that protrude from the pedicles; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsukamoto et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O’Brien et al., 2012</xref>). This represented an important step, given what is known about the active compartmentalization of free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wei et al., 2012</xref>). We recorded from three cones with an <italic>EGTA low Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>whole cell</italic> solution (50 nM free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>; see ‘Materials and methods’), of which only one had weak coupling to rods upon breaking the patch. In two of the three cones, rod coupling increased rapidly in the first minutes of recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>), while in the third cone, coupling did not develop despite a stable recording for more than 1 hr (not shown). Further, we recorded from three cones with a <italic>BAPTA low Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>whole cell</italic> solution (50 nM free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) to rule out an involvement of fast and localized calcium transients. While all three cones were initially uncoupled, they rapidly increased their coupling to rods up to moderate levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). Since in all these experiments free calcium in the pedicle was buffered at very low levels compared to those normally present in darkness (∼2 µM spatially averaged: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Szikra and Krizaj, 2006</xref>), we conclude that high calcium (on the side of the cone) is not required for the expression of the progressive increase in coupling.

The possibility that what we interpret as rod input could instead represent a change in cone phototransduction can be rejected, as it is contradicted by our findings that: (<italic>i</italic>) the GJ blocker MFA abolished rod-like responses in cones, (<italic>ii</italic>) dim and bright flash responses have different reversal potentials, (<italic>iii</italic>) in many cones, dim and bright flash responses (delivered after a rod-saturating pre-flash) display opposite spectral preferences. Moreover, in preliminary recordings from the cones of mice lacking Cx36, we did not observe rod-like features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asteriti et al., 2013</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cone opsin expression gradients and rod–cone coupling</title><p>Except for a small number of pure S-cones (i.e. <italic>blue</italic> cones), most mouse cones reportedly express both S and M opsins, with their expression ratio varying along the dorsoventral axis of the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Applebury et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haverkamp et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Daniele et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, any pure M-cones would respond to UV light since M-opsin has a prominent secondary absorption peak in the near UV region (the β-band; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Govardovskii et al., 2000</xref>). It was thus not surprising that almost all of our recorded cones were intrinsically sensitive to both G and UV light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, cf. with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Our dissection and recording techniques did not allow us to identify their dorsoventral position in the retina, so that we could not directly examine possible correlations between their location and the level of maximal coupling. We could however conclude that both S-dominant cones (known to be mid and ventrally located) and M-dominant cones (dorsally located) are able to couple strongly to rods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). As for pure S-cones, our small recorded sample is in no way sufficient to conclude that they have a reduced propensity to couple to rods, since we found uncoupled cones also within the S/M group. Interestingly, there is some evidence in macaque that blue cones form fewer junctional contacts with rods compared to other cone types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O’Brien et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>It is important to note that the G/UV ratios obtained in our sample of cones after rod-saturating pre-flashes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) <italic>do not</italic> provide a completely unbiased representation of the relative sensitivity to G over UV light within the native cone population. First, while we recorded from both central and peripheral retina, it is unlikely that we obtained a uniform sampling at all eccentricities; this, combined with the dorsoventral gradients in S- and M-opsin expression (see references above), will distort the observed distribution. Second, any differences in size or accessibility among cones would have affected their odds of being recorded (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cangiano et al. (2012)</xref> for rod vs cone recording bias). Third, compared to the classical approach of estimating cone spectral preference by adjusting the strengths of flashes of different wavelengths to match their response amplitudes, our use of the ratio of the peak response amplitude to moderately bright G and UV flashes of equal strength (our G/UV ratios) shifts values somewhat toward unity as cone saturation is approached (we chose this approach because it was quick and avoided exposing rods to very bright light). Fourth, there could be a contribution of other cones coupled to the recorded cone, which would shift the measured G/UV ratio in one or the other direction depending on their relative expression of S- and M-opsins. Finally, we cannot exclude that in some experiments, coupled rods may have retained a small response to the bright flash following the saturating pre-flash, again shifting the G/UV ratio. These last two factors could explain the shifts in G/UV ratio observed in some cones during spontaneous coupling increase and superfusion with MFA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>), as well as in the ‘reversal’ experiment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Functional range of rod–cone coupling and its relationship to the anatomical substrate</title><p>GJs are often documented only anatomically, leaving open the question of their functional impact on neurons. Moreover, since they can be actively regulated, knowledge of their full coupling potential is essential. Our finding that the amplitude of rod signals in cones may attain a significant fraction of their source amplitude is a measure of the importance that rod–cone GJs can have in visual processing by the cone pathway. Is such a strong level of coupling compatible with what is known about rod–cone GJs?</p><p>Each cone in mouse forms junctional contacts with an average of 32 rods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsukamoto et al., 2001</xref>). To our knowledge, the only measurement in mammals of the transjunctional conductance was made in rod–cone pairs of the cone-dominated ground squirrel retina (legend of supplementary Figure 6 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2010</xref>). Assuming that their average value of 121 pS for coupled pairs (corresponding to ∼20 open homotypic Cx36 channels; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moreno et al., 2005</xref>) was also representative of the mouse, multiplying it by a rod–cone convergence of 32 gives a summed junctional conductance of ∼3900 pS. This would imply that a 4 mV hyperpolarization in rods relative to a maximally coupled cone would be sufficient to draw from it an overall junctional current of ∼16 pA—a very large value as it is comparable to estimates of the circulating current in mouse cones in darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nikonov et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, our data are compatible with the limited available evidence. Moreover, our results bear direct relevance to other mammals, including primates: in the <italic>area centralis</italic> of the cat retina, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith et al.

We confirmed this in mouse, observing however a much less dramatic effect: in patched cones, the time to peak (TTP) of dim flash responses was 197 ms (SD 35, n = 24), significantly shorter (p&lt;0.0001) than the 258 ms (SD 25, n = 23) of rods recorded in loose seal (rod and cone data were from both the kinetics protocol and the spectral protocol at 24°C) (note that the TTP of dim flash responses in patched rods was 288 ms (SD 51, n = 24), moderately but significantly longer (p=0.02) than that of rods recorded in loose seal; since rods recorded in loose seal did not display a kinetics rundown, their TTP values were assumed to be representative of the unperturbed state of rods in our preparation). The considerable discrepancy between the magnitude of the speedup in macaque and mouse could be explained if macaque rods underwent a rundown of kinetics during recordings (as it occurs in mouse), without this being noticed.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Mechanisms of the spontaneous increase in coupling</title><p>As mentioned in the ‘Results’, a progressive increase in junctional coupling as a specific consequence of patch recording was observed in other studies targeting Cx36-expressing neurons, including heterologous expression systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zoidl et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Del Corsso et al., 2012</xref>) and rat retinal amacrine AII cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Veruki et al., 2008</xref>). Veruki et al., recording in whole cell mode, found that high resistance (i.e., fine-tipped) electrodes prevent the coupling increase, suggesting a dialysis process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Del Corsso et al. (2012)</xref> surmised that an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggers the coupling increase during whole cell recordings in neuroblastoma cells in vitro. Moreover, they reported that the coupling increase did not occur when recording in perforated patch clamp mode with amphotericin-B, again implicating pipette-cell dialysis.</p><p>However, here we reach a different conclusion from that of the studies cited above. First, in cones, this phenomenon is not dependent on diffusion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> between the cell and the pipette, as the spontaneous increase in coupling was expressed in perforated patch recordings, even in combination with EGTA in the pipette solution. This, therefore, excludes the possibility of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through hypothetical Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable pores formed by amphotericin-B in the patch membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Romero et al., 2009</xref>; see also ‘Results’). Second, our recordings in whole cell patch clamp with buffered pipette Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, made in close proximity to the GJs, strongly suggest that changes in free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in cones are not responsible for the expression of this phenomenon. Moreover, since the progressive increase in coupling was observed both when preserving the intracellular environment of the cone (perforated patch recordings) and when intentionally dialyzing it (whole cell recordings), a general tentative conclusion may be advanced: diffusible messenger molecules in cones are not necessarily involved in the process. Thus, any diffusible messengers (including Ca<sup>2+</sup>) could be located in the rods surrounding the recorded cone and act on the connexon hemichannels on the rod side.</p><p>Evidence for a primary trigger mechanism can be found in a previous study on macaque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hornstein et al., 2005</xref>), which reported that Neurobiotin injected in cones at the end of perforated patch recordings diffused preferentially to rods located under the recording pipette, leading them to suggest that ‘the electrode might alter the coupling efficiency of the rod–cone junctions by mechanical disturbance’. This observation implies that their cones also expressed a progressive increase in coupling, a process whose electrophysiological counterpart must have gone unnoticed. In this scenario, and taking into account the arguments given above, coupling would be promoted by stretch/deformation of the rods adjacent to the recorded cone. This could explain the large variability in the rate of increase and maximum level of coupling that we observed in our recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), since the angle of entry and depth of the pipette in the tissue varies from experiment to experiment, likely changing its mechanical interaction with neighboring rods.</p><p>With regard to the downstream pathways, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Del Corsso et al. (2012)</xref> found in their heterologous expression system a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated enhancement in the activity of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), which would lead to phosphorylation of Cx36 and increased channel conductance. Interestingly, CaMKII was recently found to participate in the physiological regulation of Cx36 in AII amacrines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kothmann et al., 2012</xref>), raising the possibility that this kinase may play a role also in photoreceptors, on the rod side of rod–cone GJs (see above).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Candidate routes for the in vivo recruitment of rod–cone coupling</title><p>At the start of the recordings, we found most cones modestly coupled to rods relative to their full coupling potential, although we observed strong initial coupling in a limited sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). A key question that needs to be addressed is when the retina exploits the strong coupling potential detected in this study. Candidate regulators of rod–cone GJs in mammals are (references in the ‘Introduction’): (<italic>i</italic>) the circadian synthesis and release of the endogenous retinal neuromodulators, melatonin, dopamine, and adenosine, whereby coupling would be stronger at night when melatonin levels are high; most mouse strains, including the C57BL/6 used here, have deficits in melatonin synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roseboom et al., 1998</xref>) and are thus inadequate to investigate circadian processes; it is therefore possible that the low level of coupling that we estimated for our unperturbed cones may be related to this deficit and that full blown coupling, of the strength emerging during our recordings, is recruited in melatonin-competent mouse strains at night; (<italic>ii</italic>) acute light exposure, acting on the same neuromodulators and possibly also locally in the photoreceptors, which would inhibit coupling.</p><p>Unfortunately, unresolved discrepancies persist in the literature, a major one being the lack of effect of light and dopamine on rod–cone coupling studied with patch clamp in macaque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schneeweis and Schnapf, 1999</xref>). Similar discrepancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hartveit and Veruki, 2012</xref>) exist for the GJs between AII amacrines, also containing Cx36 and thought of being modulated in a circadian and light-dependent fashion. While a common explanation for these conflicting pieces of evidence may eventually be found, our demonstration that rod–cone coupling can be upregulated so as to have a major impact on cones provides an important framework in which to place circadian/light-dependent modulation of these GJs in mouse. In fact, (<italic>i</italic>) let’s suppose that the level attained in our experiments by the fully developed coupling process had been quite smaller than what we actually observed; then this would have raised serious doubts about the physiological importance of circadian/light-dependent modulation of rod–cone coupling for mouse visual processing; (<italic>ii</italic>) given however our demonstrated high level of coupling, should a future direct examination of the role of circadian rhythmicity find that only a small fraction of this coupling potential is utilized, one might then well suspect that yet unidentified physiological factors play a greater role in recruiting rod–cone GJs, or, alternatively, that these may have an important part in response to stress and injury. One should recollect that GJs play a dual role, for example, conduits of electrical signals and of intracellular molecules. Cx36, in particular, is critically involved in neuronal responses to injury and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belousov and Fontes, 2013</xref>). Currently, only a few studies have investigated this in the retina, with both positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Striedinger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paschon et al., 2012</xref>) and negative results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kranz et al., 2013</xref>) depending on the specific models tested.</p><p>The existence of a large degree of GJ-mediated anatomical convergence from rods to cones is not peculiar of the mouse, since it has been found in other rod-dominated mammalian retinas including the peripheral retina of macaque.

Flash duration was in the range of 1–10 ms. Unless specified in the protocol, consecutive bright flashes were delivered at intervals of 12 s or more between each other. The photon flux density reaching the photoreceptors was derived from the measured power density and was likely to be overestimated to varying degrees across recorded cells due to reflection at the air–water interface and absorption by the surrounding tissue, including retinal pigment epithelium.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>This is a very nice paper describing gap junctional coupling between mammalian rods and cones. A good deal of indirect evidence, and a few direct experiments, supports a picture in which rod signals can traverse the retina through a primary (rod bipolar) pathway and a secondary (rod–cone gap coupling) pathway. The present paper provides to date the most detailed and complete characterization of the cone signals inherited from rods via gap junctions. Building on work presented in the authors' previous paper presenting the first whole-cell recordings from mouse cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cangiano et al., 2012</xref>), it makes a compelling case that the gap-junctional pathway for rod signals through cones exists in mouse, and characterizes a number of aspects of the pathway.</p><p>The paper presents patch-clamp recordings with the perforated-patch technique from cones in slices of mouse retina. The experiments seem ably done. The authors make the interesting observation that rod input into cones can be modest at the beginning of the recording but can become large as the recording proceeds, presumably as the result of some change in the physiology of the photoreceptors or retina. Although the paper leaves open the reason for the large change in gap-junctional conductance, the simple demonstration of large rod input into cones – regardless of the conditions of the recording – provides compelling evidence that junctions between rods and cones in mouse are capable of transferring large voltage signals.</p><p>Overall, the work is carefully executed with statistical sampling and analyses that support the primary conclusions. In general the conclusions drawn are well supported. This paper is likely to interest many investigators in photoreceptor and retinal research. The reviewers think that it will be a strong addition to <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>A few specific areas that could use attention follow.</p><p>1) One major problem arises from the fact that the mouse cone S- and M-opsins are expressed in dorso-ventral counter gradients, and co-expressed in most cones, and the authors have not made their recording from well identified regions of the retina. From the limitations of their dissection methodology, it follows that any general inferences to be drawn about the relative sensitivity of cones to excitation of S- and M-opsins are not very informative, and in some cases misleading. The authors do state that they took tissue samples “randomly” from different regions of the retina, but it seems that this really mean that they just didn't pay any attention to the region of the retina from which their tissue samples were taken. But even if they could argue that the tissue samples were truly randomly sampled from all retinal areas, they would need to provide a much clearer analysis (e.g., based on the S/M opsin gradients in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Applebury et al., 2000</xref>; Yang et al., 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Daniele et al., 2011</xref>) of the predictions of the S/M sensitivity of cones for their sampling method.</p><p>Minimally, what the authors must do is be completely up-front about the problems of the dorso-ventral gradients of cone opsin expression, and address how this might have affected their results and conclusions. This problem does not impact the major conclusions of the paper about rod signaling through cones, but rather mainly leads to issues and discussion irrelevant to the main point of the paper.</p><p>The authors should consider deleting the last three sections of Results. The “Mixed S/M” section is inappropriate to the Results; it might be incorporated into the Discussion if the authors could shorten it significantly. As written, however, this section is diffuse and leads to no clear conclusion. The section “Rod signals” is again inappropriate to the Results section but could perhaps be incorporated into the Discussion.</p><p>2) A second major issue concerns the modeling of the “resistive” network of the cones and rods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; Methods). The model is superficial, in part because too many of the conductances required for generating a proper model are unknown, and in part because it neglects a number of important and well established electrophysiological features of rods and cones, including hyperpolarization-activated conductance (Ih currents, HCN channels) and the voltage dependence of the cone cGMP-activated conductance (treated as not voltage-dependent). This section in the Results (including the model and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) should simply be deleted. It is premature for the authors to make a model of rod/cone conductance when there remain so many uncertainties, including the reason for the large variability from one cone to the next and the change in the properties of the junctional conductance with time of recording.

From the limitations of their dissection methodology, it follows that any general inferences to be drawn about the relative sensitivity of cones to excitation of S- and M-opsins are not very informative, and in some cases misleading. The authors do state that they took tissue samples “randomly” from different regions of the retina, but it seems that this really mean that they just didn't pay any attention to the region of the retina from which their tissue samples were taken. But even if they could argue that the tissue samples were truly randomly sampled from all retinal areas, they would need to provide a much clearer analysis (e.g., based on the S/M opsin gradients in</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2"><italic>Applebury et al., 2000</italic></xref><italic>; Yang et al., 2011;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8"><italic>Daniele et al., 2011</italic></xref><italic>) of the predictions of the S/M sensitivity of cones for their sampling method</italic>.</p><p><italic>Minimally, what the authors must do is be completely up-front about the problems of the dorso-ventral gradients of cone opsin expression, and address how this might have affected their results and conclusions. This problem does not impact the major conclusions of the paper about rod signaling through cones, but rather mainly leads to issues and discussion irrelevant to the main point of the paper</italic>.</p><p>We have introduced a new section in the Discussion titled “Cone opsin expression gradients and rod-cone coupling”, which explicitly discusses the limitations of our dissection and recording techniques in the context of the S- and M-opsin expression gradients. We have also revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> to account for the quantitative models of opsin expression gradients in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Daniele et al.

The “Mixed S/M” section is inappropriate to the Results; it might be incorporated into the Discussion if the authors could shorten it significantly.

The model is superficial, in part because too many of the conductances required for generating a proper model are unknown, and in part because it neglects a number of important and well established electrophysiological features of rods and cones, including hyperpolarization-activated conductance (Ih currents, HCN channels) and the voltage dependence of the cone cGMP-activated conductance (treated as not voltage-dependent). This section in the Results (including the model and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8</italic></xref><italic>) should simply be deleted. It is premature for the authors to make a model of rod/cone conductance when there remain so many uncertainties, including the reason for the large variability from one cone to the next and the change in the properties of the junctional conductance with time of recording. The model should be introduced in a future publication, once the nature of rod/cone coupling in mouse is better understood and more clearly quantified</italic>.</p><p>We have removed from the Results the section titled “The summed junctional conductances to rods can exceed the cone’s light-sensitive conductance”, as well as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and the corresponding section in the Materials and methods.</p><p><italic>3) The cause of the gradual shift of cones' signaling rod-like responses is not resolved in the paper.

We have approached this question by obtaining whole cell patch clamp recordings from cone synaptic terminals, to dialyze cones in the immediate proximity of their GJs to rods, using low (∼50 nM free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>; n=6) or high calcium buffered intracellular solutions (approx. 5 µM free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>; n=6). Our findings are presented in a new section of the Results and in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>. In summary, we have found that the process of coupling increase is expressed even when free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in the pedicle is clamped to low levels, both with EGTA and BAPTA. Conversely, high calcium levels did not appear to favor coupling compared to the low calcium condition or to perforated patch recordings.</p><p>Our conclusions, stated in a revised Abstract and Discussion, are that calcium changes on the cone side of the GJs appear not to be responsible for the progressive increase in coupling. Moreover, since this phenomenon was expressed both in perforated patch and whole cell recordings, two techniques at opposite extremes in terms of their impact on the intracellular milieu of the cone, we suggest that any diffusible messenger involved in the process would likely be located in the neighboring rods.</p></body></sub-article></article>
