Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), ATM- and Rad3-related protein (ATR) and DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) are three drivers of DDR which belong to the family of phosphoinositide 3-kinase like kinases (PIKKs). PIKKs respond to the DNA damage by activating their downstream substrates leading to cell cycle delay/arrest and DNA repair and depending on the extent of damage can also lead to apoptosis. ATM is activated through autophosphorylation of S1981 residue and is subsequently recruited to the double strand breaks (DSBs) through a sensor complex, MRN (MRE11, NBS1 and Rad50) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee and Paull, 2005</xref>). DSBs are also the site of recruitment and activation of DNA-PKcs, facilitated by a DSB-bound heterodimer Ku70-80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gottlieb and Jackson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spagnolo et al., 2006</xref>). ATR-ATRIP complex is recruited in response to RPA-coated ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ball et al., 2005</xref>). Even though all the three kinases coordinate their functions independently, crosstalk among these kinases is known to exist, such as ATM-dependent activation of ATR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shiotani and Zou, 2009</xref>); ATM and ATR-dependent phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirokawa et al., 1992</xref>) and DNA-PKcs-mediated modulation of ATM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Peng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, these kinases also share substrates such as p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Canman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lakin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lees-Miller et al., 1990</xref>). Phosphorylation of H2AX at the serine 139 (termed γH2AX), at the chromatin regions flanking the damage site is considered as a marker for DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burma et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rogakou et al., 1998</xref>). While phosphorylation of H2AX is predominantly modulated by ATM, ATR and DNA-PKcs also contribute either partially or entirely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burma et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Royo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). Phosphorylation of H2AX acts as the foundation for recruitment of other DDR mediator proteins eventually leading to DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ciccia and Elledge, 2010</xref>). Thus, DDR is an indispensable mechanism that restores the genomic integrity and regulates the cellular response by modulating DNA repair, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, or senescence in response to DSBs in the cell. Thus, DDR is also a preferred target of pathogenic bacteria.</p><p>Pathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> are capable of imparting notable DNA damage to the host and subsequently impair the DDR to avoid premature cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cuevas-Ramos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Toller et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> triggers DSBs in the host, and γH2AX induction but simultaneously it impairs the DDR by inhibiting the recruitment of 53BP1, ensuing inadequate signal amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chumduri et al., 2013</xref>). Listeriolysin O (LLO) secreted by <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> induces degradation of crucial DNA damage sensor, MRE11. This results in impaired DDR, curtailing the host ability to halt cell cycle, thus successfully promoting multiplication and survival of the pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Samba-Louaka et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>H. pylori</italic> impedes nucleotide repair by downregulating the proteins and their respective transcripts that are involved in mismatch and base excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Machado et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>, <italic>H. pylori</italic> and <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> also downregulate p53 levels to promote host cell survival and inhibit apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wei et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vielfort et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Since ancient times <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) has been steadily evolving sophisticated tactics to dodge the defense responses of the host. One of the remarkable survival strategies of <italic>Mtb</italic> is to intervene with the fundamental signaling events of the host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koul et al., 2004</xref>) and to facilitate these manipulations <italic>Mtb</italic> secretes an enormous number of characterized and uncharacterized effectors inside the host. These effectors modulate host cellular processes such as phagosome maturation, apoptosis, autophagy, calcium homeostasis, activation of pro-inflammatory responses and TLR, TNFα, MAPK signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dey and Bishai, 2014</xref>). However, till date, the role of ATM kinase in the survival of <italic>Mtb</italic> inside the host has not been investigated.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that <italic>Mtb</italic> causes DSBs and determine its impact on the activation of host DDR. SecA2 secretome is necessary and sufficient for inflicting DSBs in the host. We show that instead of classical ATM-Chk2 pathway, <italic>Mtb</italic> gains survival advantage through activation of ATM-Akt signaling cascade that results in the inhibition of apoptosis. In a chronic mice infection model, <italic>Mtb</italic> infected lungs showed significant DSBs and activation of ATM. Combining ATM inhibitor, KU55933 with INH resulted in better clearance of <italic>Mtb</italic> compared with INH treatment alone in the lungs and spleen of infected mice. This study reveals novel exploitation mechanism utilized by <italic>Mtb</italic>, wherein the pathogen inflicts persistent DSBs in the host to activate ATM-Akt signaling pathway and thereby inhibiting apoptosis and accentuating cell growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mtb inflicts DNA damage in the host cell</title><p>To address the question of whether <italic>Mtb</italic> infection leads to the damage of the host DNA we used PMA differentiated THP-1, RAW264.7 (RAW) macrophages and primary murine peritoneal macrophages (PΦ). The cells were infected with the virulent <italic>Mtb</italic> strain, <italic>H37Rv (Rv)</italic> and the γH2AX levels, the hallmark of DNA damage, was evaluated. Results showed considerable DNA damage in the infected cells compared to the corresponding uninfected control and these observations were consistent across all the three cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–c</xref>). The damage could be observed as early as 1 hr post infection (p.i) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) and persisted even at 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We assessed if the observed DNA damage is dependent on the presence of live bacteria by infecting cells with live or heat killed <italic>Rv.</italic> Results showed that (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) only the live bacilli could cause damage to the host genome. To evaluate the role of <italic>Mtb</italic> virulence in inflicting genotoxicity, we performed infection experiments with <italic>Rv</italic> or its avirulent counterpart <italic>H37Ra</italic> (<italic>Ra</italic>). Based on its characteristics such as reduced survival under anaerobic conditions, inability to produce persistent infection in mice and guinea pigs, <italic>Ra</italic> is considered as attenuated, avirulent strain of <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alsaadi and Smith, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">North and Izzo, 1993</xref>). While both <italic>Ra</italic> and <italic>Rv</italic> infected THP1 cells showed considerably higher γH2AX levels compared with the uninfected control, there was consistent and noticeably higher levels of γH2AX levels in <italic>Rv</italic> compared with the <italic>Ra</italic> infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>; compare 4, 24 and 48 hr time points). However, in case of RAW cells the higher γH2AX levels in <italic>Rv</italic> was apparent only in the early time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f and g</xref>: up to 4 hr). Subsequent to DNA damage, H2AX gets phosphorylated on the chromatin flanking the site of damage, which appears as foci in the nucleus. We performed immunofluorescence experiments using antibodies specific for γH2AX and observed significantly higher numbers of γH2AX foci at both 4 and 24 hr p.i (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>) compared with the uninfected controls. Consistent results were observed in infected THP1 and PΦ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>).

Depending on the type of damage, - DSBs or single-stranded DNA (ssDNA; due to replication fork stalling) either ATM-Chk2 or ATR-Chk1 pathways, respectively, are activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee and Paull, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zou and Elledge, 2003</xref>). To determine the type of DDR involved in <italic>Ra</italic> and <italic>Rv</italic> inflicted damage, lysates prepared at 4 and 24 hr p.i were examined for the phosphorylated forms of ATM, Chk2, ATR and Chk1, indicative of their activation. Infection by <italic>Ra</italic> led to the formation of distinct nuclear pRPA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) and RPA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>) foci and robust activation of ATR-Chk1 pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>; right panel), suggesting that <italic>Ra</italic> induces generation of ssDNA.

These results were corroborated by immunofluorescence experiments, wherein we observed distinct pATM foci upon <italic>Rv</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>).

Host cell in response to the occurrence of DSBs activate ATM kinase and is recruited at the site of damage by the sensor, MRN complex. Activated ATM autophosphorylates itself and phosphorylates H2AX in the chromatin flanking the sites of DNA damage, which becomes the foundation for the recruitment of mediator protein MDC1, thus amplifying DDR. pATM promote recruitment of 53BP1 at the damage site. pATM as a part of DDR also activates downstream effectors, Chk2 and p53, which are responsible for alterations in the host cell cycle. pATM in a parallel pathway also activates Akt, which is known inhibit apoptosis and promote cell survival. Activation of ATM and Akt and subsequent inhibition of apoptosis provides survival advantage to <italic>Rv</italic>. Inhibition of ATM or Akt activation through inhibitors, ATM-I or Akt-I, respectively, promote host cell apoptosis, which impedes the bacilli growth.

Subsequently, tissue lysates prepared from uninfected and <italic>Rv</italic> infected mice lungs were subjected to western blotting to evaluate the expression of molecular markers corresponding to DNA damage and DDR. While the levels of γH2AX, pATM, pChk2, and pAkt was negligible in the uninfected mice lungs, we observed significantly elevated levels of γH2AX, pATM, pChk2 and pAkt in the lungs of <italic>Rv</italic> infected mice, suggesting that <italic>Mtb</italic> infection produces sustained DSBs and Akt mediated proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1b</xref>). In a similar vein, we also observed increased levels of γH2AX in the lysates obtained from spleen of infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>; bottom panels). CFUs in spleen after 56 days of infection suggests dissemination of <italic>Rv</italic> from lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). Collectively the results suggest that pathogenic <italic>Mtb</italic> induces genotoxicity both ex vivo and in vivo resulting in deleterious DSBs in the host genome.</p><p>DSBs activate ATM, which in turn phosphorylates H2AX to mark the damaged site and activates Chk2 and p53 to alter the cell cycle progression. In parallel, it also activates Akt to delay cell death and promote survival of the pathogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). We hypothesized that <italic>Mtb</italic> mediated genotoxicity provides a survival niche through activation of ATM kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>).

To investigate this possibility, PΦ were infected with <italic>Rv</italic> and the infection was allowed to establish for 24 hr. The cells were then treated with either vehicle or INH or ATM-I or INH +ATM-I and the CFUs were enumerated at 24, 48 and 72 hr post treatment.

Notably, treatment of <italic>Rv</italic> infected cells with ATM-I + INH decreased the pathogen survival by ~11 fold.

Mice were aerosolically infected with <italic>Rv</italic> and 15 days p.i mice were treated with vehicle or INH or ATM-I or INH+ATM-I for the next 15 days followed by CFU enumeration in both lungs and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). While treatment with INH alone resulted ~1 log fold reduction in the <italic>Mtb</italic> load, treatment with ATM-I alone did not show any difference.

Is this <italic>Mtb</italic> mediated DNA damage manifested in the mice model of in vivo infection?</p><p>Results show that <italic>Mtb</italic> infection promotes γH2AX upregulation in ex vivo models of murine/human origin and murine primary macrophages. The induction of γH2AX and subsequent formation of foci could also be detected by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–h</xref>). These results are in accordance with earlier studies wherein induction of γH2AX foci and genomic instability was detected through immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization, respectively, in the ex vivo model of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castro-Garza et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mohanty et al., 2016</xref>). While the induction of γH2AX is dependent on the presence of the live bacteria, <italic>Ra</italic> a non-pathogenic counterpart of <italic>Rv</italic> could also induce γH2AX levels, albeit at comparatively slower rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d–g</xref>). In addition to temporal differences, <italic>Ra</italic> and <italic>Rv</italic> appear to inflict distinct types of damages resulting in the activation of ATR and ATM pathways, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The infection with <italic>Rv</italic> results in lingering γH2AX levels even at later time points, suggesting the sustained presence of pathogenic <italic>Mtb</italic> continues to inflict DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). In consonance with this hypothesis, elimination of intracellular <italic>Mtb</italic> drastically reduced γH2AX levels/DNA damage, suggesting <italic>Mtb</italic> may be inducing DNA damage at a faster frequency relative to the host’s ability to repair them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>).</p><p>In response to the DSBs generated upon pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> infection, host activates phosphorylation of Cdc25 through ATM-Chk2 pathway to hamper cell cycle progression. However, at higher MOI, host cell undergoes p53 SUMOylation through SENP1 downregulation to promote senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cougnoux et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> decelerate the host cell cycle by reducing p53 and concurrent elevation of p21 and p27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vielfort et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in addition to impairing host MRE11 also activates DDR in ATM/ATR independent fashion eventually resulting in cell cycle delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leitão et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, it is evident that pathogens utilize diverse and distinct mechanisms to perturb the host cell cycle to avoid untimely death. We observed activation of ATM-Chk2 pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) and subsequent decrease in the cells in G1 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>), an indicator of differed host cell cycle at the early stages of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. However, at the later time points, infected cells showed increased cell death, most likely an effort by the host to curb the transmission of genotoxic effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). Interestingly, cell cycle perturbations were limited to the cells possessing intracellular bacilli but not extended to bystander-uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). Thus, our results demonstrate that <italic>Mtb</italic> mediated DNA damage disturbs the homeostatic coordination among the cellular components participating in cell cycle.</p><p>Toxins like Cytolethal distending toxin (CDT), typhoid toxin and colibactin from pathogenic bacteria are examples of characterized toxins that are reported to block the host cell cycle progression after inducing DNA damage in the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">El-Aouar Filho et al., 2017</xref>). Persistent presence of DSBs and modulation of host cell cycle in cells harboring bacilli, propelled us to examine the role of <italic>Mtb</italic> secretory factors in imparting genotoxicity. The proteins exported from <italic>Mtb</italic> are considered a source of virulence, however not many secreted proteins have been individually characterized. <italic>Mtb</italic> secretes &gt;300 secretory factors with the help of secretory systems such as classical TAT and SecA1; accessory SecA2 and TypeVII. Results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e–h</xref> suggest that SecA2 mediated secretory factors are principally responsible for the DSBs in the host. Mass spectrometry-based study has identified the secretion of 37 proteins, including Mce1, Mce4 family and multiple solute binding lipoproteins to be dependent on the SecA2 pathway. In addition to these, secretion of protein kinase G (PknG), superoxide dismutase (SodA) and phosphatase SapM proteins are also through SecA2 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feltcher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sullivan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zulauf et al., 2018</xref>). As polyketides and lipids from mycobacteria were suggested to be cyclomodulins; therefore, we speculate that one or more lipoproteins secreted through the SecA2 pathway could be critical for genotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cumming et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">George et al., 1998</xref>). Macrophages generate reactive oxidation species as an anti-microbial activity to combat the survival of <italic>Mtb</italic> intracellularly. Mice lacking p47 and <italic>gp91</italic> subunit of NADPH oxidase (gp91<sup>phox-/-</sup>) are susceptible to <italic>Mtb</italic> as the macrophages in these mice fail to generate ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cooper et al., 2000</xref>). While the primary purpose of generated ROS is to clear the intracellular bacilli, it can however damage its own DNA as exemplified in case of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chumduri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yu and Anderson, 1997</xref>). On the contrary, <italic>H. pylori</italic>, <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> mediated DSBs are ROS-independent. SodA<sub>Mtb</sub>, which is secreted through SecA2 pathway plays an important role in detoxification of ROS generated inside the host thus partially neutralizing the anti-microbial property of ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lau et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Piddington et al., 2001</xref>). In <italic>RvΔSecA2</italic> mutant SodA<sub>Mtb</sub> secretion is expected to be compromised and hence one would expect higher levels of host ROS upon infection. The fact that <italic>RvΔSecA2</italic> mutant fails to inflict DSBs suggest that <italic>Mtb</italic> mediated damage is unlikely to be ROS-dependent. In agreement with this, addition of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a scavenger of ROS, to the infected cells did not alter the γH2AX, suggesting that DNA damage is not mediated through ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Our future study would be aimed towards identifying the specific effector(s) and the mechanism of how the effector brings about DSBs in the host.</p><p><italic>Mtb</italic> is known to modulate multiple host signaling pathways to establish favorable environment in the host for its survival. Thus, we investigated the role of <italic>Mtb</italic> induced host DNA damage and subsequent activation of ATM-Chk2 pathway in facilitating and enhancing its survival. While presence of ATM inhibitor significantly compromised the <italic>Mtb</italic> survival, addition of inhibitor for one of the downstream effectors, Chk2 which is associated to cell cycle checkpoints activation, failed to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). These results suggest that while the survival signals for <italic>Mtb</italic> are dependent on activation of ATM, it is not channeled through the classical DDR. High-throughput study revealed that following DSBs, ATM-dependent phosphorylation of ~700 substrates regulate multitude of cellular processes such as cell cycle, cellular differentiation etc., emphasizing its global regulatory role. Importantly, DDR was suggested to crosstalk with the IGF-1/PI3K/Akt pathway to elicit cell survival signals, which is also supported by data that demonstrated ATM-dependent phosphorylation of Akt at S473 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khalil et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matsuoka et al., 2007</xref>). Previous reports suggested that inhibiting Akt diminished <italic>Mtb</italic> survival inside host cells and proposed it to be a novel target for host directed therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuijl et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized a probable divergence of ATM signaling towards Akt activation may play a role in influencing <italic>Mtb</italic> survival. We observed that addition of Akt-I compromises the survival of <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). Furthermore, combinatorial addition of both ATM and Akt inhibitors did not show either additive or synergistic impact on the <italic>Mtb</italic> survival, suggesting that survival signals are routed through ATM-Akt axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>).</p><p><italic>Mtb</italic> infection of the host cells can induce host cell death through both apoptotic and non-apoptotic pathways. Apoptotic death is considered to be advantageous for the host as it results in the elimination of pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fratazzi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Molloy et al., 1994</xref>). Induction of non-apoptotic death of the host cells is beneficial for the bacilli as it fails to eliminate the pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dobos et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keane et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee and Paull, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Park et al., 2006</xref>). Recently, it was reported that internalization of <italic>Mtb</italic> aggregates by the host cell results in killing of the host and there was a direct correlation between the size of aggregates and cell death. However, the death in such cases was through non-apoptotic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mahamed et al., 2017</xref>). In our experiments we kept MOI at one to circumvent aggregation and non-apoptotic cell death of the host. We observed significantly increased apoptosis upon the addition of inhibitors for either ATM or Akt or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>). These results are in line with the previous findings, wherein bacterial pathogens such as <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> and <italic>Coxiella burnetii</italic> have been shown to get survival advantage through Akt activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuijl et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Voth and Heinzen, 2009</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesize that persistent DSBs caused by <italic>Mtb</italic> could be a means to constitutively activate ATM, which in turn would activate Akt and inhibit apoptosis thus facilitating the survival of the pathogen. We corroborated our finding in the murine model of chronic tuberculosis infection, wherein the infected lungs showed the activation of γH2AX and ATM-Chk2 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a–b</xref>). Addition of ATM inhibitor to the INH regime substantially reduced the bacilli load in the host establishing ATM as a potent target for HDT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c–f</xref>). In conclusion, our study demonstrates that <italic>Mtb</italic> through SecA2 secretome challenges the host fitness by damaging the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g</xref>). In an effort to repair the damage, the host cell activates the ATM kinase mediated signaling cascade, which is exploited by <italic>Mtb</italic> to survive. We believe we have identified a novel survival mechanism utilized by <italic>Mtb</italic>, wherein the pathogen constantly challenges the host genome leading to the activation of pro-survival ATM-Akt signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g</xref>). Hence, we propose the use of ATM inhibitors as adjunct for HDT in the treatment of tuberculosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>Fine chemicals used in the study were purchased from Sigma-Merck.

After 21 days, CFUs of <italic>Mtb</italic> were enumerated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Preparation of lysates, western blotting, and immunofluorescence</title><p>Cell lines were lysed and snap-frozen mice lungs and spleen were macerated in cold RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1.0% NP-40, 0.5% Sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, freshly supplemented with PhosSTOP and Complete protease inhibitor (Roche). The lysates were resolved in 10–15% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membrane (Biorad). Antibody dilutions, incubation time and temperature conditions were according to the manufacturers’ protocol. Blots were developed on autoradiograms using chemiluminescent HRP substrate (ECL, Millipore). For immunofluorescence assay, 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells were seeded on sterile coverslips in 6-well tissue culture plates and infected with GFP expressing <italic>Rv/Ra</italic>. At defined time points, cells were fixed with 2% PFA and immunostaining was performed according to the manufacturers’ protocol provided by respective antibody. Coverslips were mounted on slides with DAPI containing Vectashield mountant (H-1200, Vector Labs).

Infection load in lungs and spleen was determined at day 1 and 56 p.i to evaluate deposition and commencement of chronic infection of <italic>Mtb</italic>, respectively. One lung and part of spleen of infected mice were homogenized and plated on 7H11 plates supplemented with PANTA (BD Bioscience) to enumerate CFUs. Second lung and part of the spleen from infected and uninfected mice were used preparation of tissue lysates. In another experimental set up, Balb/c mice were infected with <italic>Rv</italic> as stated above. Post 15 days of infection, mice were either kept untreated or treated with Vehicle (5% DMSO in sterile PBS), INH (prepared in sterile water, 25 mg/kg/dose through oral gavage), KU55933 (prepared in DMSO and further diluted in PBS such that DMSO is 5% (v/v) in PBS before injecting in the peritoneal cavity; administered every third day at 10 mg/Kg/dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batey et al., 2013</xref>]) or INH+ATM-I according to the dosage stated for next 15 days.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Alasdair Lesley (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The submission by Nandicoori explores activation of the ATM kinase, which occurs during colonization of macrophages by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. The authors study this in human and mouse macrophage cell lines and in primary mouse macrophages. The activation of ATM kinase led to the phosphorylation of cognate substrates Chk2 and γH2AX, the latter being detected in the form of nuclear foci, an observation that supports the induction of DNA double-strand breaks in response to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. In contrast, a non-virulent strain (<italic>H37Ra</italic>) led to activation of the human ATR kinase, detected by its phosphorylation and phosphorylation of its substrate, Chk1. DNA damage induction could be recapitulated using bacterial supernatants and was abolished when using heat-killed bacteria or a mutant of the SecA2 secretion system. These data support the SecA2-dependent secretion of a genotoxic agent/s by virulent mycobacteria. Inhibition of ATM led to a small reduction in bacterial load in infected mouse macrophages and when combined with the antibiotic isoniazid, a synergistic effect was demonstrated. Inhibition of ATM led to apoptosis in a large proportion of infected macrophages, supporting a model where ATM promotes <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> survival in its host. Inhibition of the Chk2 kinase, acting classically downstream of ATM to block cell cycle progression, did not phenocopy ATM inhibition while inhibition of Akt did. Akt has been reported as being activated by ATM but also by DNA-PK (another kinase activated together with ATM upon DNA double-strand breaks). Consistent with this, the authors report here an ATM dependent activation of Akt upon infection. These findings are of potential interest as they support the hypothesis that virulent mycobacteria secrete a genotoxic agent, that still awaits characterization, through the SecA2 pathway and suggest that inhibitors of the human DNA damage response, including ATM inhibitors and probably DNA-PK inhibitors, could be used as host-directed therapy in combination with current antimicrobials. Several of these inhibitors have already undergone clinical trials to be used alone or in combination with DNA damaging agents to cure various human cancers and some of them have demonstrated safety and efficacy.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In Figure 2D, phosphoATM seems nucleolar on the micrographs. This is unexpected. This could be an important finding if confirmed. To confirm signal specificity, an immunofluorescence (IF) experiment would be needed using the ATM inhibitor KU55933 to show that the nucleolar staining disappears after treatment. To confirm the localization, co-staining of phosphoATM upon infection should be performed with a nucleolar marker (e.g. nucleolin).</p><p>2) Considering that the formation of γH2AX foci is the strongest evidence for DNA double-strand break induction presented in the manuscript, pictures acquired at higher resolution showing the focal pattern of the staining should be provided. In addition, IF should also be performed using an antibody against another protein forming foci in response to DNA double-strand breaks, for example 53BP1.</p><p>3) When considering (i) the major role of NHEJ in repairing DNA double-strand break in human cells (Ciccia and Elledge, 2010) and (ii) the role of the NHEJ complex DNA-PK in activating Akt (Lan et al. Oncotarget 2016; Stronach et al. Neoplasia 2011), the impact of the inhibition of DNA-PK kinase activity on <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection should be investigated in this study in parallel to ATM inhibition. This could be tested using one of the specific DNA-PK inhibitors available, such as NU7441.</p><p>4) After treatment with classical DNA double-strand break inducing agent, production of γH2AX is mainly ATM dependent, but has also been reported in some circumstance to be DNA-PK and/or ATR dependent. In Figure 5B, treatment with the ATM inhibitor only reduces γH2AX production, which suggests that other kinases might be at work. The authors should test the implication of ATR and DNA-PK in this residual phosphorylation, since specific inhibitors against these kinases are commercially available.</p><p>5) The authors report ATR activation upon infection by the <italic>H37Ra</italic> attenuated strain. IF should be performed (after <italic>H37Ra</italic> and <italic>H37Rv</italic> infection) to monitor for the accumulation of the protein RPA (complex of RPA1, RPA2 and RPA3) in the form of foci, which would support the accumulation of single-strand DNA upon infection (RPA is recruited on single-strand DNA regions).</p><p>6) Previous work has implicated ROS in the production of DNA damage in infected host cells, the role of ROS should be investigated here. An experiment with N-acetyl-cysteine or membrane permeable reduced glutathione should be performed.</p><p>7) Figure 6A and B do not provide sufficient data to support conclusions. Rather, the authors should test the effect of the KU inhibitor in vivo.</p><p>8) Furthermore, the model suggests AKT signalling promotes survival by blocking <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> induced apoptosis. Therefore, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection with AKT or ATM inhibition should lead to increased cell death by apoptosis. However, this is very hard to assess with the data presented as, in Figure 5H, the effect of inhibitor alone is not tested (so the increased apoptosis could just be due to the inhibitor – which, as from Figure 5—figure supplement 1, does cause cell death); and in Figure 5—figure supplement 1, there is no increased cell death when <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is added. The authors should assess the effect of the inhibitors (KU and AKT-I) alone on apoptosis without <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection.</p><p>9) Western blot data should be quantified and statistically analyzed. Some blots are sliced/edited others not in the same panel (Figure 3C); a single membrane should be used.</p><p>10) The model that decreased apoptosis is associated with increased bacterial growth is also contrary to recently published live imaging studies suggesting that macrophage death is essential for rapid bacterial growth (Mahamed et al., 2017). The authors should discuss this.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51466.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In Figure 2D, phosphoATM seems nucleolar on the micrographs.

In order to address the question, we performed immunofluorescence of PФ infected with GFP-<italic>Rv</italic> at 24 h p.i. To obtain better resolution, we captured the images at 100X (in the previous version we did it at 63X) with an optical zoom of 2.9X. It is apparent from the newly added data (Figure 2E) that pATM foci are observed throughout the nuclei. We also observed distinct localization of pATM foci at what appears to be nucleolar. We confirmed the specificity of these signals by performing pATM immunofluorescence in the presence of ATM inhibitor KU55933 (Figure 5B). Treatment of cells with ATM inhibitor led to disappearance of pATM foci, suggesting that the foci indeed correspond to pATM.</p><p>Further we made several attempts to co-stain nucleoli with nucleolin (cat no. 396400; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and pATM antibody. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts and even when utilized two other nucleolin antibodies, we were unsuccessful in getting the staining for the nucleolin. Therefore, while we agree with the reviewers that pATM localization in the nucleolus seems to be interesting, we have no definitive experimental proof of this observation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Considering that the formation of γH2AX foci is the strongest evidence for DNA double-strand break induction presented in the manuscript, pictures acquired at higher resolution showing the focal pattern of the staining should be provided.

We agree with the reviewers that images at higher resolution would provide us a better staining pattern for one of the most important DNA damage marker, γH2AX. Presence of mediator proteins such as 53BP1, which accumulate at the DNA damage site would corroborate our findings. We therefore performed immunofluorescence of PФ infected with GFP-<italic>Rv</italic> at 24 h p.i. for γH2AX and 53BP1 (Figure 2F). To obtain higher resolution images, they were captured at 100X magnification with an optical zoom of 2.9X. Results show distinct focal pattern and colocalization of γH2AX and 53BP1 in <italic>Rv</italic> infected PФ (Figure 2F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) When considering (i) the major role of NHEJ in repairing DNA double-strand break in human cells (Ciccia and Elledge, 2010) and (ii) the role of the NHEJ complex DNA-PK in activating Akt (Lan et al. Oncotarget 2016; Stronach et al. Neoplasia 2011), the impact of the inhibition of DNA-PK kinase activity on M. tuberculosis infection should be investigated in this study in parallel to ATM inhibition. This could be tested using one of the specific DNA-PK inhibitors available, such as NU7441.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewers for an insightful suggestion. Infection of PФ with <italic>Rv</italic> did indeed result in the activation of DNA-PK, albeit to much lower levels and at later time points compared with the pATM (Figure 6A). To assess the role of DNA-PK and ATR in the survival of pathogen in the host, cells treated with inhibitors individually were infected with <italic>Rv</italic> and CFUs were enumerated (Figure 6C). It is evident that the addition of NU7441 (inhibitor of DNA-PK) or VE-281 (inhibitor of ATR) did not alter the CFUs, suggesting that even though DNA-PK seems to be activated in the DDR pathway, it does not influence the survival of the pathogen (Figure 6C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) After treatment with classical DNA double-strand break inducing agent, production of γH2AX is mainly ATM dependent, but has also been reported in some circumstance to be DNA-PK and/or ATR dependent.

The authors should test the implication of ATR and DNA-PK in this residual phosphorylation, since specific inhibitors against these kinases are commercially available.</p></disp-quote><p>Results in Figure 5A (Figure 5B in the previous version) showed presence of residual γH2AX despite KU treatment. While phosphorylation of H2AX is predominantly modulated by ATM; ATR and DNA-PKcs may also contribute either partially or entirely to its phosphorylation (Ciccia and Elledge, 2010). Thus, as suggested by reviewers we assessed the possible role of combinatorically inhibiting ATM and DNA-PK or ATR on the levels of γH2AX. PФ treated with KU or KU + NU or KU + VE were infected with <italic>Rv</italic> and the extent of H2AX phosphorylation was evaluated by western blot. While addition of VE+KU did not alter the residual levels of γH2AX, addition of NU +KU resulted in further decrease in the levels of γH2AX, suggesting that DNA-PKcs also contributes to H2AX phosphorylation. To assess the role of DNA-PK and ATR in the ex-vivo survival of pathogen, host cells treated individually with inhibitors were infected with <italic>Rv</italic> and CFUs were enumerated (Figure 6C). It is evident that addition of NU or VE did not alter the CFUs, suggesting that even though DNA-PK seems to be activated in the DDR pathway, it does not influence the survival of the pathogen (Figure 6C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors report ATR activation upon infection by the H37Ra attenuated strain. IF should be performed (after H37Ra and H37Rv infection) to monitor for the accumulation of the protein RPA (complex of RPA1, RPA2 and RPA3) in the form of foci, which would support the accumulation of single-strand DNA upon infection (RPA is recruited on single-strand DNA regions).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by reviewers, we evaluated differential accumulation of RPA2 and pRPA2 in UI, <italic>Ra</italic> and <italic>Rv</italic> infected cells. Infection by <italic>Ra</italic> led to the formation of distinct nuclear pRPA2 (Figure 2C) and RPA2 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) foci, which corroborate robust activation of ATR-Chk1 pathway (Figure 2B; right panel), suggesting that <italic>Ra</italic> mediates generation of ssDNA. On the other hand, infection by <italic>Rv</italic> showed far fewer foci for RPA2 or pRPA2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Previous work has implicated ROS in the production of DNA damage in infected host cells, the role of ROS should be investigated here. An experiment with N-acetyl-cysteine or membrane permeable reduced glutathione should be performed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that ROS is known to generate DNA damage as exemplified in case of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infection (Chumduri et al., 2013). On the contrary, <italic>H. pylori</italic>, <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> mediated DSBs are ROS-independent. SodA<sub>Mtb</sub>, which is secreted through SecA2 pathway plays an important role in detoxification of ROS generated inside the host thus partially neutralizing the anti-microbial property of ROS. In <italic>RvΔSecA2</italic> mutant, SodA<sub>Mtb</sub> secretion is expected to be compromised and hence one would expect higher levels of host ROS upon infection. The fact that <italic>RvΔSecA2</italic> mutant fails to inflict DSBs suggests that <italic>Mtb</italic> mediated damage is unlikely to be ROS-dependent. In agreement with this, addition of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a scavenger of ROS, to the infected cells did not alter the γH2AX, suggesting that DNA damage is not mediated through ROS (Figure 7—figure supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 6A and B do not provide sufficient data to support conclusions. Rather, the authors should test the effect of the KU inhibitor in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that in vivo validation of PФ infection data (Figure 7C in the revised manuscript) is necessary. We investigated the possibility of utilizing ATM inhibitor towards adjunct host directed therapy (HDT) for TB with the help of murine infection model. Mice were infected aerosolically with <italic>Rv</italic> and 15 days post infection mice were treated with vehicle or INH or KU or INH + KU for next 15 days and CFUs were enumerated in both lungs and spleen (Figure 7D). As anticipated, treatment with INH resulted in ~ 1 log fold reduction in the load of <italic>Mtb</italic>. While treatment with KU alone did not show any difference in the clearance of the pathogen, combination of KU + INH treatment resulted in ~ 1 log fold better clearance compared with INH treatment alone (Figure 7E). Notably, the impact of KU+INH treatment compared with INH treatment alone was more evident in the spleen (Figure 7F), suggesting that combined therapy compromises dissemination of the pathogen. Taken together, we propose that ATM inhibitor is a potential candidate for HDT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Furthermore, the model suggests AKT signalling promotes survival by blocking M. tuberculosis induced apoptosis. Therefore, M. tuberculosis infection with AKT or ATM inhibition should lead to increased cell death by apoptosis. However, this is very hard to assess with the data presented as, in Figure 5H, the effect of inhibitor alone is not tested (so the increased apoptosis could just be due to the inhibitor – which, as from Figure 5—figure supplement 1, does cause cell death); and in Figure 5—figure supplement 1, there is no increased cell death when M. tuberculosis is added. The authors should assess the effect of the inhibitors (KU and AKT-I) alone on apoptosis without M. tuberculosis infection.</p></disp-quote><p>The MTT assay quantifies the relative quantity of viable and healthy cells by measuring the reduction of yellow tetrazolium dye, MTT by mitochondrial enzymes. We agree with the reviewers that inhibitors alone do impact the health of cell, which we could observe when we plotted the graphs at an inhibitor concentration of 10 µM. (Graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, same as Figure 6—figure supplement 1 (presently) but plotted UI and <italic>Rv</italic> in the same graph).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Cell viability upon treatment with inhibitors.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-51466-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>However, we have not statistically quantitated the difference. To quantify the number of cells undergoing apoptosis we performed Annexin V-7AAD staining wherein Annexin V recognizes the phosphatidylserine (PS) of the inner membrane and 7AAD is a nuclear stain. Even though these two assays utilize different approaches and have different sensitivity levels, in principle we observed similar readout of compromised health of <italic>Rv</italic> infected cells undergoing inhibitor treatment.</p><p>To address the point raised by reviewers, we performed Annexin V-7AAD staining both in UI and <italic>Rv</italic> infected cells in the presence of DMSO or KU or Akt-I or KU +Akt-I. Previously we performed the staining at 72 h. Since in MTT assay, we followed only up to 48 h, this time round, we performed Annexin V-7AAD staining at 48 h. While the addition of inhibitors did not impact the percent live cells (Figure 6G; top panel) in UI cells, their presence decreased the percent live cells <italic>Rv</italic> infected cells (Figure 6G; top panel). We observed concomitant increase in the early and late apoptotic cells in the presence of KU or Akt-I or KU + Akt-I (Figure 6G; bottom panel).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Western blot data should be quantified and statistically analyzed. Some blots are sliced/edited others not in the same panel (Figure 3C); a single membrane should be used.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the concerns, we have quantified and statistically analyzed the blots with major findings. Briefly densitometric analysis of major findings was performed with the help of Image J software. Scans of autoradiograms (300 dpi) were opened in Image J software and the intensities of bands in each lane was individually measured. The intensities of γH2AX/pATM/pATR/pChk2/pChk1/pAkt/p53 were normalized with respect to their corresponding loading control β-actin/β-tubulin/GAPDH. Once the values were obtained for all the lanes in an image, the fold change was calculated as follows.</p><p>Fold Change = [Normalized intensity of a band / highest normalized intensity in that panel]</p><p>The figure numbers of the corresponding western blot, which is a representative blot of one of the replicates, is given above each graph.

The authors should discuss this.</p></disp-quote><p>In the recent paper published in <italic>eLife</italic> (Mahamed et al., 2017), it was reported that internalization of <italic>Mtb</italic> aggregates by the macrophage results in killing of the host cell and there was direct correlation between the size of aggregates and cell death. However, the death in such cases was through non-apoptotic pathway. In our experiments we kept MOI at 1 to circumvent aggregation and non-apoptotic cell death of the host. <italic>Mtb</italic> infection of the host cells can induce host cell death through both apoptotic and non-apoptotic pathways. Apoptotic death is considered to be advantageous for the host as it results in the elimination of pathogen. Induction of non-apoptotic death of the host cells is beneficial for the pathogen as it fails to eliminate the pathogen. The above aspects have been included in the Discussion with appropriate references. We observed significantly increased apoptosis upon the addition of inhibitors for either ATM or Akt or both (Figure 6). These results are in line with the previous findings, wherein bacterial pathogens such as <italic>Salmonella</italic> typhimurium and Coxiella burnetii have been shown to get survival advantage through Akt activation (Kuijl et al., 2007; Voth and Heinzen, 2009).</p></body></sub-article></article>
