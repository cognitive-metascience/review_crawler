Perforin-2 is expressed constitutively in phagocytes and inducibly in parenchymal, tissue-forming cells. In vitro, Perforin-2 prevents the intracellular replication and proliferation of bacterial pathogens in these cells. Perforin-2 knockout mice are unable to control the systemic dissemination of methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) or <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> and perish shortly after epicutaneous or orogastric infection respectively. In contrast, Perforin-2-sufficient littermates clear the infection. Perforin-2 is a transmembrane protein of cytosolic vesicles -derived from multiple organelles- that translocate to and fuse with bacterium containing vesicles. Subsequently, Perforin-2 polymerizes and forms large clusters of 100 Å pores in the bacterial surface with Perforin-2 cleavage products present in bacteria. Perforin-2 is also required for the bactericidal activity of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and hydrolytic enzymes. Perforin-2 constitutes a novel and apparently essential bactericidal effector molecule of the innate immune system.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06508.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06508.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06508.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>An effective defense against foreign invaders is fundamental to an organism's survival. It is likely that immunity began to develop shortly after the emergence of Earth's first single-celled organisms and a remnant of that distant past still exists in our present day immune system in the form of Perforin-2. This ancient protein has been highly conserved throughout evolution from sea sponges to humans. Some studies have suggested that Perforin-2 may have an antimicrobial role in invertebrates (including clams, mussels, and snails) and fish. However, its mechanism of killing and its role in the mammalian immune systems has remained largely unknown.</p><p>McCormack et al. now report that Perforin-2 is a crucial component of host defense against a wide spectrum of infectious bacteria in both mice and humans. This was shown when mice lacking Perforin-2 died from bacterial infections that are not normally lethal. Somewhat unexpectedly, other bactericidal molecules were also found to be less effective in the absence of Perforin-2. This indicates that Perforin-2 is required for the activity of multiple aspects of the mammalian immune system.</p><p>McCormack et al. demonstrated that Perforin-2 kills by punching holes in bacteria. Unlike other pore-forming proteins that are only present in specific cells, all mammalian cells can express Perforin-2. McCormack et al. also showed that when Perforin-2 is produced at optimal levels, cells are able to combat otherwise lethal, drug-resistant bacteria, including methicillin resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA). This means that Perforin-2 provides a rapid self-defense mechanism for cells against bacterial invaders. The protein's dual role as a pore-forming protein and a supporter of other antibacterial molecules is unprecedented. In the future, these findings could inform the development of treatments that activate and optimize Perforin-2 production to target and eradicate bacterial infections.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold>

to disrupt the cellular integrity of bacterial pathogens and virally infected cells. The first immunologically relevant discovery of a pore-former was the spontaneous polymerization and refolding of the hydrophilic complement component C9 into a membrane-associated cylindrical complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Podack and Tschopp, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tschopp et al., 1982</xref>).

Analysis of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) identified Perforin-1 as the pore-forming killer protein for virus-infected cells and tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dennert and Podack, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Podack and Dennert, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blumenthal et al., 1984</xref>). Sequence alignment of Perforin-1 and C9 identified a conserved domain, named the Membrane Attack Complex/Perforin (MACPF) domain in reference to its founding members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lichtenheld et al., 1988</xref>).</p><p>During polymerization, the MACPF-domains of individual protomers refold and expose an amphipathic helix that inserts into the targeted membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rosado et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baran et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kondos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Law et al., 2010</xref>). The hydrophilic surface of the membrane-inserted portion of polymerizing MACPF forms the inner, hydrophilic lining of the nascent pore driving the displacement of hydrophobic membrane components. MACPF generated pores disrupt the innate barrier function of membranes and provide access for chemical or enzymatic effectors that finalize destruction of the target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schreiber et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Masson and Tschopp, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Trapani et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shiver et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smyth et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>Macrophage Expressed Gene 1 (MPEG1) is the most recently identified protein with a MACPF-domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spilsbury et al., 1995</xref>).

Evolutionary studies of Perforin-2, have demonstrated that Perforin-2 is one of the oldest eukaryotic MACPF members, present in early metazoan phyla including <italic>Porifera</italic> (sponges) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">D'Angelo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wiens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McCormack et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McCormack et al., 2013b</xref>).

Recent studies in vertebrates (mammalia) demonstrate that expression of Perforin-2 is not limited to macrophages, as it was also detected in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and human epithelial cells after bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fields et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McCormack et al., 2013a</xref>) suggesting that Perforin-2 expression is tied to antibacterial activity.

Perforin-2 is an essential innate effector protein that kills gram-positive, gram-negative, and acid-fast bacteria.

The presence of Perforin-2 potentiates the antibacterial activity of other known effectors including reactive oxygen and nitrogen species.

If ROS and NO activity is dependent upon Perforin-2 we hypothesized that bacterial ROS and NO defense mechanisms would be unnecessary in Perforin-2 knockout cells. Unlike other superoxide dismutases that protect bacteria from oxygen radicals produced intracellularly as a byproduct of cellular respiration, SodC1 is a periplasmic superoxide dismutase.

Flavohemoglobin acts by either catalyzing an O<sub>2</sub>-dependent denitrosylase reaction converting NO to a nitrate ion or N<sub>2</sub>O, or an anoxic reductive reaction forming NO<sup>−</sup>. As with SodC1, in vivo and in vitro studies substantiate the role of HmpA with significant attenuation observed with HmpA deficient bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stevanin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bang et al., 2006</xref>).

siRNA knockdown was used to determine its contribution towards intracellular killing of bacteria by IFN-induced murine and human parenchymal cells. Although IFN induces hundreds of antimicrobial genes in addition to Perforin-2, silencing of Perforin-2 alone was sufficient to cause bacterial replication. Without exception, Perforin-2 expression and function were essential for killing a diverse array of intracellular pathogenic bacteria by parenchymal or phagocytic cells. Examples of bactericidal activity include human vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC); human pancreatic cells (MIA-PaCa-2); human uroepithelial cells (UM-UC-9); murine ovarian epithelial cells (MOVCAR 5009); murine colon epithelial cells (CT26); and murine cardiac myoblasts (C2C12), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

Upon density gradient ultracentrifugation, Perforin-2 co-sedimented with membrane vesicles staining with markers for ER, Golgi, early endosome, or plasma membrane. Perforin-2 was not detected in fractions containing mitochondrial, peroxisomal, or lysosomal membranes, nor in the cytoplasm. As Perforin-2 localizes to the same organelles following co-sedimentation of endogenous Perforin-2 or imaging after overexpressed c terminal tagged Perforin-2, it is unlikely that the tag will disrupt Perforin-2 localization following bacterial challenge.</p><p>In non-infected murine BV2 microglial cells, Perforin-2-GFP vesicles were distributed in a membrane pattern throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>).

During this process GFP is released from GFP synthesizing bacteria suggesting bacterial demise. Similarly, the appearance of diffuse bacterial DNA inside the vesicle suggests that integrity of the bacteria has been compromised. Owing to Perforin-2′s highly conserved MACPF domain, we next were interested in elucidating if Perforin-2 and its MACPF domain can form pores.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Perforin-2 forms large clusters of 100 Å pores in bacterial cell walls</title><p>To address the hypothesis that Perforin-2 can form pores in membranes akin to C9 of complement and Perforin-1 we used an artificial system by overexpressing Perforin-2 in HEK-293 cells, followed by the isolation of post-nuclear membranes, limited proteolysis, and their analysis by negative staining electron microscopy (EM). The cytoplasmic domain of Perforin-2 has a predicted trypsin cleavage site close to the N-terminus of its transmembrane domain which may be functionally important. We observed clusters of typical membrane pores of ∼100 Å inner diameter in these membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>) that were morphologically similar to poly-C9 and poly-Perforin-1 pores on bacterial and cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schreiber et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Podack and Tschopp, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Podack and Dennert, 1983</xref>). Pores were not observed on any membranes in the absence of trypsin treatment. These experiments suggest that Perforin-2, putatively via its MACPF domain, is able to form clusters of regular polymeric pores on membranes akin to C9 of complement and Perforin-1.

The physical proximity of the pore-forming MACPF domain of Perforin-2 to endocytosed bacteria suggested that bacteria killed inside the endosomes might also exhibit electron microscopic images typical for Perforin-2-lesions on bacterial surfaces/membranes.

Since we have a panel of antibodies that recognize denatured Perforin-2, we reasoned that it is possible to prove or disprove the latter. To accomplish this, we utilized five antibodies raised against peptides from different regions of human Perforin-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In order to determine eukaryotic cellular contamination following bacterial purification, non-infected cells were processed in parallel as a control.

This indicates that Perforin-2 was not present as a soluble protein nor associated with cellular debris or microvesicles. Rather, Perforin-2 was associated with particles larger than 0.22 microns, such as bacterial cells. This conclusion was supported by the detection of the EPEC transcription factor ADA in the bacterial fractions but not filtrates. Likewise, MRSA Penicillin Binding Protein (PBP) was only detected in the unfiltered bacterial fractions.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06508.022</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Cleaved Perforin-2 recovered after cellular infection with bacteria.</title><p>Perforin-2 −/− MEFs were transfected with human Perforin-2-GFP or GFP induced with murine IFN-γ and infected with the extracellular bacteria MRSA or EPEC.

Keratinocytes in the skin and the mucosal epithelia in the intestinal tract are known to provide local immune defense at barrier sites through the deployment of antimicrobial compounds and peptides to thwart pathogens while maintaining complex commensal communities. These effectors also, minimize chronic immune activation and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Linden et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Turner, 2009</xref>). In this study we have characterized an additional effector, Perforin-2, present in professional phagocytes and barrier forming cells such as keratinocytes and mucosal epithelial cells. In the absence of Perforin-2, the ability of these cells to destroy bacteria is severely compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). These findings suggest that Perforin-2 may act upstream of other antimicrobial effectors or that their potency is enhanced by Perforin-2.</p><p>Our study demonstrates that parenchymal, tissue-forming cells can also express Perforin-2 and its expression in these cells is essential for killing of bacteria. Our EM analysis of isolated bacteria suggests that this killing is achieved by polymerization and pore-formation of Perforin-2. In the absence of Perforin-2, the other innate defense effectors were unable to prevent the replication and systemic dissemination of bacterial pathogens. As per above, this suggests that Perforin-2 may facilitate or augment the activity of other antimicrobial effectors.</p><p>The unique structure of Perforin-2 as a membrane protein with a luminal and extracellular MACPF-killer domain is well suited for locally killing membrane-entrapped, extracellular or intracellular bacteria. Unlike Perforin-2, the other immunologic MACPF proteins do not act within the cell producing the effector protein. Perforin-1 is stored in granules in NK and CTL that are exocytosed into the immunologic synapse, thereby exposing Perforin-1 to extracellular calcium ions that trigger Perforin-1 polymerization in target membranes. The components of the MAC of complement are secreted by the liver into blood to exert their antibacterial effects after binding of C3b to the bacterial surface which initiates the assembly of the pore-forming C5b-8-poly-C9 complex.</p><p>Seemingly every cell can utilize Perforin-2 to defend itself against bacteria—potentially even before professional phagocytes are recruited–according to the constitutive expression of Perforin-2 in kc. Owing to this innate intrinsic protection of kc, bacteria may be cleared by these barrier cells even before the influx and assistance of professional phagocytes. The lack of barrier protection by kc when Perforin-2 is deficient may explain why Perforin-2 knockout mice rapidly (within days; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>) exhibit symptoms to epicutaneous infection with MRSA. Thereafter the combined absence of Perforin-2 in the barrier tissue and in professional phagocytes may overwhelm the host by enhancing the systemic dissemination of the bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>) and, ultimately, leading to multiple organ failure. The speed and severity of infections in Perforin-2 deficient animals, including sepsis and death following traditional non-lethal inocula of bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig8">Figures 7, 8</xref>), may also be assisted by the seemingly ubiquitous expression and function of Perforin-2, either inducible or constitutive. We suggest that this ubiquitous mechanism provides heretofore unrealized defenses at all potential sites of infection including barrier cells, phagocytes, parenchyma, and possibly even stroma. Further studies are required to determine the relative contribution of Perforin-2 expressed in each of them.</p><p>The scenarios above are further complicated by differences in the regulation of Perforin-2 in different cells. It is constitutively expressed in macrophages (and at least in certain barrier cells like kc) but requires induction in parenchymal cells. Therefore we speculate that unactivated parenchymal cells offer invasive bacteria a window of opportunity for replication and further dissemination. A second issue is that some pathogens have evolved mechanisms to suppress Perforin-2 (see accompanying report by McCormack et al.). On the other hand, our data also shows that when Perforin-2 is expressed at optimal levels, highly pathogenic and antibiotic-resistant bacteria can be killed by Perforin-2. This leads us to speculate that supraphysiologic levels of Perforin-2 expression could be an approach to defeat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Vice versa, serious clinically relevant infections including antibiotic resistant strains of MRSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), and <italic>M. avium</italic> as well as <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) are all susceptible to Perforin-2, as demonstrated by greater bacterial pathogenesis in the absence of Perforin-2.</p><p>We undertook several approaches to determine whether Perforin-2 is a pore-forming protein and all approaches supported this concept. First, we isolated eukaryotic membranes from Perforin-2 overexpressing cells following limited trypsin digestion (to activate poly-Perforin-2 pore formation presumably by cleaving the cytoplasmic domain at a predicted trypsin-sensitive site) and observed 100 Å pores. The caveats of this approach entail its unphysiological setting especially the use of eukaryotic cell membranes that seem unlikely to compromise Perforin-2′s natural target. However, the visualization of pores on bacterial surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) was dependent on the availability of Perforin-2 and the bacterial membranes contained Perforin-2-derived fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) that were only discernable following infection with Perforin-2 expressing cells. These results strongly imply that the antibacterial properties of Perforin-2 involve polymerization and pore-formation in bacteria. The detection of cleavage proteins suggests that Perforin-2 also could be cleaved physiologically at some point during the bacterial infection; however, the order of cleavage and pore-formation as well as the role of additional proteins requires further investigation.</p><p>Membrane perforation by the MAC of complement and by poly-Perforin-1 of cytolytic lymphocytes provides a conduit for additional effector molecules to ensure complete target destruction. MAC-polyC9 pores act as entry point for serum lysozyme to digest peptidoglycan resulting in bacterial collapse and lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schreiber et al., 1979</xref>). Poly-Perforin-1 pores provide access to multiple granzymes that promote apoptosis of virally infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dennert and Podack, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Podack and Konigsberg, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Masson and Tschopp, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jenne and Tschopp, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Trapani et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shiver et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smyth et al., 1994</xref>). Likewise, our studies suggest that poly-Perforin-2 pores enhance the delivery and action of endogenously produced ROS and RNS. This is consistent with our previous finding that exogenous lysozyme lysed <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> and MRSA when they were isolated from Perforin-2 expressing fibroblasts but failed to lyse these pathogens when they were isolated from Perforin-2 deficient fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McCormack et al., 2013</xref>). Although high levels of lysozyme, ROS, or RNS can kill pathogens in the absence of Perforin-2 in vitro, we suggest that physiological endogenous levels of these–and potentially other antimicrobial effectors–may be limiting, requiring assistance by poly-Perforin-2 pore-formation to achieve bacterial killing (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and its supplements).</p><p>As pathogenic microbes are specialized in their invasive strategies so are the innate strategies of the immune system in the use of the three pore forming proteins. First, interstitial extracellular bacterial pathogens are killed by MAC-polyC9 of the complement system whose components are present in the serum. Second, the viral production factories are destroyed by poly-Perforin-1 delivered by NK cells and CTL. Third, invasive or cell membrane attached bacterial pathogens are eliminated by poly-Perforin-2 expressed in most, if not all, cells. Common to all three pore-formers is that their antimicrobial activity cooperates with additional specialized effectors. Our studies add Perforin-2 as the third MACPF-domain driven pore-forming killer protein to the arsenal of the mammalian immune system for protection against microbial invasion.</p><p>Given the central role of Perforin-2 in antimicrobial responses, the pathogenicity of bacteria may depend on their ability to subvert or evade Perforin-2′s pore-forming ability. In the accompanying manuscript we describe one such virulence factor (Cif) that protects bacterial pathogens by blocking translocation of Perforin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40a">McCormack et al., 2015</xref>). Determining the mechanism of how other pathogenic bacteria inhibit Perforin-2 will elucidate additional critical steps in Perforin-2 activation and may allow the development of new treatments targeting both antibiotic-sensitive and antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and bacterial organisms</title><p>RAW264.7 (TIB-71), J774A.1 (TIB-67), HL-60 (CCL-240), HeLa 229 (CCL 21), CATH.a (CRL-11179), Neuro-2A (CCL-131), NIH/3T3 (CRL-1658), Balb/c 3T3 (CCL-163), C2C12 (CRL-1772), CMT-93 (CCL-223), CT26.WT (CRL-2638), B16-F10 (CRL-6475), B16-F0 (CRL-6322), LL/2 (CRL-1642), MIA PaCa-2 (CRL-1420), Thp1 (TIB-202), NK-92 (CRL-2407), OVCAR3 (HTB-161), CaCo-2 (HTB-37), A549 (CCL-185), U-1752, JEG-3 (HTB-36), and HEK-293 (CRL-1573) cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA.

An edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the substantive concerns or comments; minor concerns are not usually shown. Reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elifesciences.org/review-process">review process</ext-link>). Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your work entitled “Perforin-2 is essential for intracellular defense of parenchymal cells and phagocytes against pathogenic bacteria” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Losick (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We agree that your manuscript reports an important finding but that there is a need to reinforce the results and/or to modulate your claims. Here are the main criticisms:</p><p>1) The authors show clearly that Perforin-2 promotes in vivo defense against methicillin resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) as demonstrated by greatly increased susceptibility of Perforin-2<italic>–/–</italic> mice. However, demonstration of similar in vivo protection using another bacterial pathogen would enhance the study.</p><p>2) One serious problem with the paper is that the mice were not backcrossed into the C57BL background for multiple generations. Conclusions about infection experiments in mice are repeatedly found to be unreliable if this isn't done.</p><p>3) It would be good to know whether Perforin-2 is more abundant in certain cells and, when induced, how levels compare (impossible to evaluate fold increase over “zero”).</p><p>4) How does Perforin-2 work on both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria? They have very different cell wall. How does Perforin-2 differentiate between bacterial and mammalian cell membranes? The so-called pores in bacterial membranes are not completely convincing. No evidence is provided to support the notion that these pores are formed by polymerized Perforin-2, as stated – this is just an inference. Could immunogold staining help localize Perforin-2 to the “pores”? Is an endogenous protease needed? It would be helpful to know if Perforin-2 has a lower MW or separates from the host membrane and relocalizes to the bacterial membrane after bacterial infection. These points require clarification.</p><p>5) The authors argue that ROS and NOS enhance the bactericidal activity of Perforin-2. However, all experiments have been with chemical inhibitors (NAC and L-NAME) and follow-up analysis with knockout mice must be done to really demonstrate this conclusion or else the language should be tempered.</p><p>6) The authors claim that Perforin-2 is not required for normal murine development or for control of commensal bacteria. Are there data to support this statement or literature to cite?</p><p>7) In the Discussion, the authors draw sharp distinctions among extracellular bacterial pathogens, intracellular viral pathogens and intracellular bacterial pathogens and their use of MAC-polyC9, poly-Perforin-1 and poly-Perforin-2. However, the experiments using Perforin-2<italic>–/–</italic> mice use <italic>S. aureus</italic>, which is primarily an extracellular pathogen although it can invade some cell types.

Here are the main criticisms:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors show clearly that Perforin-2 promotes in vivo defense against methicillin resistant</italic> S. aureus <italic>(MRSA) as demonstrated by greatly increased susceptibility of Perforin-f2–/– mice. However, demonstration of similar in vivo protection using another bacterial pathogen would enhance the study.</italic></p><p>We agree. Thus we have added orogastric infection with the gram-negative pathogen <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>. As in previous experiments, similar increased susceptibility of Perforin-2 knockout mice was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1 fig8s2 fig8s3">Figure 8–figure supplement 1-3</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) One serious problem with the paper is that the mice were not backcrossed into the C57BL background for multiple generations. Conclusions about infection experiments in mice are repeatedly found to be unreliable if this isn't done.</italic></p><p>In our initial study the Perforin-2 mutation was backcrossed 7-10 times, a point that is now made clearer (subsection “Generation of Perforin-2 knockout mice”). However, we agree that is not sufficient to remove doubts as per the cause of the phenotype. Therefore we now include additional animal studies with genetically pure 129X1/SvJ mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig8">Figure 7, 8B</xref>). The results with these new mice are similar to those previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig8">Figure 7, 8A</xref>). Therefore we are confident that the reported phenotypes are due to Perforin-2 deficiency and not the result of passenger mutations or differences between strains.</p><p><italic>3) It would be good to know whether Perforin-2 is more abundant in certain cells and, when induced, how levels compare (impossible to evaluate fold increase over “zero”).</italic></p><p>We agree and have modified our qPCR analysis to demonstrate induction by ΔCT of Perforin-2 subtracted from our housekeeping gene (GAPDH). With this analysis one can now compare Perforin-2 levels between samples pre- and post-stimulation as well as between samples.</p><p><italic>4) How does Perforin-2 work on both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria? They have very different cell wall. How does Perforin-2 differentiate between bacterial and mammalian cell membranes? The so-called pores in bacterial membranes are not completely convincing. No evidence is provided to support the notion that these pores are formed by polymerized Perforin-2, as stated – this is just an inference. Could immunogold staining help localize Perforin-2 to the “pores”? Is an endogenous protease needed? It would be helpful to know if Perforin-2 has a lower MW or separates from the host membrane and relocalizes to the bacterial membrane after bacterial infection. These points require clarification.</italic></p><p>This is an interesting mechanistic question regarding pore-formation of Perforin-2 on both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria as well as targeting differentiation between bacterial or mammalian cell membranes. However, based on previous studies with other MACPF proteins in complement as well as Perforin-1, both of these questions are likely to require a significant amount of work that goes beyond the scope of this current study.</p><p>We agree that immunogold staining would help to localize Perforin-2 to the visualized pores. Unfortunately no antibodies are currently available that would work with immunogold staining of Perforin-2. In order to clarify that the visible pores are poly-Perforin-2, we have added blinded quantification of pores present with different conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>). We have also isolated both gram-positive and –negative bacteria following infection and have identified Perforin-2 fragments present with the bacteria. This finding suggests that Perforin-2 can be isolated in both gram-positive and -negative bacteria following infection and that poly-Perforin-2 may be what is observed with the EM.</p><p><italic>5) The authors argue that ROS and NOS enhance the bactericidal activity of Perforin-2. However, all experiments have been with chemical inhibitors (NAC and L-NAME) and follow-up analysis with knockout mice must be done to really demonstrate this conclusion or else the language should be tempered.</italic></p><p>We have tempered the claims regarding Perforin-2 with ROS and NOS. Perforin-2 and ROS or NOS knockout animals are not currently available, a clarification that we believed was necessary (subsection “Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species enhance the bactericidal activity of Perforin-2 but have little microbicidal activity when Perforin-2 is absent”). We have also clarified the rational for using mutant bacteria that is attenuated to ROS and NOS.</p><p><italic>6) The authors claim that Perforin-2 is not required for normal murine development or for control of commensal bacteria. Are there data to support this statement or literature to cite?</italic></p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref>, we analyze the frequency of CD4, CD8, B cell, and NK cells in the peripheral blood of both Perforin-2<italic>–</italic>/<italic>–</italic> and +/+ littermates. As these Perforin-2 knockout animals are able to thrive in specific pathogen free barrier conditions, we conclude that Perforin-2 is not required for normal murine development or for control of commensals. To the extent of our knowledge, this is the first generation of Perforin-2 knockout mice. Therefore, we are unable to cite other literature confirming the normal development of these animals.</p><p><italic>7) In the Discussion, the authors draw sharp distinctions among extracellular bacterial pathogens, intracellular viral pathogens and intracellular bacterial pathogens and their use of MAC-polyC9, poly-Perforin-1 and poly-Perforin-2. However, the experiments using Perforin-2–/– mice use</italic> S. aureus<italic>, which is primarily an extracellular pathogen although it can invade some cell types. This discussion should be tempered to soften the sharp distinctions that are made.</italic></p><p>The discussion of these three pore-formers has been rewritten. We agree with the reviewer’s statements that the discussion as it was written is confusing and potentially misleading given the findings presented in this study and the accompanying manuscript.</p><p><italic>The Discussion talks about 3 immune cell pore-forming proteins (complement, Perforin and Perforin-2). Why is GNLY not mentioned, especially since it has anti-bacterial activity? It would be good to relate the findings here to the recent paper of Walch et al. in Cell.</italic></p><p>While we agree that the findings by Walch et al. in Cell regarding GNLY are interesting findings, we feel that GNLY falls outside of the scope of this study. Complement, Perforin, and Perforin-2 are all members of the MACPF super family of pore-forming proteins. Unlike these members, GNLY is a member of the saposin-like protein family. Further, recent manuscripts have demonstrated that while GNLY has anti-bacterial activity when combined with the activity of granzymes, it does not have great lytic activity on its own (requiring micromolar GNLY concentrations or extremely hypotonic or acidic buffers (Ernst, 2000; Stinger, 1998). Due to the above reasons, we do not believe that GNLY would easily mesh with our discussion which focuses on pore forming proteins.</p></body></sub-article></article>
