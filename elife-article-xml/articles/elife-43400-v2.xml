The mechanisms linking extended wakefulness to clock-gene expression are, however, not well understood. We propose CIRBP to play a role because its rhythmic expression is i) sleep-wake driven and ii) necessary for high-amplitude clock-gene expression <italic>in vitro</italic>. We therefore expect <italic>Cirbp</italic> knock-out (KO) mice to exhibit attenuated sleep-deprivation-induced changes in clock-gene expression, and consequently to differ in their sleep homeostatic regulation. Lack of CIRBP indeed blunted the sleep-deprivation incurred changes in cortical expression of <italic>Nr1d1</italic>, whereas it amplified the changes in <italic>Per2</italic> and <italic>Clock</italic>. Concerning sleep homeostasis, KO mice accrued only half the extra REM sleep wild-type (WT) littermates obtained during recovery. Unexpectedly, KO mice were more active during lights-off which was accompanied with faster theta oscillations compared to WT mice. Thus, CIRBP adjusts cortical clock-gene expression after sleep deprivation and expedites REM-sleep recovery.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd><kwd>cortical temperature</kwd><kwd>clock genes</kwd><kwd>locomotor activity</kwd><kwd>REM sleep</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>146694</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoekstra</surname><given-names>Marieke MB</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Etat de Vaud</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoekstra</surname><given-names>Marieke MB</given-names></name><name><surname>Emmenegger</surname><given-names>Yann</given-names></name><name><surname>Hubbard</surname><given-names>Jeffrey</given-names></name><name><surname>Franken</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The temperature-sensitive protein CIRBP contributes to the effect of sleep loss on the molecular circadian clock.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The sleep-wake distribution is coordinated by the interaction of a circadian and a sleep homeostatic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Daan et al., 1984</xref>). The molecular basis of the circadian process consists of clock genes that interact through transcriptional/translational feedback loops. CLOCK/NPAS2:BMAL1 (ARNTL) heterodimers drive the transcription of many target genes, among them the <italic>Period</italic> (<italic>Per1-2</italic>), <italic>Cryptochome</italic> (<italic>Cry1</italic>, <italic>−2</italic>) and <italic>Rev-Erb (Nr1d1, −2)</italic> genes. Subsequently, PER:CRY complexes inhibit CLOCK/NPAS2:ARNTL-transcriptional activity thereby preventing their own transcription. In addition, clock components such as the transcriptional repressor NR1D1 regulate the transcription of <italic>Arntl</italic>, ensuring together with other transcriptional feedback loops a period of ca. 24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lowrey and Takahashi, 2011</xref>). While this clock-gene circuitry is functionally expressed in almost each cell of the body, peripherally generated circadian rhythms are coordinated by a central pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus, assuring proper circadian time-keeping at the organismal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hastings et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The sleep homeostatic process keeps track of time spent awake and asleep, during which sleep pressure is increasing and decreasing. The mechanisms and specific brain structure(s) underlying this process are to date unknown. Accumulating evidence has implicated clock genes in sleep homeostasis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Franken, 2013</xref>). This is supported by studies in several species (i.e. mice, fruit flies and humans), showing that mutations in circadian clock genes are associated with an altered sleep homeostatic response to sleep deprivation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shaw et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Viola et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wisor et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">He et al., 2009</xref>). Sleep homeostasis has distinct local, use-dependent aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krueger and Tononi, 2011</xref>), a notion which seems incompatible with the existence of a central sleep homeostat, functionally analogous to the SCN as a master clock in circadian timekeeping. Disrupting circadian rhythms in the tuberomammillary nucleus, however, through removal of the core clock gene <italic>Arntl</italic>, affects the regulation of time spent in NREM sleep after sleep deprivation, implying that specific nuclei can impact aspects of the sleep homeostatic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). An additional argument for a role for clock genes in sleep homeostasis comes from studies showing that enforced wakefulness affects the expression of clock genes, such as <italic>Nr1d1</italic>, <italic>Per1-3</italic> and <italic>Dbp</italic>, in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mongrain et al., 2010</xref>). These sleep-deprivation induced changes in clock-gene expression were most pronounced in the cerebral cortex, while expression in the SCN remained unperturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Curie et al., 2015</xref>). The mechanisms through which these changes occur are, however, unclear.</p><p>In this study, we examined one possible mechanism and hypothesized that some of the sleep deprivation-induced changes in clock-gene expression occur through Cold-Inducible RNA Binding Protein (CIRBP). Decreasing temperature <italic>in vitro</italic> increase CIRBP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nishiyama et al., 1997</xref>) and daily changes in mice core body temperature are sufficient to drive robust cyclic levels of <italic>Cirbp</italic> and CIRBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morf et al., 2012</xref>) in anti-phase with temperature. Although daily changes in cortical temperature appear circadian, in the rat more than 80% of its variance is explained by the sleep-wake distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franken et al., 1992</xref>). Hence, when controlling for the daily sleep-wake driven changes in cortical temperature by sleep deprivations, the daily rhythms of cortical <italic>Cirbp</italic> become strongly attenuated (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, based on Gene Expression Omnibus number GSE9442 from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maret et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, the expression of the gene <italic>Cirbp</italic> shows the highest down-regulation of all genes after sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mongrain et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2010</xref>), underscoring its sleep-wake-dependent expression. But how does CIRBP relate to clock gene expression?</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43400.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The sleep-wake distribution drives daily changes of <italic>Cirbp</italic> expression in the mouse brain.</title><p>Dark-grey symbols and line (baseline): from ZT0 to ZT12, mice spend most of their time asleep and <italic>Cirbp</italic> increases, whereas between ZT12-18, when mice spent most of their time awake, <italic>Cirbp</italic> decreases.

Therefore, we and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Archer et al., 2014</xref>) proposed that changes in clock-gene expression during sleep deprivation are a consequence of the sleep-wake-driven changes in CIRBP. To test this hypothesis, we first quantified in mice the contribution of sleep-wake state and locomotor activity to changes in cortical temperature. Next, we measured sleep-deprivation-induced changes in clock-gene expression in both (wild-type) WT and mice lacking CIRBP (<italic>Cirbp</italic> KO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Masuda et al., 2012</xref>), anticipating that clock-gene expression in response to sleep deprivation differed in KO mice. Finally, as clock genes play a role in sleep homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Franken, 2013</xref>), we also compared the homeostatic regulation of sleep between WT and KO mice.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that like in the rat, the sleep-wake distribution in the mouse is the major determinant of cortical temperature changes, with a significant, albeit small, contribution of locomotor activity. In line with our predictions, we found that a lack of CIRBP attenuated the sleep-deprivation-induced changes in the cortical expression of <italic>Nr1d1</italic> and the homeostatic response in REM-sleep time. However, in contrast to our hypothesis, we observed that differences in <italic>Per2</italic> and <italic>Clock</italic> expression after sleep deprivation were augmented in <italic>Cirbp</italic> KO mice. Unexpectedly, these mice were also substantially more active during the dark phase of the 24 hr period when compared to their WT littermates, without increasing their time spent awake. This increase in locomotor activity was accompanied by an acceleration of electroencephalogram (EEG) theta oscillations during active waking. Altogether, our data show that <italic>Cirbp</italic> contributes to some of the sleep-deprivation-induced changes in clock-gene expression, but also points to the existence of other sleep-wake-driven pathways transferring sleep-wake state information to clock-gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The relation between cortical temperature, sleep-wake distribution, and locomotor activity</title><p>The dependence of brain and cortical temperature on sleep-wake state has been demonstrated in a number of mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alföldi et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker and Hayward, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deboer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franken et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hayward and Baker, 1968</xref>) but has not been specifically addressed in the mouse.

Consistent with mice being nocturnal animals, increased waking, locomotor activity and overall higher cortical temperature were observed during the dark phase. Sleep deprivation [between Zeitgeber Time (ZT)0–6] led to an almost uninterrupted period of 6 hr waking, during which locomotor activity and cortical temperature reached values comparable to bouts of spontaneous wakefulness under undisturbed baseline conditions (i.e. ZT12-18). Closer inspection of cortical temperature changes revealed rapid fluctuations associated with sleep-wake state transitions. We quantified these changes in cortical temperature by selecting and aligning transitions between consolidated bouts of NREM and REM sleep and wakefulness during the 2 baseline days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>-B). When entering NREM sleep, cortical temperature consistently decreased, whereas at transitions into wake and REM sleep, it increased. This latter transition was characterized by a fast and consistent change in cortical temperature, where within 1.5 min an increase of 0.4°C was observed. Transitions from REM sleep into wake led to an initial decrease in cortical temperature, contrasting with the increase observed in the wakefulness when following NREM sleep. Altogether, these results provide evidence that sleep-wake state importantly contributes to changes in cortical temperature.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43400.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>T<sub>cx</sub> changes with sleep-wake state.</title><p>T<sub>cx</sub>: cortical temperature; LMA: locomotor activity.

During the 6 hr sleep deprivation, animals spent 98% awake of the 6 hr, significantly more when compared to the same circadian time under baseline conditions (paired t-test: waking [hours] baseline: 2.2 ± 0.1, sleep deprivation: 5.9 ± 0.04; t(10)=-38.1, p&lt;0.0001; log<sub>2</sub>[movements], baseline: 13.1 ± 2.4, sleep deprivation: 39.4 ± 2.1; t(10)=-15.2, p&lt;0.0001). This increase in waking and activity led to sustained elevated cortical temperatures (average ZT0-ZT6 [°C]: baseline: 34.7 ± 0.07, sleep deprivation: 36.6 ± 0.06, t(10)=-44.3, p&lt;0.0001), suggesting a causal relationship. Notably, the genotype of the mice did not contribute to or interact with these changes (two-way ANOVA, Genotype*sleep deprivation/baseline: p&gt;0.39)</p><p>However, factors other than extended waking consequent to sleep deprivation, such as stress, could have contributed to these changes in cortical temperature. To address this issue, we selected in each mouse the longest uninterrupted spontaneous waking bout occurring during baseline (average length: 100 ± 19 min). We then compared cortical temperature of this bout with values reached of an equivalent time spent awake from the start of the sleep deprivation. The average of the last 10 min of these bouts was taken to reduce the influence of temperature differences at bout-onset. Cortical temperature reached in this bouts did not differ during sleep deprivation and spontaneous wakefulness in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>-C), nor in KO mice (t(5)=0.84, p=0.44), indicating that factors other than extended wakefulness (e.g. light exposure, circadian time, sleep deprivation-associated stress) do not expressly contribute to these changes.</p><p>Considering the strong correlation between locomotor activity and cortical temperature (WT: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.76; KO: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.81; p&lt;0.0001), it could be hypothesized that locomotor activity contributes to the sleep-wake associated changes in cortical temperature. To investigate this further, the respective contribution of waking and locomotor activity to changes in cortical temperature was quantified by partial correlation analysis. Although locomotor activity did significantly contribute, substantially more of the variance in cortical temperature was explained by waking in both genotypes. This was quantified with a paired t-test on Fisher Z-transformed R<sup>2</sup>-values from each individual mouse’s partial correlation on hourly waking and cortical temperature, and on hourly locomotor activity and cortical temperature (WT: t(5)=5.1, p=0.004; KO: t(5)=10.7, p=0.0001; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>-D for R<sup>2</sup>-partial correlation coefficients which are based on hourly data from all WT mice combined). We then determined the residual variance by calculating the difference between the observed cortical temperature and the temperature predicted based on the time-spent-awake in a given hour. During the light and dark phases, linear regression over- and underestimated cortical temperature, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>-E,F; baseline 1 and 2), leading to negative residuals during the light and positive residuals during the dark phases. Fitting a sinewave through these residuals across 2 baseline days revealed a ‘circadian’ distribution, with a mean amplitude of 0.29°C, almost twice what was previously reported in the rat [0.15°C] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franken et al., 1992</xref>). Interestingly, when considering the time course of the residuals throughout the experiment including the sleep deprivation and recovery, a consistent parallel became evident in the distribution of locomotor activity expressed per unit of waking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>-G).</p><p>Therefore, to determine if including locomotor activity could predict a larger portion of the variance in cortical temperature, we applied three Mixed Linear Models, with locomotor activity expressed per unit of waking (LMA/Waking). Model1 explained the variance in cortical temperature based on waking alone, Model2 also incorporated LMA/Waking, and Model3 considered additionally the interaction between Waking and LMA/Waking. Indeed, Model3 provided the best prediction of cortical temperature variance, although the improvement was marginal over the two other models (Model1: R<sup>2</sup><sub>c</sub>=0.84; Model2: R<sup>2</sup><sub>c</sub>=0.85; Model3: R<sup>2</sup><sub>c</sub>=0.86; chi-squared test: Model1 vs Model2: <italic>X<sup>2</sup></italic>(5)=16.2; p&lt;0.0001; Model2 vs Model3: <italic>X<sup>2</sup></italic>(6)=25.0; p&lt;0.0001). Thus, the sleep-wake distribution is the most important determinant of cortical temperature while locomotor activity is modestly contributing as well. Nevertheless, the residuals of this model, depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, still showed a similar pattern as those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>-F, illustrating the contribution of other (circadian) variables and/or a non-linearity of the association between locomotor activity and sleep-wake states to changes in cortical temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The influence of sleep deprivation and CIRBP on transcripts in cortex and liver</title><p>After establishing that the sleep-wake distribution was the major determinant of cortical temperature changes in mice, we assessed whether the sleep-deprivation incurred decrease in <italic>Cirbp</italic> expression is responsible for the changes in clock-gene expression. To achieve this, we quantified 11 transcripts from liver and 15 from cortex before and after sleep deprivation using RT-qPCR. Genes of interest included transcripts affected by sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maret et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mongrain et al., 2010</xref>) and/or the presence of CIRBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morf et al., 2012</xref>), with an emphasis on clock genes.

Although both isoforms are referred to as ‘cold-induced’, they exhibit opposite responses to sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2010</xref>), with a decrease in the short and an increase in the long isoform. We found that overall, the short isoform was more common than the long isoform in the cortex (PCR cycle detection number for all samples pooled: cortex: <italic>Rbm3-short</italic>: 25.6 ± 0.2, <italic>Rbm3-long</italic>: 29.7 ± 0.1, amplification efficiency <italic>Rbm3-short</italic>: 2.11 and <italic>Rbm3-long:</italic> 2.07). In the liver, only the short isoform was detected (liver: <italic>Rbm3-short</italic>: 28.2 ± 0.2, <italic>Rbm3-long</italic>:&gt;32; that is beyond reliable detection limit). In addition, we confirmed that after sleep deprivation <italic>Rbm3-short</italic> expression decreased in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>-A) and liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), whereas <italic>Rbm3-long</italic> increased in cortex. The latter observation reached significance only in the KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>-A).</p><p>As anticipated, cortical expression of the waking-induced transcripts <italic>Homer1a</italic>, <italic>Dusp4, Hspa5</italic>, <italic>Hsp90b1</italic> and <italic>Hsf1</italic> was increased by sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Post-hoc tests revealed that the latter two were significantly increased only in <italic>Cirbp</italic> KO mice. Furthermore, the effect of sleep deprivation on the transcripts <italic>Hsp90b1</italic> and <italic>Hspa5</italic> was significantly amplified in <italic>Cirbp</italic> KO mice compared to WT mice. Unexpectedly, no changes in the expression of heat shock transcripts incurred by sleep deprivation or genotype were detected in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that the presence of CIRBP is associated with longer 3’UTRs of its target genes, such as the transcript splice-factor proline Q (<italic>Sfpq</italic>), resulting in a higher prevalence of long isoforms (extended or <italic>ext</italic>) over all isoforms (common or <italic>com</italic>), and thus an increased <italic>ext/com</italic> ratio (see FigS4-S5 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore expected a lower <italic>ext/com</italic> ratio in mice lacking CIRBP. However, under baseline conditions [ZT0 and ZT6-NSD], <italic>Cirbp</italic> KO mice did not differ in their <italic>ext/com</italic> ratio from WT littermates (ZT0: liver: (t(8)=1.55, p=0.16; cortex: t(7)=2.0, p=0.09; ZT6-NSD: liver: t(8)=0.19, p=0.85, cortex: t(8)=1.4, p=0.20). Because RBM3 also determines the <italic>ext/com</italic> ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), the lack of an effect of CIRBP on the <italic>ext/com</italic> ratio could be due to compensation by RBM3. We tested this by assessing the effect of sleep deprivation on the <italic>ext/com</italic> ratio as it acutely suppresses both RBM3 and CIRBP. Indeed, sleep deprivation significantly decreased the <italic>ext/com</italic> ratio in the liver in both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>-B; two-way ANOVA, factor sleep deprivation: F(1,16)=20.4, p=0.003). In the cortex of WT mice, however, we observed an unexpected non-significant increase in the <italic>ext/com</italic> ratio, leading to a significant genotype x sleep deprivation interaction (cortex: F(1,16)=5.25, p=0.036).

Previous studies evaluating the effects of sleep deprivation on cortical clock transcripts showed a consistent increase in <italic>Per2</italic> and a decrease in <italic>Dbp</italic> and <italic>Nr1d1</italic>¸whereas the response of <italic>Clock</italic> and <italic>Npas2</italic> varied among studies, but if any, tended to increase after sleep deprivation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mang and Franken, 2015</xref>).

Conform our hypothesis, CIRBP attenuated the sleep-deprivation-induced changes of cortical <italic>Nr1d1</italic>, a transcriptional repressor recently implicated in the sleep homeostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mang et al., 2016</xref>). This observation contrasts with the genotype-dependent changes in <italic>Per2</italic>, because when considering the lower levels of cortical <italic>Per2</italic> in <italic>Cirbp</italic> KO mice at ZT0, the effect of sleep deprivation was amplified in KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>-C, two-way ANOVA, ZT0-ZT6[SD], interaction effect genotype x sleep deprivation: F(1,16)=12.4, p=0.003).

Theta-dominated waking is correlated with activity, most prevalent during the dark phase and sleep deprivation, and characterized by the presence of EEG theta-activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buzsáki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vassalli and Franken, 2017</xref>).

Did the increased locomotor activity in <italic>Cirbp</italic> KO mice relate to changes in brain activity during dark phase theta-dominated waking?</p><p>Although theta-dominated waking EEG in both genotypes showed its characteristic theta activity [6.5–12.0 Hz], subtle differences between genotypes were detected in the spectral composition of the EEG signal. In <italic>Cirbp</italic> KO mice, slow [32–45 Hz] and fast [55–80 Hz] gamma power were both reduced during theta-dominated waking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>-B), and this reduction was observed throughout the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>; and see time course in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that these spectral differences are robust across different lighting conditions, circadian time and throughout the sleep deprivation. In contrast, EEG spectral composition during ‘quiet’ waking (i.e. not theta-dominated waking), was remarkably similar between the two genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This similarity demonstrated that changes in theta-dominated waking EEG spectra were not the result of a general CIRBP effect on the waking EEG, but specifically affected this waking sub-state.</p><p>We also observed a significant decrease in slow and a non-significant increase in fast theta activity in the theta-dominated waking EEG of <italic>Cirbp</italic> KO mice, which hinted at an acceleration of the theta oscillation (lower panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>-B). Indeed, theta-peak frequency in this sub-state in baseline was increased in KO mice (+0.15 Hz), although the significance threshold was not met (t(35)=2.0, p=0.0506). During REM sleep, the other sleep-wake state characterized by distinct theta oscillations, theta-peak frequency was not affected (WT: 7.43 ± 0.06; KO: 7.56 ± 0.05, t(35)=1.7, p=0.10). Increased locomotor activity correlates with increased theta-peak frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jeewajee et al., 2008</xref>). In accordance with this observation, mean log<sub>2</sub>-transformed locomotor activity in each mouse during the dark phase predicted the mean theta-peak frequency during theta-dominated waking at the same time of day (WT and KO combined; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.52, p&lt;0.0001), although this relationship remained significant only in KO mice when assessing the two genotypes separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>-C). However, this genotype-dependent association between theta-peak frequency and locomotor activity was not confirmed by a significant difference in slope between the genotypes (ANCOVA, F(1,29)=3.8, p=0.059).</p><p>Because the group correlation did not account for inter-individual differences in locomotor activity levels, we also assessed the correlations between this variable and theta-peak frequency within individual mice. To test if this association depended on lighting condition, we analyzed the dark and light phases separately (i.e. 24 values per mouse per lighting condition; see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). In the dark phase, this correlation was significant in all but one mouse (a KO), and both the slope and the predictive power of this correlation did not significantly differ between genotypes (slope: WT: 0.15 ± 0.01, KO: 0.14 ± 0.01, t(31)=0.37, p=0.72; R<sup>2</sup>: WT: 0.81 ± 0.03; KO: 0.79 ± 0.04, t-test on the Fisher Z-transformed R<sup>2</sup>-values: t(31)=-0.49, p=0.62). In the light phase, this association was weaker (dark vs. light: paired t-test: slope: t(32)=7.8, p&lt;0.0001; Fisher Z-transformed R<sup>2</sup>-values: t(32)=5.9, p&lt;0.0001), but again did not differ between genotypes (WT: 0.07 ± 0.01, KO: 0.09 ± 0.01, t(31)=1.2, p=0.23; R<sup>2</sup>: WT: 0.59 ± 0.04; KO: 0.67 ± 0.05, t-test on the Fisher Z-transformed R<sup>2</sup>-values: t(31)=1.2, p=0.23). However, during the light phases, when locomotor activity and theta-dominated waking were substantially reduced and estimates of theta-peak frequency less precise, we found more non-significant associations in both genotypes (KO: 3/16; WT: 3/17 mice).

Unexpectedly, <italic>Cirbp</italic> KO mice were more active during the dark phase, and EEG during theta-dominated waking was characterized by a reduction of gamma activity and faster theta oscillations.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Changes in cortical temperature are sleep-wake driven</title><p>When sleep and waking occur at their appropriate circadian times, the changes in both brain and body temperature have a clear 24-hr rhythm and therefore appear as though they are being controlled directly by the circadian clock. However, sleep-wake cycles contribute significantly to those daily changes in temperature. In humans, this involvement is powerfully illustrated by spontaneous desynchrony, where body temperature follows both a circadian and an activity-rest (and presumably, sleep-wake) dependent rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wever, 1979</xref>). The contribution of sleep-wake state to the daily dynamics in body temperature is further supported by forced desynchrony studies, such as (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dijk and Czeisler, 1995</xref>), estimating that ‘masking’ effects of rest-activity and sleep-wake cycles contributed between 30% and 50% to the amplitude of the circadian body temperature rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hiddinga et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dijk et al., 2000</xref>). Not only in humans but also in smaller mammals like rats, a circadian and rest-activity component contribute to the circadian fluctuations in body temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cambras et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, the apparent circadian amplitude of body temperature is amplified when wake and sleep occur at the appropriate phase of the circadian rhythm.</p><p>In contrast to body temperature, brain temperature in rodents is much more determined by sleep-wake state: 80% of its variance can be explained by the sleep-wake distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franken et al., 1992</xref> and this study). Likewise, the sleep-wake-driven changes in brain temperature are still present in arrhythmic animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Edgar et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2005</xref>), pointing to a more important sleep-wake dependency of brain temperature compared to body temperature. Our study assessed the contribution of locomotor activity and found that waking with higher locomotor activity was associated with higher cortical temperature. Although significant, the contribution of locomotor activity to the daily changes in cortical temperature was modest and explained only 2% more of the variance compared to waking alone. Can we optimize the prediction of cortical temperature? A non-linear relationship between sleep-wake state and cortical temperature was assumed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franken et al., 1992</xref>) and could have improved the prediction of our model further. This is supported by the residuals from the complete model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), which exhibit under baseline conditions, a circadian distribution, whereas during sleep deprivation they remain increased as during the dark phase. Thus, the model overestimates cortical temperature during periods with little waking (light phase) and underestimates it when waking is dominant (dark phase and sleep deprivation), suggesting a non-linear relationship between these two variables.</p><p>It is important to consider that the influence of locomotor activity on cortical temperature is likely affected by the type of activity; for example, rats using a running wheel can increase their brain temperature by 2°C within 30 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fuller et al., 1998</xref>). In addition, exercise in humans leads to an increase in (proxies of) brain temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nybo et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, although in our study the effect of locomotor activity on cortical temperature was modest compared to the effect of waking, these contributions likely differ depending on the type of physical activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Locomotor activity-dependent and -independent changes in waking characteristics</title><p>Little is known about the role of CIRBP in neuronal and behavioral functioning. It was therefore unexpected that <italic>Cirbp</italic> KO mice were not only more active during the dark phase but also showed changes in neuronal oscillations during theta-dominated waking: a reduction in low- and high gamma power and an increase in theta-peak frequency. Because running speed correlates positively with hippocampal theta-peak frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jeewajee et al., 2008</xref>), and our measured theta activity is mainly of hippocampal origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buzsáki, 2006</xref>), we indeed can relate this increase in speed of theta oscillations to increased locomotor activity in KO mice. In contrast to theta-peak frequency, the literature has not consistently reported on a relation between a general decrease in gamma power during active waking and its relation to locomotor activity. Some studies have found that increased speed of movement and gamma power are related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Furth et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Niell and Stryker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vinck et al., 2015</xref>), whereas others found that this association is only present in higher gamma frequencies [&gt;60 Hz] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, it is unclear if locomotor activity relates to changes in gamma power. However, there is a clear increase in high gamma power specifically during the sleep deprivation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), as noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vassalli and Franken, 2017</xref>). This increase was present in both genotypes suggesting that while KO mice have a reduced capacity to produce fast gamma activity, sleep deprivation is still able to activate their fast-gamma circuitry. These results, together with the observation that during the light phase decreased gamma power was still present at a time of day when locomotor activity did not significantly differ, argues against an association between the decreased gamma activity and increased locomotor activity in <italic>Cirbp</italic> KO mice.</p><p>Interestingly, gamma oscillations are associated with a variety of cognitive processes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bosman et al., 2014</xref>). This is further supported by associations between behavioral impairments and changes in gamma power. For example, mice with abnormal interneurons are impaired at the behavioral level (<italic>e.g.</italic> lack of cognitive flexibility) and have a reduction in task-evoked gamma power in their EEG. Pharmacological stimulation of inhibitory GABA-neurons augmented power in the gamma band and rescued the behavioral phenotype of the mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the hippocampus, gamma-theta coupling, that is the occurrence of gamma oscillations at a specific phase of the theta oscillation, has been suggested to aid processes underlying memory (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colgin, 2015</xref>). Because CIRBP reduces theta-peak frequency and increases EEG power in the gamma bands, further experiments could address if <italic>Cirbp</italic> KO mice have altered phase coherence between these two frequency bands. Together with the postulated function of gamma power in cognitive flexibility, it would be also be of interest to assess if the EEG phenotypes we observed in <italic>Cirbp</italic> KO mice are associated with cognitive abnormalities.</p><p>Several aspects of waking that appeared to differ between <italic>Cirbp</italic> KO and WT mice under baseline dark conditions but were non-significant, reached significance during the recovery dark phase. For example, during the baseline, <italic>Cirbp</italic> KO mice were 4% more awake and spent 13% more time in theta-dominated waking compared to their WT littermates. These genotype differences increased to 8% and 20%, respectively, during recovery. Similarly, theta-peak frequency and its genotype-dependent association with locomotor activity reached significance during the recovery. This suggests that sleep deprivation amplified genotypic differences. Other sleep deprivation studies found evidence for similar phenomena, where sleep disturbance can amplify molecular and behavioral phenotypes of Alzheimer’s mouse models (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Musiek and Holtzman, 2016</xref>) and sensitivity to pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sutton and Opp, 2014</xref>). Our data indicates that sleep deprivation has a comparable effect on a number of wake-related phenotypes in <italic>Cirbp</italic> KO mice. It would be interesting to determine the dynamics of this change; that is if they are reversible, and if a second sleep deprivation could augment genotypic differences further.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>CIRBP adjusts clock-gene e xpression and REM-sleep recovery following sleep deprivation</title><p>CIRBP modulated the cortical response to sleep deprivation in the expression of three out of the five quantified clock genes.

For example, <italic>Npas2</italic> KO mice showed a reduced increase in <italic>Per2</italic> expression in the forebrain after sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Franken et al., 2006</xref>), while <italic>Cry1,2</italic> double-KO mice display a larger increase in <italic>Per2</italic> expression after sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wisor et al., 2008</xref>).

After sleep deprivation, the cortical expression of <italic>Nr1d1</italic>, which we recently discovered to be of importance for the sleep homeostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mang et al., 2016</xref>), was attenuated in <italic>Cirbp</italic> KO mice, whereas the expression of two other clock genes, <italic>Per2</italic> and <italic>Clock</italic>, was amplified. Thus, the sleep-deprivation-induced changes in clock-gene expression are modulated by CIRBP, but not always in the anticipated direction.</p><p>A large body of evidence has shown that clock genes are crucial for metabolism (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Panda, 2016</xref>). This is supported by the observation that disturbance of clock-gene expression, through for example genetic manipulations in mice or shift work in humans, can lead to the development of metabolic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rudic et al., 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Karlsson et al., 2001</xref>). Not only sleeping at the wrong time, but also sleeping too little or of poor quality can induce disturbed metabolic state both in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barf et al., 2010</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Copinschi et al., 2014</xref>). Because sleep loss affects clock-gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Franken, 2013</xref>), we propose that this could represent a common pathway through which both sleep and circadian disturbances lead to metabolic pathologies. It is thus of importance to determine the pathways through which a disturbed sleep-wake distribution affects clock-gene expression. We show that temperature and CIRBP contribute to this process, and we identified the expression of <italic>Nr1d1</italic> as one of the genes affected by CIRBP. Genetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delezie et al., 2012</xref>) and pharmacological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Solt et al., 2012</xref>) studies have shown that this transcriptional repressor is important for healthy metabolic functioning. Further experiments could address the metabolic consequences of the attenuated response in <italic>Nr1d1</italic> to sleep loss.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M.

The surgery took place under deep xylazine/ketamine anesthesia supplemented with isoflurane (1%) when necessary (for details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mang and Franken, 2012</xref>). Briefly, six gold-plated screws (diameter 1.1 mm) were screwed bilaterally into the skull over the frontal and parietal cortices. Two screws served as EEG electrodes and the remaining four anchored the electrode-connector assembly to the skull. As EMG electrodes, two gold wires were inserted into the neck musculature. Of all EEG/EMG implanted mice, 8 KO and 9 WT mice were implanted with a thermistor (serie P20AAA102M, General Electrics (currently Thermometrics), Northridge, CA) which was placed on top of the right cortex (2.5 mm lateral to the midline, 2.5 mm posterior to bregma). The EEG and EMG electrodes (and thermistor) were soldered to a connector and cemented to the skull. Mice recovered from surgery during 5–7 days before they were connected to the recording cables in their home cage for habituation, which was at least 6 days prior to the experiment.

Wakefulness was characterized by EEG activity of mixed frequency and low amplitude and variable muscle tone. NREM sleep was defined by synchronous activity in the delta frequency range (1–4 Hz), and low and stable muscle tone. REM sleep was characterized by regular theta oscillations (6–9 Hz) with low EMG activity. Waking was further differentiated into ‘quiet waking’ and ‘theta-dominated waking’ (TDW). Theta-dominated waking was determined based on the relative importance of power in the 6.5 to 12.0 Hz range to the overall power in the EEG of an artefact-free epoch scored as wakefulness, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vassalli and Franken (2017)</xref>. We refer to waking that is not classified as theta-dominated waking as ‘quiet’ waking. Epochs containing EEG artefacts were marked according to the state in which they occurred and excluded from EEG spectral analysis but included in the sleep-wake state analyses. During the 4-day recording, 7.0 ± 0.9%, 2.1 ± 0.3% and 2.5 ± 0.2% of the epochs were scored as an artefact in waking, NREM, and REM sleep, respectively, and this did not differ between genotypes (t-tests, t(35)=1.77, p=0.09; t(35)=0.64, p=0.53; t(35)= 0.99, p=0.33, respectively).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Analysis of cortical temperature</title><p>The raw cortical temperature data showed unexpected variation. Therefore, we inspected the inter-individual variation in daily amplitude and absolute cortical temperature levels. The latter was determined in two ways: i) by averaging cortical temperature during the last five hours of sleep deprivation, thus minimizing the sleep-wake state incurred differences in cortical temperature and ii) by averaging cortical temperature during the 12 hr baseline light phase. These measures were highly correlated (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99; p&lt;0.0001). Variation in the daily amplitude was quantified by averaging the difference between the highest and lowest hourly mean of cortical temperature of each of the 2 baseline days. No effect of genotype on absolute average cortical temperature or amplitude was detected (t-test, t(12)=0.61, p=0.55; t(12)=-0.63, p=0.54, respectively). Two mice (one of each genotype) exhibited a ca. 2-fold reduction in amplitude together with 2°C higher values during the sleep deprivation relative to the other mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, pink symbols). Therefore, we excluded these two mice from subsequent cortical temperature analysis. Three other mice (2 WT and 1 KO) showed normal amplitude but overall lower absolute values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, blue symbols). We corrected for this difference by raising their cortical temperature values by the difference between the cortical temperature reached in each of these three mice during the sleep deprivation to the average cortical temperature reached over the same recording period in the remaining nine mice. Of note, most of our cortical temperature analyses focus on its relative sleep-wake-dependent changes, which are not affected by differences in absolute cortical temperature values. During the recording, one KO mouse and one WT mouse had random fluctuations of cortical temperature beyond physiological reach and were therefore excluded from analysis involving the daily dynamics of cortical temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In the recovery, a KO mouse was excluded due to aberrant high cortical temperature that could not be accounted for by the sleep-wake distribution, leaving 6 WT and 5 KO mice for analyses involving REC1 and REC2.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43400.031</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Assessment of amplitude and absolute values of cortical temperatures.</title><p>Two outliers were detected (pink), whereas three others were corrected for their low values (blue).</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig7sdata1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43400.032</object-id><label>Figure 7—source data 1.</label><caption><title>The daily amplitude of cortical temperature and cortical temperature reached during sleep deprivation.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-43400-fig7-data1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-43400-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Because visualization of all 4 s epochs occurring in 24-hr day is not compatible with the resolution of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>-A, sleep-wake states were averaged per minute and assigned to either wake, NREM or REM sleep. Because REM sleep occurs less and in shorter bouts than waking and NREM sleep, this state is slightly underrepresented in the hypnogram of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>-A. Cortical temperature values were averaged per minute.</p><p>We analyzed cortical temperature 1.5 min before and after sleep-wake state transitions (i.e. transitioning from wake to NREM sleep, NREM to REM sleep, REM sleep to wake and NREM sleep to wake). A sleep-wake state transition was selected when the state immediately before and after the transition lasted at least eight epochs (i.e. &gt;32 s). With this criterion, an average of 38 wake to NREM sleep, 101 NREM sleep to REM sleep, 28 REM sleep to wake and 32 NREM sleep to wake transitions per mouse during the two baseline days were detected. The profile of cortical temperature changes before and after the transition was constructed by calculating temperature relative to the mean temperature at a given sleep-wake state transition (i.e. the average of temperature in the epoch before and after the sleep-wake state transition). We subsequently constructed an individuals’ average cortical temperature profile for each sleep-wake state transition. For this average, at least 10 traces were contributing at a given time point to prevent that average individual temperature profiles were based on a few transitions only. Thus, the further from the sleep-wake state transition, the less epochs contributed to the average individual cortical temperature profile. One WT mouse exhibited an extreme drop in cortical temperature (−0.2°C in a 4 s epoch) after the transition from NREM sleep to wake in its average cortical temperature trace, but not in other sleep-wake state transitions. We attributed this observation to a technical artefact and therefore this mouse was excluded from the NREM sleep to wake and wake to NREM sleep transitions. No transitions from waking to REM sleep, nor from NREM to REM sleep are depicted because these events are relatively rare and short and were therefore not detected with our strict criteria.</p><p>The residuals of the correlation between waking and cortical temperature exhibited a circadian pattern under baseline conditions. We visualized the properties of this pattern further by fitting a sinewave through the data (Prism, non-linear regression; sine-wave with non-zero baseline; least squares fit).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Analysis of EEG based on sleep-wake state</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, all mice (20 WT and 17 KO) were included in the analyses based on the EEG data. Spectral content of the EEG within sleep-wake states was calculated as follows. To account for inter-individual differences in overall EEG power, EEG spectra were expressed as a percentage of an individual reference value calculated as the total EEG power across 0.75–45 Hz and all sleep-wake states in the 48 hr baseline. This reference value was weighted so that for all mice the relative contribution of the three sleep-wake states (wake, NREM and REM sleep) to this reference value was equal.</p><p>Theta-peak frequency was calculated by determining the frequency at which power density peaks per 4 s epoch and subsequently averaged per individual. Power density peaks were quantified in the 6.5 to 12.0 Hz range and the 5.5 to 12.0 Hz range for theta-dominated waking and REM sleep, respectively.</p><p>Time course analysis of EEG delta power (i.e. the mean EEG power density in the 0.75–4.0 Hz range in NREM sleep) during baseline and after sleep deprivation was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Franken et al., 1999</xref>), and similar to the analysis of locomotor activity per unit of waking. The light periods of baseline days 1 and 2, and recovery day 2 were divided into 12 percentiles, the recovery day 1 light period (ZT6–12) into eight sections, and all dark periods into six sections. The timing of these percentiles was based on the prevalence of NREM sleep. EEG delta power values in NREM sleep were averaged within each percentile and then expressed relative to the mean value reached in the last 4 hr of the two main rest periods in baseline between ZT8–12. This reference was selected because delta power reaches lowest values at this time of the day and is least influenced by differences in prior history of sleep and wakefulness (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Franken et al., 1999</xref>). In the time course of NREM delta power, one mouse (KO) demonstrated a strong decrease over the course of the experiment which could not be attributed to changes in the sleep-wake distribution. 9 out of the 12 delta power values during the light phase of recovery day 2 in this mouse were outliers (MAD outlier test, for details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leys et al., 2013</xref>).

As an estimate of the lower asymptote, the intersection of the distribution of delta power values in NREM sleep with REM sleep was taken. At the start of the simulation, an iteration through the first 24 hr was performed with S<sub>0</sub> = 150 at t = 0.

This change correlated well with the day-to-day changes in total spectral power in the EEG calculated across all sleep-wake states in baseline day 1 and 2, and recovery day 2 (Pearson correlation: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.70, p&lt;0.0001; n = 36).

RNA quantity (NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer; Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, NC, USA) and integrity (Fragment Analyzer, Advanced Analytical, Ankeny, IA, USA) was measured and verified for each sample. 1000 ng of purified total RNA was reverse-transcribed in 20 μL using a mix of First-strand buffer, DTT 0.1M, random primers 0.25 μg/μl, dNTP 10 mM, RNAzin Plus RNase Inhibitor and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Zug, Switzerland) according to manufacturers’ procedures. The cDNA was diluted 10 times in Tris 10 mM pH 8.0, and 2 μL of the diluted cDNA was amplified in a 10 μL TaqMan reaction in technical triplicates on an ABI PRISM HT 7900 detection system (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, Zug, Switzerland). Cycler conditions were: 2 min at 50°C, 10 min at 95°C followed by 45 cycles at 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min. Standard curves were calculated to determine the amplification efficiency (E).

The threshold of significance was set at p=0.05, and all statistics were solely performed on biological replicates. To be more specific, our RT-qPCR data stems from five biological replicates, whereas amplification of cDNA from one biological replicate is performed in three technical replicates. Deviations from the mean are representing standard error of the mean. The distribution of the locomotor activity data was normalized by a log<sub>2</sub> transformation on the hourly values, allowing for subsequent parametric analyses on the relationship between cortical temperature and locomotor activity as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Time course data were analyzed by one- and two-way repeated measures (RM) analysis of variance (ANOVA) with as factors ‘time’ and ‘genotype’ (GT). Upon significance, post-hoc Fisher LSD tests were computed. Differences between baseline and recovery values within genotype were computed by paired t-tests. EEG spectra were also analyzed by one- and two-way RM ANOVA with as factors ‘time’ or ‘frequency’ and ‘genotype. When genotype or its interaction with time or frequency reached significance, post-hoc t-tests were computed. The above-mentioned analyses were all performed in Prism.</p><p>Correlation coefficients of linear regression were calculated in Prism over all hourly values of locomotor activity, cortical temperature and waking per genotype (96 per mice). To compare slopes of regression lines between genotypes, an ANCOVA was applied based on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zar, 1984</xref>) and run in Prism. To quantify the contribution of waking and locomotor activity independent from each other to cortical temperature, a partial correlation was performed (R software; package ‘ppcor’, function pcor.test). Mixed model analysis was performed with factors locomotor activity (log<sub>2</sub> transformed), waking, and genotype (R packages ‘lme4’, ‘lmer’, ‘lmerTest’, and’ MuMIn’). Model1 quantified the predictive power of waking, Model2 of waking and locomotor activity per unit of waking (LMA/Waking) and Model3 of waking, LMA/Waking and its interaction, to predict cortical temperature. Predictive power of models was compared with Chi-squared tests by assessing the statistical significance in the reduction of residual sum of squares between two models ordered by complexity; that is Model1 was compared to Model2, and upon significance, Model2 was compared to Model3. Goodness-of-fit was assessed by the marginal R-squared (R<sup>2</sup><sub>m</sub>) which explains the effect of the fixed factors only, and the conditional R-squared (R<sup>2</sup><sub>c</sub>), which considers the individual variance as well and is therefore more biological relevant. Hence, in the results section only the R<sup>2</sup><sub>c</sub> values are reported.</p><p>For the molecular data, the qPCR NRQ values were log<sub>2</sub>-transformed to normalize the distribution. Genotype differences at ZT0 were tested with a t-test. The effect of sleep deprivation and genotype at ZT6 was assessed by two-way ANOVA with post-hoc Fisher LSD tests upon significance.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cold Inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRBP) adjusts clock gene expression and REM sleep recovery after sleep deprivation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Louis J Ptáček as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ying-Hui Fu (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper by Hoekstra and colleagues studies sleep-wake regulation in <italic>Cirbp</italic>-deficient mice showing reduced REM sleep recovery after sleep deprivation. Data are correlated with experiments on cortical temperature regulation by sleep. The authors suggest that sleep loss-induced increases in cortical temp may down-regulate <italic>Cirbp</italic> and affect clock regulation in this tissue, thus modulating SD recovery responses.</p><p>The sleep and temperature analyses are very well done and the correlation between cortical temp and sleep states is striking. It is very interesting that <italic>Cirbp</italic> loss affects sleep deprivation responses, but not baseline sleep regulation. In addition, it appears to have an unexpected effect on locomotor activity.</p><p>The gene expression data and the functional implication of the circadian clock in this context is less well worked out. Importantly, it remains somewhat unclear by which mechanism <italic>Cirbp</italic> regulates clock function in the cortex and to which extent the clock machinery is mediating the effects of <italic>Cirbp</italic> loss in the mutant mice on sleep deprivation responses.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 2/3: I think it is very important to show the KO data for baseline sleep regulation. How are state transients reflected in cortical temperature? Considering the postulated temp-<italic>Cirbp</italic>-clock-sleep axis, would one not expect differences between WTs and KOs already under these (non-SD) conditions?</p><p>2) In Figure 4, they show that in the KO mice, that there are changes in expression of several clock genes and they imply they are all regulated by CIRBP. Since CLOCK and PER are transcriptional regulators, it is possible that only one is regulated by CIRBP and that the effects on other genes are indirect (through the clock). This should be discussed.</p><p>The findings on clock gene regulation by SD are puzzling and in part contradict the results expected from the Schibler paper (Morf et al., 2012). This suggests a different mechanism of <italic>Cirbp</italic>-clock interaction in the cortex compared to fibroblasts. I think this is a critical point to understand the KO phenotype. Considering the differential responses of <italic>Clock</italic> and <italic>Rev-Erb</italic>, one could evaluate their contribution to SD responses by testing respective mouse mutants (and, possibly, double mutants).</p><p>3) Figure 6: Also, for locomotor activity, the specific contribution of the clock to <italic>Cirb</italic>-mediated effects should be tested.</p><p>In Figure 6A, it would be interesting to phenotype these mice in a skeletal photoperiod. Since they are showing differences in sleep homeostasis, it is possible that activity is being 'masked' during the light phase. What is the intensity of light in these experiments?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43400.038</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 2/3: I think it is very important to show the KO data for baseline sleep regulation.

We have now included the cortical temperature changes across sleep-wake state transitions in KO mice in Figure 2B, and added a supplementary figure to Figure 3A showing the time course of cortical temperature in both genotypes under baseline conditions (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Both analyses demonstrate that lack of CIRBP does not affect the strong relationship between sleep-wake state and cortical temperature. Although <italic>Cirbp</italic> expression is known to depend on temperature changes in a variety of tissues, we are not aware of any reports suggesting that CIRBP is implicated in the regulation of temperature. This is consistent with the lack of a genotype effect on temperature changes at sleep-wake transitions, and its dynamics across the day.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 4, they show that in the KO mice, that there are changes in expression of several clock genes and they imply they are all regulated by CIRBP.

We now have specifically addressed this issue in the Discussion section ‘CIRBP adjusts clock gene expression and REM sleep recovery following sleep deprivation’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The findings on clock gene regulation by SD are puzzling and in part contradict the results expected from the Schibler paper (Morf et al., 2012).

Considering the differential responses of Clock and Rev-Erb, one could evaluate their contribution to SD responses by testing respective mouse mutants (and, possibly, double mutants).</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, some aspects of our results do not follow our straightforward “sleep deprivation-temperature-CIRBP-clock genes” hypothesis that is central to our manuscript and which was based on the <italic>in vitro</italic> findings of Schibler and colleagues in fibroblasts published in Science. While the <italic>Rev-Erbα</italic> results do confirm our hypothesis, we agree that the increase in the sleep-deprivation induced changes in <italic>Clock</italic> and <italic>Per2</italic> expression in <italic>Cirbp</italic> KO mice is puzzling. In his recent review (Schibler et al., 2015), Ueli Schibler mentions unpublished data indicating that the amplitude of <italic>in vivo</italic> clock-gene rhythms in the liver of <italic>Cirbp</italic> KO mice was, surprisingly, increased (see legend of Figure 3 in that review). With the reviewer, he suggested that CIRBP’s effects on clock genes might be cell-type or tissue specific. In light of our results in the cortex, that go in a similar direction as those obtained in liver, it seems, however, that differences might be related to <italic>in vitro</italic> versus <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions instead. We have discussed this important issue in the section “Other mechanisms linking sleep-wake state to clock gene expression”.</p><p>“We […] hypothesized that some of the sleep deprivation-induced changes in clock gene expression occur through CIRBP” (quoted from the Introduction). In the past we have identified other pathways that contribute to the sleep-deprivation induced changes in clock-gene expression such as corticosterone signalling (Mongrain et al., 2010). Also lack of one of more clock genes affects the sleep-deprivation incurred changes in the expression of other clock genes (reviewed in Franken, 2013). As to testing <italic>Clock</italic> and <italic>Rev-Erbα</italic> mutant mice specifically, the absence of <italic>Rev-Erbα</italic>, a transcriptional repressor, led to the expected increase in the cortical expression of other clock genes (<italic>Bmal1</italic>, <italic>Clock</italic>, and <italic>Npas2</italic>) in <italic>Rev-Erbα</italic> KO mice. The cortical molecular response to sleep deprivation remained, however, unaffected (Mang et al., 2016). We did not quantify clock-gene expression in <italic>Clock</italic> KO mice but did so in KO mice for the perhaps more relevant (for the forebrain) <italic>Clock</italic>-paralog <italic>Npas2</italic> (Franken et al., 2006). We found that the sleep-deprivation induced increase in <italic>Per2</italic> expression in the brain of <italic>Npas2</italic> KO mice was significantly reduced. Although the latter finding demonstrates that the clock-gene circuitry can contribute to aspects of the sleep-deprivation induced changes in clock-gene expression, it has become evident that clock genes, especially <italic>Per2</italic>, can respond to a variety of systemic cues including stress, feeding, and, importantly, temperature, notably in the absence of a functional clock-gene circuitry (for reviews see Franken, 2013 and Schibler et al., 2015). With the CIRBP-temperature axis we have continued to investigate the influence of these systemic cues on the clock-gene circuitry and the collective data increasingly favour a scenario in which sleep-wake behaviour (through e.g. temperature, corticosterone, and feeding) drives rhythms is clock-gene expression in tissues peripheral to the SCN. We have addressed these issues in the section “Other mechanisms linking sleep-wake state to clock gene expression”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 6: Also, for locomotor activity, the specific contribution of the clock to Cirb-mediated effects should be tested.</p><p>In Figure 6A, it would be interesting to phenotype these mice in a skeletal photoperiod. Since they are showing differences in sleep homeostasis, it is possible that activity is being 'masked' during the light phase. What is the intensity of light in these experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>Light was provided by overhead fluorescent tubes yielding an intensity of 70-90 lux at the cage-floor level. This information has now been further detailed in the Materials and methods.</p><p>In two cohorts of mice (WT n=5, KO n=7), we quantified circadian rhythms in locomotor activity under constant-dark (DD) conditions. The estimates of circadian tau mentioned in the manuscript (23.8h in both genotypes) were based on this sub-population of mice. We used this dataset to address the issue of masking by light by comparing, within the same individuals, mean levels of locomotor activity obtained in the rest phase under LD12:12 with the levels reached during the rest phase (or ‘rho’) under the ensuing DD (averages over 10 days in each lighting condition). This analysis did not reveal any evidence of a different response to light between genotypes (see Author response table 1). The sleep homeostatic phenotype we reported on concerned REM sleep recovery that was less efficient in KO mice. This REM sleep deficit was, however, most pronounced in the initial hours of the dark phase. For these reasons we do not think that this homeostatic phenotype can be attributed to (differences in) masking by light.</p><p><bold>Author response table 1</bold>: Locomotor activity counts during the rest phase under LD12:12 and DD conditions (mean ± SEM)</p><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable2" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><bold>LD12:12</bold></td><td valign="top"><bold>DD</bold> </td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold><italic>Cirbp</italic> KO</bold> </td><td valign="top">34.0 ± 5.2</td><td valign="top">38.5 ± 4.2</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold><italic>Cirbp WT</italic> </bold></td><td valign="top">35.5 ± 5.5</td><td valign="top">35.5 ± 5.9</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>2-way rANOVA w/ factors ‘Genotype’ (<italic>P</italic> = 0.91), ‘Light’ (<italic>P</italic> = 0.52), and their interaction (<italic>P</italic> = 0.52)</p></body></sub-article></article>
