Here we describe a strategy for increasing the efficiency of HDR in cells by using a chromatin donor template instead of a naked DNA donor template. The use of chromatin, which is the natural form of DNA in the nucleus, increases the frequency of HDR-edited clones as well as homozygous editing. In addition, transfection of chromatin results in negligible cytotoxicity. These findings suggest that a chromatin donor template should be useful for a wide range of HDR applications such as the precise insertion or replacement of DNA fragments that contain the coding regions of genes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Genome editing is a powerful tool used across a wide range of biomedical research. There are several different techniques used, depending on the type of edit being made, and one known as homology-directed repair – or HDR for short – is a common technique for precisely inserting large sections of DNA, such as those needed to make desired proteins in cells.</p><p>HDR takes advantage of the cell’s mechanisms for repairing damage to DNA if both strands of the DNA double helix are broken. The mechanism relies on a DNA template to stitch the strands back together. To insert or replace a new DNA sequence, scientists can add a customized piece of DNA of their choosing to the cell so that it might be incorporated into the genome. However, HDR is not very efficient, and the success rate is often less than a few percent.</p><p>In HDR gene editing, the DNA template is typically added as purified, or ‘naked’, DNA. However, the natural form of DNA in cells, known as chromatin, is where the DNA helix is wrapped around a cluster of proteins known as histones. Cruz-Becerra and Kadonaga tested the idea that DNA in the form of chromatin might be more effective as a template for HDR than naked DNA.</p><p>The two approaches were compared to see which was better at inserting a sequence at three different locations in the genome of lab-grown human cells. In these experiments, the chromatin templates were 2.3- to 7.4-fold more efficient than the naked DNA. Also, the DNA in human cells is organized as pairs of chromosomes, and chromatin was better than naked DNA for editing both copies of the chromosome pairs rather than only one of them. In addition, the chromatin is potentially less toxic to the cells. Cruz-Becerra and Kadonaga hope that this will be useful for increasing the success rate of HDR experiments and potentially other methods of gene editing in the future.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>homology-directed repair</kwd><kwd>precise genome editing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM118060</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kadonaga</surname><given-names>James T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Precise genome editing by homology-directed repair occurs more efficiently with a chromatin donor template than with a naked DNA donor template.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability to manipulate genomes precisely is revolutionizing the biological sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Doudna, 2020</xref>). Of particular utility is the modification or insertion of customized DNA sequences at a specific genomic location by homology-directed repair (HDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jasin and Rothstein, 2013</xref>). For genome engineering in cells, HDR typically involves the generation of a specifically targeted DNA double-strand break (DSB) in the presence of a homologous DNA donor template that contains the desired sequence to be modified or inserted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Urnov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bedell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Pickar-Oliver and Gersbach, 2019</xref>).</p><p>A key challenge in successful genome editing has been the low efficiency of HDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carroll, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Harrison et al., 2014</xref>). For the generation of specific alterations in a short stretch of DNA (&lt;50 nt), recently developed techniques such as base editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rees and Liu, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Molla and Yang, 2019</xref>) and prime editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anzalone et al., 2019</xref>) have been shown to be highly effective. In addition, for the imprecise insertion of larger DNA fragments, homology-independent approaches can be used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">He et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Suzuki et al., 2016</xref>). These powerful methods cannot, however, be used for the precise insertion or replacement of &gt;50 bp DNA fragments, such as those containing the coding regions of genes. For such applications, we considered a different strategy for increasing the efficiency of HDR in cells. Based on our previous observation that homologous strand pairing, an early step in HDR, occurs more efficiently with a chromatin donor template than with a plain (naked) DNA donor template in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexiadis and Kadonaga, 2002</xref>), we postulated that HDR in cells might similarly be more efficient with a chromatin relative to a naked DNA donor template.</p><p>In this study, we tested this idea by comparing the efficiency of HDR with chromatin versus naked DNA donor templates in conjunction with DSBs generated by the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system. We found that the overall HDR efficiency as well as the frequency of homozygous editing is enhanced by the use of a chromatin donor template relative to a DNA donor template. We thus envision that a chromatin donor template, which resembles the natural form of DNA in the nucleus, could be widely used to increase the success of HDR-mediated applications, particularly those that involve the targeted insertion of DNA fragments such as the coding regions of genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To ascertain whether the use of chromatin donor templates affects the efficiency of HDR in cells, we reconstituted three DNA donor templates (corresponding to the human <italic>GAPDH</italic>, <italic>RAB11A</italic>, and <italic>ACTB</italic> loci) into chromatin and tested the relative efficiencies of the targeted insertion of the GFP coding sequence with chromatin versus naked DNA versions of these templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>).

With standard CRISPR-Cas9 methodology and human MCF10A cells (non-tumorigenic epithelial cells derived from human mammary glands), we observed that the use of a chromatin donor template relative to a naked DNA donor template resulted in a 7.4-, 2.9-, and 2.3-fold increase (average of three biological replicates) in the directed insertion of GFP sequences at the <italic>GAPDH</italic>, <italic>RAB11A</italic>, and <italic>ACTB</italic> loci, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B, C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>). Thus, at three different loci (<italic>GAPDH</italic>, <italic>RAB11A</italic>, and <italic>ACTB</italic>) in human MCF10A cells, there was a higher efficiency of HDR-mediated GFP insertion with chromatin donor templates than with naked DNA donor templates.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The efficiency of HDR-mediated gene editing with CRISPR-Cas9 is higher with chromatin donor templates than with DNA donor templates.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic outline of the workflow in the CRISPR-Cas9-mediated editing experiments with DNA or chromatin donor templates. The HDR-mediated insertion of the GFP sequence was directed to different loci as follows. Plasmid DNA containing the coding sequence for Cas9-T2A-mCherry and a target-specific sgRNA sequence was co-transfected into different human cell lines with the corresponding HDR donor template as either DNA or chromatin. At 24 hr post-transfection, mCherry-positive cells were enriched by FACS and cultured for an additional 10 days. The expression of GFP was then analyzed by flow cytometry, and individual GFP-positive cells were sorted by FACS to generate independent clones. To determine whether there was partial or complete conversion of the multiple chromosomes containing the target genes, genomic DNA samples from each of several independent GFP-positive clones were analyzed by PCR. In addition, the precise integration of the GFP sequence at the target sites in representative edited clones was confirmed by DNA sequencing.

This low toxicity of chromatin to cells could be useful for HDR applications in which there is low cell viability after transfection.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we show that the efficiency of HDR-mediated gene editing can be increased by using a chromatin donor template instead of a naked DNA donor template. Why is chromatin more effective as an HDR donor template than naked DNA? We suggest that chromatin, as the natural form of DNA in the eukaryotic nucleus, is the preferred substrate (relative to naked DNA) for the factors that mediate homologous recombination in cells. In previous biochemical studies, we and others found that eukaryotic Rad51 and Rad54, but not bacterial RecA, can mediate homologous strand pairing, an early step in HDR, with a chromatin donor template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexiadis and Kadonaga, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jaskelioff et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, we observed that homologous strand pairing occurs more efficiently with a chromatin donor template than with a naked DNA donor template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexiadis and Kadonaga, 2002</xref>). Hence, the new findings on HDR with chromatin donor templates in cells are consistent with the results of the earlier biochemical studies on homologous strand exchange.</p><p>In general, a wide range of efficiencies of HDR has been observed in different cell types and with different methodologies. A common factor in these HDR experiments has been, however, the use of a non-chromatin donor template. In this work, we sought to focus specifically on directly comparing the relative efficiencies of HDR with chromatin versus naked DNA donor templates. In these experiments, we consistently observed a higher efficiency of HDR with chromatin relative to naked DNA. These effects include the increased efficiency of targeted insertion of GFP sequences in both loci of a diploid chromosome and in all loci of a tetraploid chromosome. These findings therefore suggest that the use of a chromatin donor template instead of a naked DNA donor template would be a broadly useful strategy for the precise insertion or replacement of DNA sequences via HDR with different methods. Moreover, transfection of chromatin donor templates, which can be simply prepared by salt dialysis methodology with purified DNA and core histones, does not affect cell viability. Thus, current methods for HDR can be easily adapted to include chromatin donor templates in place of their naked DNA counterparts.</p><p>In this regard, it is notable that we reconstituted chromatin by using native core histones from <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. These histones contain an undefined broad mixture of covalent histone modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Levenstein and Kadonaga, 2002</xref>). Because the core histones and their modifications are highly conserved throughout eukaryotes, it seems likely that similar results would be obtained with core histones from other sources. It is possible, however, that the magnitude of enhancement of HDR by chromatin could be further increased by variation of the core histone sequences and modifications.</p><p>In conclusion, although there are excellent techniques for the alteration of short (&lt;50 bp) stretches of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rees and Liu, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Molla and Yang, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anzalone et al., 2019</xref>), there remains a need for increasing the efficiency of the specific insertion or replacement of longer DNA segments that may contain sequences such as the coding regions of genes. We anticipate that chromatin donor templates might be particularly useful for such applications. In addition, we expect that many new gene editing techniques will be developed in the future, and that some of these methods will benefit from the use of chromatin donor templates. Furthermore, the low toxicity of chromatin to cells may be useful for many current and future methods. There is considerable potential to the use of the natural form of the donor template in gene editing experiments. It is our hope that these findings will advance the utility of precise genome editing in basic, translational, and clinical research.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>To ensure the reproducibility of the results, at least two biological replicates were performed for each experimental condition.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Wolf-Dietrich Heyer as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Lieber (Reviewer #2); Jeremy Stark (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The targeted integration of DNA sequences constitutes an important aspect of gene editing. Current techniques are quite inefficient, and the authors found that chromatinized templates enhance targeting efficiencies at three different gene loci. In addition, the authors report an increase in bi-allelic targeting events using chromatinized templates. These observations constitute a critical technical advance that will facilitate certain gene targeting experiments.</p><p>The experiment involves co-transfection of the chromatin donor, along with plasmids expressing Cas9 and single guide RNAs. A few different targeted loci are tested in MCF10A cells, which is an appropriate model cell line, and one is tested in HeLa cells. The donor has a promoterless GFP, so homologous integration should cause GFP+ cells. As well, through isolation of GFP+ clones, targeted integration is confirmed, and an apparent increase in homozygous targeting is shown. Altogether, the approaches are appropriate to test the hypothesis that a chromatin donor causes a greater frequency of homologous recombination, compared to a protein-free donor. These findings will likely be of broad interest, however, there are issues of rigor and controls that should be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is a concern with the limited evidence of reproducibility. Throughout the manuscript, it appears that representative n=3 experiments are shown, without statistics. In the Materials and methods section, it is stated that 2 biological replicates were performed, but the data do not appear to be shown. All the frequency data for experiments that had working controls should be shown. The raw HR frequencies will vary between experiments, which is fine, but such data should be shown. In particular, in each figure, for the flow cytometry frequency data, data from additional replicates should be shown, and in the main figure. This will give the reader the sense of variability among experiments for the raw data, as well as any variability in the fold-effect for the chromatin DNA template at individual targeted sites.</p><p>2) There are no statistics in the manuscript. In addition to statistics for the effect of the chromatin template for frequencies of GFP+ cells, for the clonal analysis, an appropriate statistical test should be employed for homozygous vs. heterozygous targeting.</p><p>3) The nature of the chromatin should be spelled out at the beginning of the Results section.

We now clearly indicate in the revised manuscript that we performed three biological replicates for the HDR experiments at each of the three target loci in MCF10A cells and three biological replicates at the <italic>GAPDH</italic> locus in HeLa cells.</p><p>We have now included all of the raw data for these experiments as follows.</p><p>a) Flow cytometry. We added the following raw data:</p><p>New Figure 1—figure supplement 4</p><p>New Figure 3—figure supplement 1</p><p>New Figure 3—figure supplements 3A and 3B</p><p>b) Standard PCR experiments.

We analyzed the data by using Welch's t-test because it is more robust than the more commonly used Student's t-test (with which we obtained lower <italic>p</italic>-values than with Welch's t-test). The <italic>p-</italic>values for the experiments are now given in the revised figure legends. In addition, as mentioned above in point 1 (part d), we have replaced the bar graphs with scatter plots. The scatter plots are much more informative than the bar graphs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The nature of the chromatin should be spelled out at the beginning of the Results section. What is known about the nature of the native <italic>Drosophila</italic> chromatin used? Does it tend to have a broad mix of histone tail modifications? How do these histone tail modifications relate to what is found in human cell lines? If the precise nature of the chromatin is not well understood, at least this should be stated in the Results section and Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this question. We previously analyzed the core histones from <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos by mass spectrometry (Levenstein and Kadonaga, 2002), and found that the histones contain a broad mixture of covalent modifications. The precise nature of covalent modifications has not been resolved.</p><p>As recommended, we added the following sentence at the beginning of the Results section.</p><p>“The chromatin was reconstituted by using salt dialysis methodology with plasmid DNA and purified core histones from <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, which contain a broad mixture of covalent modifications that have not been precisely resolved (Levenstein and Kadonaga, 2002).”</p><p>We also added the following paragraph in the Discussion section.</p><p>“In this regard, it is notable that we reconstituted chromatin by using native core histones from <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. These histones contain an undefined broad mixture of covalent histone modifications (Levenstein and Kadonaga, 2002). Because the core histones and their modifications are highly conserved throughout eukaryotes, it seems likely that similar results would be obtained with core histones from other sources. It is possible, however, that the magnitude of enhancement of HDR by chromatin could be further increased by variation of the core histone sequences and modifications.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) An unlikely issue with the PCR confirmation is the possibility of primer jumping that will artificially appear as targeted clones. The homozygous targeted clones could also reflect one targeted allele, and a large deletion on the other allele, based on the work of Allan Bradley (PMID: 30010673). While these possibilities may be unlikely, some PCR analysis of homozygous clones using more distant primers, again as performed by the Bradley laboratory (e.g. with LongAMP polymerase / NEB) would help ensure that these are bona fide targeted events.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for this helpful suggestion. We performed long-range PCR on 115 of our apparently homozygous clones with LongAmp Hot Start <italic>Taq</italic> DNA Polymerase (NEB), as in Kosicki et al., (2018) (new Figure 2—figure supplement 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 4, and Figure 2—figure supplement 5; new Figure 3—figure supplement 2). We found that two out of the 115 apparently homozygous clones appeared to contain one chromosome with a properly edited allele and one chromosome with a large deletion in the other allele (new Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Hence, as recommended by the reviewers, these results thus highlight the importance of carrying out long-range PCR analysis of apparently homozygous clones. In addition to the new figures cited above, the text has been modified as follows.</p><p>“In addition, by performing long-range PCR as in Kosicki et al., (2018), we identified two apparently homozygous clones that contained one chromosome with a precisely edited allele and one chromosome with a large deletion at the other allele (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Hence, in the generation of homozygous clones, it is important to carry out both standard and long-range PCR analyses.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
