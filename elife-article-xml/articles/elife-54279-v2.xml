subsets of progenitor cells generate progeny in a non-stochastic manner, suggesting that these decisions are tightly regulated. However, the gene-regulatory network components that are functionally important in these progenitor cells are largely unknown. Here we identify a functional role for the OTX2 transcription factor in this process. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing was used to produce somatic mutations of OTX2 in the chick retina and identified similar phenotypes to those observed in human patients. Single cell RNA sequencing was used to determine the functional consequences OTX2 gene editing on the population of cells derived from OTX2-expressing retinal progenitor cells. This confirmed that OTX2 is required for the generation of photoreceptors, but also for repression of specific retinal fates and alternative gene regulatory networks. These include specific subtypes of retinal ganglion and horizontal cells, suggesting that in this context, OTX2 functions to repress sister cell fate choices.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>photoreceptors</kwd><kwd>cell fate</kwd><kwd>gene regulatory network</kwd><kwd>retinal progenitor cell</kwd><kwd>single cell profiling</kwd><kwd>gene editing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY024982</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Emerson</surname><given-names>Mark M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T34GM007639</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gonzalez</surname><given-names>Kevin C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006545</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3G12MD007603</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ghinia Tegla</surname><given-names>Miruna Georgina</given-names></name><name><surname>Buenaventura</surname><given-names>Diego F</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Diana Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Thakurdin</surname><given-names>Cassandra</given-names></name><name><surname>Gonzalez</surname><given-names>Kevin C</given-names></name><name><surname>Emerson</surname><given-names>Mark M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A retinal gene regulatory network prevents the formation of alternative cell fates from non-stochastic retinal progenitor cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The vertebrate retina is a highly structured tissue comprising six neuronal classes and several types of glia. The specification of these diverse cell types is a dynamic process, largely conserved across vertebrate species, with the commitment to a final fate of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), cone photoreceptors (PRs) and horizontal cells (HCs) in the first developmental wave, followed progressively by amacrine cells (ACs), rod PRs and bipolar cells (BCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Masland, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bassett and Wallace, 2012</xref>). Müller glia are also generated during the last phase of retinal development, while astrocytes and the resident microglia are generated at early stages, independent of the neuronal retina, simultaneously with optic stalk formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kolb, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tao and Zhang, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Elucidation of the mechanisms by which each cell type is generated from multipotent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) is crucial for the development of successful cell replacement therapies for patients that suffer from retinal degeneration. Initial studies using viral labeling showed that multipotent RPCs have the potential to give rise to all retinal cell types, in a mechanism that can be explained by both deterministic and probabilistic models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Turner and Cepko, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wetts and Fraser, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holt et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cepko et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vitorino et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, identification of markers of restricted, neurogenic lineages enabled the characterization of these types of RPCs. For example, one class of restricted RPCs gives rise to all cell types except RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brzezinski et al., 2011</xref>), one produces all cell types except RGCs and Müller glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hafler et al., 2012</xref>), and another that is largely restricted to only two cell types – cone PRs and HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hafler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emerson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Suzuki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schick et al., 2019</xref>). This last RPC type is defined by the activity of the cis regulatory module 1 (CRM1) of the gene THRB. Previous studies have determined that the activation of the THRBCRM1 element requires the expression and direct binding of the Orthodenticle Homeobox 2 (OTX2) and ONECUT1 transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emerson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Souferi and Emerson, 2019</xref>). Moreover, a recent study has identified cellular and molecular changes that occur during the generation of these fate-restricted RPCs, but not in multipotent RPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buenaventura et al., 2018</xref>). However, the roles of OTX2 and ONECUT1 in the establishment of this restricted signature are not well understood.</p><p>OTX2 is one of the key regulators of nervous system development, as it is involved in forebrain and midbrain specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acampora et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Simeone et al., 2002</xref>), pineal and pituitary gland development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nishida et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Henderson et al., 2009</xref>), as well as development of sensory structures such as the inner ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Matsuo et al., 1995</xref>) and visual system (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beby and Lamonerie, 2013</xref>). In the visual system, OTX2 is expressed in different subsets of cells as development progresses – first, during optic vesicle formation, OTX2 directs evagination of the optic vesicle to contact the surface ectoderm along with RAX, PAX6, HES1 and SIX3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler and Canto-Soler, 2007</xref>). Later, during the specification of the neuronal and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) territories, OTX2 is highly expressed in the RPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martinez-Morales et al., 2001</xref>) and in a subset of RPCs that primarily generate cones and HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Emerson and Cepko, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emerson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buenaventura et al., 2018</xref>), then in postmitotic PRs during the specification of retinal neuronal cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nishida et al., 2003</xref>), in the PRs and BCs in the mature retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koike et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2008</xref>), and in a subset of Müller glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brzezinski et al., 2010</xref>). As a consequence of its involvement during early eye genesis, several studies have reported OTX2 mutations in humans with ocular malformations. The clinical manifestations range from unilateral and bilateral anophthalmia, microphthalmia, optic nerve aplasia to various forms of coloboma (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gat-Yablonski, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have examined the role of OTX2 in the development of the neuronal retina using conditional floxed mouse models, as homozygous OTX2 mutants die embryonically due to defects in the specification of the anterior neuroectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acampora et al., 1995</xref>). When OTX2 loss is mediated by a post-mitotic PR Cre driver, a severe loss of PRs was observed, while the number of PAX6-positive cells was increased, suggesting a trans-differentiation of the mutant cells into amacrine-like neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nishida et al., 2003</xref>). Microarray analysis of these retinas supported this conclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Omori et al., 2011</xref>). Similar PR loss and abnormal generation of amacrine-like cells, along with loss of BCs and HCs was reported, when OTX2 ablation was initiated throughout the early retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sato et al., 2007</xref>). Despite the contributions from these studies that implicate OTX2 as a crucial regulator of PR development, several questions remain unanswered. Specifically, what are the cell fates and underlying gene regulatory networks that are impacted by loss of OTX2? While previous analyses have suggested that ACs are ectopically induced upon loss of OTX2, these effects were characterized in the postnatal retina leaving the primary effects of OTX2 loss unknown. In addition, OTX2 expression is initiated in specific RPC populations prior to the formation of PRs and this expression would not be compromised by the previously used PR Cre drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emerson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buenaventura et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the functional role of OTX2 in this RPC population that will generate PRs is unknown.</p><p>This study reports a characterization of OTX2 mutants during various stages of retinal development with a focus on OTX2-positive RPCs. CRISPR-induced OTX2 loss-of-function mutations were introduced in the context of the developing chicken retina in vivo and ex vivo, providing a robust and facile experimental system to determine OTX2 function. Successful ablation of OTX2 was demonstrated by immunofluorescence, gene expression analysis and deep sequencing of the OTX2 gene. The effects of OTX2 loss on OTX2-positive RPCs were analyzed using a reporter active in this cell population combined with the examination of known markers and characterization using single cell RNA sequencing. In addition, these data show the strict requirement of OTX2 for the specification of PR cells, while specific subtypes of RGCs and HCs are generated in the OTX2 mutant retinas, suggesting that alternate fates are not randomly chosen, but are selected from those normally associated with OTX2-positive RPCs. This high-resolution analysis of OTX2 function provides new insights into the process of PR formation in the vertebrate retina and the mechanisms of retinal cell fate choice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CRISPR/Cas9-induced ablation of the OTX2 gene at the optic vesicle stage results in anatomical defects of the overall eye structure, pigment epithelium and neuronal retina</title><p>To generate mutations that disrupt the function of the OTX2 gene, two RNA guides that corresponded to mRNA positions 141 and 167 in the coding sequence of the OTX2 gene, called guide 2 (g2) and guide 3 (g3), were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>).

Throughout the study, the comparison was done between retinas electroporated with the CRISPR guide plus electroporation control vector mix and retinas electroporated with the same electroporation control as well as an ‘empty’ p18 plasmid that contained the Cas9 open reading frame driven by the CAG promoter and the guide RNA scaffold, but without the 20 bp part of the guide RNA specific to the target gDNA.

Electroporation of the OTX2 g2 or g3 yielded severe anatomical defects of the electroporated eye upon analysis at E5, a timepoint when both the neuronal retina and the RPE territories have already been specified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–H</xref>). The morphological defects observed in the OTX2<sup>CRISPR</sup> mutants ranged from microphthalmia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,E,I</xref>), patches of depigmentation in the RPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–H</xref>), defects of the optic nerve (ON), such as ON head enlargement, as well as both iridial and optic stalk coloboma-like phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E,F,H</xref>). For all in ovo experiments the left eye, not targeted by electroporation, developed normally as expected (MGT). Quantification of the above-mentioned phenotypes is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I–J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>. Similar results were obtained in seven independent experiments.</p><p>The mosaicism observed in the patches of depigmentation in the mutant RPE as well as the variable size of the mutant eyes reflects the electroporation efficiency as well as the fact that the mutations were induced through non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) after the Cas9 induced double-stranded break, and, therefore, the clones derived from electroporated cells could be different with respect to their targeted mutation.</p><p>To assess the structural defects observed in the OTX2<sup>CRISPR</sup> mutants, an immunofluorescence-based characterization was performed on vertical sections of retinas electroporated at E1.5 and analyzed at E5. Mutants varied in thickness of both RPE and neuronal retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K–P</xref>). The RPE layer was found to contain structures composed of cells that were depigmented, enlarged, intensely GFP-positive, and OTX2-negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). These structures were absent in CTRL retinas and were largely EdU and PH3-negative, with low expression levels of VSX2 and high levels of PAX6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K–P</xref>).</p><p>At the developmental time of analysis, OTX2-positive cells in the neuronal retina are normally observed in a dispersed pattern in the outermost part of the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buenaventura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The OTX2<sup>CRISPR</sup> mutants displayed varying degrees of effects on OTX2 expression, ranging from absence of the outer OTX2 population to complete loss of OTX2 throughout the entire retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>As noted, the mutations induced during optic cup formation yielded a broad range of morphological defects due to the mutation of OTX2 in both neuronal retina and RPE, and therefore, obfuscated the functional evaluation of OTX2 mutation during PR development. To more specifically target the neuronal retina, in ovo electroporation experiments were performed at E3 (HH18), when the RPE and neuronal territories are already specified and the majority of cells are RPCs with high mitotic potential, ensuring the propagation of the mutations to many daughter cells.</p><p>The CAG::GFP plasmid was used as an electroporation control to identify the targeted cells. At this stage, the electroporated area is limited due to the nature of the experiment (Methods), and the sparse clones of electroporated cells can therefore be analyzed in the context of a mostly unaffected retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). When mutant retinas were analyzed at E6, the analyzed regions of the retina have many OTX2-positive cells, however, the GFP-positive cells generally lack OTX2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>).</p><p>The absence of OTX2-positive cells in the mutant was more pronounced at E10, when the retina is layered, and the OTX2-positive PRs are concentrated in the ONL and BCs are located in the outer part on the INL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Columns of GFP-positive cells that lack OTX2 form gaps within the OTX2-positive populations in the ONL and INL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>).

Furthermore, the ability to introduce mutations in specific tissues at particular timepoints has proven particularly useful for developmental studies, allowing for a more precise evaluation of genes that have a role in multiple developmental time windows. In addition, the recent technological advances for the generation of single cell gene expression profiles allows for analysis of rapidly dividing and differentiating cells at a single cell resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>). The current study illustrates the power of using these methods in combination to evaluate gene function in the context of a developing tissue with notable cellular complexity.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Timing and CRISPR/Cas9 effectiveness of the OTX2 ablation</title><p>Introduction of OTX2<sup>CRISPR</sup> at multiple timepoints allowed for identification of previously described phenotypes for OTX2, including effects on eye morphology, RPE pigmentation and gene expression, PR and BC formation, and repression of PAX6 expression. Moreover, this current mutation model resembles the clinical manifestations of human mutations of OTX2 that lead to different degrees of microphthalmia and anophthalmia more than any other reported model of OTX2 ablation. Electroporation during eye cup development, even in cases where the electroporation efficiency was relatively low, led to these phenotypes, which suggests that OTX2 expression is highly required during optic vesicle development. In human, similar malformations were reported to occur as an effect of de novo nonsense mutations that lead to early termination of OTX2 transcription and either lead to degradation of the transcript by nonsense-mediated RNA decay or to dysfunctional OTX2 protein due to defects in the homeodomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyl et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gat-Yablonski, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The amplicon analysis in this study suggested that there was a high rate of mutagenesis with g2 that either disrupted the sequence of the functionally important homeodomain or created a large truncation. Almost 30% of these reads were wildtype in the targeted region, which given the phenotypic severity of the mutation (for example, only ~5% of photoreceptors remained in the mutant), suggests that either this method underrepresented the number of mutant alleles and/or loss of one copy of OTX2 was phenotypic. The former possibility is unlikely to be caused by nonsense-mediated decay given the proximity of new stop codon usage to the last exon-exon junction in the transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lindeboom et al., 2016</xref>). However, it could be caused by failure to recover mutations in which one of the primer binding sites was removed or if mutant cells have reduced OTX2 transcription, for example, in response to cell fate changes. In support of this, the percent of OTX2 positive cells in the mutant is lower than in the CTRL samples (46.1% versus 77.9%). It is also possible that cells with only one targeted OTX2 allele may contribute to the observed phenotypes, as haploinsufficiency effects for OTX2 have been observed in both human and mouse studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ragge et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wyatt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Henderson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cell type-specific effects in response to loss of OTX2</title><p>This study is focused on the OTX2 transcription factor, known to be involved in several aspects of retinogenesis, but for which critical mechanistic details are undefined. The choice of the model organism – chick – not only increases the toolbox of developmental studies, the retina being easily accessible for manipulations during the embryonic time period, but also shows common features with the human retina, in both the physiology of the signal detection and transmission as well as gene networks. The expression of four different opsins in chick PRs that allow for signal detection during photopic conditions, as well as the existence of multiple subtypes of HCs represent features that do not exist in the murine retina. In addition, recent studies identified significant similarities between the developing human and chick retina regarding the expression of particular genes, distinctively expressed in only certain cell types, that are not expressed in the mouse retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The use of the OTX2ECR2 reporter allowed the characterization of the OTX2 RPC population and its progeny at high resolution. However, to increase the mutagenesis rate of OTX2 in these cells, the Cas9 protein and guide RNAs were driven by regulatory elements with strong, broad spatial activity (to also target multipotent RPCs that generate OTX2 RPCs). Thus, there could be OTX2-positive cells outside of the OTX2ECR2 population that are affected by the gene editing plasmid, and therefore a formal possibility that these mutated cells have a cell non-autonomous effect on the OTX2ECR2 population, either through changes in secreted factors, or through OTX2 itself, which has been reported to be secreted by cells and taken up by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sugiyama et al., 2008</xref>). However, given the existence of OTX2 mRNA and protein in the majority of the OTX2ECR2 active population and previous transcriptomic analyses showing OTX2 mRNA transcripts largely restricted to the overlapping THRBCRM1 population (see below), the effects observed here are likely due to cell autonomous mechanisms.</p><p>Previous analysis in the mouse retina concluded that conditional loss of OTX2 initiated in postmitotic PRs, or throughout the retina using an early neural retina driver, leads to loss of PRs, HCs, and BCs, a concomitant increase in ACs, and no change in RGCs. In contrast, this study identified significant increases in the representation of specific HC and RGC subtypes. While this difference could be due to a mouse/chick distinction, we favor the explanation that three experimental aspects of this study allowed for novel findings: 1) short-term assessment after OTX2 mutation, 2) a targeted cell population that includes OTX2-positive RPCs and 3) single cell analysis to sensitively identify cell types. The three previous developmental studies examined the effects of OTX2 mutation initiated either in post-mitotic PRs, or in the early retina prior to postmitotic cell formation and possibly at a timepoint when OTX2 is still critical for eye specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nishida et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sato et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Omori et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, in two of the previous cases, the evaluation of cell fate largely occurred in the adult, possibly precluding the detection of the cell fate changes observed in this study. However, several of the gene regulatory changes associated with HC and RGC formation identified in this study were identified in the previous study that examined the OTX2 conditional knockout at postnatal day one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Omori et al., 2011</xref>). These include upregulation of PROX1, associated with HCs, BCs, AII ACs, and of POU4F2 (BRN3B), expressed in RGCs. In addition, DLX1 and 2 were strongly upregulated. While these gene expression changes were not noted as indicative of cell fate changes, they are in fact consistent with the ones observed here in the chick retina and may indicate an evolutionarily conserved role of OTX2 in repression of gene regulatory networks associated with HCs and RGCs.</p><p>To date, it has been suggested that OTX2 acts primarily as a direct activator of transcription in the retina, while a potential repressive function, as well as the targets that mediate repression, are not clear. The above-mentioned studies were conducted mainly in the postnatal retina, missing the early developmental time points where there could be unique gene regulatory networks engaged by OTX2 in restricted RPCs. One of the most striking transcriptional changes to be identified was upregulation of PAX6. While previous studies also noted a robust induction of PAX6 in response to OTX2 loss, this was primarily thought to be linked to the observed increase in amacrine-like cells, which highly express PAX6. The present study shows that cluster AC/HC/RGC, with cells that express PAX6, increases from 3% in the control dataset to 5% in the OTX2<sup>CRISPR</sup> one. However, the nature of the single cell analysis allows us to observe that in restricted RPCs PAX6 was the gene most upregulated in OTX2<sup>CRISPR</sup> cells and this is not likely to be a secondary effect from a cell fate change, since the majority of the gene expression signature of these restricted RPCs stays the same. In addition, the same mutually exclusive expression between PAX6 and OTX2 was also noticed in the RPE of the retinas with induced OTX2 mutation at E1.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This suggests that the causal link between the two is more direct within retinal gene regulatory networks. The mechanism by which OTX2 functions to repress PAX6 is not clear as of yet. Previous studies have identified a role for a physical interaction of OTX2 with TLE4 that allows for direct transcriptional repression by OTX2 occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agoston and Schulte, 2009</xref>). Alternatively, repression could be mediated by a transcriptional target of OTX2 such as the transcriptional repressor PRDM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mills et al., 2017</xref>). Previous observations from our group showed that OTX2, when misexpressed with ONECUT1, was able to drive formation of a restricted RPC population from a multipotent population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buenaventura et al., 2018</xref>). Whether the effect observed here on PAX6, a functionally important transcription factor in multipotent RPCs, could contribute to this effect, is currently unknown.</p><p>In addition to the increase in the percentages of cells that form clusters RGC and HC1 in the OTX2<sup>CRISPR</sup> dataset, the generation of a new cluster, with cells that do not appear to have the clear transcriptional signature of any single final cell type in the retina, represented one of the novel findings of this study. These cells also express PAX6, are located in the inner retina and show predominantly RGC-like morphologies. However, they do not express high levels of any markers used for RGC identification. Considering their morphology, as well as the fact that the OTX2ECR2 lineage tracing shows that predominantly all GFP positive cells appear to be panPOU4F RGCs, it is possible that, at the time of the single cell analysis, these cells were in a transitional state, prior to activation of RGC transcriptional programs in the following stages. Alternatively, some of these cells could undergo apoptosis, as the number of the OTX2ECR2 lineage traced cells was reduced in comparison with the CTRL retinas analyzed.</p><p>While cell fate choice in the vertebrate retina has been an area of intense study, a coherent model of the fundamental molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this process is still lacking. One question is whether fates are decided according to stochastic or deterministic mechanisms. Several studies that examined zebrafish random progenitor cell clones have suggested that stochastic mechanisms are the primary drivers of postmitotic cell fate choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boije et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2012</xref>). However, studies in zebrafish, chicken, and mice that have used cis-regulatory elements to genetically target specific RPC populations have identified what appear to be non-random preferences for postmitotic fate choices. This suggests that there are some deterministic factors that inform these decisions. In this study, a subpopulation of the restricted RPC types labeled by the OTX2ECR2 element is the RPC population defined by the THRBCRM1 regulatory element. These progenitor cells preferentially form cones, type1 horizontal cells, and a small population of RGCs over other cell types such as rods and type 2–4 horizontal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schick et al., 2019</xref>). Experiments comparing the overlap between the two lineages showed an overlap of 32.9% c.i. ±9.5 of OTX2ECR2 cells that are THRBCRM1 (MGT). Interestingly, we observed that loss of OTX2 led to a loss of photoreceptors and a concomitant increase in type1 HCs and non-POU4F1 positive RGCs. These specific choices suggest that deterministic factors could influence the choices of mutant OTX2 RPCs as well. We speculate that this is related to the fact that type 1 HCs and possibly non-POU4F1 RGCs are already preferred fate choices of THRBCRM1 RPCs. We have noted previously that these RPCs are defined by OTX2 and ONECUT1 co-expression and that these two transcription factors become individually expressed in the postmitotic daughter cells that become cones and HCs, respectively. All members of the ONECUT family are upregulated in OTX2<sup>CRISPR</sup> retinas, suggesting that these factors appear to be derepressed in the cells that would normally be photoreceptors and, therefore, drive HC genesis.</p><p>Taken together, the current study proposes a model in which OTX2 serves as a key positive regulator of photoreceptor genesis from restricted RPCs, while repressing specific subtypes of other retinal fates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7M</xref>). At the gene regulatory network level, OTX2 represses key transcription factors involved in non-photoreceptor cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7N</xref>). Further combined use of the single cell sequencing/CRISPR gene editing approach with variation of time, targeted genes, and labeled cell populations will provide a powerful genetic strategy to examine developmental gene regulatory networks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>)</td><td>GRCg6a</td><td>International Chicken Genome Consortium</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000002315.5/">GCF_000002315.5</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct</td><td>Modified px330: <break/>P18/MG18</td><td>Modified from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cong et al., 2013</xref> version</td><td/><td>The original promoter of the px330 upstream of the Cas9 ORF was replaced with the CAG promoter</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct</td><td>Modified px330 with OTX2 g2: MG10</td><td>Lab made</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct</td><td>Modified px330 with OTX2 g3: MG233</td><td>Lab made</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct</td><td>Modified Stagia3: <break/>ME1860</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Emerson and Cepko, 2011</xref></td><td/><td>Mouse OTX2 ECR2 EGFP reporter as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Emerson and Cepko (2011)</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct</td><td>CAG::βGal</td><td>Cepko lab</td><td/><td>Expression vector, nuclear βGalactosidase reporter driven by the CAG promoter</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct</td><td>CAG::EGFP</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matsuda and Cepko, 2004</xref></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_11150">Addgene_11150</ext-link></td><td>Expression vector, EGFP reporter driven by the CAG promoter</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct</td><td>CAG::iRFP</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buenaventura et al., 2018</xref></td><td/><td>Expression vector, iRFP reporter driven by the CAG promoter</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-OTX2 <break/>Goat polyclonal</td><td>AF1979</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1617988">AB_1617988</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti- OTX1+OTX2 <break/>Rabbit polyclonal</td><td>ab21990</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_776930">AB_776930</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-PAX6 <break/>Mouse IgG1 monoclonal</td><td>PAX6</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_528427">AB_528427</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-BRN3A <break/>Mouse IgG1 monoclonal</td><td>Mab1585</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_94166">AB_94166</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-panBRN3 <break/>Mouse IgG1 monoclonal</td><td>sc-390780</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-LIM1 Mouse IgG1 monoclonal</td><td>4F2-C</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_531784">AB_531784</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-ISL1 <break/>Mouse monoclonal</td><td>39.3F7</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1157901">AB_1157901</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-PH3 <break/>Rabbit polyclonal</td><td>06–570</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10582726">AB_10582726</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-VSX2 <break/>Sheep polyclonal</td><td>x1180p</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2314191">AB_2314191</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-βGAL <break/>Chick polyclonal</td><td>ab37382</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_307210">AB_307210</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay</td><td>Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 647 imaging kit</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>Cat#C10340</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Reagent</td><td>O.

responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Otx-2 is an important gene that has been implicated in many developmental processes in the brain and in particular in the retina. Its use through multiple developmental times made it difficult to investigate its late role in the retina. Your investigations of these functions using precise CRISPR-based manipulations provide an important contribution to understanding the role of Otx-2 in the visual system and in particular its conserved role in photoreceptor specification,</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;OTX2 represses sister cell fate choices in the developing retina to promote photoreceptor specification&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their various requests and came out with the list below of experiments/changes.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The mutation induced by Cas9 over time needs to be better characterized as providing information on the outcome of the Cas9 editing over time would be valuable data. You should evaluate the percentage of homozygous and heterozygous cells, preferably with respect to the unique indel types. Analyzing RNAseq data from populations of cells as shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1 might be sufficient: The data show that most reads have indels, which could be useful for determining the percentage of homozygous and heterozygous cells and the indel types). This is important as the study is based on analyses of the outcome of a heterogeneous population of mutant cells that differ in the size and time of deletion.</p><p>2) You should also complete the analysis of loss of Otx2 at earlier stages.</p><p>3) The use of reporter activity to monitor cell lineage could be misleading as the mutation was induced in all of the transfected retinal progenitor cells, and not only those in which this enhancer is active. The impact of the mutation (autonomous or cell non-autonomous) on the enhancer can distort the conclusion about the fate of the mutant cells, thereby complicating the interpretation of the relevance to Otx2 activity. You should discuss this limitation in the Discussion.</p><p>Other comments:</p><p>– Referring to the control as &quot;WT&quot; is confusing. Note that you write that the &quot;contralateral non-electroporated eye developed normally&quot;. This is not the control mentioned earlier. An accurate term should be provided for the relevant controls – those that were electroporated with Cas9 and guide scaffold. Were the control eyes for the single-cell sequencing electroporated with Cas9 or not? This needs to be clarified.</p><p>– Figure 1F: show a higher magnification of the mutant retina and RPE. Not clear if Otx2 is indeed reduced in the RPE.</p><p>– Figure 1: also label the region encoding the homeodomain in Figure 1A. In the top panel (F-H), indicate the stages on the right (E1.5-E5), as was done for the lower panel.</p><p>– Subsection “CRISPR Cas9-induced ablation of the OTX2 gene at the optic vesicle stage results in anatomical defects of the overall eye structure, pigment epithelium and neuronal retina”: revise the text to eliminate redundancy.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In the present manuscript, Ghinia Tegla and colleagues have investigated the role of OTX2 during retinal cell fate specification. It is well known that OTX2 plays key roles in different processes during CNS patterning, eye morphogenesis, as well the in the terminal differentiation of photoreceptors and bipolar cells. Because of the important early functions of OTX2, null mutants have severe defects and die embryonically. Several studies on the role of OTX2 in postmitotic cells have been published using specific CREs but the specific role of OTX2 in retinal progenitors has remained unresolved.</p><p>Here, by means of a systematic OTX2 ablation using CRISPR/Cas9 electroporation in chicken embryos at different stages of development, the authors elegantly address the functions of OTX2 in progenitor cells as well as its genetic networks using single cell RNA-seq. Surprisingly, the authors observe a specific increase in subpopulations of RGCs and Horizontal cells in the absence of OTX2. The work constitutes a meticulous survey of roles of OTX2; it is very well designed, and includes meaningful datasets that shed light onto some unresolved questions. I anticipate that this paper will be a useful resource in the field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript details a methodical approach using chick to ascertain the function of OTX2 in retinal development. The authors use CRISPR/Cas9 to target OTX2 in vivo, followed by FACS and SC-Seq to determine gene expression changes. The methods are rigorous and the sometimes complex data are presented in a clear and systematic fashion. The results support the major conclusions of the paper, namely that OTX2 not only is essential to activate the photoreceptor cell fate but also to repress alternative fates. The statistical analyses are well described and appropriate.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Otx2 is one of the most extensively studied transcription factors in forebrain and eye development. Genetic dissection using Cre/loxP in mice has been performed by several groups, leading to the overall notion that this gene is required for photoreceptor, horizontal and bipolar cell fates while inhibiting amacrine cell fate. However, because of its complex expression pattern and the hallmark of the retina where different cells are generated at the same time, there is eventually limited insight on roles of the gene in subsets of progenitors.</p><p>The aim of the study by Ghinia Tegla and colleagues is to further explore and decipher the role of Otx2 at different stages and in subsets of retinal progenitors during chick retinal development. To this end, the researchers combined the cutting-edge technologies of in-vivo somatic mutation using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing approach and single-cell RNA-Seq analysis to characterize, at single-cell resolution, the outcome of Otx2 mutation at three stages of development: optic vesicle (during specification of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and retina, E1.5), optic cup (electroporation of the retina only, E3) and during later stages of retinogenesis (E5).</p><p>The first two stages were analyzed qualitatively. The analyses supported reduction of Otx2 in the electroporated cells. The reduction was more extensive at E10, implying that it takes a few days to achieve efficient mutation in many cells. The observed phenotypes served as proof of concept for efficient mutagenesis, and showed that the mutations in chicks resemble the outcome of loss of Otx2 in mammals that suffer from a range of ocular abnormalities, including anophthalmia and coloboma.</p><p>Detailed cellular analysis of the phenotype was performed following mutation of Otx2 at E5, along with analysis of the explants 2 days later. In this setting, the authors reported a reduction in Otx2 and in photoreceptor gene expression based on the activity of a reporter that is regulated by Otx2 and is active in cone photoreceptors in the chick retina (THRBCRM2 cis-regulatory element). Next they focused on the impact of the mutation on a subpopulation of retinal progenitors in which one of the Otx2 enhancers has been found by this group to be active (ECR2) in a subset of retinal progenitor cells destined to horizontal cell and cone photoreceptor cell fates. The cells in which ECR2 was expressed were isolated from control and mutant retinas and examined for gene expression using single-cell-seq analyses. The single-cell analysis of transcriptomic changes following the mutation revealed that Otx2 functions to inhibit alternative cell fates, as increases in HZC and amacrine gene expression were detected in the mutant cells. Another finding was the detection of an aberrant type of ganglion-like cell following the mutation. The functional significance of the latter observation is currently not clear.</p><p>Overall, this study makes important technical advances as it implements new technologies to functionally address the role of an important developmental regulator in retinogenesis, providing cellular resolution for the functions of this complex gene.

You should evaluate the percentage of homozygous and heterozygous cells, preferably with respect to the unique indel types. Analyzing RNAseq data from populations of cells as shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1 might be sufficient: The data show that most reads have indels, which could be useful for determining the percentage of homozygous and heterozygous cells and the indel types). This is important as the study is based on analyses of the outcome of a heterogeneous population of mutant cells that differ in the size and time of deletion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion to report additional details of the induced mutations. We have performed an additional experimental analysis to identify the mutations that were induced in OTX2 and provide quantitation of the frequencies of these mutations. We extracted mRNA from the cells left over upon completion of the 10X single cell sequencing experiment, generated cDNA and amplified an OTX2 region that encompassed the target region for the OTX2 guide 2. These PCR products were submitted for amplicon deep sequencing using a local sequencing provider (Genewiz). The analysis yielded a quantification of the sequences in both control and OTX2<sup>CRISPR</sup> samples and revealed the types of mutation that occurred in the remaining OTX2 transcripts present in the single cell analysis upon OTX2 mutation. We updated the Materials and methods section, (subsection “Library preparation, sequencing and data analysis” paragraph four) as well as the Results, presented in paragraph four of subsection “Single cell RNA sequencing analysis of the OTX2ECR2-positive cells reveals widespread changes in the distribution of cells per cluster”, as well as Figure 5—figure supplement 1F, G. We did observe a higher percentage of wildtype reads than we expected given the penetrant phenotypic effects. This could be due to overrepresentation of the wildtype allele in our sequenced amplicons due to Cas9-induced deletion of one of the primer binding sites. In addition, it could be that mutant cells express a lower level of OTX2 as these cells change fate and therefore wildtype transcripts in the few remaining photoreceptors or other OTX2-positive cells are overrepresented at the RNA level. We note in the text that the number of OTX2-positive cells in the single cell datasets supports this possibility. It is also possible that OTX2 heterozygotes have haploinsufficient effects in this context and OTX2 has previously been shown to have such a genetic requirement in mice and humans. All of these possibilities are discussed in the Discussion, paragraph two of subsection “Timing and CRISPR/Cas9 effectiveness of the OTX2 ablation”.</p><p>Though this new analysis partially addresses the reviewers’ concern, we are unable to provide a specific estimation of the percentage of homozygous and heterozygous cells that are formed in response to the OTX2<sup>CRISPR</sup> condition. We will first review why this is technically not feasible and then our response as to why we believe this analysis, though potentially informative, is not required for this study.</p><p>There are two ways in which reasonable estimates of the allele status of each single cell in the presented dataset could be determined. The first is by examination of the OTX2 mRNA species present in each cell. This would be the most direct method. However, due to the nature of the 10X RNASeq platform used in this experiment, the reads for all genes are heavily biased to the 3’ end of the gene and there is minimal representation of the Cas9 targeted region (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C) in OTX2, which is located near the 5’ region of the mRNA. The small number of reads that are present in this region all represent mutant alleles, which supports the hypothesis that the CRISPR/Cas9 system was in fact very efficient in this instance, and it is likely that many cells carry mutations in both alleles of OTX2.</p><p>The second method we could use is to extrapolate from the results of the bulk RT-PCR experiment and estimate homozygotes versus heterozygotes versus wildtype cell distributions. If we assumed that all of the wildtype alleles were present in the same cells (all cells were either wildtype or homozygous mutant with no heterozygotes present) we would expect that the ~29% wildtype alleles would represent 14.5% wildtype cells. At the other extreme, those wildtype alleles could always be paired with a mutant allele, thus all wildtype alleles would be in heterozygote cells. This would mean that 29% of cells were heterozygotes. However, it seems plausible that we could be underestimating the number of mutant alleles for the reasons noted above and this could lead to a misestimation of even this range of projected genotypes.</p><p>Though we agree with the reviewer that this would be a useful datapoint, we do not believe that it is required to support the findings of the current study. There have been several previous reports that OTX2 heterozygous mutations underlie human disease, so some of the observed phenotypes in the chicken retina may be in line with this sensitive genetic requirement for OTX2. Whether the results here are due to such a haploinsufficiency effect does not affect the findings that are the focus of this study. We have addressed this point in paragraph two of subsection “Timing and CRISPR/Cas9 effectiveness of the OTX2 ablation”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) You should also complete the analysis of loss of Otx2 at earlier stages.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion and have responded by performing additional experiments to quantify the most encountered phenotypes that resemble clinical manifestation of people suffering OTX2 mutations, which are coloboma and microphthalmia. These results are described in paragraph two of subsection “CRISPR Cas9-induced ablation of the OTX2 gene at the optic vesicle stage results in anatomical defects of the overall eye structure, pigment epithelium and neuronal retina”, and detailed in Figure 1—figure supplement 1I, J and Supplementary file 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The use of reporter activity to monitor cell lineage could be misleading as the mutation was induced in all of the transfected retinal progenitor cells, and not only those in which this enhancer is active.

You should discuss this limitation in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion to explain the use of the reporter further as we believe it increases clarity of the study.

A similar analysis as in the above-mentioned paper is not possible, considering the differences in the experimental paradigms. The cited paper used single cells to seed colonies and then analyzed them. The experimental workflow our study used a scRNASeq analysis and the depth of sequencing, as well as the location of the target site relative to the sequencing reads, prevents such analysis. However, we did perform additional experiments using deep sequencing on the same sample that was analyzed at the single cell level.
