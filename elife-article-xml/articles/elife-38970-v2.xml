Virus-like particles (VLPs) containing flavivirus prM/E proteins have been demonstrated to be a potential vaccine candidate; however, the structure of dengue VLP is poorly understood. Herein VLP derived from DENV serotype-2 were engineered becoming highly matured (mD2VLP) and showed variable size distribution with diameter of ~31 nm forming the major population under cryo-electron microscopy examination. Furthermore, mD2VLP particles of 31 nm diameter possess a T = 1 icosahedral symmetry with a groove located within the E-protein dimers near the 2-fold vertices that exposed highly overlapping, cryptic neutralizing epitopes. Mice vaccinated with mD2VLP generated higher cross-reactive (CR) neutralization antibodies (NtAbs) and were fully protected against all 4 serotypes of DENV. Our results highlight the potential of ‘epitope-resurfaced’ mature-form D2VLPs in inducing quaternary structure-recognizing broad CR NtAbs to guide future dengue vaccine design.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dengue</kwd><kwd>virus-like particle</kwd><kwd>cryoEM</kwd><kwd>broad antibody response</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>104-2320-B-006-027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Shang-Rung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>105-2320-B-006-017-MY3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Shang-Rung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>104-2633-B-005-001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chao</surname><given-names>Day-Yu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST 106-2313-B-005-029</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jyung-Hurng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Despite size heterogeneity, an epitope-resurfaced mature-form dengue VLP has the potential to induce quaternary structure-recognizing broad cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dengue virus (DENV), a member of the family <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, is a mosquito-borne pathogen with four distinct serotypes, DENV-1 to DENV-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lindenbach and Rice, 2001</xref>). It has been estimated that DENV infects about 390 million individuals globally each year, resulting in 96 million clinically apparent infections ranging from mild fever to the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhatt et al., 2013</xref>). Although the chimeric yellow fever 17D-derived, tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) has recently been approved by the governments of a few DENV-circulating countries, the unexpected low vaccine efficacy in dengue-naïve children or children younger than 6 years old has limited the use of this vaccine in the 9 – 45 age group living in endemic countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guy and Jackson, 2016</xref>). Developing a new strategy by either improving the efficacy of CYD-TDV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">WHO, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguiar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Halstead, 2017</xref>) or the second-generation vaccine candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kirkpatrick et al., 2016</xref>) is essential to broaden the coverage for all vulnerable populations.</p><p>The envelope (E) protein of DENV on the surface of viral particles is the major target of neutralizing antibodies (NtAbs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Roehrig, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pierson et al., 2008</xref>). The ectodomain of the E protein contains three distinct domains, EDI, EDII, and EDIII, which are connected by flexible hinges to allow rearrangement of domains during virus assembly, maturation and infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Modis et al., 2003</xref>). However, the immune response from humans who have recovered from primary DENV infections is dominated by cross-reactive (CR), non-NtAbs which recognize mainly pre-membrane (prM) or fusion loop of the E (FLE) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dejnirattisai et al., 2010</xref>). During virus replication, newly synthesized DENVs are assembled as immature particles in the endoplasmic reticulum at neutral pH, followed by translocation through the trans-Golgi network and low-pH secretory vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chambers et al., 1990</xref>). The pr portion of the prM protein, positioned to cover the fusion loop (FL) peptide at the distal end of each E protein, prevents premature fusion during the virion maturation process along the egress pathway from the infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kostyuchenko et al., 2013</xref>). For DENV to become fully infectious, the pr molecule has to be removed by a cellular furin protease during the egress process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rodenhuis-Zybert et al., 2010</xref>). However, furin cleavage in the low-pH secretory vesicles is thought to be inefficient; hence, DENV particles released from infected cells are heterogeneous populations with different degrees of cleavage and release of the pr portion of prM to form the mature membrane (M) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pierson and Diamond, 2012</xref>). Immature DENV (imDENV) particles consist of uncleaved prM protein and partially immature particles (piDENV) containing both prM and M proteins, while fully mature DENV (mDENV) contains only M protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pierson and Diamond, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Junjhon et al., 2010</xref>). Functional analyses have revealed that a completely immature flavivirus lacks the ability to infect cells unless in the presence of anti-prM antibodies through a mechanism called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dejnirattisai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rodenhuis-Zybert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">da Silva Voorham et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rodenhuis-Zybert et al., 2011</xref>). ADE plays an important role in dengue pathogenesis, and is potentially modulated by the antibody concentration and the degree of virion maturity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nelson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rodenhuis-Zybert et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Virus-like particles (VLPs) containing flavivirus prM/E proteins have been demonstrated to be a potential vaccine candidate, since their ordered E structures are similar to those on the virion surface and also undergo low-pH-induced rearrangements and membrane fusion similar to viral particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allison et al., 1995</xref>). Also, VLP vaccines present several advantages since they are highly immunogenic, non-infectious, and accessible to quality control as well as increased production capacity. However, we theorized that the process of VLP maturation might be similar to that of dengue viral particles, with heterogeneous pr-containing structures. In this study, we engineered and characterized the structure of mature DENV-2 VLPs through cryo-EM. The immunological properties of mature VLPs were further compared with its immature counterparts.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>As we theorized, the process of VLP maturation are similar to that of dengue viral particles so that the wild-type particles (wtD2VLP) produced from the cells are partially immature containing both prM and M proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To overcome this problem, we engineered the DENV-2 VLPs as completely mature particles by manipulating the furin cleavage site at the junction of pr and M in a DENV-2 VLP-expressing plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2003</xref>). For comparison, we also generated immature VLP (imD2VLPs) by mutating the minimal furin cleavage motif REKR to REST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2008</xref>), which resulted in completely uncleaved prM as detected by western blot and ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Generation of mature DENV-2 VLP (mD2VLP) was much more challenging. First, we performed multiple sequence alignments of the pr/M junction from several flaviviruses, including the distance-related cell fusion agent virus (CFAV), and analyzed their furin cleavage potential using the algorithm PiTou 2.0<sup>24</sup>. DENV-3 pr/M junction had the lowest predicted Pitou score of 6.87, while WNV had the highest score of 15.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Secondly, we determined the cleavage efficiency of D2VLP by replacing P1-8 at the pr/M junction site of DENV-2 with sequences from different flaviviruses. Although the Pitou prediction of the CFAV pr/M junction did not result in a high score for cleavage, replacement with P1-8 of CFAV resulted in the most efficient furin cleavage for D2VLP, with only 31% of prM remaining uncleaved as compared to the 100% uncleaved imD2VLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). An additional mutation in the P3 residue from E to S of the CFAV P1-8 construct reduced the prM signaling to 13.7% of that of imD2VLP. We thus named this construct with the replacement of CFAV P1-8 plus the P3 E to S mutation as mD2VLP. The pr/M cleavage of this construct was increased to nearly 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Similar to wtD2VLP purified from plasmids transfected culture supernatants, the mD2VLP and imD2VLP showed consistent conformational integrity as ascertained by similar equilibrium banding profiles in 5 – 25% sucrose density gradients, as well as comparable particle size distributions as determined by negative staining electron microscopy, and complex glycosylation on the E proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38970.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the prM junction cleavage efficiency among different DENV-2 virus-like particles (D2VLPs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic drawing of the prM protein. The C-terminal of the prM protein contains an α-helical domain (MH) in the stem region, followed by two transmembrane domains (MT1 and MT2). Numbers refer to the position of the amino acids in the polyprotein starting at the first amino acid of prM according to DENV-2 (NP_056776). Single letter designations of amino acid sequence alignment of representative strains from different serocomplexes of flaviviruses at the prM junction site includes dengue virus serotypes 1 – 4 (DENV-1 to DENV-4), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), West Nile virus (WNV), tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), yellow fever virus (YFV), cell-fusion agent virus (CFAV), Zika virus (ZKV), immature DENV-2 VLP (imD2VLP) and mature DENV-2 VLP (mD2VLP). Numbers with P in the beginning refer to the positions of the amino acid relative to the prM cleavage site in the proximal direction (without apostrophe) and the distal direction (with apostrophe). Protein sequences were aligned, with the key P1 and P4 positions within the furin cleavage sites highlighted. The arrow indicates the prM cleavage site. The amino acids in red indicate the residues different from DENV-2. The PiTou 2.0 furin cleavage prediction scores are shown on the right for each sequence and the higher scores indicate the higher efficiency of furin cleavage. The relative quantity of prM and E of the wild-type and mutant DENV-2 VLP with P1-8 replacement (from other flaviviruses as shown) was measured by ELISA using MAb 3H5 (specific to E domain III of DENV-2) and MAb 155 – 49 (specific to DENV prM). The relative prM-to-E ratios were calculated by absorbance for prM/absorbance for E protein with reference to imD2VLP, whose pr portion was set as 100% uncleaved, as shown on the right.

However, the cryo-EM results showed low resolution due to particle size heterogeneity and no immunological data can be derived from such structure. To better understand if the structural organization of mD2VLP is similar to that of TBEV and its immunological characteristics, purified mD2VLPs were subjected to cryo-EM analysis. The results demonstrated that the mD2VLPs preparation had a variable size distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In order to perform the single particle 3D reconstruction, first of all, we used a dengue virus-specific Mab (MAb32-6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2012</xref>) to identify the mD2VLPs, it turned out that the spherical particles with a diameter of ~31 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), which were also the major population as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, were well bound by antibodies. Besides, the particles with diameter of ~31 nm had more solid features in 2D image analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and were able to obtain stable structure potentially than other groups. Therefore, we continued and focused on this population for further 3D reconstruction and image analyses. The results showed that the 31nm-diameter mD2VLPs at a resolution of 13.1 Å had a hollow structure and smooth surface with protrusions around the 5-fold positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, left, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Fitting the atomic E and M surface proteins PDB: 3J27) into the cryo-EM density map showed that the immunogold labelled mD2VLPs had 60 copies of E packed as dimers in a T = 1 icosahedral surface lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, right). The apparent differences of structural features on the mD2VLPs compared to the mature native virion particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kostyuchenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2013a</xref>) was a slimmer lipid bilayer and the rearrangements of the surface proteins. First, the central section through the viron and m2DVLP reconstructions showed that the bilayer of mD2VLP was relatively thinner than that of viron. The distance between the exterior leaflet and the interior leaflet of mD2VLP and virion was 12 Å and 14 Å, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). A similar T = 1 icosahedral symmetry of the E-protein arrangement and thinner lipid bilayer were also found in TBEV VLPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferlenghi et al., 2001</xref>). Second, interpretation of the map showed that E dimer subunits moved apart from each other causing less density in the intra-dimeric interphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Because of this loose interaction, a groove located within the E-protein dimer near the icosahedral 2-fold vertices on mD2VLP was noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, right, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Third, the central section showed that there was a solid density in the H-layer, which is composed of H helices of E and M protein stem regions, while the density in the T-layer, which contains transmembrane helices of E and M proteins, was weaker in the VLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Each E protein consists of an E ecto-domain and a stem region that connects the ecto-domain to its transmembrane region. The stem contains two α-helices, one of which interacts with the viral lipid membrane and the other with the E ecto-domain. This looser interaction of E protein dimers was further stabilized by the E protein rearrangement and the closer interaction with one of the α-helices, which resulted in the solid density beneath the ecto-domain as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. It is worth noting that the stem region of this mD2VLP was replaced into Japanese Encephalitis viral (JEV) sequence; it was previously suggested that this replacement increased the hydrophobicity for the interaction with the lipid membrane and enhanced the secretion of dengue VLP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Purdy and Chang, 2005</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38970.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The structure of mature form virus-like particles of dengue virus serotype 2 (mD2VLP).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The reconstructed cryo-EM map of the DENV VLPs (left panel) were presented with the radial color-code indicated (left), the size of the particle is 31 nm.

To address whether the higher neutralization activity induced by mD2VLP was partly due to the reduction of anti-prM antibodies that are known to be cross-reactive but have no neutralizing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dejnirattisai et al., 2010</xref>), we performed epitope-blocking ELISAs by using an anti-prM-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb 2H2). MAb 2H2 blocked only 7.59% of the activity of anti-mD2VLP sera but blocked up to 35.26% of antibodies from the imD2VLP-vaccinated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). To avoid steric hindrance due to Mab 2H2 binding, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on three amino acids of pr protein based on the following criteria: (1) the conservation of amino acids among all four serotypes; (2) residues interacting with MAb 2H2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2013</xref>); (3) residues not interfering with prM and E interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2008</xref>).

However, only the mutant Δ2H2-imD2VLP with F1A, K21D and K26P amino acid triple mutations completely prevent the binding of both MAb 2H2 and 155–49 but not that of DENV-2, E-specific Nt-MAb 3H5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). The sera from immunized mice were tested for their binding ability to the wild-type and mutant-Δ2H2 imD2VLP.

Thus, mD2VLP has the advantage of eliciting lower levels of anti-prM CR antibody and inducing antibodies with greater neutralizing activity.</p><p>The preservation of neutralizing epitopes on the surface of VLPs is critical for efficient production of broadly neutralizing antibody responses. Recent studies have suggested that human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) reactive with all dengue serotypes can neutralize DENV in the low picomolar range. These MAbs have a preference to bind at the envelope dimer epitopes preserved on virion particles with a high degree of maturity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rouvinski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dejnirattisai et al., 2015</xref>).

Substitutions at N103K, G104Q, K307E, E314R, T315H, P364R and W391G produced plasmids, which did not secrete measurable VLP antigens into the tissue culture medium.

MAb DM25-3 recognized mD2VLP very well, but reacted poorly with imD2VLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Next, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on the fusion loop peptide in domain II and A-strand in domain III, both of which are important binding regions for CR group/complex neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Alwis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tsai et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The results suggested that amino acid E-101 was likely important in the binding site of DM25-3. Residue 101 on the fusion loop of E protein is conserved among all four serotypes of DENV and can only be exposed when virion particles undergo low-pH induced conformational change or during the ‘breathing’ state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2013b</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> shows that residue 101 is located at the touching point between EDII and EDIII of the dimeric molecule. Since residue 101 is a critical residue in stabilizing E-protein dimers on DENV virion, mutation on 101 would disrupt viral particle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rouvinski et al., 2017</xref>). However, mD2VLP with a mutation of residue 101 can still form particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), which further support our cryoEM model that the E:E protein interactions on VLP are loose. When the E:E protein interaction was looser, residue 101 at the groove within the dimeric molecule was more exposed (64%) than on the native virion (23.8%, PDB:3J27) or on the native virion during the 37°C ‘breathing’ state (45.3%, PDB:3ZKO). We also generated a recombinant virus of DENV-2 whose EDIII was exchanged for a consensus EDIII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2013</xref>), and the recombinant virus PL046cEDIII was recovered from the transfected cell culture supernatants for use in ELISA and FRμNT. Compared to the parental DENV-2 strain PL046, there was significant loss of binding of MAb DM25-3 and immune mouse sera to PL046cEDIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), suggesting that DM25-3 could be an E-dimer inter-domain antibody whose binding footprint is sensitive to amino acid changes in the EDIII domain. By comparing FRμNT<sub>50</sub> tests using murine antisera on both PL046 and PL046cEDIII viruses, we found that anti-mD2VLP sera showed a greater difference in neutralizing activity against PL046 and PL046cEDIII than did anti-imD2VLP sera, indicating a greater conformational dependence for anti-mD2VLP-triggered neutralization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>The major obstacle of dengue vaccine development is the lack of a suitable small animal model to evaluate vaccine efficacy.

Recent studies suggest that potent human neutralizing antibodies with broad reactivity across dengue serocomplex can be generated from dengue patients, particularly after secondary infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rouvinski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dejnirattisai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tsai et al., 2013</xref>). Our unique findings here suggested that mD2VLP, with diameter of 31 nm and a scaffolding of multiple E-protein dimers similar to that of virion, could be capable of inducing such CR antibodies with broad neutralizing activity. This monovalent mature-form dengue VLP with ‘epitope re-surfaced’ has the potential to be the ‘epitope-focused’ antigens when combined with other live attenuated dengue vaccine to induce higher and broader neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rouvinski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rey et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Very few flavivirus studies explored the immunogenicity of prM-reduced VLP antigens and its capability in inducing broad NtAbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rouvinski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Keelapang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Suphatrakul et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Metz et al., 2017</xref>). In TBEV study, VLP preparation showed a range of size distribution with the majority fell into 31 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferlenghi et al., 2001</xref>). Greater than 90% of the particles are mature and immunogenic. On the contrary, WNV VLPs were secreted as large (40–50 nm) and small (20–30 nm) particle sizes, which showed different maturity and immunogenicity. The large VLPs with the size of virions (50 nm) are more mature and induced higher NtAb titers and more potent protection against WNV challenge than the small immature VLPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ohtaki et al., 2010</xref>). Similar design of prM-reduced D2VLP was used as immunogens but was produced from mosquito cells and such VLP required adjuvants to boost immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Suphatrakul et al., 2015</xref>). Other attempts using E-dimers without the co-expression of prM cannot only display the quaternary structure epitopes but also reduce the exposure of FLE epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rouvinski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Metz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Metz et al., 2018</xref>). However, the immunogenicity of such E-dimers with only two copies of E could be lower than VLP. The mD2VLP used in this study was produced from mammalian cells with the features similar to dengue virion, such as glycosylation pattern, particle distribution in gradient after high-speed centrifugation, epitopes preserved on the surface by the mapping of monoclonal antibodies, and mostly importantly, multiple copies of E structurally packed as dimers on the particle surface lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Compared to imD2VLP (35%), only 7.6% of prM-recognizing antibodies were induced by mD2VLP through 2H2-blocking assay. Current dengue vaccine candidates in the market such as CYD-TDV or others in clinical trial are either prM-possessing forms or E-protein monomer which is lack of quaternary epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wichmann et al., 2017</xref>).

Usually these epitopes are cryptic in mature virions maintained at 28°C and in a neutral-pH environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lok, 2016</xref>). By superimposing the E-dimer-dependent quaternary epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lok et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fibriansah et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rouvinski et al., 2015</xref>) onto the structure of mD2VLP, the binding footprints of these antibodies were highly overlapping and formed a ‘neutralization-sensitive hotspot’ on mD2VLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). In spite of its size heterogeneity, the underlying mechanisms of why mD2VLPs are able to stimulate an elevated and broader immune response could be based on the following: (1) epitope accessibility exposed at the grooves within E-protein dimers, which govern the generation of neutralizing antibodies; (2) removal of decoy epitopes presented on prM-containing structures found in imD2VLPs; and (3) inter-dimeric epitope accessibility due to the 5-fold and 3-fold openings of the E protein arrangement of T = 1. Other mechanisms cannot be excluded such as reducing the production of FLE-like antibodies (ie.

Previous studies have shown that neutralizing activity can be modulated by the maturity of virion in flavivirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pierson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nelson et al., 2008</xref>). Several murine cross-reactive weak neutralizing antibodies, such as 4G2, can have neutralizing activity against all four serotypes of DENV at high concentrations, although they can enhance the virus replication while at lower concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zellweger et al., 2010</xref>). To confirm this argument, we mutated amino acid 101 on fusion peptide of imD2VLP and compared the loss of binding of antibodies from the immuned mice sera with the wild-type imD2VLP. Mutation of amino acid 101 on imD2VLP disrupted the binding of murine Mab 4G2. Meanwhile, the results showed that the proportion of 4G2-like antibodies among the sera receiving imD2VLP immunization was greater than that of sera either receiving mD2VLP or wtD2VLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Recent studies suggested that the most potent neutralizing antibodies came from those recognizing quaternary epitopes on the smooth surface of dengue virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rouvinski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fibriansah et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crowe, 2017</xref>). Our study suggested that different types of D2VLP could raise different proportions of NtAbs, which are highly structure-dependent and could sometimes contribute to similar level of FRNT50, such as against DENV-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Despite the size heterogeneity, we have found that a mature form of monovalent VLP from dengue virus serotype two with ‘epitope re-surfaced’ is efficient in inducing elevated and broadly NtAbs targeting quaternary epitopes. We cannot exclude the possibility of that the protection of mD2VLP immunization against all four serotypes of DENV challenge could also be due to non-neutralizing mechanism such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Therefore, it is crucial to understand the type of neutralizing antibodies induced by vaccination and establish the association between the level of such B-cell mediated immunological response and protection in the future study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Katzelnick et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flipse and Smit, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Henein et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The major limitation of the current study is the unknown structure of imD2VLP or wtD2VLP to provide the proper explanation for the antibody response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) or murine Mab mapping results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Our in silico footprint analysis showed the epitopes of Mab 1A1D-2 on DIII were well exposed on mD2VLP and was compared to DENV-2 virion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), instead of imD2VLP. By comparing the structure of mD2VLP and D2 virion, it might be due to the groove within the E-protein dimer exposed several amino acids, including those located in both DI/II and DIII, previously suggested to be cryptic on virion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, our Mab mapping experiment was performed to compare between mD2VLP and imD2VLP. The results did confirm that several conformational-dependent Mabs, particularly those recognizing DI/II, were affected more by the structure of VLP with different maturity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The mapping results of Mab 1A1D-2 showing similar binding activity to both mD2VLP and imD2VLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) might indicate DIII was less affected by VLP maturity. This is consistent with the previous study in TBEV VLPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lorenz et al., 2003</xref>). Our current follow-up study is to solve the structure of imD2VLP, which might give a clear and direct picture of structural differences from Mab mapping.</p><p>Despite of size heterogeneity, our unique findings in this study showed that a mature, monovalent DENV-2 VLP with diameter of 31 nm possessing grooves within the E protein dimeric molecules on the surface of particles has the potential to induce highly protective, NtAbs against heterologous dengue viruses from all four serotypes. When combined delivery with other live attenuated vaccine, such as CYD-TDV or dengue tetravalent vaccine, there is potential to provide not just T-cell immunity, but also higher broad NtAb response through ‘epitope-focusing’ while exploring the next generation dengue vaccine in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crill et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flipse and Smit, 2015</xref>).

Normal COS-1 cell tissue culture fluid and cell pellets were used as control antigens. Captured antigens were detected by adding 50 μL of anti-DENV-2 MHIAF at 1:2000 in blocking buffer, incubated for 1 hr at 37°C, and washed for five times. Fifty microliters of HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Westgrove, PA, USA) at 1:5000 in blocking buffer was added to wells and incubated for 1 hr at 37°C to detect MHIAF. Subsequently, plates were washed ten times.

The imaging electron dosage was ~10 e<sup>-</sup>/Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhatt et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Variations in size and shape were observed in the EM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). The irregularly-shaped particles were eliminated through visual inspection, while the spherical particles were subjected to further image analyses. The particle size analyses showed that the major peaks were located at ~26 nm,~31 nm and ~36 nm diameter size classes which were therefore denoted by small (‘S’), medium (‘M’) and large (‘L’). The heterogeneity analyses by EMAN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tang et al., 2007</xref>) and XMIPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sorzano et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de la Rosa-Trevín et al., 2013</xref>) showed that all of the classes had distinct two layers and that the particles classes with diameters of 31 nm had more prominent features than others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Taken together with the immunogold labeling results, we selected the particles with size of ~31 nm or further 3D reconstruction process. The structure reconstruction processes were performed by EMAN2. There were 4217 spherical particles with the size of ~31 nm which were included in the reconstruction process and the icosahedral symmetry was imposed during the whole process. The reconstruction process ended when there was no improvement achieved. The resolution of the final reconstructions was 13.1 Å from a Fourier shell correlation curve using the gold standard resolution estimate in EMAN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of individual amino acid molecules on mD2VLP was calculated by POPS program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fornili et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cavallo et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Fitting</title><p>The atomic structure of mD2VLP was modeled based on the cryo-EM structure of the mature dengue virus at 3.5 Å resolution (PDB ID: 3J27) using MODELLER 9v15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eswar et al., 2007</xref>).

Anti-prM antibodies enhance disease pathogenesis by DENV and therefore represent a serious concern for DENV vaccine concepts. To address this problem, the investigators of this study have presented E protein on an immunogenic VLP-array and at the same time have manipulated the furin cleavage site of this envelope protein to substantially increase cleavage and ensure the presentation of the M form only (=mD2VLP). In contrast to VLP forms where E was not so manipulated, mD2VLP was more effective in mouse-DENV challenge models and could stimulate antibody responses with broader neutralizing properties. The authors engineered VLPs with different levels of prM and analyzed their epitopes recognized by known monoclonal antibodies and the antibody response elicited these VLPs with regard to epitope recognition and in vivo protection. The authors attempt to relate the structure of the mature VLP to its superior ability especially the &quot;open&quot; configuration of the E dimer in antibody accessibility and the ability to elicit better neutralization. The furin engineering concept represents an important advance in the field for advancing next generation DENV vaccines, and the study is largely well executed. While the authors' overall conclusions are likely correct, the VLP vaccine preparations were extremely heterogeneous, meaning that much of the structure-based conclusions on the vaccine preparation have been overstated and are quite misleading. These and other concerns that need to be addressed are noted below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A central concern is that the heterogeneity of the mD2VLP prep does not seem to be properly acknowledged. The title for example &quot;an epitope-resurfaced virus-like particle…&quot; or in the abstract &quot;mD2VLP particles possess a T=1 icosahedral symmetry with a groove located within the E-protein dimers near the 2-fold vertices that exposed highly overlapping, cryptic neutralizing epitopes through cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction&quot; are not reflective of the actual vaccine composition. There are many examples of uniform VLP-vaccine preps, but this does not appear to be one of them. Notably, there is considerable variation in the diameter and morphology of the VLPs (Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Then a follow up cryo em structure appears to have been selectively picked, but it does that does not seem to reflect the bulk population. Also, the structure of the other two forms of VLPs (wtD2VLP and imD2VLP) was not experimentally determined. In the literature, there are examples of particle vaccines that do pass uniformity tests, however the one reported in the paper does not. It is misleading to then claim to have a structure that then supplies certain downstream immunological effects. This is not to say non-uniform vaccines aren't worth having or making, especially those that provide efficacy. But, the structural interpretations and predictions (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 2—figure supplement 3, Figure 3—figure supplement 1, Figure 3—figure supplement 2) need to be toned down or removed because they are not representative of the vaccine preparation as a whole.</p><p>2) It is not immediately clear why Figure 7 is important. Why is it important to know which murine antibody families are used? If important, the DENV B cell probe needs to be properly validated; i.e. a pre-immune flow plot should be shown to demonstrate that the antibodies pulled out actually bind DENV. The DENV positive gate seems to include B cells that are likely not antigen specific.</p><p>3a) A number of findings that seem difficult to explain were not discussed in the manuscript. For example, in Figure 4, binding of 1A1-D2 (which recognizes a cryptic epitope of DIII which is supposedly more exposed in mD2VLP) to imD2VLP and mD2VLP was similar. This is not consistent with the main argument.</p><p>b) If one follows the authors' assertion that the antibody response was determined by the VLPs' structure and epitope accessibility, immunization with imD2VLPs should elicit primarily antibody responses to the conformational independent epitope of the fusion peptide and perhaps a minor response to other epitopes on DIII and should be poorly neutralizing. However, the neutralizing activity of the imD2VLP immune sera was comparable to wtD2VLP immune sera to DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4, and not different from mD2VLP immune sera to DEN-3 (Figure 5C). The difference in neutralizing activity elicited by these VLPs to various serotypes of DENV both in vitro and in vivo was also not explained and discussed.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;An epitope-resurfaced virus-like particle potentially induce broad neutralizing antibodies against dengue viruses&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Arup Chakraborty (Senior Editor and handling Reviewing Editor), and two reviewers.</p><p>Unfortunately, we do not think you have made significant changes in response to the major criticism regarding the size heterogeneity that does not support the structure related arguments made in the manuscript.

Claiming in the title &quot;An epitope-resurfaced virus-like particle…&quot; means something with respect to structure-based vaccine design – namely that a single re-engineered entity has been developed. But, you have have generated a preparation with reconfigured epitopes that is extremely heterogenous in size and morphology. However, given the problem of disease enhancement by anti-prM antibodies, the furin engineering concept represents an important advance worthy of publication in this journal.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The title needs revising to e.g. &quot;Epitope resurfacing on VLP vaccine preparation to…&quot;</p><p>2) A clear acknowledgement of the heterogeneity from the outset, in the abstract and beyond.

This does not seem to be accurate. The mD2VLP preparation consist of entities that are mostly not this. The authors need to state specifically that the structure presented can guide vaccine design, but likely does not represent what is precisely in the vaccine.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38970.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A central concern is that the heterogeneity of the mD2VLP prep does not seem to be properly acknowledged.

In TBEV study, VLP preparation showed a range of size distribution with the majority fell into 31nm as mature particles. However, WNV VLPs were secreted as large (40-50nm) and small (20-30nm) particle sizes, which show different degrees of maturity and immunogenicity. We agree with the reviewers and editors’ general comments that ex vivoprotection elicited by VLPs immunization cannot solely attribute to the protective immunity induced by 30nm-VLP due to the size heterogeneity of our preparation. We have toned down the conclusion and have revised in the manuscript including the Title and Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is not immediately clear why Figure 7 is important. Why is it important to know which murine antibody families are used? If important, the DENV B cell probe needs to be properly validated; i.e. a pre-immune flow plot should be shown to demonstrate that the antibodies pulled out actually bind DENV. The DENV positive gate seems to include B cells that are likely not antigen specific.</p></disp-quote><p>The initial intention of the experiment performed on Figure 7 is to find out if the CR Nt Mab identified from hybridoma fused between myeloid cell and splenocytes of mice immunized by mature VLP is due to clonal expansion. Although we cannot completely exclude the possibility of sorting non-DENV-specific B cell into the wells, the gating of either B220-positive or D2VLP-positive was done separately using control mouse splenocytes. We are currently undertaking the follow-up study to express heavy chain and light chain of DENV B cell clones. Recombinant antibodies will be used to compare their binding properties with the MAbs generated from hybridomas. Furthermore, we agree this portion of our manuscript cannot be substantiated and elect to remove the portion with Figure 7 from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3a) A number of findings that seem difficult to explain were not discussed in the manuscript. For example, in Figure 4, binding of 1A1-D2 (which recognizes a cryptic epitope of DIII which is supposedly more exposed in mD2VLP) to imD2VLP and mD2VLP was similar. This is not consistent with the main argument.</p></disp-quote><p>First, our best guess is that DIII is less affected by maturity of VLP and that’s the reason why the 1A1D-2 mapping results showed similar binding to three different D2VLPs. Second, based on the prediction of epitope accessibility between VLP and virion, the residues surrounding 1A1D-2 binding have overall higher surface/solvent accessibility in mD2VLPs than DENV-2 virions. We, thus, hypothesize that the use of mD2VLPs as immunogen are more accessible than imD2VLPs or wtD2 VLPs to naïve B-cells. However, the epitope-mapping used in this study may not be sufficiently sensitive to distinguish the difference in surface accessibility between mD2VLPs and imD2VLPs. Also, we don’t have the structure of imD2VLP. The prediction using DENV-2 immature virion, which was solved by Yu et al., cannot be directly extrapolate to imD2VLP. We are attempting to solve the structure of imD2VLP, and hopefully we can address the question directly. Overall our finding from Figure 4 is that the binding of several conformational-dependent MAbs are affected by the structural differences between mD2VLP and imD2VLP, as suggested from TBEV VLP studies. We have revised accordingly in Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) If one follows the authors' assertion that the antibody response was determined by the VLPs' structure and epitope accessibility, immunization with imD2VLPs should elicit primarily antibody responses to the conformational independent epitope of the fusion peptide and perhaps a minor response to other epitopes on DIII and should be poorly neutralizing. However, the neutralizing activity of the imD2VLP immune sera was comparable to wtD2VLP immune sera to DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4, and not different from mD2VLP immune sera to DEN-3 (Figure 5C). The difference in neutralizing activity elicited by these VLPs to various serotypes of DENV both in vitro and in vivo was also not explained and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>In our study, we showed that imD2VLP did induce significantly lower proportion of conformation-dependent epitope fusion peptide amino acid 101-specific antibody (Figure 6C) and antibodies recognizing DIII-conformational-independent epitopes (Figure 6E) compared to mD2VLP. Thus, theoretically, the immune response elicited by imD2VLP should be poorly neutralizing, as pointed out by the reviewers. However, the discrepancy of the results from neutralizing antibodies and the proportion of epitope-specific antibodies elicited by imD2VLP and D2VLP could be explained that other CR epitopes-recognizing conformation-independent antibodies such as 4G2-like antibodies, though poorly neutralizing, can still neutralize DENV while in a large quantity. To confirm this argument, we mutated amino acid 101 on fusion peptide of imD2VLP and compared the loss of binding of antibodies from the immuned mice sera with the wild-type imD2VLP (Figure 5—figure supplement 4). Mutation of amino acid 101 on imD2VLP disrupted the binding of murine Mab 4G2. Meanwhile, the results showed that the proportion of 4G2-like antibodies among the sera receiving imD2VLP immunization was greater than that of sera either receiving mD2VLP or wtD2VLP. We agree with the reviewers and have added one paragraph in Discussion section in the revised manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Unfortunately, we do not think you have made significant changes in response to the major criticism regarding the size heterogeneity that does not support the structure related arguments made in the manuscript.

Claiming in the title &quot;An epitope-resurfaced virus-like particle…&quot; means something with respect to structure-based vaccine design – namely that a single re-engineered entity has been developed. But, you have have generated a preparation with reconfigured epitopes that is extremely heterogenous in size and morphology. However, given the problem of disease enhancement by anti-prM antibodies, the furin engineering concept represents an important advance worthy of publication in this journal.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The title needs revising to e.g. &quot;Epitope resurfacing on VLP vaccine preparation to…&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers and the title has been revised as such “Epitope resurfacing on dengue virus-like particle vaccine preparation to induce broad neutralizing antibody”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A clear acknowledgement of the heterogeneity from the outset, in the abstract and beyond. E.g. in abstract &quot;herein we show for the first time that mD2VLP particles possess a T=1 icosahedral symmetry with a groove located within the E 52protein dimers near the 2-fold vertices that exposed highly overlapping, cryptic neutralizing 53 epitopes through cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction&quot;. This does not seem to be accurate. The mD2VLP preparation consist of entities that are mostly not this. The authors need to state specifically that the structure presented can guide vaccine design, but likely does not represent what is precisely in the vaccine.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers and the Abstract has been revised to acknowledge the size heterogeneity of dengue VLP vaccine preparation.</p><p>Also, mD2VLP with diameter of 31nm as epitope-resurfacing features has been further emphasized in the Results section and the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
