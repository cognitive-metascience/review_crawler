Nerve cells are generally composed of a cell body, multiple dendrites, and a single axon. The dendrites are responsible for receiving inputs and for transferring these signals to the cell body, whereas the axon carries signals away from the cell body and relays them to other cells.</p><p>Like all cells, nerve cells have a cytoskeleton made up of microtubules, which help to determine cellular shape and which act as ‘highways' for intracellular transport. Microtubules are long hollow fibers composed of alternating α- and β-tubulin proteins: each microtubule has a ‘plus'-end, where the β subunits are exposed, and a ‘minus'-end, where the α subunits are exposed. Nerve cells are highly polarized: within the axon, the microtubules are uniformly oriented with their plus-ends pointing outward, whereas in dendrites, there are many microtubules with their minus-ends pointing outward. This arrangement is conserved across the animal kingdom, but the mechanisms that establish it are largely unknown.</p><p>Yan et al. use the model organism <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (the nematode worm) to conduct a detailed in vivo analysis of dendritic microtubule organization. They find that a motor protein called kinesin-1 is critical for generating the characteristic minus-end-out pattern in dendrites: when the gene that codes for this protein is knocked out, the dendrites in microtubules undergo a dramatic polarity shift and adopt the plus-end-out organization that is typical of axons. The mutant dendrites also show other axon-like features: for example, they lack many of the proteins that are usually found in dendrites. Based on these and other data, Yan et al. propose that kinesin-1 determines microtubule polarity in dendrites by moving plus-end-out microtubules out of dendrites.</p><p>These first attempts to explain, at the molecular level, how dendritic microtubule polarity is achieved in vivo could lead to new insights into the structure and function of the neuronal cytoskeleton.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00133.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00133.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>polarity</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>kinesin-1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Kang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A cellular motor protein helps to ensure that microtubules are oriented correctly within neuronal dendrites</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons are highly polarized cells that usually elaborate two sets of morphologically and functionally distinct processes: a single long axon that sends out information to its targets, and multiple shorter dendrites that receive synaptic input from the environment or other neurons. Among the many differences between axons and dendrites, one distinct feature is that they have different microtubule (MT) organization. MTs, composed of strands of tubulin polymers, are dynamic structures with two molecularly and functionally distinct ends: a plus-end that favors polymerization and supports net growth and a minus-end that favors depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Howard and Hyman, 2003</xref>). Since MTs in neurites provide the platform for intracellular transport, and molecular motors such as kinesins and dyneins migrate toward either the plus- or minus-ends, MT polarity might play an important role in determining the directionality of transport events. One way to measure MT polarity in vivo is to perform time-lapse imaging studies using the EB family members of the TIPs (Tip Interacting Proteins), which bind transiently to the growing plus-ends of MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baas and Lin, 2011</xref>). Based on the behavior of EB1 in neurites, it was cohesively concluded that MTs are uniformly polarized with their plus-ends oriented toward the distal tip in axons from worm to rodents. In the dendrites, MTs are mixed in the proximal region and uniformly plus-end-out in distal parts in cultured vertebrate neurons, whereas MTs exhibit a mixed orientation with minus-ends predominantly facing the distal dendrite in worm and fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baas et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baas et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stepanova et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rolls et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stone et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kollins et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kapitein and Hoogenraad, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maniar et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Unlike in nonneuronal cells, where most MTs extend out from the microtubule organization center (MTOC) that harbors the minus-ends, the majority of neuronal MTs have ‘free-floating' ends, raising the question of whether these microtubules are locally polymerized or transported from the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baas and Lin, 2011</xref>). Based on direct observation of short MT strand movement in cultured neurons, Baas and colleagues proposed a model in which the MT-based motors dynein and several mitotic kinesins directly slide MT strands into the axon and dendrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baas, 1999</xref>). More recently, Jan and colleagues showed that dynein was required for the uniform plus-end-out MT organization in <italic>Drosophila</italic> sensory neuron axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zheng et al., 2008</xref>). In dynein mutants, about 30% of the axonal MTs exhibit a minus-end-out orientation, whereas the dendritic MT polarity remains intact. Another recent study showed that the axon-localized MT-binding protein UNC-33/CRMP plays an important role in orienting dynamic MTs in both axons and dendrites in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maniar et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>unc-33</italic> mutants, both the axon and dendrite exhibit polarity defects. However, how predominant minus-end-out MT polarity is established in the dendrite remains largely unknown.</p><p>The signature pattern of MT polarity provides structural characteristics for axons and dendrites. In addition, the polarity pattern of MTs likely instructs the transport of motor-based polarized cargo and distribution of asymmetrical cellular material in the neuron. Thus, MT polarity might play an instrumental role in the establishment of neuronal polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baas, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoogenraad and Bradke, 2009</xref>). Here, we show that kinesin-1 is critical in generating the characteristic minus-end-out MT organization of the dendrite in vivo. Kinesin-1 (previously called kinesin heavy chain or KHC) is a plus-end-directed motor and has been reported to transport various cargoes including mitochondria, synaptic vesicles, and mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vale, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hirokawa and Takemura, 2005</xref>). Like other kinesin family members, kinesin-1 contains an N-terminal motor domain, a coiled-coil region for dimerization, and a C-terminal tail domain for cargo binding and regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vale, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adio et al., 2006</xref>). It has been showed that the kinesin-1 tail domain directly binds to MTs and mediates MT sliding in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Navone et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jolly et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Seeger and Rice, 2010</xref>). In <italic>unc-116</italic> (kinesin-1/kinesin heavy chain) mutants, we find that dendritic MT polarity is completely reversed and adopts an axonal-like plus-end-out organization. The consequences of this polarity reversal in the dendrite include ectopic accumulation of synaptic vesicles (SVs) and active zone proteins, and loss of dendritic enrichment of dendritic proteins. These results demonstrate that the proper polarized MT organization is essential for conferring neurite identity because it specifies the compartmental distribution of vital axonal and dendritic constituents such as SVs and neurotransmitter receptors in vivo. We also provide evidence that kinesin-1 is able to cross-link anti-parallel MTs in vitro. Combined with the structure–function analyses, we propose that kinesin-1 regulates the dendrite MT polarity through directly gliding the plus-end-out MTs out of the dendrite using both the motor domain and the C-terminal MT-binding domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MT polarity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons</title><p>In order to understand the molecular mechanisms and physiological importance of differential neuronal MT organization, we studied MT organization in two bipolar neurons in <italic>C. elegans.</italic> The ventrally localized DA9 cell body elaborates two functionally distinct processes. An axon migrates to the dorsal nerve cord, where it extends anteriorly and forms presynaptic specializations, and a dendrite extends anteriorly along the ventral nerve cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">White et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sym et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klassen and Shen, 2007</xref>). MT motors fused to a fluorescence tag have previously been used as indicators for MT polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clark et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stone et al., 2008</xref>). To examine MT polarity in the DA9 neuron, we expressed fluorescent proteins fused with retrograde and anterograde motors, which should accumulate at the minus- and plus-ends of MTs, respectively. We found that YFP-tagged UNC-104/Kinesin3 exhibits dim diffuse fluorescence along the axon with dramatic accumulation at the distal tip, but is completely absent from the dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Conversely, DHC-1/dynein heavy chain fused with GFP shows weak staining along the dendrite with accumulation at the distal tip of the dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition, GFP fused to the slow Ncd family minus-end kinesin, KLP-16, exhibits a graded fluorescence signal from proximal to distal dendrite with accumulation at the distal tip of the dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The specific localization of the tagged KLP-16 motor is dependent on its motor activity, as motor-dead versions are largely diffuse through the DA9 processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These localization data are consistent with previous observations made in mammalian and <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons, which suggest that MTs are uniformly plus-end-out in the axon and predominantly minus-end-out in the dendrite.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00133.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>UNC-116 (kinesin-1) is required for the minus-end-out MT polarity in the DA9 dendrite.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of the morphology of the DA9 neuron.

We first compared the development of the DA9 dendrite in wild-type and <italic>unc-116</italic> animals. In wild-type animals, DA9 axonal outgrowth and neuromuscular junction formation occur embryonically, whereas most dendrite outgrowth takes place postembryonically starting from the L1 stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Teichmann and Shen, 2011</xref>). Upon reaching adulthood, the DA9 axon and dendrite achieve stereotyped lengths. In the <italic>unc-116(e2310)</italic> mutants, the sequence and directionality of axonal and dendrite outgrowth as well as the length of the axon are indistinguishable from that of the wild-type strain. The length of the DA9 dendrite, however, is dramatically longer compared with wild-type animals at every stage of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). To determine whether MT-dependent vesicle transport is affected by <italic>unc-116(e2310)</italic>, we examined localization of synaptic vesicle (SV) markers. The UNC-104/Imac/kinesin3 motor traffics SVs to presynaptic specializations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hall and Hedgecock, 1991</xref>), and synaptic vesicle proteins like RAB-3 exclusively accumulate in the axon of wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In <italic>unc-104(e1265)</italic> mutants, SV markers are completely absent from the axon, accumulating instead in the cell body and dendrite due to the activity of dynein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ou et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, we found that in <italic>unc-116(e2310)</italic> mutants, both the axon and dendrite contain a similar number of vesicle clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). If this ectopic accumulation of SVs in the dendrite is due to the switch of MT polarity to axon-like plus-end-out arrangement (rather than to the activity of dynein), then the accumulation of SVs in the DA9 dendrite should depend on the UNC-104 kinesin motor. Indeed, in <italic>unc-104(e1265);unc-116(e2310)</italic> double mutants, SVs are largely absent from both processes and trapped in the cell body. These results argue that UNC-116 is not directly involved in SV transport in the DA9 neuron; rather, it creates the minus-end-out MT polarity of the dendrite. As a result of this aberrant MT polarity, the plus-end motor UNC-104 promotes locomotion of cargoes into the dendrite. If our model is correct, the <italic>unc-116</italic> mutations should not only affect RAB-3 but also other synaptic vesicle proteins and active zone proteins. Indeed, the active zone protein SYD-2/liprin and other SV markers like SNG-1/synaptogyrin show similar ectopic localization to DA9 dendrites in the <italic>unc-116(e2310)</italic> mutants, suggesting that the changes in MT polarity affect the entire presynaptic structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00133.013</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Dendrite exhibits axonal-like properties in <italic>unc-116</italic> mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>)–(<bold>D</bold>) Distribution of GFP::RAB-3 puncta (left panels) and represented schematic diagrams (right panels) in wild-type (<bold>A</bold>), <italic>unc-116</italic> (<bold>B</bold>), <italic>unc-104</italic> (<bold>C</bold>), and <italic>unc-116;unc-104</italic> mutant animals (<bold>D</bold>).

Like kinesin-1, UNC-116 is composed of an N-terminal motor domain, a putative coiled-coil dimerization stalk region, and a C-terminal tail domain that binds to kinesin light chains (KLCs), adaptors, and cargos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vale, 2003</xref>). Interestingly, several recent biochemical and cell biology experiments have shown that part of the C-terminal tail domain of kinesin-1 binds directly to MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Navone et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dietrich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Seeger and Rice, 2010</xref>). It was also demonstrated that kinesin-1 could cross-link and glide MTs using in vitro assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Palacios and St Johnston, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamada et al., 2010</xref>). To understand how UNC-116 regulates dendrite MT polarity, we considered two possible models in which UNC-116/kinesin-1 directly transport the minus-end-out MTs into dendrites or transport the plus-end-out MTs out of dendrites via interaction of its C-terminal MT-binding domain with the cargo MTs. In either scenario, it requires kinesin-1 selectively cross-link anti-parallel MTs. We first tested it using in vitro MTs bundling assay. When purified tubulins were polymerized into MTs, the MTs were found as isolated microtubules with the appearance of smooth surface under the electron microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Addition of purified kinesin-1 complex from bovine brain to the MTs causes the dispersed MTs to adopt a more ‘rough' surface due to the binding of kinesin-1 to MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). When both of kinesin-1 and mNUDC were added to the MTs, we found that MTs were bundled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The MT bundles are superficially similar to those reconstructed from flagellar axonemal dyneins and MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ueno et al., 2008</xref>). No such bundles were observed in control samples containing just taxol-stabilized MTs or in mixtures of MTs with kinesin-1 only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Neighboring MTs in the bundles has an interval of ∼80 nm. Considering kinesin-1 has a long flexible stalk (maximum ∼80 nm; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hirokawa et al., 1989</xref>) and mNUDC is an adapter protein, it is conceivable that the cross-bridges represent a complex of kinesin-1 and mNUDC. Furthermore, we determined the polarity of the cross-linked MTs from their Moiré patterns of protofilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chretien et al., 1996</xref>), and determined orientation of 13 pairs of MTs cross-linked by kinesin-1. Nine pairs (69%) of microtubule bundles were anti-parallel with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 39% and 91% by <italic>F</italic>-test for binominal distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D-D2</xref>). The lower limit of CI exceeds 50% when a significant level is 13.4% using one-tailed <italic>F</italic>-tests. Therefore, kinesin-1-mNUDC complex tends to cross-link anti-parallel microtubule bundles.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00133.017</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Purified kinesin-1 complex bundles anti-parallel MTs in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>)–(<bold>C</bold>) Negatively stained EM images of (<bold>A</bold>) MTs alone, (<bold>B</bold>) kinesin-1-MTs, and (<bold>C</bold>) kinesin-1-NudC-MTs.

The molecular lesion of <italic>e2310</italic> is a TC5 transposon insertion. The transposon was inserted after residue 692, which truncates the C-terminal MT-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Patel et al., 1993</xref>). Point mutations are found in the motor domain in wy270 and rh24sb79 alleles, which likely result in partial loss of motor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2005</xref> and unpublished data). These results suggest that both motor activity and C-terminal MT-binding might be required for this newly defined function of UNC-116/kinesin-1. To definitively test this, we created a mutant form of UNC-116 in which three point mutations were introduced in the C-terminal MT-binding motif. The same mutations diminish the binding of kinesin-1 C-terminal domain to MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Seeger and Rice, 2010</xref>). Therefore, this mutant form (UNC-116<sub>MT</sub>) might specifically lack its ability to bind to MTs with the C-terminal motif. We tested whether this form can still rescue the dendrite polarity phenotypes as well as phenotypes related to the canonical transport function of UNC-116. To assess the canonical organelle transport function of UNC-116, we examined localization of mitochondria in DA9. In wild-type animals, a mitochondrial marker TOM-20::YFP localizes to discrete puncta in both the axon and dendrite of DA9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In <italic>unc-116(e2310)</italic> mutants, the TOM-20 signal is completely absent from both processes and only found in the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that UNC-116 is required for transporting mitochondria to both axon and dendrite. DA9 expression of UNC-116<sub>MT</sub> efficiently rescues the TOM-20 localization defect in the axon, suggesting that this mutant form of UNC-116 can support the organelle transporting function. Interestingly, but the same transgene showed much less rescue of the MT polarity defects in the dendrite, as assayed by KLP-16 localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This result is consistent with the notion that the C-terminal MT-binding motif of UNC-116 is specifically required for the establishing dendritic MT polarity. In addition, UNC-116<sub>MT</sub> efficiently rescues the abnormally long dendrites in the <italic>unc-116(e2310)</italic> mutant, suggesting that this length phenotype is independent of the MT polarity.</p><p>To further explore the difference between the MT-polarity-related function of UNC-116 and its canonical vesicular and organelle transport function, we studied the kinesin light chains, KLC-1 and KLC-2. Consistent with previous reports, KLC-2 is required for axonal localization of TOM-20, suggesting that the KLCs are required for the organelle transport function of UNC-116 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, neither <italic>klc-1</italic> or <italic>klc-2</italic> single mutants nor <italic>klc-1</italic>; <italic>klc-2</italic> double mutants showed any defects in MT polarity markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that they are dispensable for the MT polarity function of UNC-116. Indeed, the MT-gliding activity of kinesin-1 in nonpolarized <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells is also independent of KLCs, suggestive of a similar mode of action in nonneuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jolly et al., 2010</xref>). Taken together, our structure–function analyses have revealed a novel function of UNC-116 in regulating dendritic MT polarity. This function requires both motor activity and C-terminal MT binding, and can be separated from the canonical vesicular and organelle trafficking function of UNC-116 both at the level of cargo-binding domains as well as the dependency on kinesin light chains.</p><p>How does UNC-116/kinesin-1 promote minus-end-out MTs configuration in the dendrite? Our genetic data so far are consistent with two models. In the first model, UNC-116/kinesin-1 directly slides minus-end-out MTs into dendrites. Alternatively, UNC-116 might slide plus-end-out MTs out of dendrite and consequently increase the percentage of the minus-end-out MTs in dendrites. In order to differentiate these two models, we analyzed the MTs concentration in the dendrite and axon. We reasoned that if UNC-116/kinesin-1 slides minus-end-out MTs into dendrite, there would be less MTs in the dendrite of mutant animals. If UNC-116/kinesin-1 slides plus-end-out MTs out of dendrite, there would be more MTs in the dendrite of mutant. We visualized the MTs structure by expressing GFP::TBA-1/ α-tubulin in the DA9 neuron. In wild-type animals, axon has higher expression of GFP::TBA-1, with a dendrite/ventral axon intensity ratio around 0.6. In <italic>unc-116(e2310)</italic> animals, axon expression of GFP::TBA-1 remains largely unchanged, whereas expression in the dendrite increases, with a dendrite/axon intensity ratio around 1.2, suggestive of excessive MTs in the <italic>unc-116</italic> mutant dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>). Another measure of the number of MTs is the frequency of EBP-2::GFP comets, which directly reflects the number of dynamic plus-ends. We found that EBP-2::GFP comets in the <italic>unc-116</italic> mutant DA9 dendrite is three times more frequent comparing to wild type, further indicating there are more MTs in <italic>unc-116(e2310)</italic> dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig6">Figures 2C, 6F</xref>). Collectively, these data favor the model that UNC-116/kinesin-1 maintains minus-end-out MT polarity in dendrite through selectively sliding plus-end-out MTs out of dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We report a new function of kinesin-1 to promote the minus-end-out MT organization in the dendrite. Previous studies in neuronal cell cultures showed that intracellular transport of short MTs occurs robustly in neurites and can be driven by mitotic kinesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baas et al., 2006</xref>). While we did not find evidence that mitotic kinesins are required for DA9 MT organization, our data provide in vivo evidence that transport of MTs by another kinesin, kinesin-1, in the dendrite is critical for establishing or maintaining MT polarity. An interesting study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> sensory neurons showed that the minus-end motor dynein is required for the uniform plus-end-out MT organization in the axon but dispensable for dendritic MT organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zheng et al., 2008</xref>). A recent study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuron showed that another motor kinesin-2 complex is required to steer MTs growth in the dendrite branch point to maintain the uniform minus-end-out MT polarity in the dendrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mattie et al., 2010</xref>). Since kinesin-1 is highly conserved throughout evolution, we anticipate our findings to be a starting point for more sophisticated in vitro or in vivo analyses of MT polarity in neurons. If UNC-116/kinesin-1 slides plus-end-out MTs out of dendrites, one immediate question is how this process is restricted to dendrites. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maniar et al. (2012)</xref> recently showed that the MT-associated axon initial segment (AIS)-enriched protein UNC-33/CRMP is important for MT organization in both the axon and dendrite in worm sensory neurons. The AIS has been reported to play important roles in neuronal polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hedstrom et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sobotzik et al., 2009</xref>). It is conceivable that AIS proteins provide critical regulatory roles for motor-based MT sliding by restricting the direction of MT transport. Interestingly, the AIS in vertebrate neurons is known to serve as a diffusion barrier for both transmembrane and cytosolic proteins. How it regulates MT transport will be an interesting question for future studies.</p><p>The compartmentalization of neurons is achieved by several cell biological mechanisms including directed intracellular trafficking, local sequestration, diffusion barriers, and transcytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kennedy and Ehlers, 2006</xref>). Previous studies have also reported the existence of ‘smart motors' that are capable of distinguishing axonal and dendritic MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Saito et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marszalek et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guillaud et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kapitein et al., 2010</xref>). The existing literature raises the question of what functional role is played by MT polarity, an important question that cannot be answered without a polarity-altering tool. The <italic>unc-116</italic> mutants specifically affect MT polarity in dendrites, and therefore serve as useful reagents to dissect the importance of dendritic MT polarity. Our data strongly support the notion that the minus-end-out MTs in dendrites not only allow for the accumulation of dendritic proteins but are also critical for the exclusion of axonal components such as synaptic vesicles and active zone proteins. Furthermore, MT polarity appears to affect the length of the dendrite, suggesting that both the structural and transport functions of MTs depend on their polarity. Interestingly, the direction and timing of dendrite outgrowth are not affected in <italic>unc-116</italic> mutants, suggesting that MT polarity does not play a critical role in dendrite outgrowth, a process in which the actin cytoskeleton is known to play an important role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 1999</xref>). Together, these data argue that polarized MT tracks play instructive roles in formation of axonal and dendritic identities, as well as in the compartmentalization of axonal and dendritic constituents such as SVs, active zone proteins, and neurotransmitter receptors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and genetics</title><p>Worms were raised on NGM plates at 20°C using OP50 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> as a food source.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of <italic>eLife's</italic> Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviewers' reports.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers found the study of potentially high significance since it tackles an important and unresolved problem in neurobiology, namely the molecular mechanisms polarizing neurons and, in particular, the role of microtubules and molecular motors in axon/dendrite specification. The discovery that kinesin-driven microtubule transport might participate to the unique microtubule orientation characterizing the dendrite in <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons is potentially interesting and novel.</p><p>However, at this point, the reviewers raised a number of concerns regarding the interpretation of some of the results, the validity of some the quantitative analysis, and some general aspects of the data presentation. If you can address the following major comments with new experiments, improved quantitative analysis, and revised text, we would like to consider a revised version.</p><p>1. Interpretation of the data: the authors claim that the conversion of microtubule orientation (minus end distal into plus end distal) in the kinesin-1 mutant is due to the microtubule transport function of kinesin-1, which might selectively transport minus-end microtubules to the distal end of the dendrite. The reviewers propose that, based on the plus-end direction of kinesin-1 transport, an equally likely interpretation of the authors' data is that kinesin-1 may function to promote transport of plus-end microtubules out of the dendrite into the cell body. The authors conclude the reverse (that ‘…dynein moves minus-end out MT out of the axon, while kinesin-1 moves minus-end out MT into dendrites'). The authors should consider this alternative interpretation of their results that kinesin-1 moves plus-end distal MTs out of the dendrites by using their plus-end directed motor activity to transport plus-end MT towards the cell body, that is out of the dendrite In the same vein, their conclusion schema (Figure 6G) is a bit confusing in this regard: in most of the paper, the authors represent minus-end microtubules distal in dendrites and the circle represents the cell body. In Figure 6G the circle indicates the distal end of the dendrite. The authors should make sure this is not a mistake. They should try to make clearer the difference between ‘long minus end out' MTs and the fragment/transported plus-end out MTs (maybe using a different color). The authors must discuss how they envision that kinesin-1 can establish minus end-out microtubules. If this motor were to slide microtubules along each other in dendrites, all of the microtubules would eventually collapse into the cell body. Finally, can the authors comment on the localization pattern of kinesin-1 in DA9? Is it found in the dendrite as the model in Figure 6G predicts?</p><p>2. More experiments on <italic>Unc-116</italic>: the authors should be more accurate when they describe the <italic>e2310</italic> allele of <italic>Unc-116</italic> (kinesin-1). For example, they mention that this allele ‘…likely represents a partial loss of kinesin activity'. But then they mention the study from Patel and colleagues, suggesting that <italic>e2310</italic> mutation affects a residue at the ‘…C-terminal end of kinesin-1 adjacent to the MT binding motif'. This is unlikely to affect kinesin-1 motor activity as suggested earlier. The authors argue that the C-terminal domain of <italic>unc-116</italic> is likely to bind microtubules based on sequence similarity (but not identity) of the MT binding domain to homologs, but whether the <italic>C. elegans</italic> sequence binds to MTs is not known. The major model presented by the authors will be strengthened by these data if the resources are available to perform this work. Finally, does <italic>unc-116</italic>-MT rescue the dendrite elongation defect of <italic>unc-116</italic> mutants? This experiment is relevant as the authors indicate in the Discussion that MT polarity appears to affect the length of the dendrite, when this could in principle be due to organelle trafficking roles.</p><p>3. More quantification: while the data are generally high quality, certain arguments would be strengthened by additional quantification, for example quantification is lacking from main Figures 1, 4, and 5.</p><p>4. One reviewer felt the authors were potentially misleading in the title and abstract by not indicating that they have investigated this in worms, rather than in mammals. The authors should improve their Introduction and how they formulate the question tackled. At the end of the first paragraph of the introduction, the authors state “dendritic MTs exhibit a mixed orientation with minus-ends predominantly facing the distal dendrite…”. This is not correct: it has been established that in mammalian systems, microtubules are of mixed polarity in the proximal region of the dendrite but are predominantly plus end-out in the distal dendrite (Baas 1988; Stepanova 2003; Kollins 2009; etc.). This has been very nicely reviewed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20817096">Kapitein and Hoogenraad</ext-link>, Mol Cell Neurosci 2011. The authors should improve their Discussion and quoting of the literature. For example, there are several more recent reviews with more relevant information than the ones cited (Hirokarwa 1998; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vale 2003</xref>). More significantly, kinesin-2 has been shown to be required for minus end-out microtubule orientation in flies (Mattie et al Curr Biol 2010). The authors should cite this paper and discuss the relevance of their work to this paper.</p><p>5. It seems that dendritic outgrowth of the DA9 neuron occurs during post-embryonic development, suggesting that microtubule polarity of the dendrite is set up at L1. One reviewer feels it would be appropriate to demonstrate microtubule polarity via (+) and (-) end markers and the establishment of longer dendrites at L1 through adult stages to further support their hypothesis that in <italic>unc-116</italic> animals the dendrite takes on a longer, more axonal like configuration with reversed MT polarity.</p><p>[Editors'note: during revisions the editors made the following suggestion.]</p><p>The reviewers agreed that it would be beneficial to re-include the data regarding the dendrite elongation phenotype that you removed during the first revisions:</p><p>“[We] raised the issue of the basis for the dendrite elongation phenotype, which the authors have sorted out, but [we] felt that entirely removing the dendrite phenotype is not the best solution in the revision since the paper now refers to a lack of all other morphological defects (dendrite axon directionality and axon growth), but awkwardly omits dendrite length. The basis of this phenotype appears complex, yet [we] feel the authors should find a way to include at least the basic observation.”</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00133.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We have followed the suggestions of the reviewers and performed additional experiments. The most constructive suggestion from the review was that our genetic data could be interpreted by two different models. One model is the one that we had originally presented: Kinesin-1 shuffles minus-end-out MTs into the dendrite. The alternative model is that Kinesin-1 shuffles plus-end-out MTs out of dendrite into the soma. We have performed two experiments to distinguish these two models. The new results favor the alternative model proposed by the reviewers. Accordingly, we have changed the manuscript to reflect these results. We have also included new in vitro data that directly support our model.</p><p>Since the in vitro experiments we added were not requested by the reviewers, we will describe them first before providing a direct reply to all the questions.</p><p>The genetic results we showed were consistent with the model that UNC-116/Kinesin-1 establishes the minus-end-out MT polarity in dendrites. Through structure-function analysis, we propose that kinesin-1 potentially binds to MTs with its C-terminal tail domain and slides anti-parallel MTs against each other. To directly test if Kinesin-1 can crosslink anti-parallel MTs, we collaborated with Dr. Hirotsune's laboratory, who performed in vitro MT cross-linking assays with the kinesin-1 complex. Consistent with previous literature, they found that kinesin-1 could cross-link MTs. They further used cryo-EM to determine the polarity of the cross-linked MTs. They found that the majority of MTs are of anti-parallel polarity (Figure 5). While these experiments were performed with vertebrate proteins, we feel that it provided valuable support for our model. We therefore included the data in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We want to be upfront about the low case number for the EM reconstruction of the MTs in this analysis. Since the assay is incredibly time consuming, we could only complete the reconstruction of 13 pairs of MTs, out of which 9 pairs are anti-parallel and 4 pairs are parallel. While the anti-parallel MTs accounts for the majority of the cases, it does not reach statistical significance based on these numbers. We are open to not including these data if the reviewers and editors advise us to do so.</p><p>Below is the point-by-pointreply to the questions raised by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>1) Interpretation of the data</italic>.</p><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for coming up with this alternative model. Our original model is that “Kinesin-1 slides minus-end-out microtubules (MTs) into dendrites”. The alternative model states that “Kinesin-1 slides plus-end-out microtubules out of dendrites”.</p><p>The results we presented in the original manuscript are consistent with both models. Therefore, we performed two experiments to distinguish the two models. We reasoned that if the original model is correct, in <italic>unc-116</italic> mutants, the net number of MTs should decrease compared to the wild-type animals. On the contrary, the alternative model would predict that in <italic>unc-116</italic> mutants, the net number of MTs should increase. We used two methods to measure the relative concentration of MTs in dendrites.</p><p>First, we used a GFP::tubulin (GFP::TBA-1) transgene to assess the overall level of MTs. Since the absolute fluorescence intensity is affected by the expression level of the transgenes, we used the ratio between the dendrite and axon fluorescence as a measure for the relative enrichment of MTs in the dendrite vs. axon. We found that <italic>unc-116</italic> mutants show significantly higher MT abundance compared to the wild type (Figure 6E, error bars represent standard deviation).</p><p>Second, we analyzed the frequency of the EBP-2::GFP comets as a measure of the number of dynamic MTs in DA9 dendrites. Interestingly, we again found that <italic>unc-116</italic> mutant dendrites have three times higher frequency of EBP-2::GFP comets compared to the wild-type controls. No difference was found in the axons between mutant and wild type.</p><p>Together, both experiments support the alternative model and suggest that Kinesin-1 regulates the minus-end-out MT polarity in the dendrite by specifically transporting plus-end-out MTs out of the dendrite. In the <italic>unc-116</italic> mutants, plus-end-out MTs accumulate in the dendrite and lead to the erosion of polarity.</p><p>Regarding the conclusion schema (Figure 6G), the symbol was indeed a mistake. We apologize for that and we have corrected it. We have also distinguished the longer MTs and shorter transporting MTs with two different colors as the reviewers suggested. We envision that the kinesin-1 slides plus-end-out MTs out of the dendrite to create the dominant polarity of minus-end-out MTs in the DA9 dendrite. We envision that this function must be regulated. From the EBP-2::GFP experiments, it is clear that a small percentage of MTs are plus-end-out even in the wild type dendrites.</p><p>We have also created UNC-116::GFP to examine the localization of this motor in DA9. Similar to the UNC-104::GFP construct, we found that the vast majority of fluorescence is found at the tip of the axon, again supporting the plus-end-out MT polarity in the axon. We do not find a high level of UNC-116::GFP in the dendrite as expected. However, these experiments are not perfect since they detect transgenically expressed UNC-116. In this case, even antibody staining will likely not be useful, as it will lose the cellular specificity attained by the DA9 dendrite being tightly associated with the ventral nerve cord. It is therefore impossible to differentiate the potential signal from DA9 and those from the many other neurites. One related note is that kinesin-1 was found in the vertebrate dendrites (Nakata and Hirokawa, 2003).</p><p><italic>2) More experiments on</italic> Unc-116.</p><p>We have sequenced the <italic>e2310</italic> allele and confirmed the previously reported TC5 transposon insertion. The transposon was inserted into the C-terminal coding region of <italic>unc-116</italic>, which results in a premature stop codon after residue 692, which truncates the potential MT-binding domain and the very C-terminal IAK motif of kinesin-1/UNC-116. The IAK motif was shown to be important for regulating the motor activity of kinesin-1 (Wong et al., 2009). So we anticipate that <italic>e2310</italic> allele will cause impaired motor activity.</p><p>In order to test whether the putative MT-binding domain of UNC-116 is able to bind MTs, we expressed GFP-tagged UNC-116(aa521-863) in the HEK 293T cells and co-stained with MTs. As shown in the following figures, GFP-UNC-116(aa 521-863) co-localized with MTs (Author response image 1). Similar experiments were used to demonstrate that the vertebrate kinesin-1 counterpart can directly interact with MTs (Navone et al., 1992). Importantly, a mutant form of this domain that includes three R to A mutations showed no colocalization with MT markers. The same mutations when introduced in the vertebrate Kinesin-1 domains also diminish the interaction between MT and the C-terminal MT binding motif (Seeger and Rice, 2010). Together, these results further support our model.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p/></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-00133-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>We want to thank the reviewers for raising questions about the dendrite length phenotype in <italic>unc-116</italic>. In our original submission, we showed that in <italic>unc-116</italic> mutants, the DA9 dendrite exhibits axon-like MT polarity and is also significantly longer than the wild type dendrite. The reviewers asked us to test whether the increased length is caused by the change of MT polarity. Through structure-function dissection of UNC-116, we identified a mutant form of UNC-116 which is defective in the putative novel MT sliding function, yet appears to maintain other vesicular trafficking functions as measured by the localization of mitochondria (Figure 6B and Figure 6—figure supplement 1). When expressed in DA9, this mutant UNC-116 (UNC-116 <sub>MT</sub>) failed to rescue the MT polarity phenotype, but fully rescued the dendrite length phenotype, indicating the longer dendrite is not a consequence of MT polarity change. Consistent with this notion, we examined the dendrite length of another mutant <italic>wy774</italic>, which we have isolated from our forward genetic screen. This mutant exhibits similar MT polarity phenotype as the <italic>unc-116</italic> mutants but is mapped to a different genomic locus (hence not another allele of <italic>unc-116</italic>). Interestingly, this mutant shows normal dendrite length, further suggesting that longer dendrite in the <italic>unc-116</italic> mutant is not a consequence of MT polarity change but likely due to other functions of UNC-116/kinesin-1. In the light of these new results, we have removed the data and discussion on dendrite length in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) More quantification</italic>.</p><p>We have included quantifications in Figures 1, 4 (now Figure 3) and 5 (now Figure 4).</p><p><italic>4) One reviewer felt the authors were potentially misleading in the title and abstract by not indicating that they have investigated this in worms, rather than in mammals […]</italic>.</p><p>We have clarified the organism in the title and abstract.

Using +end and –end markers as suggested by the reviewers, we examined the DA9 dendrite polarity at different developing stages in both wild type and <italic>unc-116</italic> mutants. The results are summarized below and shown in Author response image 2.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p/></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-00133-resp-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>1) In wild type L1s (10 hour after hatching) animals, (-) end marker KLP-16::GFP is localized to the dendrite, but does not show the dramatic enrichment at the tip of the dendrite found in adults. At the same stage, (+) end marker UNC-104::GFP avoids the dendrite and is dramatically enriched at the tip of the DA9 axon. These results suggest that in wild type young animals, the dendrite likely already contains mix-polarized MTs but the minus-end-out MTs are not as dominant as in adult dendrites. We looked hard for any evidence that would suggest that very young dendrites bear axonal-like polarity, a phenotype that was observed in the stage 2 neurons in dissociated vertebrate cultures. However, we did not see any UNC-104::GFP fluorescence in the dendrites of wild-type animals at any developmental stages. We therefore conclude that as soon as the dendrite grows out, it has adopted a mixed MT polarity.</p><p>2) at 20 hours after hatching, wild type DA9 dendrite showed dramatic enrichment of (-) end marker KLP-16::GFP at the tip of the dendrite, suggesting that the minus-end-out MTs have become dominating species by this time point.</p><p>3) at 10 hour after hatching, <italic>unc-116</italic> mutant dendrites showed the same distribution of (-) end marker and (+) end marker as in the wild type. In other words, <italic>unc-116</italic> mutant did not show a phenotype at this very early stage of dendrite development.</p><p>4) at 20 hours after hatching, the <italic>unc-116</italic> mutant dendrite completely fails to enrich the (-) end marker KLP-16::GFP at its tip; instead, it enriches the (+) end marker UNC-104::GFP at its tip, suggesting a polarity reversal starting at this stage.</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that the dendrite starts out as a process with a mixed MT polarity (certainly not an axon-like uniformly plus-end-out, but also not as minus-end-out as the mature dendrite). With time, MTs becomes more dramatically polarized with minus-end-out being the dominating species.UNC-116/Kinesin-1 likely functions in the maturation stage to establish and maintain the polarity. These data are consistent with our MT gliding model.</p><p><italic>[Editors' note: during revisions the editors made the following suggestion: The reviewers agreed that it would be beneficial to re-include the data regarding the dendrite elongation phenotype that you removed during the first revisions.</italic>]</p><p>We have followed your suggestions and put back the DA9 dendrite length elongation phenotype of <italic>unc-116</italic> animals in the manuscript as a supplement to Figure 3.</p><p><bold>References</bold></p><p>Nakata, T, &amp; Hirokawa, N.
