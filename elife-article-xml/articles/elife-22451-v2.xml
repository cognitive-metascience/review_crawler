High levels of D-2-hydroxyglutarate inhibit the TET family of DNA demethylases and Jumonji family of histone demethylases and cause epigenetic changes that lead to altered gene expression. The link between inhibition of DNA demethylation and changes in expression is strong in some cancers, but not in others. To determine whether D-2-hydroxyglutarate can affect gene expression through inhibiting histone demethylases, orthologous mutations to those known to cause accumulation of D-2-hydroxyglutarate in tumors were generated in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, which has histone demethylases but not DNA methylases or demethylases. Accumulation of D-2-hydroxyglutarate caused inhibition of several histone demethylases. Inhibition of two of the demethylases that act specifically on histone H3K36me2,3 led to enhanced gene silencing. These observations pinpointed a new mechanism by which this oncometabolite can alter gene expression, perhaps repressing critical inhibitors of proliferation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22451.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22451.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Heterochromatin</kwd><kwd>D-2-Hydroxyglutarate</kwd><kwd>Isocitrate Dehydrogenase</kwd><kwd>Oncometabolite</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 Postdoctoral Fellowship, GM115074</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Janke</surname><given-names>Ryan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1S10OD020062-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iavarone</surname><given-names>Anthony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM31105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rine</surname><given-names>Jasper</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM120374</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rine</surname><given-names>Jasper</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mutations in budding yeast modeled after cancer-associated isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations lead to stabilization of heterochromatin and enhanced gene silencing through inhibition of specific histone demethylases by the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Among the biggest surprises from cancer genome sequencing has been the extent to which mutations affecting metabolic enzymes appear as drivers of specific types of cancers. Isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH), enzymes that convert isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate, are prime examples. Specific IDH mutations are highly prevalent features of certain subsets of cancers, including 60–90% of gliomas and secondary glioblastomas, 20% of late-stage acute myelogenous leukemia, ~50% of central and periosteal cartilagenous tumors, and 10–20% of interhepatic cholangiocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Parsons et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Molenaar et al., 2014</xref>). The high frequency and patterns of IDH mutations suggest that they are important in early tumor development. In the case of acute myelogenous leukemia, IDH mutations also contribute to progression of these tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Molenaar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Reitman and Yan, 2010</xref>). With rare exception, IDH mutations in tumors occur exclusively as heterozygous missense mutations. The most frequently documented IDH mutations occur as substitutions of arginine 132 in IDH1 or the equivalent arginine (172) in IDH2. The specific amino acid substitution varies across and within tumor subtypes.</p><p>Tumor-associated IDH mutations appear to abolish the conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate, and instead promote a partial reverse reaction in which α-ketoglutarate is reduced to form D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2-HG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rendina et al., 2013</xref>). D2-HG is a metabolite that is typically maintained at low levels in human cells through the activity of the enzyme D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (D2HGDH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achouri et al., 2004</xref>). Cellular D2-HG levels are commonly elevated in IDH-mutant tumor cells, sometimes to millimolar levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gross et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dang et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The structural similarity between D2-HG and α-ketoglutarate inspire models for D2-HG’s role in tumor formation centered on antagonism of α-ketoglutarate-dependent enzymes. Indeed, the α-ketoglutarate-dependent TET family of DNA demethylases and Jumonji histone demethylases are inhibited by high levels of D2-HG in vitro and in cell culture, resulting in DNA and histone hypermethylation and accompanied by changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Figueroa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chowdhury et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2012</xref>). There is strong circumstantial evidence from acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) that DNA demethylases are the targets of the D2-HG produced by the IDH mutations: AMLs tend to have either the mutations in IDH or mutations in the genes encoding TET enzymes, but not both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Figueroa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gaidzik et al., 2012</xref>). In the case of gliomas and other types of tumors, there is no such simple dichotomy, suggesting the possibility of other important targets of D2-HG in these tumors such as histone demethylases. Indeed elevated bulk histone methylation has been reported for some tumors producing D2-HG, but whether critical changes in gene expression result from inhibition of DNA demethylation or inhibition of histone demethylation in these tumors is an important and unresolved question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chowdhury et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gaidzik et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2012</xref>). Further, tumors with elevated D2-HG levels show bulk increases in histone methyl marks typically associated with both transcriptional activation (H3K4, H3K36) and repression (H3K9, H3K27) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Turcan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2012</xref>). The increase of global histone methylation marks could conceivably lead to architectural changes in chromatin that alter heterochromatin/euchromatin states, or change the capacity to initiate and undergo transcription, or some combination of both. Which processes underlie the critical transcriptional changes that promote development and progression in D2-HG-accumulating tumors is unknown. Here, the causality of transcriptional changes due to elevated D2-HG was tested in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</italic> Elevated D2-HG levels led to increased gene repression at a heterochromatic locus. The mechanism behind this effect on transcription was pinpointed to elevated H3K36 methylation as a result of D2-HG inhibition of Jumonji-domain-containing demethylases Rph1 and Gis1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To study the impact of IDH mutations on gene expression, an analogous tumor-associated IDH mutation was made in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<italic>IDP2-R132H</italic>) at the <italic>IDP2</italic> locus. The yeast and human proteins share 61% amino acid identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The frequency of loss-of-silencing events, detected as green spots or sectors within a colony, was quantified using MORPHE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). The <italic>IDP2-R132H</italic> mutation increased the stability of heterochromatin (p&lt;0.0001; Student’s <italic>t</italic> test) compared to wild-type <italic>IDP2</italic>, resulting in fewer switches from RFP to GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Deletion of <italic>IDP2</italic> did not affect the stability of heterochromatin suggesting that <italic>IDP2-R132H</italic> results in a gain-of-function. These results demonstrate that tumor-associated IDH mutations led to increased stability of gene silencing in a heterochromatic domain in <italic>Saccharomyces.</italic></p><p>If <italic>IDP2-R132H</italic> stabilized heterochromatin through increased D2-HG levels, then other genetic changes that independently increase D2-HG levels should do the same. In human cells, D2-HG is metabolized by D2HGDH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achouri et al., 2004</xref>). Loss of D2HGDH causes D2-HG to accumulate to high levels. The high degree of amino acid sequence similarity between human D2HGDH and yeast Dld2 and Dld3 suggested that both were potential yeast orthologs of human D2HGDH, as recently confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becker-Kettern et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, on medium with glycerol as the sole carbon source, when oxidative phosphorylation is the primary means of ATP production, the <italic>dld2∆</italic> mutant phenocopied the effect of the <italic>IDP2-R132H</italic> mutant and increased gene silencing compared to wild type (p&lt;0.0001; Student’s <italic>t</italic> test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Moreover, the <italic>IDP2-R132H dld2∆</italic> double mutant resulted in a further increase in heterochromatin stability compared to wild type (p&lt;0.0001; Student’s <italic>t</italic> test) and <italic>dld2Δ</italic> alone (p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.05; Student’s <italic>t</italic> test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). The stabilizing effect of a <italic>dld2Δ</italic> mutation was slightly diminished in combination with an <italic>idp2Δ</italic> deletion, suggesting that even wild-type Idp2 may contribute to the formation of D2-HG, either by directly producing D2-HG or indirectly by producing α-ketoglutarate as a substrate used by other enzymes for D2-HG formation. A <italic>dld3∆</italic> mutation did not increase heterochromatin stability when cells were grown on glycerol medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). However, when cells were grown on glucose, where ATP is primarily generated through sugar fermentation, both <italic>dld2∆</italic> and <italic>dld3∆</italic> mutations led to increased heterochromatin stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>). The increase in heterochromatin stability in the <italic>dld2∆</italic> and <italic>dld3∆</italic> mutants implied that D2-HG is normally produced in yeast under these and other conditions (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becker-Kettern et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>If the increased gene silencing in the <italic>IDP2-R132H</italic> mutant were due to increased D2-HG levels, then the phenotype of the mutant should be dominant to wild-type <italic>IDP2.</italic> Conversely, if the effects on gene silencing were due to a reduced ability to convert isocitrate into α-ketoglutarate, the <italic>IDP2-R132H</italic> allele would likely be recessive to wild type. In an <italic>IPD2-R132H/IDP2</italic> heterozygous diploid strain, gene silencing was increased compared to the equivalent strain with two copies of wild-type <italic>IDP2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), demonstrating that the yeast mutation, analogous to the cancer-driver mutation in human <italic>IDH1</italic>, was dominant to wild-type <italic>IDP2</italic>.

Consistent with a role in metabolizing D2-HG, a <italic>dld2∆</italic> mutation led to a ~50 fold increase in cellular D2-HG levels in cells grown on glycerol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and a fivefold increase in cells grown on glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). A <italic>dld3Δ</italic> mutation also led to a sevenfold increase in cellular D2-HG, but this increase was observed only in cells grown on glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). Thus, D2-HG is a normal feature of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> metabolome and is efficiently metabolized by Dld2 and Dld3, as noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becker-Kettern et al., 2016</xref>). However, Dld3 activity toward D2-HG was limited to cells grown on fermentable carbon sources like glucose. Although the increased D2-HG level in the Idp2-R132H mutant inferred from the silencing phenotype was not detected in the LC-MS analysis of cells that were able to metabolize it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), the Idp2-R132H mutation clearly contributed to D2-HG production when measured in combination with <italic>dld2∆</italic> and wild-type Idp2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

As <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> lacks DNA methylation, there were no confounding effects of DNA methylation in our study.</p><p>D2-HG has only been recently reported in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becker-Kettern et al., 2016</xref>), and several new aspects of its metabolism are established here. D2-HG was detected in metabolite extracts even from wild-type cells, suggesting it is a normal component of the yeast metabolome. Wild-type cells maintained D2-HG at low levels through the activity of D2-HG dehydrogenases. Both Dld2 and Dld3 are capable of metabolizing D2-HG in vitro, and loss of either enzyme leads to accumulation of D2-HG in cells grown on glucose, with Dld3 having a stronger effect than Dld2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becker-Kettern et al., 2016</xref>). However, only Dld2 had a role in metabolizing D2-HG in vivo in cells grown on glycerol, suggesting that Dld3 and Dld2 are differentially regulated in response to the mode of energy production in the cell.</p><p><italic>IDP2-R132H</italic> mutants alone, and in combination with <italic>dld2</italic>∆, led to enhanced gene silencing. Multiple lines of evidence linked enhanced gene silencing to the production of D2-HG and inhibition of H3K36 histone demethylases Gis1 and Rph1. First, mutants that led to D2-HG accumulation phenocopied <italic>gis1Δ rph1Δ</italic> double mutants. Next, <italic>gis1Δ rph1Δ</italic> double mutants were epistatic to <italic>IDP2-R132H</italic> and <italic>dld2Δ</italic> mutations, indicating that the increase in gene silencing in <italic>IDP2-R132H</italic> and <italic>dld2Δ</italic> mutants was due to inhibition of these H3K36 demethylases. Additionally, the silencing phenotypes of H3K36 demethylase mutants, <italic>IDP2-R132H,</italic> and <italic>dld2Δ</italic> all depended on the H3K36 methyltransferase activity of Set2. Finally, external application of a cell-permeant form of D2-HG recapitulated enhanced silencing, demonstrating the causality of this phenotype. D2-HG acts as a competitive inhibitor of human Jumonji histone demethylase enzymes. Whether yeast Jumonji-domain histone demethylases are biochemically inhibited by D2-HG has not explicitly been tested, although the genetic and molecular evidence strongly implied such a mechanism.</p><p>D2-HG levels increased approximately 50-fold in <italic>dld2Δ</italic> mutants, and <italic>IDP2-R132H</italic> mutations also contribute to the pool of D2-HG, although this contribution was detectable only when a copy of wild-type <italic>IDP2</italic> was also present in <italic>IDP2-R132H</italic> mutant cells. This result was consistent with our genetic analysis of diploid cells in which silencing was greatest in <italic>IDP2/IDP2-R132H</italic> heterozygotes, and was also consistent with previous studies using human cell lines and tumors where the equivalent human mutation (<italic>IDH1-R132H</italic>) also partially depended on the presence an intact copy of wild-type <italic>IDH1</italic> for D2-HG production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ward et al., 2013</xref>). Increases in D2-HG were readily measured in <italic>dld2-</italic>mutants, but not in cells capable of degrading D2-HG. This differs from tumor cells where IDH mutations lead to measurable increases in D2-HG despite intact D2-HG dehydrogenase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krell et al., 2011</xref>). This discrepancy could either be due to a higher capacity of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to metabolize D2-HG, a higher capacity for the human equivalent to the <italic>IDP2-R132H</italic> mutation to generate D2-HG, or some combination of both. We were able to detect a silencing phenotype in <italic>IDP2-R132H</italic> mutants even in cells capable of metabolizing D2-HG due to the highly sensitive nature of the CRASH assay, which converts transient lapses of silencing in individual cells into permanent and heritable effects. In contrast, physical measurements of metabolites reveal only steady-state levels averaged over millions of cells. Given that D2-HG is actively degraded when Dld2 is present, it is evident that our genetic assay was able to detect change caused by changes in D2-HG that were below our present level of physical detection.</p><p>Accumulation of D2-HG led to hypermethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 and lysine 36. Importantly, it was the loss of histone demethylases that act on H3K36 that was solely responsible for increased stabilization of heterochromatin. Inhibition of H3K4 demethylation and the resulting elevation of bulk H3K4me had no effect on gene silencing. A role of H3K36 methylation in heterochromatin stability was surprising as other described roles for this modification involve co-transcriptional methylation of H3K36 to enhance transcriptional elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kizer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tu et al., 2007</xref>). Methylation of H3K36 at transcribed genes prevents aberrant transcription from initiating from within the open-reading frames of actively transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carrozza et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Keogh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Joshi and Struhl, 2005</xref>), although this process appears to be incompatible with silencing at <italic>HML</italic> for reasons detailed below. Nevertheless, other aspects of histone methylation have had unexpected impacts on heterochromatic gene silencing. For example, H3K4 methylation occurs at the 5’ ends of actively transcribed genes and is important for maintaining a local chromatin landscape conducive to transcription, and yet it also plays a role in the establishment of silencing at <italic>HML</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Osborne et al., 2009</xref>). Whether methylation of H3K4 is directly involved in the establishment and H3K36 in maintenance of <italic>SIR-</italic>dependent silencing remain important unresolved questions. Precedence for a direct role of histone methylation in silencing is evident in other species in which methylation of H3K9 and H3K27 directly recruit proteins that establish heterochromatin. Although budding yeasts lack the enzymes necessary to methylate H3K9 and K27, methylation of other histone lysines directly impact silencing. The site at which Sir3 interacts with histone H3 includes H3K79, and methylation of H3K79 by Dot1 inhibits Sir3-H3 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armache et al., 2011</xref>). The majority of euchromatic nucleosomes are methylated at H3K79, thus preventing Sir protein binding, while at heterochromatic loci Sir3 binds to H3 and sterically occludes Dot1 from accessing H3K79 for methylation. The results of this study are compatible with a model in which H3K36 methylation directly enhances the maintenance of silent chromatin, perhaps by recruitment of a pro-silencing factor to silent loci.</p><p>Alternatively, global increases in H3K36 methylation could recruit factors antagonistic to silencing away from heterochromatin. For example, the Rpd3 complex antagonizes silencing at heterochromatic loci <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> by limiting Sir3 and Sir4 occupancy at flanking silencer regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Thurtle-Schmidt et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, the deacetylase activity of Rpd3(S) is directed toward nucleosomes at actively transcribed genes in part through an interaction between the Eaf3 subunit of the Rpd3(S) complex and histones methylated at H3K36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carrozza et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Keogh, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Joshi and Struhl, 2005</xref>). It is possible that elevated H3K36 methylation in euchromatin recruits Rpd3(S) away from <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR,</italic> and partially alleviates its antagonistic effect on silencing. Because recruitment of Rpd3 to heterochromatin appears to be independent of Eaf3 and thus H3K36 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Thurtle-Schmidt et al., 2016</xref>), a global increase of H3K36 methylation could lead to relocalization of a limited pool of Rpd3 away from <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> to sites with increased H3K36 methylation. Finally, H3K36 methylation prevents binding of Sir proteins to heterochromatin-adjacent and telomere-adjacent regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tompa and Madhani, 2007</xref>). Increased global H3K36 methylation due to D2-HG accumulation could, in principle, prevent binding of Sir proteins to non-heterochromatic regions, making more Sir protein available to bind at heterochromatic loci.</p><p>Increased silencing of tumor suppressor genes is a feature of many tumors. This study pinpointed specific histone demethylase enzymes whose inhibition by D2-HG resulted in increased gene silencing. Further, this study demonstrated that D2-HG enhanced gene silencing through stabilization of heterochromatic DNA. Similar mechanisms could promote tumor formation by silencing genes encoding tumor suppressors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>The strains used in this study are derived from the W303 background and listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Alan Hinnebusch (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study shows that The IDP2-R132H mutation in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH; encoded by IDP2 in yeast) provokes formation of the metabolite 2-HG, associated with tumor formation or progression in humans. The results show that IDP2-R132H enhances silencing within the HML locus, whereas deleting IDP2 does not; and that eliminating the gene product of DLD2, one of two possible yeast orthologs of the human enzyme D2HGDH that metabolizes 2-HG, also reduces silencing, even in cells containing WT IDP2 but in a manner exacerbated by the IDP2-R132H mutation, thus indicating that 2-HG production in yeast doesn't require, but is enhanced by the IDP2 tumor-associated mutation. This conclusion is supported by measuring 2-HG production in extracts, which is very high in the dld2 mutant, and somewhat higher in the double mutant also containing the IDP2-R132H mutation; but the latter mutation alone does not suffice to increase 2-HG levels by a detectable amount. They further show that addition of exogenous octyl-D2-HG increases HML silencing in the dld2 mutant background. Thus, they establish significant correlations between 2-HG levels and increased HML silencing in the dld2 mutant, which is defective for 2-HG metabolism. They go on to show that H3-K36 and H3K4 methylation is elevated in the dld2 IDP2-R132H double mutant, and that HML silencing is increased in two mutants lacking histone demethylases specific for methylated H3-K36, Rph1 and Gis1, but not in three other histone demethylase mutants; however, the specific involvement of these two demethylases is not explained at the level of increased H3-K36 methylation in the rph1 and gis1 mutants versus the other three demethylase mutants. They conclude by demonstrating that deleting RPH1 and GIS1 suppresses the effects on silencing associated with increased 2-HG production conferred by the dld2 mutation, in the manner expected if 2-HG enhances silencing by inhibiting these two demethylases. Finally, they show that eliminating Set2 suppresses the effect of elevated 2-HG in dld2 cells, as would be expected if elevated methylated H3-K36 is responsible for the increased silencing. Based on these results they conclude that 2-HG accumulation in cells enhances HML silencing by inhibiting two specific H3-K36 demethylases with attendant accumulation of methylated H3-K36.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>It is necessary to extend the CRASH assay and demonstrate a difference in silencing between the two dld2 strains harboring WT IDP2 or IDP2-R132H that were analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. It is necessary quantify the immunoblot data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> using normalization to H3. It is necessary to explain fully what statistical tests have been applied, supply error bars to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, and histograms summarizing the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>The authors are advised to draw the distinction between a biochemical demonstration that 2-HG inhibits histone demethylases in vitro and genetic evidence supporting this possibility for the yeast demethylases Rph1 and Gis1. While not essential for acceptance, it was considered that the scientific quality of the work would be increased by comparing the effects of each of the demethylase mutants on bulk H3-K36 methylation by Western analysis in an effort to explain why only the RPH1 and GIS1 deletions affect HML silencing, or cite the appropriate published data; and also examining whether accumulation of D2-HG in human cells results in histone hypermethylation.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This study shows that The IDP2-R132H mutation in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH; encoded by IDP2 in yeast) provokes formation of the metabolite 2-HG, associated with tumor formation or progression in humans.

This is important because it is currently unclear whether inhibition of these enzymes, or rather of DNA methylases (lacking in yeast) is involved in the oncogenic properties of this metabolite in human cells. Others have shown that 2-HG can inhibit mammalian Jumonji histone demethylases in vitro. While this study does not establish this point directly for the yeast demethylases Rph1 and Gis1, it provides compelling genetic evidence that they are likely inhibited by 2-HG in vivo. It seems advisable that the authors draw this distinction between biochemical demonstration and strong inference from genetic data. Apart from this, the authors need to provide better documentation of the statistical tests that were conducted for certain experiments, as detailed below. In addition, it seems important that they analyze the effects of each of the five demethylase mutants on bulk H3-K36 methylation by Western analysis to provide insights into why only the RPH1 and GIS1 deletions affect HML silencing. Is it the case that only these two deletions provoke a strong increase in methylated H3-K36 species, or is something more complicated involved, such as locus-specific effects of the enzymes with only RPH1 or GIS1 functioning at HML (see specific comment below for more on this request.)</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>– Subsection “Mutations expected to produce D2-HG results in enhanced gene silencing”: the statistical test employed and the specific comparisons to which the p values were calculated need to be indicated in text, figure or legend.

Specifically, the authors introduce into the model organism <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mutations in the IDH homolog IDP2, which is highly conserved, and measure their effects on gene silencing. They observed a drastic increased stability on gene silencing though stabilization of heterochromatin, an effect that was dominant when compared to WT. Mutants (dld2 and dld3) that were predicted to increase levels of D2-HG also mediated the same effect. These metabolic effects were confirmed using MS and an enhanced effect was observed when the dld2 mutant was combined with the IDH mutation. Finally, exogenous D2-HG was added and in dld2 mutants, significant stabilization of gene silencing was observed. Collectively this provides strong evidence that there is indeed a functional connection between D2-HG levels and chromatin regulation. Further mechanistic insight is revealed as increase of H3K36 and H3K4 (but not K79) methylation is observed in the mutant backgrounds and a strong connection is uncovered through the jumonji demethylases.</p><p>The paper is well written and beautifully demonstrates the value of pivoting back and forth between human genomic datasets and work in more genetically tractable systems to uncover important mechanistic understanding behind cancer biology. There are several major novel themes in the paper including: 1) connecting key IDH cancer mutations to chromatin silencing through histone methylation/demethylation; 2) linking more tightly metabolism and chromatin function; 3) uncovering rare, interesting phenotypes for jumoji demethylases, and 4) demonstration of the power of yeast genetics to functionally characterize cancer mutations.

In fact, paragraph five of the Discussion section implies that this experiment has already been done for the jhd2 mutant.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer brings up a counter hypothesis (thank you) to understand why the H3K36 demethylases Gis1 and Rph1, but not the other H3K36 histone demethylase Jhd1, are the critical targets underlying the effect of D2-HG on gene silencing. The counter hypothesis cleverly pointed out by the reviewer, is that Gis1 and Rph1 might have an effect, not from their specificities, but rather from having a greater effect on bulk H3-K36 demethylation compared to the other H3K36 demethylase Jhd1. The reviewer suggests a simple test of this idea by mutating each H3K36 demethylase (and the potential effect of Ecm5) and measuring the effect on bulk H3K36 methylation.</p><p>As the reviewer inferred, such an experiment has been conducted and the effect of deleting each individual H3K36 demethylase has been published. No effect on the bulk methylation levels of histones are observed by immunoblot in any single histone demethylase mutant (Kwon and Ahn (2011) Role of yeast JmjC-domain containing histone demethylases in actively transcribed regions. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 410(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>): p614-619). This demonstrates that the specificity we observe for Gis1 and Rph1 is not simply explained by those demethylases individually having a greater general effect on the bulk levels of H3K36 methylation compared to Jhd1 or other demethylases. Another study on locus-specific effects (rather than bulk effects) of H3K36 demethylase mutants in yeast demonstrates that H3K36 demethylation occurs at the same rate in single H3K36 demethylase mutants (<italic>rph1Δ, gis1Δ</italic>, or <italic>jhd1Δ</italic>) as it does in wild-type cells, while an <italic>rph1Δ gis1Δ jhd1Δ</italic> triple mutant has delayed turnover of H3K36 methylation (Sein et al. (2015) Distribution and maintenance of histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation in a transcribed locus. PLoS One, 10(3)).</p><p>Collectively, these data suggest that analysis of H3K36 methylation levels for bulk H3 or at specific loci in single demethylase mutants will likely not reveal any insight into the relative contribution of each demethylase beyond the studies that have already been performed.</p><p>The reviewer points out that it is possible that the lack of a phenotype in a <italic>jhd1Δ</italic> mutant could be explained by the presence of a suppressor mutation that increases expression/activity of the other H3K36 demethylases. In this scenario, the contribution of <italic>jhd1Δ</italic> would then be expected to be revealed in the <italic>rph1Δ gis1Δ jhd1Δ</italic> triple mutant, where the effect of the potential suppressor mutation would be lost. We did not observe any additional contribution of <italic>jhd1Δ</italic> to the silencing phenotype in this triple mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) nor was there a growth deficiency that would have been a selection for suppressor mutations.</p><p><italic>– Discussion section, paragraph five: More pertinent to silencing is the known role of H3-K36 methylation by Set2 in suppressing cryptic promoters in coding sequences.</italic> </p><p>We demonstrated that increased H3K36 methylation increased silencing within heterochromatin. In our discussion we stated that the role of this mark on silent heterochromatin was surprising because it is generally found at actively transcribed loci and thought to promote a chromatin architecture conducive to active transcription. The reviewer importantly points out that a discussion regarding the known role of H3K36 methylation in suppressing cryptic promoters in coding sequences is particularly warranted in the context of our study, and we completely agree. At the suggestion of the reviewer, a discussion on this point was added to the Discussion section.</p><p>In short, the reviewer’s suggestion is that at actively transcribed sites, H3K36 methylation recruits the RPD3 histone deacetylase complex, which removes acetyl marks on histone H4, and that this recruitment is playing a role our observations. It has been demonstrated that this deacetylation is necessary to suppress transcription from cryptic promoters within coding sequences. This lends to the model that perhaps hypermethylation of H3K36 within heterochromatin could increase recruitment of RPD3 to heterochromatin and subsequent deacetylation could increase silencing.</p><p>However, such a model is not compatible with the fact that recruitment of RPD3 to silent heterochromatin is actually antagonistic to silencing (Thurtle-Schmidt, Dodson, and Rine, 2015. In light of this, we also discuss a different model that is more compatible with the nuanced regulation of silent heterochromatin. This model is centered on the possibility that the increase in bulk H3K36 methylation could recruit a limited pool of RPD3 away from heterochromatin and thus reduce the antagonistic effect of RPD3 on silencing that has been previously characterized. The additional discussion inspired by the reviewer’s comment has strengthened the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>In this paper, the authors explore the relationship between the accumulation of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2 HG) and gene silencing, emphasizing the role of D-2 HG in inhibition of several H3K36 histone demethylases.

Indeed, we are anxious to see the work replicated in bona fide tumor cells and made multiple inquiries including through Genentech and UCLA to see whether we could wrap such investigations into this study. Without going through the convoluted narrative of these investigations, in the end we resolved to play to our strength, confident that the robust cancer research community will quickly follow up.</p><p>To emphasize the importance of this work on its own, without mammalian data, we have rigorously tested and demonstrated one leading hypothesis for the mechanism by which the archetypal oncometabolite D2-HG exerts its carcinogenetic effect. Accumulation of D2-HG in certain cancers leads to hypermethylation of DNA and histones and altered gene expression. In these cancers, the link between the inhibition of DNA demethylation and cancer are, while indirect, compelling: these cancers have either mutations in IDH or mutations in the TET family of demethylases, but not both. While most studies to date on D2-HG have pointed towards the model that D2-HG alters the state of chromatin through dysregulation of an epigenetic process, there are other classes of cancer in which IDH mutations are drivers, but for which TET mutations are not found, and hence the conceptual link is not closed. Our work provides a compelling way to think about those cancers.</p><p>We utilized a unique genetic tool (the CRASH assay), only available in <italic>Saccharomyces</italic>, to study the effect of D2-HG on heterochromatin and gene silencing. We unequivocally demonstrated a mechanism by which D2-HG influences chromatin structure and dynamics, we demonstrated it occurs in a way that results in a change in gene expression through interference of an epigenetic mechanism, and we demonstrate that is absolutely independent of any influence on DNA methylation of demethylation. This is the first such mechanistic demonstration of the consequence of oncometabolite inhibition of histone demethylases with compelling causality. Moreover, we have demonstrated new aspects of D2-HG metabolism; the function of Dld2 and Dld3 are differentially regulated based on the mode of carbon metabolism and energy production in the cell (oxidative phosphorylation versus fermentation). We also demonstrate a novel and unanticipated connection between methylation of H3K36 and silencing.</p><p>The reviewer touches on important questions that remain regarding the cellular conditions under which D2-HG is produced. Those questions are of great significance and are the subject of extensive on-going experiments in the lab, including but not limited to, identifying other targets of D2-HG affecting cellular function. We hope to be lucky enough to engage this reviewer on our next submissions.</p><p><italic>In addition, there are several major and minor concerns to address:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) One significant problem is that the D-2 HG levels do not increase for the IDP2-R132H mutant when compared to wild type using LC-MS in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, contrasting with the CRASH results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. The authors attempt to address this apparent discrepancy by transforming with a plasmid with native promoter-driven IDP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), but they do not then revisit the CRASH assay with plasmid-based IDP2 overexpression.</italic> </p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> we demonstrated a single copy of the <italic>IDP2-R132H</italic> mutation did not result in increased D2-HG levels measured by mass spectrometry. Tumors with the equivalent isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation (<italic>IDH1-R132H</italic>) are exclusively heterozygous, retaining a wild-type copy of <italic>IDH1</italic>. Moreover, in tumor cells knock-down of wild-type <italic>IDH1</italic> reduces D2-HG produced by <italic>IDH1-R132H</italic>. We wondered if the yeast enzyme Idp2-R132H might also depend on the presence of wild-type Idp2 and this was specifically tested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. We transformed <italic>IDP2-R132H</italic> cells with a plasmid containing a wild-type <italic>IDP2</italic> gene expressed from its native promoter and observed that the presence of a wild-type copy of <italic>IDP2</italic> in combination with the <italic>IDP2-R132H</italic> mutation resulted in detectable increases of D2-HG. The reviewer points out that our model would be considerably strengthened if we also observed effects on silencing that correspond to this increased D2-HG production that we measured by mass spectrometry. We agree with the assessment of the reviewer, and we have now included this analysis. The primary question at hand was whether the additional D2-HG that results from a copy of plasmid-borne wild-type <italic>IDP2</italic> in an <italic>IDP2-R132H</italic> strain also results in increased gene silencing. Indeed, we saw an increase in silencing in <italic>IDP2-R132H</italic> strains that contained an additional copy of the wild-type <italic>IDP2</italic> gene compared to <italic>IDP2-R132H</italic> strains containing a control plasmid. Like the production of D2-HG, this effect on silencing was not simply due to an extra copy of wild-type <italic>IDP2</italic> (no effect on D2-HG levels or silencing were observed in strains with two copies of wild-type <italic>IDP2</italic>), but rather specific to the combination of IDP2-R132H with a copy of wild-type <italic>IDP2</italic>. These data were added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, and they greatly support and strengthen our conclusions that a wild-type copy of <italic>IDP2</italic> stimulates the production of D2-HG by <italic>IDP2-R132H</italic>.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> lacks error bars.
