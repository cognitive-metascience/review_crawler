Surprisingly little is known about the possible contribution of the cerebellum. To address this question, healthy participants underwent a differential fear conditioning paradigm during 7T magnetic resonance imaging. An event-related design allowed us to separate cerebellar fMRI signals related to the visual conditioned stimulus (CS) from signals related to the subsequent unconditioned stimulus (US; an aversive electric shock). We found significant activation of cerebellar lobules Crus I and VI bilaterally related to the CS+ compared to the CS-. Most importantly, significant activation of lobules Crus I and VI was also present during the unexpected omission of the US in unreinforced CS+ acquisition trials. This activation disappeared during extinction when US omission became expected. These findings provide evidence that the cerebellum has to be added to the neural network processing predictions and prediction errors in the emotional domain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>emotions</kwd><kwd>extinction</kwd><kwd>fear</kwd><kwd>vermis</kwd><kwd>cerebellar hemisphere</kwd><kwd>aversive conditioning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>316803389 (SFB1280, project A11)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bingel</surname><given-names>Ulrike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>316803389 (SFB1280, project A05)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Quick</surname><given-names>Harald H</given-names></name><name><surname>Timmann</surname><given-names>Dagmar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>316803389 (SFB1280, project A09)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Merz</surname><given-names>Christian Josef</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Pronounced cerebellar activation during unexpected omission of a potentially harmful event suggests that the cerebellum has to be added to the neural network processing prediction errors underlying emotional associative learning.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cerebellar disease has long been known to result in disordered motor performance and motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Holmes, 1908</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McCormick and Thompson, 1984</xref>). Evidence has accumulated that cerebellar patients also present with various degrees of cognitive, emotional and behavioral abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schmahmann and Sherman, 1998</xref>). Because the microscopic structure of the cerebellum is highly homogeneous, it is often assumed that the cerebellum performs one single neural operation (see Miall in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caligiore et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Popa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sokolov et al., 2017</xref>). The most popular current hypothesis states that the cerebellum acts as, or is part of, a predictive device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Popa and Ebner, 2018</xref> for recent review). In the motor domain, it is assumed that the cerebellum is crucially involved in prediction of the sensory consequences of motor commands thought to be achieved via internal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bastian, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Miall et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wolpert et al., 1998</xref>). These internal models have to be constantly adapted because of a constantly changing inner and outer environment. Assumedly, the difference between the predicted and actual sensory outcome results in a sensory prediction error used to adapt the internal model and subsequent motor behavior. Although most studies have been performed in the motor domain, there is initial evidence that the cerebellum is involved in predictive control in the cognitive domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lesage et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lesage et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moberget et al., 2014</xref>). The aim of the present study was to show that this assumption also applies to the emotional domain.</p><p>Fear conditioning was used as a model system because the cerebellum is involved in acquisition of learned fear responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lange et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maschke et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ploghaus et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sacchetti et al., 2002</xref>), and has known connections with several parts of the neural network underlying fear conditioning, including the limbic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blatt et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, prediction errors are thought to be the main drivers of associative fear learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Holland and Schiffino, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rescorla and Wagner, 1972</xref>). In the fear conditioning literature, however, the possible role of the cerebellum in aversive prediction error processing has largely been ignored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apps and Strata, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tovote et al., 2015</xref>). Previous studies focused on the role of the amygdala, insula, midbrain periaqueductal gray and striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boll et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li and McNally, 2014</xref>). We wanted to provide initial evidence that the cerebellum has to be added to the neural network processing predictions errors in learned fear responses.</p><p>During fear conditioning, participants learn to predict that the initially neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) is followed by an unpleasant unconditioned stimulus (US). As a result, fear responses are elicited already at the time of CS presentation. The initial occurrence of the US is unexpected and has been considered as an error signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor and Ivry, 2014</xref>). An event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) design allowed us to separate blood oxygenation level-dependent fMRI signals related to the CS, from signals related to the subsequent US. Participants learn within a very limited number of trials that the CS predicts the occurrence of the US, particularly if appropriate instructions are provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atlas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tabbert et al., 2011</xref>). In case the cerebellum is involved in prediction of the US, cerebellar fMRI signals should be high during CS presentation. As soon as learning has occurred, the occurrence of the US is expected. Thus, if the hypothesis is correct that the cerebellum contributes to aversive prediction errors, cerebellar activation should be increased at unexpected omission of the US (because of a partial reinforcement schedule). During extinction, that is the repeated presentation of CS-only trials, omission of the US becomes expected and cerebellar fMRI signals at the time of US omission should decrease.</p><p>In accordance with the fMRI literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lange et al., 2015</xref>), we found cerebellar activations related to prediction of the US. In addition, marked cerebellar activation was present during unexpected omission of the US, which disappeared during extinction. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the cerebellum is involved in processing of aversive predictions and prediction errors, and has to be added to the neural network underlying emotional associative learning.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>While acquiring 7T fMRI data, 27 participants underwent a differential fear conditioning and extinction paradigm using visual stimuli as CS and an unpleasant, but not painful electrical shock as aversive US. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> displays the experimental paradigm as well as the event blocks chosen for fMRI analysis.

Most importantly, marked cerebellar activation was found also during the unexpected omission of the unpleasant event and disappeared during extinction trials (in which the omission became expected). These findings support the hypothesis that the cerebellum acts as or is part of a predictive device not only in the motor domain, but also in the emotional domain. In addition to the cerebellum, exploratory whole brain analysis showed very similar patterns of activation in the insula, which has been shown to be involved in aversive prediction error processing by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Geuter et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, first evidence was found that the cerebellum is part of a more extended neural network processing prediction errors in learned emotional responses. The discussion will focus on the cerebellar findings, which were also accompanied by changes in functional connectivity predominantly with visual cortices. Hence, one cerebellar role in emotional control may be to modulate processing of fear-related sensory information.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cerebellar activation during presentation and prediction of aversive events</title><p>Cerebellar activation during presentation and prediction of aversive events is in good accordance with the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dimitrova et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lange et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maschke et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ploghaus et al., 1999</xref>).

Furthermore, the level of activation in the posterolateral cerebellum was more related to the experience of the aversive stimulus compared to its prediction. Likewise, other fMRI studies have reported that aversive stimuli result in more widespread cerebellar activations of both anteromedial and posterolateral areas (painful electrical stimulation of the feet: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dimitrova et al., 2003</xref>; airpuffs directed to the eye: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maschke et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moulton et al., 2010</xref>, for review).

Lobules VI, Crus II and X have also been related to emotional processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guell et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, different parts of the cerebellum likely contribute to the various aspects involved in processing of aversive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moulton et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Very similar to our findings, a more recent fMRI study also reported an overlap of cerebellar areas related to the experience and prediction of painful stimuli in Crus I and lobule VI of the posterolateral cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Michelle Welman et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, we suggest a different interpretation of the data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ploghaus et al. (1999)</xref>: rather than reflecting a dissociation between the experience and the prediction of unpleasant events, different parts of the cerebellum are likely involved in the different aspects of learned fear. For example, midline parts of the cerebellum are likely involved in autonomic processes, and posterolateral parts of the cerebellum in cognitive and higher-order emotional processes related to the experience and prediction of potentially harmful stimuli. The known motor areas also likely contribute to this picture. Depending on stimulus intensity, participants may withdraw their hand or at least prepare a hand movement. In fact, early animal, but also human cerebellar lesion studies highlight the involvement of the cerebellar vermis in the conditioning of autonomic fear responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apps and Strata, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apps et al., 2018</xref> for reviews; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sacchetti et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Supple and Leaton, 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Supple and Kapp, 1993</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maschke et al. (2002)</xref> found that fear-conditioned bradycardia was impaired in patients with lesions of the cerebellar midline but not the lateral cerebellar hemispheres. On the other hand, activation of the posterolateral cerebellar hemisphere is very common in human fear conditioning fMRI studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lange et al., 2015</xref>). Given the known reciprocal connections of the posterolateral cerebellum and its output nuclei, the dentate nuclei, with the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Middleton and Strick, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Middleton and Strick, 2000</xref>), lateral activations may reflect the more cognitive aspects of fear conditioning. Contingency awareness may play a critical role: a prerequisite for conditioned fear responses to occur is that participants become aware of the CS-US contingencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dawson and Furedy, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lonsdorf et al., 2017</xref>; for reviews; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tabbert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tabbert et al., 2011</xref>). Contingency awareness is likely linked to working memory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dawson and Furedy, 1976</xref>). In fact, cerebellar activation in lobules VI and Crus I overlaps with areas in the cerebellum which have been shown to contribute to working memory processes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">King et al., 2019</xref>, although in their study ‘active maintenance’ was lateralized to the right; and visual working memory was localized in the vermis). If this assumption is true, the pattern of cerebellar activation should be different in aware and unaware participants. It will be of high interest to test this hypothesis in future studies, for example using multiple CSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rehbein et al., 2014</xref>) or using distractor tasks (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tabbert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tabbert et al., 2011</xref>) to prevent awareness of the CS-US contingencies.</p><p>In the present study, the focus of activation was within Crus I with some extension into lobule VI. Although it cannot be excluded that part of the activation is related to the preparation or subliminal execution of a withdrawal movement, motor-related processes are unlikely to explain the bulk of posterolateral activation. Hand and finger movements result in fMRI activation of ipsilateral lobule V, with additional activation of lobule VI bilaterally in more complex movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">King et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schlerf et al., 2010</xref>). Although some extension to Crus I has been observed in the latter, movements never result in activations primarily of Crus I. Rather, focus of activation is always on lobules V and VI, which was clearly not the case in the present study. Of note, preparation and execution of movements have been found to activate the same cerebellar areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cui et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The present findings agree with the classic view that prediction depends on activity in the same networks that process the actual experience (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">James, 1892</xref>), at least at the level of the cerebellum. Recent single-cell recording studies within the cerebellar cortex in monkeys are also in line with this assumption: both simple and complex spike firing rates at the same Purkinje cell encode movement kinematics and sensory feedback, but also motor predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Popa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Streng et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Streng et al., 2017b</xref>).</p><p>Based on animal and human lesion data, vermal activation is to be expected related to the prediction of the aversive stimulus. A recent fMRI meta-analysis indeed showed activations of both the cerebellar hemispheres and the vermis in fear conditioning paradigms in healthy humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lange et al., 2015</xref>). This was, however, neither the case in the present study nor in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ploghaus et al. (1999)</xref>. Because participants were instructed about the CS-US contingencies to a certain degree in both studies, the cognitive component may have had the strongest impact on the fMRI data.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ploghaus et al. (1999)</xref> reported a similar dissociation for the experience and the prediction of pain in posterior and anterior parts of the insula, respectively. In the present study, we also found activation related to the US in the posterior insula, and activation related to the CS+ (and therefore prediction of the US) in more anterior parts. Very similar to our cerebellar findings, however, US-related activation extended into the more anterior insula and overlapped with CS+ related activations. Again, we hypothesize that this is not a dissociation between experience and prediction but reflects different functional aspects of processing of potentially harmful stimuli. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Frot et al. (2014)</xref> suggested that posterior parts of the insula may be more important in the evaluation of the intensity and localization of an aversive stimulus, whereas the anterior insula may process the emotional reaction to the stimulus. However, as yet, the anterior insula, but not the posterior insula has been shown to be involved in processing predictions of aversive events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Geuter et al., 2017</xref>). Notwithstanding, this concept may also be extended to other brain areas, for example. the medial and anterior cingulate cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Vogt, 2014</xref>). In the present study, however, no other cerebral regions showed significant activations related to the prediction of the aversive stimulus in the whole brain analysis using a conservative statistical threshold.</p><p>It should be noted that a nonselective analysis of cerebellar (and cerebral) activations has been performed, that is interpretation of specific regional activations has been done a posteriori. Another approach would comprise a selective analysis of (a priori) functionally defined ROIs based on the recent studies mapping the cerebellum to a broad range of functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">King et al., 2019</xref>). As yet, however, there are important open questions regarding cerebellar areas involved in emotions. The emotional area described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guell et al. (2018)</xref> is based on one single task, not on a meta-analysis of a significant number of different emotional tasks. In the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">King et al. (2019)</xref>, more tasks included emotional processing. However, emotional processing did not become part of any of the 10 main functional regions of the cerebellum introduced by the authors. Furthermore, they found that vermal activation was best explained by eye movements (or visual attention), but not emotional processing as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guell et al. (2018)</xref>. Thus, as yet, a nonselective analysis gives a more unbiased picture of cerebellar regions involved in fear conditioning. We do acknowledge, however, that this approach allows only limited conclusions on the possible contributions of selective cerebellar areas to learned fear responses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cerebellar activation during the unexpected omission of predicted aversive events</title><p>We found cerebellar activation related to the predicted occurrence of an aversive US. More prominent cerebellar activations, however, were observed during the unexpected omission of the unpleasant event. Cerebellar activation was most marked in the posterolateral cerebellum (lobules Crus I, VI), but additional activations were also present in the vermis. Importantly, cerebellar activation vanished during extinction trials, during which the omission of the US became expected. These findings support the hypothesis that the cerebellum is involved in encoding and/or processing of prediction errors. The present findings are supported by earlier findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ploghaus et al., 2000</xref>) reporting activations of the posterolateral cerebellar hemisphere in the very first extinction trial in an associative learning task using painful heat stimuli as US. Our findings are also very similar to findings in a recent fMRI study on the cerebellar contributions to language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moberget et al., 2014</xref>): Activation of the posterolateral cerebellum (Crus I and II) was related to the predictability of upcoming words in a sentence (e.g., two plus two is <italic>four</italic>). Similar to the present findings, prominent cerebellar activation was also observed when this prediction was violated (e.g., two plus two is <italic>apple</italic>). In the sensorimotor domain, fMRI data in humans also show cerebellar activation related to the unexpected omission of an expected sensory stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ramnani et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schlerf et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Based on theoretical models it has long been assumed that error information is sent to the cerebellar cortex via the climbing fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albus, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marr, 1969</xref>). Climbing fibers have been shown to signal the unexpected occurrence and the unexpected omission of the airpuff-US in eyeblink conditioning in mice and rabbits (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ohmae and Medina, 2015</xref>, for a recent study): Whereas the unexpected occurrence leads to an increase of climbing fiber activity, the unexpected omission results in a decrease. Because the fMRI signal is thought to reflect synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lauritzen et al., 2012</xref>), decrease of climbing fiber input cannot explain the observed increased fMRI signal in the cerebellar cortex during US omission. Prediction errors, however, may not only be signaled by the climbing fiber system. There is also evidence that mossy fibers play a role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Popa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Streng et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, the role of the cerebellum may go beyond the processing of sensory predictions and sensory prediction errors and may include reward predictions and prediction errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wagner et al., 2017</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wagner et al. (2017)</xref> found granule cells that responded preferentially to reward, to reward omission and reward anticipation, a function commonly ascribed to the dopaminergic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schultz, 2017</xref>). Importantly, reward omission granule cells were significantly more frequent than reward cells. In addition to sensory and reward prediction errors, the cerebellum may be involved in prediction of punishment and punishment prediction errors. As outlined in the introduction, several brain areas are likely involved in the processing of predictions and prediction errors in associative fear learning. As yet, it is unknown where prediction errors of learned fear responses are encoded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tovote et al., 2015</xref>). Because there is some experimental evidence that sensory prediction errors are encoded in the cerebellar cortex and nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brooks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ohmae and Medina, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Popa and Ebner, 2018</xref>), the cerebellum is a likely candidate. However, this issue is far from being settled and extracerebellar areas may also play a role.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Changes in connectivity between the cerebellum and visual cortex</title><p>Functional connectivity of the cerebellum was increased with visual cortical areas when comparing CS+ with CS- trials and with limbic areas during presentation of the US, but not during its prediction. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lithari et al. (2016)</xref> found that visual cortex processing plays a more central role and that limbic areas become functionally decoupled in a fear conditioning paradigm. Increased connectivity between the cerebellum and visual cortex suggests that the cerebellum contributes to the known enhancement of the perception of visual stimuli during fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Petro et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>However, at first sight, increased connectivity between the cerebellum and visual cortex is unexpected. In monkeys, the primary visual cortex has no known afferent connections with the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Glickstein et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schmahmann and Pandya, 1997</xref>). Likewise, resting state fMRI revealed no functional connectivity between the cerebellum and primary visual cortex in a large study population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buckner et al., 2011</xref>). Rather, the cerebellum receives dense afferent connections from the dorsal stream of parietal lobe visual areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Glickstein, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schmahmann and Pandya, 1997</xref>) and is known to increase visual perception of movements (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Christensen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Händel et al., 2009</xref>). The influence of the cerebellum on the perception of fear-conditioned visual stimuli may be indirect: enhanced processing of fear conditioned visual stimuli in the visual cortex has been shown to be under the control of cortical structures, in particular the middle frontal gyrus (MFG; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Petro et al., 2017</xref>). Bidirectional cerebello-frontal connections are known for the frontal eye field and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which play an important role in attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Middleton and Strick, 2001</xref>). Possibly, the cerebellum may help to increase selective attention to the CS. The present findings, however, are based on PPI, which do not give any information about directionality.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The most important present finding is the pronounced cerebellar activation during the unexpected omission of a predicted aversive stimulus. This cerebellar activation is best explained by the generation or further processing of prediction errors. As expected, cerebellar activation was also found during the prediction of aversive stimuli. These findings support the hypothesis that the cerebellum is of general importance for predictive control including the emotional domain. The cerebellum has to be added to the more extended neural network involved in processing of aversive predictions and prediction errors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Experiment power was estimated based on previous eyeblink conditioning data, which had also been acquired at 7 T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ernst et al., 2017</xref>) using the fmriPower toolbox for MATLAB (fmripower.org; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mumford, 2012</xref>). Considering CS-only trials in acquisition and aiming for a power of 80% at p&lt;0.001, group sizes were estimated to 21 participants for lobule VI and 30 participants for Crus I ipsilaterally to US application.</p><p>A total of 27 young and healthy participants performed the experiment. Three participants had to be excluded because of technical errors, one participant because of an incidental finding on brain MRI, and one participant because of constant motion throughout MRI acquisition. Thus, a total of 22 participants (eight males, 14 females, mean age: 26.9 (SD = 4.3) years, range: 19–32 years) were included in the final data analysis. None of the participants presented with neurological or neuropsychiatric disorders based on medical history. None were taking centrally acting drugs, except two who were taking a low dosage of a corticosteroid and an antihistamine, respectively. All participants were right-handed based on the Edinburgh handedness inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Oldfield, 1971</xref>) and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. They were asked to refrain from alcohol consumption the night before the experiment. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study was approved by the local ethics committee and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Fear conditioning</title><p>The entire experiment was performed within one session inside the MRI scanner. The paradigm presentation was controlled by a computer running the software Presentation (version 16.4, Neurobehavioral System Inc, Berkeley, CA). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> displays the experimental paradigm. Participants were shown images of the visual stimuli used in the experiment and told that electrical shocks would be applied during the experiment. They were instructed that, should they perceive a pattern between CS and US presentations, the experimenter would not change it during the experiment.</p><p>Visual stimuli were projected onto a rear projection screen inside the scanner bore using a standard projector. Images were visible to the participants through a mirror mounted on the radiofrequency (RF) head coil. Two pictures of black-and-white geometric figures (a square and a diamond shape, that is the square tilted by 45°) of identical brightness were used as CS+ and CS- (time of presentation: 8 s). In reinforced CS+ trials (i.e. 10 out of 16 acquisition trials), the visual stimulus co-terminated with the presentation of the aversive US. In CS- trials, the visual stimulus was never followed by the aversive US. A neutral black background image was displayed in between visual stimulus presentations (ITI randomized between 16 s and 20 s). Use of the two figures as CS+ and CS- was pseudorandomly counterbalanced between the individual participants.</p><p>A short electrical stimulation was used as an aversive US. The electrical stimulation was generated by a constant current stimulator (DS7A, Digitimer Ltd., London, UK) and applied to the left hand via a concentric (ring-shaped) bipolar surface electrode with 6 mm conductive diameter and a central platinum pin (WASP electrode, Specialty Developments, Bexley, UK). For MR-safety reasons, an in-house build non-magnetic high-resistivity electrode lead was used to connect the stimulator with the surface electrode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schmidt et al., 2016</xref>). The 100 ms US consisted of a short train of four consecutive 500 µs current pulses (maximum output voltage: 400 V) with an inter pulse interval of 33 ms. Immediately before the start of MRI measurements, the stimulation current was gradually increased, and participants were asked to report on the perceived sensation intensity until an ‘unpleasant but not painful’ intensity was reached (mean current: 3.9 (SD = 2.3) mA, range 1.6–9.3 mA). The final individual current setting was kept constant for all stimulations. Stimulus timing was set for the US to co-terminate with visual CS+ presentation.</p><p>During the experiment three types of trials were presented to the participants: CS+ followed by an US (paired CS+/US trial), CS+ without an US (CS+ only trial) and CS- without US (CS- only trial). The experimental protocol consisted of the three phases: ‘habituation’ (four CS+ only trials, four CS- only trials, presented in alternating order), ‘acquisition’ (10 paired CS+/US trials, six CS+ only trials, 16 CS- only trials) and ‘extinction’ (16 CS+ trials, 16 CS- only trials). Different trial types in acquisition and extinction were presented in a pseudorandomized order with four restrictions: firstly, the first two trials of acquisition were set to be paired CS+/US trials; secondly, there were never more than two consecutive CS of one kind presented in a row; thirdly, during acquisition and extinction the number of events of each kind was kept identical in the first half and in the second half of the experiment; and fourthly, the very last trial of acquisition was set to be a paired CS+/US trial. During acquisition, the order of events was the same for all participants, while use of the two different figures as CS+ and CS- was counterbalanced across the whole group. Order of CS+ and CS- events was counterbalanced during extinction (12 starting with CS+, 10 starting with CS-), and habituation (15 starting with CS+, seven starting with CS-). Each experimental phase was performed within a separate block of fMRI data acquisition.</p><p>Of note, fear conditioning in both animals and humans are commonly done with long CS-US intervals because measures of autonomic fear responses evolve slowly. Different to eyeblink conditioning, fear conditioning is tolerant to these long CS-US periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carter et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lonsdorf et al., 2017</xref>). This allows performance of event-related fMRI studies, which can separate between CS-related activation, US-related activation, and activation related to the omission of the US. Both animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lavond et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sacchetti et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Supple and Leaton, 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Supple and Leaton, 1990b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Supple and Kapp, 1993</xref>) and human studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maschke et al., 2002</xref>) have shown that the cerebellar vermis is involved in fear conditioning – despite these long CS-US time intervals.

Semi-automated peak detection was performed, and SCR were defined as the maximum trough-to-peak-amplitude of any SCR peak within a given time interval.

Further imaging parameters were set as follows: TR/TE, 6000/3.45 ms, TI1/TI2, 800/2700 ms, flip angles 1/2, 4°/5°, parallel acceleration factor, 3, phase and slice partial Fourier factor, 6/8, acquisition matrix, 320 × 300, number of slices, 192, TA, 9:40 min.</p><p>Whole brain functional fMRI acquisition was performed using a fat-saturated, two-dimensional simultaneous multi slice echo planar image (SMS-EPI) sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cauley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Setsompop et al., 2012</xref>) with an isotropic voxel size of 1.7 mm, in three consecutive episodes for habituation (90 volumes), acquisition and extinction (320 volumes each). Imaging parameters were selected as follows: TR/TE, 2000/22 ms, flip angle, 70°, parallel acceleration factor, 2, SMS factor, 3, phase partial Fourier factor, 6/8, acquisition matrix, 130 × 130, number of slices, 90.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Image processing</title><p>All image and fMRI analyses were performed using SPM 12 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_007037">SCR_007037</ext-link>, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) on a platform running MATLAB on Mac OS X 10.12.6, if not explicitly stated otherwise. SPM default brightness threshold was set from 0.8 to 0.1 to avoid signal dropouts within the hypointense cerebellar nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Thürling et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Functional MRI volumes for each participant were corrected for slice timing and realigned to the first volume of the habituation phase. One mean functional volume per participant was calculated.</p><p>Brain extraction was performed on non-denoised uniform T1 weighted (UNI) volumes using the CBS tools for high-resolution processing of high-field brain MRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bazin et al., 2014</xref>). Best coregistration of the mean functional volume to the brain extracted structural volume was achieved using the function ‘epi_reg’ available in FSL (Release 5.0.10, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002823">SCR_002823</ext-link>, Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain, Oxford, UK). Coregistration was subsequently applied to all functional volumes of each respective participant.</p><p>Normalization of the cerebellum was performed using the SUIT-toolbox for SPM (version 3.1, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_004969">SCR_004969</ext-link>). Using the spatially unbiased atlas template of the human cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diedrichsen, 2006</xref>), brain-extracted structural volumes were segmented and cerebellar masks were generated. Manual correction of each mask was performed by an experienced technician using MRIcron software (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002403">SCR_002403</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rorden and Brett, 2000</xref>) and slightly smoothed with an isotropic smoothing kernel of 1.5 mm (and subsequently thresholded against a value of 0.5) to remove remnant single outlying voxels. Using this process, on average 6.2% (SD 2.0%) of voxels (predominantly in the anterior region) were removed from, and 3.6% (SD 1.3%) of voxels (mainly in the dorsal region) were added to the cerebellar masks. The segmented structural images and the cortical cerebellar mask were supplied to a region of interest (ROI)-based DARTEL normalization algorithm available within the SUIT toolbox, and a cerebellar normalization was calculated. In addition, whole-brain normalization to MNI-space was obtained using the SPM segment routine. Functional volumes were then separately normalized to SUIT space using the corrected cerebellar mask from SUIT segmentation and MNI space (whole brain). All normalized volumes were subsequently smoothed by an isotropic smoothing kernel of 4 mm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>fMRI analysis</title><p>We focused our fMRI analysis on the cerebellum. In addition, exploratory analysis of the whole brain was performed. The first level analysis was modelled as an event related-design. All US, no-US and CS event regressors were modelled for the respective stimulus onset and all the respective durations were set to 0 s. The first five volumes of each fMRI run were disregarded. Events were blocked into 19 regressors of interest as displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. If number of trials allowed (n ≥ 4), events of each kind were grouped in two equal-sized blocks representing the first (early) and the second (late) half of each phase. Regressors were chosen for CS+ and CS- during habituation (two regressors, four events each), CS+ and CS- presentations during acquisition and extinction (eight regressors, eight events each), US presentations during acquisition (two regressors, five events each), and the omission of US presentations (no-US) at the expected time of US presentations after CS onset (no-US post CS+: one regressor, six events during acquisition, two regressors, eight events each during extinction; no-US post CS-: four regressors, eight events each during acquisition and extinction).</p><p>To correct for motion, volume realignment parameters were prepared as six nuisance regressors (three translations and three rotations). Pulse oximetry and respiration data from PMU were processed using essential features of the PhLEM toolbox for SPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Verstynen and Deshpande, 2011</xref>). To correct for physiological motion effects the RETROICOR (retrospective image-based correction) method was applied and eight regressors were generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Glover et al., 2000</xref>), resulting in a total of 14 nuisance regressors for each fMRI run. To ensure that no significant information was lost as a result of physiological denoising, an additional analysis with motion regressors but without RETROICOR was performed. Similarly, to ensure that no fine details were lost as a result of smoothing, a further analysis was performed using the normalized, un-smoothed functional data.</p><p>First level main effect contrasts against rest and differential first level contrasts were generated and tested in second level <italic>t</italic>-tests. The contrast ‘US post CS+ &gt; no US post CS-’ was calculated to reveal activation in response to the presentation of the aversive stimulus (US). The contrast ‘CS+ &gt; CS-’ was calculated to reveal activation related to the prediction of the US. Finally, the contrast ‘no-US post CS+&gt;no US post CS-’ was calculated to reveal activation related to the omission of the US. For second level <italic>t</italic>-tests, first level differential contrasts for acquisition and extinction phase were collapsed over early and late blocks, respectively. Contrasts were never collapsed across experimental phases. To evaluate differences between early and late acquisition and extinction, individual second level within-subject ANOVA were modelled for the contrasts 'CS+ &gt; CS-' and “no-US post CS+ &gt; no US post CS-', and (for acquisition only) for the contrast 'US post CS+ &gt; no US post CS-'. TFCE was applied using the TFCE toolbox for SPM12 (R164 and R174, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dbm.neuro.uni-jena.de/tfce/">http://dbm.neuro.uni-jena.de/tfce/</ext-link>).</p><p>In addition, second level one-way ANOVA was modeled for the three main acquisition contrasts (considering early and late acquisition together). To identify regions of shared activation, conjunction analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Price and Friston, 1997</xref>) was performed to test global null hypotheses for each of the three contrasts. Using the same second level model, the main effect of contrast was calculated to assess differences between the three contrasts (<italic>F</italic>-test, contrast vector: [1 -1 0; 0 1 -1]).</p><p>PPI were modelled for the whole brain analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Friston et al., 1997</xref>) using cerebellar VOI based on conjunction analysis in SUIT space as seed regions. TFCE was applied on the results. Additionally, region mean <italic>β</italic> values for selected VOIs were extracted from simple first level <italic>β</italic> maps against rest and compared between CS and US events using ANOVA and paired <italic>t</italic>-tests. To exclude the possibility that the observed functional connectivity between cerebellum and occipital cortex was driven by ‘bleed over’ from visual cortex, PPI was reanalyzed using the mean signal modulation in the section of occipital lobe closer than 6 mm to the cerebellum as first level nuisance regressor, in analogy to the work performed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buckner et al. (2011)</xref>.</p><p>Activation maps were masked in SUIT space using the SUIT atlas volume (Cerebellum-SUIT.nii) with the inner-cerebellar white matter manually filled in, and in MNI space using the SPM canonical inner-cranial volume mask (mask_ICV.nii). To display results, cerebellar (SUIT space) activation maps were projected on cerebellar flatmaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Diedrichsen and Zotow, 2015</xref>). Whole brain MNI space activation maps were projected on MNI152 average T1 volume provided with SPM (icbm_avg_152_t1_tal_lin.nii). To acquire anatomical region labels, maps were then projected onto the SUIT atlas volume (Cerebellum-SUIT.nii, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diedrichsen, 2006</xref>) and the automated anatomical labeling (AAL)﻿ atlas volume (AAL.nii, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003550">SCR_003550</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002</xref>), respectively.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank M Craske for her valuable advice and fruitful discussions, J Marquez for his support using the MP2RAGE sequence, B Poser for his work on the SMS-EPI sequence, and T Otto for his work on SCR analysis.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Sam McDougle as the Reviewing Editor and Richard Ivry as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Torgeir Moberget and Maedbh King.</p><p>Your submission has been favorably evaluated though several major concerns must be addressed for re-submission of the manuscript. We have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revision.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors present an fMRI fear conditioning paradigm, and test the prediction that acquired responses to visual conditioning stimuli (i.e., shape images) and a paired aversive tactile unconditioned stimulus (i.e., a brief electric shock) will be observed in the cerebellum during the conditioning process, and will change predictably over the course of learning and extinction. The fMRI results appear to support these predictions, showing reliable activity in lateral regions of the cerebellum in response to the conditioning stimulus (CS+) versus a non-paired stimulus (CS-), and also in response to an omitted US following a CS+, subsequent to the acquisition of the fear association. Moreover, PPI analyses reveal learning-related connectivity patterns between the cerebellum and striate visual cortex, as well as the insula, implicating the cerebellum in a wider network of regions contributing to the conditioning process. These results in the affective domain support the broader idea that the cerebellum is a generalized predictive substrate, one that is involved in various learning domains outside of the traditionally highlighted role in motor learning.</p><p>While we see considerable value in this work in terms of expanding our conceptualization of the functional domain of the cerebellum, there are some methodological details that need to be clarified, as well as additional control analyses to support the interpretations of the imaging results, as well as further efforts in linking the current results to the literature.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Did the authors make a priori predictions about ROI activation? Given the work that has been done to map the cognitive cerebellum, the authors could have theorized that the activation would be elicited in &quot;emotional&quot; (Guell et al., 2018) or &quot;prediction&quot; (Moberget et al., 2014) regions of the cerebellum. Instead, their interpretations of the specific regional activations found seemed to be done a posteriori. This important distinction should be discussed. Moreover, several of the cerebellar foci reported in the current paper (Crus I, lobule VI) appear to overlap with cerebellar regions typically associated with higher cognitive function (e.g., working memory). Since the subjects quickly grasped the association between CS+ and US, and could in most cases explicitly report this afterwards, could representations of the learned associations in working memory explain the engagement of more &quot;cognitive&quot; cerebellar regions? In other words, if the association had been harder to detect explicitly by the subjects (e.g., by including many more conditioned stimuli with varying association levels with the US), would the authors expect the same results/regions?</p><p>2) Re: heart rate and respiration. Particularly with a fear conditioning paradigm, it could be argued that the results are vulnerable to task-related changes in heart rate, which can confound functional data. Importantly, both of these variables were measured and accounted for in the GLM. However, it would be useful to know if either one changed predictably during the acquisition and extinction phases (e.g., ramped up in anticipation of the US), so the potential for collinearity would be clearer.</p><p>3) One concern is that the PPI results (specifically the observed FC between cerebellum and occipital regions) could be driven by &quot;bleed over&quot; from visual cortex. The authors mention that they manually corrected the cerebellar mask but they did not provide any specific details. Given the importance of this analysis, extra care should be taken here to ensure that there is no mixture of signals. The mask could be recomputed (e.g., perhaps by regressing out signal from visual cortex like in Buckner et al. (2011) or a &quot;buffer mask&quot; could be created by removing voxels from both the occipital lobe + anterior cerebellum so that there is no abutting regions). One or both of these analyses used to recompute would provide assurance that the PPI results are not contaminated by bleed over.</p><p>4) One reviewer expressed concern that smoothing was done, given the high-resolution 7T data. While smoothing is common, it would be nice to know how different the (cerebellar) results come out if the data are unsmoothed.</p><p>5) Co-registration appeared to be done between the mean EPI and structural images. The EPIs were then corrected for slice timing and realigned to the first volume of the habituation phase. Were the EPIs first realigned to the &quot;corrected&quot; mean EPI image (the one coregistered with the anatomical image)? If not, it seems that the functional and anatomical images were not in the same space, which would be problematic. Moreover, the functional volumes were normalized to SUIT space, though it's not clear whether the mask used to do this was based only on the voxels from the corrected anatomical mask (cerebellum only) or whether it was a &quot;functional&quot; mask. This should be made clear in the manuscript.</p><p>6) The 8 second interval between the CS and US is much longer than what is thought to be the &quot;effective&quot; time scale of cerebellar learning (e.g., around 500ms in eyeblink conditioning paradigms; Schneiderman and Gormezano, 1964). The authors should discuss the choice of this particular interval, and address the discrepancy between the length of their chosen interval and the conventional understanding that there is only a small temporal window for cerebellar-driven learning to occur.</p><p>7) For the CS+&gt;CS- contrast, was this analysis collapsed over the habituation, acquisition, and extinction phases? It would seem odd to include the habituation phase. Moreover, the acquisition and extinction phases should theoretically produce different results as well. The authors should perform this contrast over each phase separately. Moreover, it would be useful to have the CS+/CS- β results for the habituation phase (subsection “Mean β values related to each event (presentation of US, CS+, CS-, omission of US) compared to rest”) included, and those should also be included in Figure 5.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46831.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Did the authors make a priori predictions about ROI activation?

Interpretation of specific regional activations has been done a posteriori.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that another approach would have comprised a selective analysis of (a priori) functionally defined ROIs based on the recent studies mapping the cerebellum to a broad range of functions. Although this is a very attractive approach, there are still some limitations. Firstly, it remains unclear whether or not there is “a” prediction region in the cerebellum. This does not exclude that there is overlap between prediction-related activities across different tasks. A future meta-analysis of prediction-related cerebellar fMRI activity across different task domains would help to answer this question. Secondly, there are important open questions regarding cerebellar areas involved in emotions. The emotional area described by Guell et al. (2018) is based on one single task, but not on a meta-analysis of a significant number of different emotional tasks. In the King et al. (2019) study, four tasks included emotional processing. However, emotional processing did not become part of any of the ten main functional regions of the cerebellum introduced by the authors. Furthermore, they found that vermal activation was best explained by eye movements (or visual attention), but not emotional processing as reported by Guell et al. (2018).</p><p>Thus, as yet, we feel that a nonselective analysis gives a more unbiased picture of cerebellar regions involved in fear conditioning. We do acknowledge, however, that this approach does allow only limited conclusions on the possible contributions of selective cerebellar areas to learned fear responses. The Discussion has been revised accordingly (subsection “Cerebellar activation during the presentation and the prediction of aversive events”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, several of the cerebellar foci reported in the current paper (Crus I, lobule VI) appear to overlap with cerebellar regions typically associated with higher cognitive function (e.g., working memory).

Yes, we fully agree that cerebellar activation in lobules VI and Crus I overlap with areas in the cerebellum which have been shown to contribute to cognitive functions including working memory (e.g. Guell et al., 2018; King et al., 2019, although in this study “active maintenance” was lateralized to the right; and visual working memory was localized in the vermis). We believe that this makes very good sense: in human studies, the main output measure of conditioned fear are increases in skin conductance response (SCR) and changes in ratings of US expectancy or fear (e.g. Lonsdorf et al., 2017 for recent review). A prerequisite for these conditioned fear responses to occur is that participants become aware of the CS-US contingencies (Dawson and Furedy, 1976; Lonsdorf et al., 2017, for reviews; Tabbert et al., 2006; Tabbert et al., 2011). Contingency awareness is likely linked to working memory processes (Dawson and Furedy, 1976). Thus, at least part of the activations seen in the lateral cerebellar hemisphere may be due to higher cognitive processes involved in differential fear conditioning. If this assumption is true, the pattern of cerebellar activation should be different in aware and unaware participants. This hypothesis could be tested in future studies, e.g. by using multiple CSs as suggested by the reviewers (see also Rehbein et al., 2014) or by using distractor tasks (e.g. Tabbert et al., 2006; Tabbert et al., 2011) to prevent awareness of the CS-US contingencies. The contribution of higher cognitive function to fear conditioning is discussed in more detail in the revised Discussion subsection “Cerebellar activation during the presentation and the prediction of aversive events”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Re: heart rate and respiration.

However, it would be useful to know if either one changed predictably during the acquisition and extinction phases (e.g., ramped up in anticipation of the US), so the potential for collinearity would be clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>This is correct. In fear conditioning, changes of heart (and respiration) rate are to be expected. Both conditioned bradycardia and tachycardia has been observed, with conditioned bradycardia being more likely in a restraint animal, and in humans using neutral CSs (Lonsdorf et al., 2017; Maschke et al., 2002). To evaluate fear-conditioned variations in heart rate, however, an electrocardiogram (ECG) with a sampling rate of 500 Hz or above is recommended (Quintana et al., 2016). Unfortunately, a 7T fMRI compatible ECG was not available to us. Instead, heart rate was acquired with a pulse oximeter sensor attached to a finger with a sampling rate of 50 Hz. The low sampling rate, as well as the broad and time delayed pulse oximeter curve (compared to the ECG's well-defined and instantaneous R-peaks) did not allow for the accuracy needed to observe small variations in heart rate. This limitation has been added to the revised Materials and methods section (subsection “Physiological data acquisition”). Of note, an unpleasant, but not painful US was used, and only small changes in heart rate are to be expected. In fact, we did analyze the pulse oximetry data, and – as expected – were unable to detect any changes.</p><p>Changes in respiration rate are not recommended as a physiological outcome measure of fear conditioning in human studies (Lonsdorf et al., 2017). Given a normal respiration rate of 12-18/minute and a CS-US time window of 8 seconds, fear conditioned changes of respiration rate cannot be reliably assessed. In addition, the same limitations as for measures based on pulse oximetry apply.</p><p>For fMRI with a TR of 2 seconds, however, the measured pulse (and respiration) signal is of acceptable quality and can be used to perform retrospective physiological denoising (RETROICOR, Glover et al., 2000). For illustration, non-denoised evaluation of the three main contrasts in acquisition is now presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 2A-C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) One concern is that the PPI results (specifically the observed FC between cerebellum and occipital regions) could be driven by &quot;bleed over&quot; from visual cortex.

Data has been recomputed using the method introduced by Buckner et al. (2011). Data is presented in Figure 6—figure supplement 1. The general pattern did not change, so we do not have any hint for a possible “bleed over”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) One reviewer expressed concern that smoothing was done, given the high-resolution 7T data. While smoothing is common, it would be nice to know how different the (cerebellar) results come out if the data are unsmoothed.</p></disp-quote><p>Done. Additional data analysis of the three main contrasts is provided in Figure 3—figure supplement 2G-I, based on un-smoothed functional data. By omitting smoothing, cerebellar activation patterns are essentially unchanged, except for a small decrease of activation in the vermal region and lobule VIII.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Co-registration appeared to be done between the mean EPI and structural images. The EPIs were then corrected for slice timing and realigned to the first volume of the habituation phase.

This should be made clear in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this helpful comment. The Materials and methods section has been revised to more correctly represent the actual order of preprocessing operations and the origin of the cerebellar mask used for normalization to SUIT space (subsection “Image processing”, last paragraph).</p><p>In brief, functional data was first slice-time corrected and realigned to the first volume of the habituation phase, by which step a mean functional image was auto-generated by SPM. This mean functional image was coregistered with the anatomical image and the coregistration transformation was subsequently applied to all the participants’ slice-time corrected and realigned functional volumes.</p><p>Cerebellar masks were generated using the SUIT Segment and Isolate routine, manually corrected by an experienced technician, slightly smoothed (isotropic kernel of 1.5 mm on 1 mm masks) to remove stray voxels and artificially steep steps in the mask outline from manual slice-wise drawing, thresholded against a value of 0.5 and supplied to the SUIT Normalize DARTEL routine.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The 8 second interval between the CS and US is much longer than what is thought to be the &quot;effective&quot; time scale of cerebellar learning (e.g., around 500ms in eyeblink conditioning paradigms; Schneiderman and Gormezano, 1964). The authors should discuss the choice of this particular interval, and address the discrepancy between the length of their chosen interval and the conventional understanding that there is only a small temporal window for cerebellar-driven learning to occur.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good question. Because measures of autonomic fear responses evolve slowly (SCR, heart rate change), fear conditioning in both animals and humans are commonly done with long CS-US intervals. Different to eyeblink conditioning, fear conditioning is tolerant to long CS-US periods (Carter et al., 2003; Lonsdorf et al., 2017). This allows to perform event-related fMRI studies, which can separate between CS-related activation, US-related activation, and activation related to the omission of the US – which is not possible in eyeblink conditioning studies (using the most optimal CS-US time window of around 500 ms). Both animal (Lavond et al., 1984; Sacchetti et al., 2002; Supple and Leaton, 1990a; Supple and Leaton, 1990b; Supple and Kapp, 1993) and human studies (Maschke et al., 2002) have shown that the cerebellar vermis is involved in fear conditioning – despite these long CS-US time intervals. Read-outs in theanimal studies were either freezing behavior or changes in heart rate. We agree with the reviewers that this is somewhatcounterintuitive, because the cerebellum is generally thought to be important in tasks with much smaller time scales. The contribution of the cerebellum to discrete somatic motor behavior (such as eyeblink responses) may be different compared to slowly reacting autonomic responses, but also in cognitive tasks (e.g. working memory or language tasks). We added a brief discussion of the differences between eyeblink and fear conditioning to the revised manuscript to account for this helpful comment (subsection “Fear conditioning”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) For the CS+&gt;CS- contrast, was this analysis collapsed over the habituation, acquisition, and extinction phases?
