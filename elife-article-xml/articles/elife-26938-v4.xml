Although these communities are often densely colonized, a broadly distributed contact-dependent mechanism of interbacterial antagonism utilized by Firmicutes has not been elucidated. Here we show that proteins belonging to the LXG polymorphic toxin family present in <italic>Streptococcus intermedius</italic> mediate cell contact- and Esx secretion pathway-dependent growth inhibition of diverse Firmicute species. The structure of one such toxin revealed a previously unobserved protein fold that we demonstrate directs the degradation of a uniquely bacterial molecule required for cell wall biosynthesis, lipid II. Consistent with our functional data linking LXG toxins to interbacterial interactions in <italic>S. intermedius</italic>, we show that LXG genes are prevalent in the human gut microbiome, a polymicrobial community dominated by Firmicutes. We speculate that interbacterial antagonism mediated by LXG toxins plays a critical role in shaping Firmicute-rich bacterial communities.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26938.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26938.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26938.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most bacteria live in densely colonized environments, such as the human gut, in which they must constantly compete with other microbes for space and nutrients. As a result, bacteria have evolved a wide array of strategies to directly fight their neighbors. For example, some bacteria release antimicrobial compounds into their surroundings, while others ‘inject’ protein toxins directly into adjacent cells.</p><p>Bacteria can be classified into two groups known as Gram-positive and Gram-negative. Previous studies found that Gram-negative bacteria inject toxins into neighboring cells, but no comparable toxins in Gram-positive bacteria had been identified. Before a bacterium can inject molecules into an adjacent cell, it needs to move the toxins from its interior to the cell surface. It had been suggested that a transport system in Gram-positive bacteria called the Esx pathway may export toxins known as LXG proteins. However, it was not clear whether these proteins help Gram-positive bacteria to compete against other bacteria.</p><p>Whitney et al. studied the LXG proteins in Gram-positive bacteria known as Firmicutes. The experiments reveal that Firmicutes found in the human gut possess LXG genes. A Firmicute known as <italic>Streptococcus intermedius</italic> produces three LXG proteins that are all toxic to bacteria. To avoid being harmed by its own LXG proteins, <italic>S. intermedius</italic> also produces matching antidote proteins. Further experiments show that LXG proteins are exported out of <italic>S. intermedius</italic> cells and into adjacent competitor bacteria by the Esx pathway. Examining one of these LXG proteins in more detail showed that it can degrade a molecule that bacteria need to make their cell wall.</p><p>Together, these findings suggest that LXG proteins may influence the species living in many important microbial communities, including the human gut. Changes in the communities of gut microbes have been linked with many diseases. Therefore, understanding more about how the LXG proteins work may help us to develop ways to manipulate these communities to improve human health.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

environments must persist in the face of frequent physical encounters with competing organisms. Studies have revealed Gram-negative bacterial species contend with this threat by utilizing pathways that mediate antagonism toward contacting bacterial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Konovalova and Søgaard-Andersen, 2011</xref>). For instance, Proteobacteria widely employ contact-dependent inhibition (CDI) to intoxicate competitor cells that share a high degree of phylogenetic relatedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hayes et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, both Proteobacteria and bacteria belonging to the divergent phylum Bacteroidetes deliver toxins to competitor Gram-negative cells in an indiscriminate fashion through the type VI secretion system (T6SS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Russell et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2014b</xref>). Although toxin delivery by CDI and the T6SS is mechanistically distinct, cells harboring either pathway share the feature of prohibiting self-intoxication with immunity proteins that selectively inactivate cognate toxins through direct binding.</p><p>Few mechanisms that mediate direct antagonism between Gram-positive bacteria have been identified. In <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, Sec-exported proteins belonging to the YD-repeat family have been shown to potently inhibit the growth of contacting cells belonging to the same strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koskiniemi et al., 2013</xref>); however, to our knowledge, a pathway that mediates interspecies antagonism between Gram-positive bacteria has not been identified. Given that Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria inhabit many of the same densely populated polymicrobial environments (e.g. the human gut), it stands to reason that the former should also possess mechanisms for more indiscriminate targeting of competing cells.</p><p>Contact-dependent toxin translocation between bacteria is primarily achieved using specialized secretion systems. Gram-negative export machineries of secretion types IV, V, and VI have each been implicated in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aoki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hood et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Souza et al., 2015</xref>). A specialized secretion system widely distributed among Gram-positive bacteria is the Esx pathway (also referred to as type VII secretion) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdallah et al., 2007</xref>). This pathway was first identified in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, where it plays a critical role in virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stanley et al., 2003</xref>). Indeed, attenuation of the vaccine strain <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG can be attributed to a deletion inactivating ESX-1 secretion system present in virulence strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lewis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pym et al., 2003</xref>). Subsequent genomic studies revealed that the Esx pathway is widely distributed in Actinobacteria, and that a divergent form is present in Firmicutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gey Van Pittius et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pallen, 2002</xref>). Though they share little genetic similarity, all Esx pathways studied to-date utilize a characteristic FtsK-like AAA+ ATPase referred to as EssC (or EccC) to catalyze the export of one or more substrates belonging to the WXG100 protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ates et al., 2016</xref>). Proteins in this family, including ESAT-6 (EsxA) and CFP10 (EsxB) from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, heterodimerize in order to transit the secretion machinery.</p><p>The presence of the Esx secretion system in environmental bacteria as well as commensal and pathogenic bacteria that specialize in colonizing non-sterile sites of their hosts, suggests that the pathway may be functionally pliable. Supporting this notion, ESX-3 of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is required for mycobactin siderophore-based iron acquisition and the ESX-1 and ESX-4 systems of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> are linked to DNA transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gray et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Siegrist et al., 2009</xref>). In Firmicutes, a <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> Esx-exported DNase toxin termed EssD (or EsaD) has been linked to virulence and contact-independent intraspecies antibacterial activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ohr et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Aravind and colleagues have noted that Esx secretion system genes are often linked to genes encoding polymorphic toxins belonging to the LXG protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Analogous to characteristic antimicrobial polymorphic toxins of Gram-negative bacteria, the LXG proteins consist of a conserved N-terminal domain (LXG), a middle domain of variable length, and a C-terminal variable toxin domain. The LXG domain is predicted to adopt a structure resembling WXG100 proteins, thus leading to speculation that these proteins are Esx secretion system substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). Despite the association between LXG proteins and the Esx secretion system, to-date there are no experimental data linking them functionally. However, an intriguing study performed by Hayes and colleagues demonstrated antibacterial properties of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> LXG RNase toxins via heterologous expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Holberger et al., 2012</xref>). This growth inhibition was alleviated by co-expression of immunity determinants encoded adjacent to cognate LXG genes. We show here that LXG proteins transit the Esx secretion system of <italic>Streptococcus intermedius</italic> (<italic>Si</italic>) and function as antibacterial toxins that mediate contact-dependent interspecies antagonism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LXG proteins are Esx secretion system substrates</title><p>We initiated our investigation into the function of LXG proteins by characterizing the diversity and distribution of genes encoding these proteins across all sequenced genomes from Firmicutes. As noted previously, the C-terminal domains in the LXG family members we identified are highly divergent, exhibiting a wide range of predicted activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). LXG protein-encoding genes are prevalent and broadly distributed in the classes Clostridiales, Bacillales and Lactobacillales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Notably, a significant proportion of organisms in these taxa are specifically adapted to the mammalian gut environment. Indeed, we find that LXG genes derived from reference genomes of many of these gut-adapted bacteria are abundant in metagenomic datasets from human gut microbiome samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). An LXG toxin that is predicted to possess ADP-ribosyltransferase activity – previously linked to interbacterial antagonism in Gram-negative organisms – was particularly abundant in a subset of human gut metagenomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Close homologs of this gene are found in <italic>Ruminococcus</italic>, a dominant taxa in the human gut microbiome, potentially explaining the frequency of this gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2011</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26938.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The LXG protein family contains diverse toxins that are broadly distributed in Firmicutes and found in the human gut microbiome.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dendogram depicts LXG-containing genera within Firmicutes, clustered by class and order.

By co-expressing candidate open reading frames located downstream of each <italic>tel</italic> gene, we identified a cognate <italic>tip</italic> (<underline>t</underline>el <underline>i</underline>mmunity <underline>p</underline>rotein) for each toxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then sought to inactivate each of these factors to generate <italic>Si</italic><sup>B196</sup> strains sensitive to each of the Tel proteins. In <italic>Si</italic><sup>B196</sup>, <italic>telA tipA</italic> loci are located immediately upstream of conserved <italic>esx</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We were unable to generate non-polar <italic>telA tipA</italic>-inactivated strains, and thus focused our efforts on the other two <italic>tel tip</italic> loci.</p><p>We reasoned that if LXG toxins target non-self cells, this process would occur either through diffusion or by facilitated transfer, the latter of which would likely require cell contact. Since we detect TelA-C secretion in liquid medium, we began our attempts to observe intercellular intoxication with wild-type and toxin-sensitive target cell co-culture. These efforts yielded no evidence of target cell killing or growth inhibition, including when co-incubations were performed at cell densities higher than that achievable through growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The application of concentrated supernatants or purified TelC (to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL) to sensitive strains also did not produce evidence of toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>). This result is perhaps not surprising given the barrier presented by the Gram-positive cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Forster and Marquis, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Next, we tested conditions that enforce cell contact. In each of these experiments, donor and recipient strains were grown in pure culture before they were mixed at defined ratios and cultured on a solid surface for 30 hr to promote cell-cell interactions. We observed significant growth inhibition of TelB- or TelC-susceptible strains co-cultured with wild-type, but not when co-cultured with strains lacking <italic>telB</italic> or <italic>telC</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). A strain bearing inactivated <italic>essC</italic> was also unable to intoxicate a sensitive recipient. In competition experiments performed in parallel wherein the bacterial mixtures were grown in liquid culture, TelB and TelC-susceptible strains competed equally with wild type, suggesting that Esx-mediated intoxication requires prolonged cell contact. To further probe this requirement, we conducted related experiments in which wild-type donor cells were segregated from sensitive recipients by a semi-permeable (0.2 μm pore size) membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This physical separation blocked intoxication, which taken together with the results of our liquid co-culture experiments and our finding that purified TelC is not bactericidal, strongly suggests that the mechanism of Esx-dependent intercellular LXG protein delivery requires immediate cell-cell contact.</p><p>In Gram-negative bacteria, some antagonistic cell contact-dependent pathways display narrow target range, whereas others act between species, or even between phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hayes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Russell et al., 2014a</xref>). To begin to determine the target range of Esx-based LXG protein delivery, we measured its contribution to <italic>Si</italic><sup>B196</sup> fitness in interbacterial competition experiments with a panel of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria.

Given this precedence, we considered the possibility that the antibacterial activity we observed may not be relevant physiologically. TelB degrades NAD<sup>+</sup>, a molecule essential for all cellular life, and therefore this toxin is not definitive in this regard. We next turned our attention to TelC, which elicits toxicity from outside of the bacterial cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This protein contains a conserved aspartate-rich motif that we hypothesized constitutes its enzymatic active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To gain further insight into TelC function, we determined the crystal structure of TelC<sub>tox</sub> to 2.0 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The structure of TelC<sub>tox</sub> represents a new fold; it is comprised of distinct and largely α-helical N- and C-terminal lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The single β element of TelC<sub>tox</sub> is a hairpin that protrudes from the N-terminal lobe. Although TelC<sub>tox</sub> does not share significant similarity to previously determined structures, we located its putative active site within a shallow groove that separates the N- and C-terminal lobes. This region contains a calcium ion bound to several residues that comprise the conserved aspartate-rich motif.

Likely due to its distinctive and conserved structure, lipid II is the target of diverse antibacterial molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Breukink and de Kruijff, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oppedijk et al., 2016</xref>). To test activity against lipid II, we incubated the molecule with purified TelC<sub>tox</sub>. Analysis of the reaction products showed that TelC<sub>tox</sub> cleaves lipid II – severing the molecule at the phosphoester linkage to undecaprenyl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Reaction products were confirmed by mass spectrometry and inclusion of TipC inhibited their formation. Consumption of lipid II for peptidoglycan assembly generates undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (UPP), which is converted to undecaprenyl phosphate (UP), and transported inside the cell. The UP molecule then reenters peptidoglycan biosynthesis or is utilized as a carrier for another essential cell wall constituent, wall teichoic acid (WTA). Our experiments showed that TelC<sub>tox</sub> is capable of hydrolyzing cleaved undecaprenyl derivatives but displays a strict requirement for the pyrophosphate group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), indicating the potential for TelC to simultaneously disrupt two critical Gram-positive cell wall polymers. Consistent with its ability to inhibit a conserved step in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, TelC exhibited toxicity towards diverse Gram-positive species including <italic>Si</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>)<italic>, S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). These data do not explain our observation that cytoplasmic TelC is non-toxic, as the substrates we defined are present in this compartment. The substrates may be inaccessible or TelC could be inactive in the cytoplasm. It is worth noting that TelC contains a calcium ion bound at the interface of its N- and C-terminal lobes. Many secreted proteins that bind calcium utilize the abundance of the free ion in the milieu to catalyze folding. Taken together, our biochemical and phenotypic data strongly suggest that TelC is a toxin directed specifically against bacteria. While we cannot rule out that TelC may have other targets, we find that its expression in the cytoplasm or secretory pathway of yeast does not impact the viability of this model eukaryotic cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C–D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>WXG100-like proteins bind cognate LXG proteins and promote toxin export</title><p>The majority of Esx substrates identified to-date belong to the WXG100 protein family.

Our results suggest that like the T6S pathway of Gram-negative bacteria, the Esx system may mediate antagonism against diverse targets, ranging from related strains to species belonging to other genera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schwarz et al., 2010</xref>). This feature of Esx secretion, in conjunction with the frequency by which we detect LXG genes in human gut metagenomes, suggests that the system could have significant ramifications for the composition of human-associated polymicrobial communities. Bacteria harboring LXG toxin genes are also components or pathogenic invaders of polymicrobial communities important in agriculture and food processing. For instance, LXG toxins may assist <italic>Listeria</italic> in colonizing fermented food communities dominated by <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Lactococcus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Farber and Peterkin, 1991</xref>). Of note, the latter genera also possess LXG toxins, which may augment their known antimicrobial properties. Our findings thus provide insights into the forces influencing the formation of diverse communities relevant to human health and industry.</p><p>Palmer and colleagues recently reported that the Esx system of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> exports EssD, a nuclease capable of inhibiting the growth of target bacteria in co-culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao et al., 2016</xref>). The relationship between these findings and those we report herein is currently unclear. <italic>S. aureus</italic> EssD does not possess an LXG domain and was reported to be active against susceptible bacteria during co-incubation in liquid media, a condition we found not conducive to LXG toxin delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). It is evident that the Esx pathway is functionally pliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burts et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conrad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gray et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gröschel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Manzanillo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Siegrist et al., 2009</xref>); therefore, it is conceivable that it targets toxins to bacteria through multiple mechanisms. The capacity of EssD to act against bacteria in liquid media could be the result of its over-expression from a plasmid, although we found that the exogenous administration of quantities of TelC far exceeding those likely achievable physiologically had no impact on sensitive recipient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). A later study of EssD function found no evidence of interbacterial targeting and instead reported that its nuclease activity affects IL-12 accumulation in infected mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ohr et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our data suggest that, like a subset of substrates of the Esx systems of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, LXG family members require hetero-dimerization with specific WXG100-like partners to be secreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ates et al., 2016</xref>). Hetero-dimerization is thought to facilitate secretion of these substrates due to the requirement for a bipartite secretion signal consisting of a YxxxD/E motif in the C-terminus of one partner in proximity to the WXG motif present in the turn between helices in the second protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Champion et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Daleke et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Poulsen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sysoeva et al., 2014</xref>). While the canonical secretion signals found in other Esx substrates appear to be lacking in the LXG proteins and their interaction partners, structure prediction algorithms suggest they adopt similar helical hairpin structures, which could facilitate formation of an alternative form of the bipartite signal. Unlike previously characterized Esx substrates, we found that the LXG proteins are not co-dependent for secretion, and we failed to detect secretion of their WXG100-like interaction partners. This suggests that WxgA-C could function analogously to the EspG proteins of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, which serve as intracellular chaperones facilitating delivery of specific substrates to the secretion machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Daleke et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ekiert and Cox, 2014</xref>). Alternatively, Wxg–Lxg complexes could be secreted as heterodimers, but for technical reasons the Wxg member was undetected in our experiments. The paradigm of Lxg-Wxg interaction likely extends beyond <italic>S. intermedius</italic>, as we observe that LXG proteins from other species are commonly encoded within the same operon as Wxg homologs.</p><p>Our study leaves open the question of how Esx-exported LXG proteins reach their targets. In the case of TelC, the target resides on the extracellular face of the plasma membrane, and in the case of TelA and TelB, they are cytoplasmic. Crossing the thick Gram-positive cell wall is the first hurdle that must be overcome to deliver of each of these toxins. The size of LXG toxins exceeds that of molecules capable of free diffusion across the peptidoglycan sacculus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Forster and Marquis, 2012</xref>). Donor cell-derived cell wall hydrolytic enzymes may facilitate entry or the LXG proteins could exploit cell surface proteins present on recipient cells. Whether the entry of LXG toxins is directly coordinated by the Esx pathway is not known; our experiments do not rule-out that the requirement for donor-recipient cell contact reflects a step subsequent to secretion by the Esx pathway. Once beyond the sacculus, TelA and TelB must translocate across the plasma membrane. Our study has identified roles for the N- and C-terminal domains of LXG proteins; however, the function of the region between these two domains remains undefined and may participate in entry. Intriguingly, the central domains of TelA and TelB are each over 150 residues, whereas the LXG and toxin domains of TelC, which does not require access to the cytoplasm, appear to directly fuse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Based on the entry mechanisms employed by other interbacterial toxins, this central domain – or another part of the protein – could facilitate direct translocation, proteolytic release of the toxin domain, interaction with a recipient membrane protein, or a combination of these activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kleanthous, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Willett et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We discovered that TelC, a protein lacking characterized homologs, adopts a previously unobserved fold and catalyzes degradation of the cell wall precursor molecule lipid II. This molecule is the target of the food preservative nisin, as well as the last-line antibiotic vancomycin, which is used to treat a variety of Gram-positive infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ng and Chan, 2016</xref>). Lipid II is also the target of the recently discovered antibiotic teixobactin, synthesized by the soil bacterium <italic>Eleftheria terrae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ling et al., 2015</xref>). A particularly interesting property of this potential therapeutic is the low rate at which resistance is evolved. The apparent challenge of structurally modifying lipid II in order to subvert antimicrobials may explain why interbacterial toxins targeting this molecule have evolved independently in Gram-negative (colicin M) and -positive (TelC) bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">El Ghachi et al., 2006</xref>). We anticipate that biochemical characterization of additional LXG toxins of unknown function will reveal further Gram-positive cell vulnerabilities that could likewise be exploited in the design of new antibiotics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p><italic>S. intermedius</italic> strains used in this study were derived from the sequenced strains ATCC 27335 and B196 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). <italic>S. intermedius</italic> strains were grown at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in Todd Hewitt broth (THYB) or agar (THYA) supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Jeffery S Cox (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, the authors investigate the LXG protein family to test the overarching hypothesis that LXG proteins are toxins used for inter-species bacterial antagonism. Specifically, they focus on two LXG proteins produced by <italic>Streptococcus intermedius</italic> (TelB and TelC). They show that TelB and TelC are independently secreted by the Esx pathway in <italic>S. intermedius</italic>. The authors claim that TelB has NADase activity, and demonstrate that TelC is a calcium phosphatase acting on the bacterial peptidoglycan precursor Lipid II. Their data show that Esx-mediated secretion of TelC and TelB is likely contact-dependent, and that TelB mediates inter-species bacterial antagonism. The authors also present intriguing but preliminary data that WXG100-like proteins interact with their cognate LXG domain proteins, and that WXG100-like proteins promote LXG toxin secretion. Although the reviewers were enthusiastic about some aspects of the work, a number of shortcomings were identified that would need to be addressed if the authors wish to resubmit.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although the paper was submitted as a 'Short Report', this length restriction led to some results being poorly explained or, in some cases like the WXG-100 data, almost neglected. There was also an extremely limited introduction, which is not ideal for a broad interest journal like <italic>eLife</italic>. The authors should flesh out the Introduction, Results, and Discussion to make the paper more accessible to a wider range of readers.</p><p>2) There was some confusion about a fundamental aspect of this system: On the one hand, the authors have argued that LXG proteins can only inhibit via a contact-dependent mechanism, but the proteins are easily detected in the supernatant suggesting they're constitutively secreted. This seems wasteful – why would a contact-dependent inhibition system spew toxin into the environment when it can only be active via direct delivery? Maybe more importantly, can the authors rule out the possibility that toxins are secreted and can kill in a contact-independent way, but are somehow getting stuck on the membranes used for the filter-well experiments? On a related note, the authors claim at one point that &quot;The discovery that LXG toxin family members are delivered between bacteria…&quot; But there's no direct evidence that TelC is transferred to recipient cells. The co-culturing experiments are consistent with such a model, but not definitive. For instance, are the fitness effects observed in co-culture on solid media really due to &quot;intoxication&quot; of the recipient strain? Is it possible to over-express the antitoxins in the recipient cell, in the experiments presented in both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and G</xref>? Likewise, it would be nice to show specificity of the two systems (TelB/TipB and TelC/TipC) by performing competitive experiments with all combinations of mutants. In short, stronger, more direct evidence is needed that the LXG toxins are transferred from donors to recipients.</p><p>3) It would appear that <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref> only shows what happens when ToxCtox is expressed by cells, i.e. self-intoxication after overexpression. But ToxC is normally is secreted into the extracellular medium. So the authors need to show that it can be toxic 'in trans', presumably by co-culturing cells on a solid surface given that co-culturing in liquid doesn't work. This is important to concluding that, if/when transferred as a full-length protein (not just the tox domain used in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>), ToxC targets lipid II.</p><p>4) The authors tested to see if production of the toxin TelC, which cleaves lipid II, is toxic in yeast cells. They were curious about this because these eukaryotes produce essential polyisoprenoid-linked glycoconjugates that are required for N-glycosylation. The authors do not see any toxicity. It is possible that TelC is not toxic because it cannot hydrolyze those essential lipid-linked saccharides. However, there are a lot of trivial reasons that could explain the lack of toxicity. For example, most of the protein might not be properly targeted since most of it still has a signal sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). A better test to determine substrate specificity would be to determine if TelC can cleave other bacterial undecaprenyl-linked saccharides. Although ideal, such work is not necessary and if not done, the authors should remove the text and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> panels G and H corresponding to the aforementioned test.</p><p>5) The somewhat grander claims regarding the implied role these LXG proteins play in polymicrobial communities is perhaps a bit over-speculative. In general, it seem that there is a disconnect between the data the authors present and their emphasis in the Abstract (and throughout the manuscript) on human gut metagenomes and polymicrobial dynamics. Throughout the manuscript, the authors emphasize the abundance/prevalence of LXG proteins in human microbiomes, but those data are neither very convincing nor novel. Thus, the authors have overstated the implications of the inter-species antagonism mediated by Esx secretion, as they do not present data illustrating the functional outcome of these interactions in an actual polymicrobial community.</p><p>6) The authors conclude that LXG toxins are specific to Gram + inter-species antagonism, but have only tested a single Gram negative species (<italic>E. coli</italic>). Testing a broader range of Gram negatives would be an easy way to bolster this claim.</p><p>7) The notion that TelB is a NAD+ degrading toxin is less than compelling. Two important controls are missing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> – mutation of the conserved residues that comprise the active site as predicted in Figure 2—figure supplement 2, and rescue of the toxic effect by co-expressing TipB. Complementation of the Si telB mutant using wild-type and mutant forms of TelB would also be important in this regard as well. Finally, the assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> is somewhat unconvincing. An in vitro NADase activity assay with purified TelB would be much more convincing and quantitative.</p><p>8) Given that the main emphasis in the paper is on TelC, it is disappointing that the authors do not demonstrate inter-species antagonism dependent on TelC. Perhaps we missed something, but it appears that the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref> are all experiments done with S.i. strains. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, they show that a strain WT for TelB elicits the crucial inter-species antagonism, but it is not clear whether this strain is also making TelC?</p><p>9) The idea that all three LXG proteins are secreted from Si via Esx secretion is not well supported. Table 1 is confusing – the &quot;locus tag&quot; is not intuitive, making it difficult to understand which proteins are represented in the MS results. Importantly, it is critical to show that secreted proteins that are not associated with Esx are present in similar levels in wild-type and essC mutant supernatants.</p><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is compelling but underdeveloped. The exclusive use of bacterial two-hybrid seems insufficient to show convincingly that the LSG and WXG proteins interact specifically, and thus any conclusions at this point seems speculative.</p><p>11) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, why does the CI decrease to well below 1 when the filter is present?</p><p>12) Roughly how much TelC is secreted in an exponential or overnight culture? It is not clear how to interpret Figure 2—figure supplement 3 where bacteria are incubated with purified &quot;active toxin&quot; without an estimate of the amount of toxin produced endogenously. Also, the authors don't show data to indicate that their purified recombinant TelC protein is active.</p><p>13) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, the authors highlight another Streptococcus species (parasanguinus) that has an LXG protein which they annotate as a Lipid II phosphatase. That raises the question of how novel their finding about TelC in Si is? This deserves clarification.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A broadly distributed toxin family mediates contact-dependent antagonism between gram-positive bacteria&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

I appreciate the authors' detailed responses to the reviews and their efforts to address the issues. Overall, I think they addressed the main concerns satisfactorily. I would only like to request a few modifications to the text.</p><p>The main comment I have is about the cellular target of TelC. The authors show that TelC: a) needs to be exported to be toxic in both <italic>E. coli</italic> and Staph, and b) degrades both lipid II and undecaprenyl-PP (C55-PP) in vitro. They conclude that, in cells, TelC targets lipid II that is located in the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane. This could lead readers to mistakenly think that lipid II is only present at that location and that C55-PP is not. In reality, C55-PP is also present in the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane, and both lipid II and C55-PP are present in both leaflets of the cytoplasmic membrane. Therefore, I suggest that the authors state that their in vivo data cannot distinguish whether TelC targets lipid II and/or undecaprenyl-PP (C55-PP) and that it is unknown why toxicity is limited to an extracytoplasmic location given that these essential peptidoglycan intermediates transit through both leaflets of the cytoplasmic membrane. [A simple explanation for their data could be that the intermediate(s) is not accessible in the cytoplasmic side of the membrane because proteins that normally handle it during peptidoglycan synthesis protect it from TelC or the intermediate has a very short residence time at that location].</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26938.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Although the paper was submitted as a 'Short Report', this length restriction led to some results being poorly explained or, in some cases like the WXG-100 data, almost neglected.

This seems wasteful – why would a contact-dependent inhibition system spew toxin into the environment when it can only be active via direct delivery? Maybe more importantly, can the authors rule out the possibility that toxins are secreted and can kill in a contact-independent way, but are somehow getting stuck on the membranes used for the filter-well experiments? On a related note, the authors claim at one point that &quot;The discovery that LXG toxin family members are delivered between bacteria…&quot; But there's no direct evidence that TelC is transferred to recipient cells. The co-culturing experiments are consistent with such a model, but not definitive. For instance, are the fitness effects observed in co-culture on solid media really due to &quot;intoxication&quot; of the recipient strain? Is it possible to over-express the antitoxins in the recipient cell, in the experiments presented in both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and G</xref>? Likewise, it would be nice to show specificity of the two systems (TelB/TipB and TelC/TipC) by performing competitive experiments with all combinations of mutants. In short, stronger, more direct evidence is needed that the LXG toxins are transferred from donors to recipients.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers pose an interesting question, but one that is difficulty to answer. Prior to speculating why a bacterium would secrete toxins that require cell-cell contact for delivery into the milieu during propagation in vivo, it is worth clarifying a few points. First, by spectral counts deriving from mass spectrometry data (Table 1), the abundance of the LXG proteins is below the average for other proteins we detect in culture supernatants (TelA-C, μ=12.3; All others, μ=26.50). Whereas proteins that are abundantly secreted by bacteria can be detected in unconcentrated culture supernatants using SDS-PAGE followed by coomassie stain (e.g. see Jacob-Dubuisson et al., Microbiol. 2000), we detect TelC by Western blot only after TCA precipitation of culture supernatants (e.g. see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Second, it is worth noting that the detection of LXG proteins in the supernatant may not be an indication that they are constitutively secreted. The production and/or export of the protein may still be elevated or repressed considerably depending on conditions.</p><p>Though counterintuitive, there exists overwhelming precedent for cell contact-dependent secretion systems that release their substrates to detectable levels in the absence of recipient cells. This has been documented for (note – not an exhaustive list): type III secretion (Nikolaus et al., J. Bacteriol. 2001/Rietsch et al., PNAS, 2005/Anderson and Schneewind, Mol. Microbiol.,1999) type IV secretion (Souza et al., Nat. Commun. 2015) type VI secretion (English et al., Mol. Microbiol. 2012/Eshraghi et al., 2016/Schwarz et al. Infect. Immun. 2014)</p><p>Indeed, our own group has used this property of the type VI secretion systems of <italic>Francisella novicida</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia thailandensis</italic> to define the effector proteins released by these systems (Eshraghi et al., Cell Host Microbe. 2016/Schwarz et al. Infect. Immun. 2014). In some cases, a specific cue (e.g. calcium removal, potassium addition) is required for activation of the system. Since we do not know if such a cue affects the Esx pathway of <italic>S. intermedius</italic>, we cannot determine if we have fortuitously overridden strict negative regulation by inadvertently providing an activation cue in the in vitro growth conditions we utilize.</p><p>Despite the considerations mentioned above, we have contemplated evolutionary mechanisms that could provide an explanation for apparent constitutive export of proteins that are dependent on cell contact for efficacy. We speculate that bacteria that routinely face contacting competitor cells may evolve to relieve repression of cell contact-mediated toxin delivery systems. There is evidence for this in the type VI secretion systems of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Vibrio cholera.</italic> Although many strains of these organisms display strongly repressed type VI secretion systems when grown in vitro, other isolates possess highly active systems under the same conditions (<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> clinical isolates studied in Mougous et al., Nat. Cell Biol. and the V52 strain of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> identified in Pukatzki et al.,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2006). This may be the case for the <italic>S. intermedius</italic> strain we employ in the current study. Anecdotally, we can share that prior to working with <italic>S. intermedius</italic>, we failed to observe Esx-dependent LXG protein export in several organisms. We suspect that many of the challenges we encountered are a result of secretion system inactivity under the conditions we utilized.</p><p>Respectfully, we believe that within reason we have ruled out the possibility that secreted TelC kills in the absence of a functional Esx system and cell contact. In addition to the membrane experiment referred to by the reviewer, our original submission included the demonstration that purified, full-length TelC, added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL has no impact on the growth of TelC-susceptible cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We also showed that highly concentrated TelB and TelC donor cells (OD<sub>600nm</sub> = 20) are unable to inhibit the growth of susceptible recipient cells in liquid media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Finally, as noted, we showed that a 0.2 μm pore diameter membrane separating donor and sensitive recipient cells abrogates the Esx-dependent growth advantage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>We cannot rule out that LXG proteins are adhering to the 0.2 μm pore diameter membrane during our competition experiments. However, these are low protein binding track-etched polycarbonate membranes and we would expect that the minimal protein binding capacity they possess would be rapidly saturated by virtue of being coated with cells, rich media, and a variety of extracellular proteins. Nevertheless, to address this potential confounding factor, we experimentally measured the propensity of TelC to adsorb to the membranes used in our contact-dependency studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref>). In summary, we failed to detect TelC adsorption to these membranes.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26938.022</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>TelC does not irreversibly associate with polycarbonate membranes to a detectable level.</title><p>The indicated quantity of TelC (Before) was incubated with 16 cm<sup>2</sup> of filter material in PBS.

However, we believe that no other reasonably plausible mechanism is consistent with the totality of our data and we now strengthen this further with new data described in the subsequent paragraph. We show conclusively that two LXG proteins are toxins exported via the Esx secretion system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and that the export of these proteins is required for their capacity to inhibit the proliferation of recipient cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We also show that this growth inhibitory activity of the toxins occurs only in strain populations rendered susceptible to the toxins by the removal of genes that encode proteins that bind to (in the case of TelC–TipC this is demonstrated in our paper in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and inhibit the toxin-associated biochemical activities (both TelC–TipC and TelB–TipB are demonstrated in this study, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>).</p><p>To add to the data in our original manuscript, we now provide evidence of toxin-mediated cell lysis occurring in co-cultures between wild-type <italic>Si</italic> and a mutant rendered susceptible to TelC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 2</xref>,described in detail in Reviewer Response to Essential Revision 3). We have additionally ruled out the possibility that secondary site mutations cause general growth defects in the <italic>telB tipB</italic> and <italic>telC tipC</italic> mutant strains by performing whole genome sequencing (new whole genome sequencing data described in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and by demonstrating these strains compete equally with the wild-type parent in liquid culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Additionally, we find that the difference in competitive index between a wild-type strain and an <italic>essC</italic>-inactivated strain towards a susceptible recipient species can be attributed entirely to changes in the final growth yield of the recipient, consistent with growth inhibition mediated by toxin delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 3</xref>). Finally, it is worth noting that there is precedent for similar experiments as those we present here being used to first demonstrate contact-dependent intercellular toxin delivery by a specialized secretion systems (Souza et al., Nat. Comm. 2015 / Hood et al., Cell Host Microbe 2010 / Aoki et al.

But ToxC is normally is secreted into the extracellular medium. So the authors need to show that it can be toxic 'in trans', presumably by co-culturing cells on a solid surface given that co-culturing in liquid doesn't work. This is important to concluding that, if/when transferred as a full-length protein (not just the tox domain used in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>), ToxC targets lipid II.</italic> </p><p>We assume that here and elsewhere, the reviewer is referring to TelC, as we did not study a protein designated ToxC. That aside, we believe there may be some confusion here, perhaps related to our oversight in not including legends for these videos. The bacteria in the video are <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and so we are not reporting native self-intoxication, but instead these cells are simply convenient Gram-positive heterologous hosts for observing potential phenotypic consequences of TelC<sub>tox</sub> over-expression. <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref> is presented to illustrate that the toxin domain of TelC can promote cellular lysis when over-expressed and artificially targeted to the exterior of the cell. This observation, in conjunction with our finding that the overall structure of the peptidoglycan sacculus remains largely intact, is how we came upon the hypothesis that TelC acts upstream in cell wall synthesis to degrade lipid II. In the revised manuscript, we provide biochemical evidence that full length TelC is active on lipid II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Nonetheless, we have now also obtained evidence that TelC-dependent cell lysis occurs during co-culture between <italic>Si</italic> bearing a streptomycin resistant cassette inserted at a neutral chromosomal location, and a mutant rendered susceptible to TelC through insertion of a kanamycin cassette in place of the <italic>telC tipC</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 2</xref>). We find that after 30 hours of co-culture of these strains, a significant proportion of the resulting population acquires resistance to both antibiotics. The frequency of double-resistant colonies obtained from co-cultures in which the streptomycin-resistant strain contained inactivated <italic>telC</italic> is significantly lower. It is well established in Streptococcus that cell lysis provides DNA for uptake by natural transformation. Thus, the accumulation of cells containing both markers is a useful proxy for cell lysis. These results provide further evidence that TelC is a bacteriolytic toxin.</p><p><italic>4) The authors tested to see if production of the toxin TelC, which cleaves lipid II, is toxic in yeast cells. They were curious about this because these eukaryotes produce essential polyisoprenoid-linked glycoconjugates that are required for N-glycosylation. The authors do not see any toxicity. It is possible that TelC is not toxic because it cannot hydrolyze those essential lipid-linked saccharides. However, there are a lot of trivial reasons that could explain the lack of toxicity. For example, most of the protein might not be properly targeted since most of it still has a signal sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). A better test to determine substrate specificity would be to determine if TelC can cleave other bacterial undecaprenyl-linked saccharides. Although ideal, such work is not necessary and if not done, the authors should remove the text and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> panels G and H corresponding to the aforementioned test.</italic> </p><p>We agree that there are trivial reasons for the apparent inability of TelC to inhibit yeast growth. However, we do believe that these negative data have value, as they show that contrary to the situation with bacteria, TelC is not toxic to a eukaryotic cell when expressed from a strong promoter. We show the toxin is produced to detectable levels in the cytoplasm and we provide evidence that our construct directing it to the secretory pathway is performing as expected. If this were a bona fide eukaryotic toxin, we would anticipate that levels detected by direct Western blot of lysed cells (immunoprecipitation not required) would likely be sufficient to induce detectable killing or growth inhibition, which we do not observe. This is an experiment that we feel others in the community would want to see – caveats notwithstanding – given that we are proposing TelC targets bacteria physiologically. We do appreciate the point raised by the reviewer, and so to meet in the middle on this matter, we have moved the yeast data to the supplement and we have simplified our interpretation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). We now avoid the dolichol discussion entirely and use the data simply to demonstrate a negative result consistent with our model.</p><p><italic>5) The somewhat grander claims regarding the implied role these LXG proteins play in polymicrobial communities is perhaps a bit over-speculative. In general, it seem that there is a disconnect between the data the authors present and their emphasis in the Abstract (and throughout the manuscript) on human gut metagenomes and polymicrobial dynamics. Throughout the manuscript, the authors emphasize the abundance/prevalence of LXG proteins in human microbiomes, but those data are neither very convincing nor novel. Thus, the authors have overstated the implications of the inter-species antagonism mediated by Esx secretion, as they do not present data illustrating the functional outcome of these interactions in an actual polymicrobial community.</italic> </p><p>At the suggestion of the reviewers, we have toned down and limited references in the main body of the revised manuscript to the potential role of LXG toxins in human-associated polymicrobial communities. We have also edited the Abstract with the intent to minimize this potential implication of the prevalence of LXG toxins amongst human gut microbiome samples.</p><p>We feel that we must respectfully voice our disagreement with the reviewer comment pertaining to our metagenomic analyses that “those data are neither very convincing nor novel.” To our knowledge, LXG toxins have not previously been identified in the human gut microbiome (or another polymicrobial community) and we employed rigorous, accepted methods of showing that they are present in said communities in our study.</p><p><italic>6) The authors conclude that LXG toxins are specific to Gram + inter-species antagonism, but have only tested a single Gram negative species (E. coli). Testing a broader range of Gram negatives would be an easy way to bolster this claim.</italic> </p><p>First, to clarify, we respectfully wish to correct the record by pointing out that we did not “conclude that LXG toxins are specific to Gram + inter-species antagonism.” The single statement we made addressing these data in our original submission, stated “These results demonstrate that the Esx pathway can act between species and suggest that its target range may be limited to Gram-positive bacteria.” We specifically chose the words “suggest” and “may” in this statement because we agree that stronger terms are difficult (or even impossible) to support.</p><p>At the suggestion of the reviewers, the revised manuscript now includes the results of experiments testing the capacity of the Esx secretion pathway to target additional Gram-negative bacteria. We report that under conditions similar to those used in the corresponding Gram-positive target cell experiments, the Esx system of <italic>S. intermedius</italic> did not detectably alter the outcome of co-cultivations with <italic>P. aeruginosa, B. thailandensis</italic> and <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic> (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> and <italic>B. fragilis</italic>, a β-proteobacterium and a member of the phylum Bacteroidetes, respectively, significantly extend the phylogenetic range of Gram-negative organisms tested. While we now report more Gram-negative bacteria tested, we recognize that this does not bring us significantly closer to reaching the conclusion that Gram-negative bacteria are not or cannot be targeted by the Esx pathway. We thus have not modified our statement that “These results demonstrate that the Esx pathway can act between species and suggest that its target range may be limited to Gram-positive bacteria”.</p><p><italic>7) The notion that TelB is a NAD+ degrading toxin is less than compelling. Two important controls are missing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> – mutation of the conserved residues that comprise the active site as predicted in Figure 2—figure supplement 2, and rescue of the toxic effect by co-expressing TipB. Complementation of the Si telB mutant using wild-type and mutant forms of TelB would also be important in this regard as well. Finally, the assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> is somewhat unconvincing. An</italic> in vitro <italic>NADase activity assay with purified TelB would be much more convincing and quantitative.</italic> </p><p>In our original manuscript, we used two independent biochemical methods to demonstrate that TelB is an NAD<sup>+</sup>-degrading toxin. The first makes use of the fact that if NAD<sup>+</sup> is not consumed by such a toxin, a product of its hydrolysis by base is fluorescent (Johnson et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1970). This assay showed that wild-type <italic>S. intermedius</italic> B196 possesses supernatant NAD<sup>+</sup>-degrading activity that is entirely dependent on TelB and EssC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We also showed that another strain of <italic>S. intermedius</italic> that does not encode a TelB ortholog does not possess this activity in its supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The second biochemical assay we presented makes use of a very well established, specific, and sensitive cell-based assay for measuring NAD<sup>+</sup> pools that is commercially available. We used this assay to show that induction of TelB and an established NADase, Tse6, lead to a dramatic drop in cellular [NAD+], whereas induction of an interbacterial toxin that does not possess this activity, Tse2, does not reduce cellular NAD<sup>+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In addition to these specific biochemical assays, we stated that “One such toxin domain shares homology and predicted catalytic residues with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> TNT, an NAD+-degrading enzyme” and presented a molecular model of TelB based on the TNT structure that showed conserved catalytic residues. Indeed, we noted in the methods section of the original submission that, due to its potent toxicity, we were unable to clone TelB<sub>tox</sub>, and “to circumvent this, SOE PCR was used to assemble a variant (H661A) that was tolerated under non-induced conditions. Based on the similarity of TelB<sub>tox</sub> to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> TNT toxin, this mutation likely reduces the binding affinity of TelB to NAD<sup>+</sup> (Sun et al., 2015).”</p><p>For technical reasons relating to its stability, we are unable to purify TelB. These enzymes are well characterized and we do not believe that a detailed quantification of its activity is necessary to support the conclusions of this manuscript. However, at the request of the reviewer, we now include data demonstrating that the NAD<sup>+</sup>-degrading activity of TelB is abrogated by point mutations in the active site of the enzyme and by co-expression with TipB (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p><italic>8) Given that the main emphasis in the paper is on TelC, it is disappointing that the authors do not demonstrate inter-species antagonism dependent on TelC. Perhaps we missed something, but it appears that the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref> are all experiments done with S.i. strains.

There additionally may have been some confusion regarding the footnote that defined the values we provided for each entry in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.

The exclusive use of bacterial two-hybrid seems insufficient to show convincingly that the LSG and WXG proteins interact specifically, and thus any conclusions at this point seems speculative.</italic> </p><p>We are unsure if there was disagreement amongst the reviewers as to whether the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> of our original submission was compelling or underdeveloped. Nevertheless, we agree that the exclusive use of the bacterial two-hybrid to demonstrate an interaction would be problematic and for this reason we included in vivo functional data in the original submission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>) that supports the interaction between LXG proteins and cognate WXG-like proteins. In short, we showed that a deletion of <italic>wxgC</italic> abrogates TelC secretion while leaving TelB secretion intact. To further support this, we added to the revised manuscript an experiment demonstrating that in a heterologous host, TelC immunoprecipitates WxgC and not WxgB – additional evidence of their direct interaction (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In summary, we now provide genetic, biochemical, and in vivo functional data supporting the specific interaction of Lxg proteins with cognate Wxg proteins.</p><p><italic>11) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, why does the CI decrease to well below 1 when the filter is present?</italic> </p><p>This is an excellent question that we have clarified in the revised manuscript (see revised legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In the experiments represented, recipient cell populations were placed below the filter, whereas the donor cells were above the filter. As the cells proliferate, those below the filter have an Esx-independent growth advantage by virtue of their immediate proximity to the growth substrate. It is worth noting that we conducted this experiment in both configurations and in neither case were non-contacting cells inhibited in an Esx-dependent manner.</p><p><italic>12) Roughly how much TelC is secreted in an exponential or overnight culture? It is not clear how to interpret Figure 2—figure supplement 3 where bacteria are incubated with purified &quot;active toxin&quot; without an estimate of the amount of toxin produced endogenously. Also, the authors don't show data to indicate that their purified recombinant TelC protein is active.</italic> </p><p>As we noted above, TelC (and the other Tel proteins) are of lower than average abundance (as determined by spectral counts) among the 35 proteins identified in our secreted proteome analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We are not aware of absolute measurements of secreted protein concentration during bacterial culture, but we estimate based on our own experience studying secreted proteins that those we can detect are present at 5-100 ng/mL. We choose a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL of TelC in order to ensure that the protein was present at levels exceeding those obtainable physiologically. To probe this directly and address the question raised, we present here a comparison of the relative levels of endogenous TelC to the levels of purified TelC we added exogenously to <italic>S. intermedius</italic> cells. As expected, endogenous TelC is below the detection limit of this assay, whereas 0.1 mg/mL purified TelC is readily detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 4</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26938.025</object-id><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>TelC levels in cell free supernatants (CFS) of S. intermedius do not approach 0.1 mg/mL.</title><p>SDS-PAGE analysis of the supernatant fraction of <italic>S. intermedius</italic> cells in mid-log or stationary growth.

Though it is not specified here, the reviewers may be referring to the fact that our initial biochemical assays were performed with the toxin domain of TelC (TelC<sub>tox</sub>), in contrast to the full-length protein used in our cellular inhibition assays. We use full-length TelC in lieu of TelC<sub>tox</sub> for growth inhibition assays to allow potential cell entry mechanisms that could utilize the N-terminal domains of the protein. At the suggestion of the reviewers, we have performed biochemical assays with purified full-length TelC. New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref> shows that like the toxin domain alone, the full-length protein possesses the capacity to degrade lipid II.</p><p><italic>13) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, the authors highlight another Streptococcus species (parasanguinus) that has an LXG protein which they annotate as a Lipid II phosphatase. That raises the question of how novel their finding about TelC in Si is? This deserves clarification.</italic> </p><p>The <italic>S. parasanguinus</italic> protein schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> is a predicted ortholog of TelC and was assigned a predicted activity based solely on this relatedness. Were an LXG protein possessing lipid II phosphatase activity known, we certainly would have highlighted and cited such a highly relevant result. To prevent this potential confusion, we have modified the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> legend to read: “lipid II phosphatase based on orthology to TelC (defined biochemically herein)” in place of “TelC-like lipid II phosphatase” found in the original manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>The manuscript has improved significantly because of the re-write and the inclusion of new data. I appreciate the authors' detailed responses to the reviews and their efforts to address the issues. Overall, I think they addressed the main concerns satisfactorily. I would only like to request a few modifications to the text.</italic> </p><p><italic>The main comment I have is about the cellular target of TelC. The authors show that TelC: a) needs to be exported to be toxic in both E. coli and Staph, and b) degrades both lipid II and undecaprenyl-PP (C55-PP)</italic> in vitro<italic>. They conclude that, in cells, TelC targets lipid II that is located in the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane. This could lead readers to mistakenly think that lipid II is only present at that location and that C55-PP is not. In reality, C55-PP is also present in the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane, and both lipid II and C55-PP are present in both leaflets of the cytoplasmic membrane. Therefore, I suggest that the authors state that their</italic> in vivo <italic>data cannot distinguish whether TelC targets lipid II and/or undecaprenyl-PP (C55-PP) and that it is unknown why toxicity is limited to an extracytoplasmic location given that these essential peptidoglycan intermediates transit through both leaflets of the cytoplasmic membrane. [A simple explanation for their data could be that the intermediate(s) is not accessible in the cytoplasmic side of the membrane because proteins that normally handle it during peptidoglycan synthesis protect it from TelC or the intermediate has a very short residence time at that location].</italic></p><p>At the suggestion of the reviewer we have added text stating that C55-PP and lipid II are present both inside and outside of the cell, that thus that it is unknown why cytoplasmic TelC is non-toxic. In this text, we acknowledge the substrate accessibility explanation mentioned by the reviewer and, in addition, we note that the abundance of free calcium ions outside of the bacterial cell may be important for TelC folding.</p></body></sub-article></article>
