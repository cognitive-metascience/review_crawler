in cellular metabolism to maintain glucose homeostasis. This effect is mediated by the Glut4 glucose transporter. Growth factors also enhance glucose uptake to fuel an anabolic metabolism required for tissue growth and repair. This activity is predominantly mediated by the Glut1. Akt is activated by phosphorylation of its kinase and hydrophobic motif (HM) domains. We show that insulin-stimulated Glut4-mediated glucose uptake requires PDPK1 phosphorylation of the kinase domain but not mTORC2 phosphorylation of the HM domain. Nonetheless, an intact HM domain is required for Glut4-mediated glucose uptake. Whereas, Glut1-mediated glucose uptake also requires mTORC2 phosphorylation of the HM domain, demonstrating both phosphorylation-dependent and independent roles of the HM domain in regulating glucose uptake. Thus, mTORC2 links Akt to the distinct physiologic programs related to Glut4 and Glut1-mediated glucose uptake.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26896.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26896.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Akt</kwd><kwd>mTORC2</kwd><kwd>Glut4</kwd><kwd>Glut1</kwd><kwd>insulin action</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK52852</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McGraw</surname><given-names>Timothy E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK096952</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McGraw</surname><given-names>Timothy E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Distinct phosphorylations of Akt determine the regulation of glucose uptake into fat and epithelial cells, revealing unexpected specialization in both Akt activation and its downstream control of glucose metabolism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Akt family of kinases are a major node in cell signaling, with regulatory roles in numerous physiologic processes, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, cell migration and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Manning and Cantley, 2007</xref>). Perturbations in Akt signaling are linked to many diseases, from hyper-activation in cancer to blunted activity in metabolic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Franke, 2008</xref>).</p><p>There are three Akt homologues: Akt1, Akt2 and Akt3 (also referred to as protein kinase B (PKB)α, -β and -γ, respectively). All three share a common domain structure consisting of an amino-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a kinase domain, and a carboxyl-terminal regulatory region referred to as the hydrophobic motif (HM) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 1999</xref>). The canonical mode of Akt activation involves plasma membrane recruitment to sites of phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity by Akt PH domain binding to phosphoinositide 3,4,5 trisphosphate (PIP3), the product of growth factor activation of PI3K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vivanco and Sawyers, 2002</xref>). Concurrent with plasma membrane recruitment, Akt is phosphorylated in its kinase domain at T308/9 (residue number for Akt1 and Akt2, respectively) by phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDPK1), which is itself recruited to the plasma membrane by its own PH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frech et al., 1997</xref>). Full Akt activation is associated with a second phosphorylation on S473/4 in the HM domain by mTORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sarbassov et al., 2005</xref>). The exact link between growth factor stimulation and activation of mTORC2 activity is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sparks and Guertin, 2010</xref>). The kinase domain phosphorylation, T308/9, is key for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alessi et al., 1996</xref>), whereas S473/4 phosphorylation of the HM domain allosterically enhances kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alessi et al., 1997</xref>) and contributes to substrate selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jacinto et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>A major function of Akt is to transmit insulin signaling to the control of cellular metabolism. One well characterized biological output of Akt is its role in insulin-stimulated translocation of Glut4 glucose transporter to the plasma membrane of fat and muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jiang et al., 2003</xref>). The redistribution of Glut4 underlies enhanced glucose uptake responsible for postprandial blood glucose lowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zisman et al., 2000</xref>). Akt also mediates growth factor stimulated glucose uptake into cells other than fat and muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ward and Thompson, 2012</xref>). In those cases, enhanced glucose uptake is to fulfill more local needs, such as fueling an anabolic metabolism required for cell growth and tissue repair; compared to the effect of insulin on fat and muscle cells, which is to maintain whole body glucose homeostasis. Enhanced Glut1-mediated glucose uptake by cancer cells is a prominent example of growth factor-stimulated glucose uptake untethered from regulation of whole body glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carvalho et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Akt is a principal mediator of growth factor action. However, technical impediments have made it challenging to define Akt isoform-specific roles as well as the precise roles of the two activating phosphorylations in signal transduction. We developed a system to study ectopically expressed Akt without interference from endogenous Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kajno et al., 2015</xref>). The ectopically expressed Akt is engineered to contain a mutation in the PH domain (W80A) that confers resistance to MK2206, an allosteric Akt inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calleja et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Green et al., 2008</xref>). Acute inhibition of endogenous Akt’s with MK2206 allows for functional studies of the ectopically expressed Akt, while minimizing compensatory changes due to loss of Akt functions. We have previously used this system to study Akt isoform specificity in adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kajno et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here we use this system to define the roles of Akt2 T309 and S474 phosphorylations in insulin-regulated glucose uptake by adipocytes and proliferative cells. Phosphorylation of T309 by PDPK1 is required for Glut4 translocation, whereas phosphorylation of S474 by mTORC2 is not required. However, insulin-stimulated Glut1 translocation to the plasma membrane of adipocytes and proliferative cells is dependent on both T309 and S474 phosphorylations, linking growth factor regulation of Glut1-mediated glucose uptake to mTORC2 activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To reveal the roles of Akt2 T309 and S474 Akt phosphorylations in insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation, we studied Akt2-W80A, a mutant resistant to the allosteric pan Akt inhibitor MK2206. We quantitatively determined Glut4 translocation to the plasma membrane of adipocytes in studies of a HA-Glut4-GFP reporter, an established functional assay of insulin activity in fat and muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karylowski et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lampson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zeigerer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boguslavsky et al., 2012</xref>). Throughout this work, unless noted otherwise, we refer to cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes simply as adipocytes. Although adipocytes express both Akt1 and Akt2, we focused on Akt2 since it has previously been shown to be the Akt isoform biased towards regulation of glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leavens et al., 2009</xref>). Akt2-W80A and HA-Glut4-GFP plasmids were transiently co-expressed in adipocytes by electroporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kajno et al., 2015</xref>). The Akt2-W80A construct contains a Flag epitope tag at the amino terminus and co-expression of Akt2-W80A and HA-Glut4-GFP was confirmed by GFP fluorescence and anti-FLAG immunofluorescence. Greater than 90% of the transfected cells co-expressed both proteins. To determine the expression of the constructs relative to the native proteins, we assessed total Glut4 and Akt by quantitative immunofluorescence and compared that value between cells expressing and not expressing the constructs. HA-Glut4-GFP expression was determined by GFP fluorescence and Akt2-W80A by anti-Flag staining. The cells expressing HA-Glut4-GFP showed about 1.5 fold increase in total Glut4 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), while cells expressing Akt2-W80A showed about two fold increase in total Akt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data demonstrate that the constructs are expressed to about the same level as native proteins.</p><p>A 30 min incubation with 1 nM insulin promoted an approximate 10-fold increase of Glut4 in the plasma membrane of control adipocytes, and co-expression of Akt2-W80A did not affect insulin response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). A 60 min pre-incubation with 1 µM MK2206 abolished insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation in control adipocytes, whereas Glut4 translocation was unaffected by MK2206 in cells expressing Akt2-W80A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26896.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Function of ectopic Akt can be selectively studied by expression of Akt2-W80A and using Akt inhibitor MK2206.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Relative expression levels of HA-Glut4-GFP reporter (<bold>A</bold>) and Akt2-W80A (<bold>B</bold>) relative to endogenous proteins in 3T3-L1 adipocytes used in this study.

AS160 (TBC1D4), a Rab GTPase activating protein (GAP), is an Akt target required for Glut4 translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mîinea et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geraghty et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eguez et al., 2005</xref>). Expression of Akt2-W80A fully rescued Akt phosphorylation of FoxO1 and partially rescued Akt T642 phosphorylation in cells in which native Akts are inhibited by MK2206 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E,F</xref>). The Akt2-W80A partial rescue of AS160 phosphorylation, in context of its complete rescue of Glut4 translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), indicates that AS160 phosphorylation is not linearly correlated with Akt regulation of Glut4 translocation.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Akt phosphorylation of AS160 is not a reliable surrogate of physiological activity</title><p>We next performed a more detailed investigation to determine the degree to which Akt phosphorylation of AS160 is uncoupled in Akt-dependent Glut4 translocation. MK2206 in a dose-dependent manner, inhibited insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation in control adipocytes, with an EC50 of less than 0.1 µM MK2206 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Adipocytes co-expressing Akt2-W80A were resistant to a dose up to 1 µM MK2206. Thus, 1 µM MK2206 can be used to distinguish ectopically expressed Akt2-W80A activity from the activities of endogenous Akt’s. The insulin dose-response of Glut4 translocation in MK2206-treated adipocytes expressing Akt2-W80A, was similar to that in untreated control adipocytes, validating this as an experimental system to quantitatively assess Akt function downstream of insulin stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26896.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Akt substrate phosphorylation does not directly reflect its physiological activity.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>).

Thus, Akt phosphorylation of AS160-T642 is not a linear readout of Akt control of Glut4 translocation. Insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation on T309 and S474, and phosphorylation of AS160 on T642 were unaffected by 1 µM MK2206 in adipocytes expressing Akt2-W80A, in agreement with the results of Glut4 translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Based on these results, we chose 1 µM MK2206 for subsequent structure-function studies of Akt2-W80A. As was the case for the insulin-dose response measured by Glut4 translocation, MK2206 did not affect the insulin dose-response of Akt2-W80A phosphorylation on T309 and S474, confirming the system can be used to quantitatively assess Akt activation downstream of insulin-stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>T309 phosphorylation, but not S474 phosphorylation, is required for insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation and mTORC1 activation</title><p>Activation of Akt2 involves phosphorylation of T309 and S474 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sarbassov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gonzalez and McGraw, 2009a</xref>). To probe the requirements of these phosphorylations for Akt2 signaling to Glut4, we studied the effects of alanine substitutions at these sites.

To determine if Akt2-S474 phosphorylation has a role in plasma membrane expression of Glut1 in cancer cells, we transiently co-expressed HA-Glut1 and Akt2-W80A or Akt2-W80A-S474A in a genetically engineered mouse lung cancer cell line (KP1 cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choi et al., 2015</xref>).

Thus, insulin-stimulated Glut1 translocation is downstream of Akt S474 phosphorylation in this cancer cell line.</p><p>To investigate the role of Akt2-S474 phosphorylation in Glut1-mediated glucose uptake, we generated KP1 cells stably expressing Akt2-W80A or Akt2-W80A-S474A. KP1 cells express constitutively active KRAS-G12D, which drives constitutive activity of Akt downstream of PI3 kinase. In KP1 cells stably expressing Akt2-W80A or Akt2-W80A-S474A, MK2206 treatment inhibits endogenous Akt, and therefore, any Akt-mediated effects will be downstream of the ectopically expressed Akt, allowing us to query the role of S474 phosphorylation in KRAS driven Glut1 plasma membrane expression. Glucose uptake by Akt2-W80A-S474A expressing KP1 cells was reduced compared to Akt2-W80A expressing KP1 cells, consistent with a role for phosphorylation of S474 in controlling the amount of Glut1 in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). These data demonstrate a role for S474 phosphorylation in Glut1 expression on the plasma membrane downstream of KRAS, revealing a role for mTORC2-Akt in the regulation of Glut1-depedent glucose metabolism in proliferative cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The Akt kinases are a central node in cell signaling. The two activating phosphorylations of Akt provide a mechanism by which Akt activity and signaling integrates the outputs of PDPK1 and mTORC2. The roles of the T308/9 and S473/4 for Akt activation and substrate selections have been analyzed in detail in in-vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balzano et al., 2015</xref>). Here we study their roles in intact adipocytes downstream of insulin, a natural stimulus. In adipocytes, one of the key biological output of insulin activation of Akt is the translocation of Glut4 to the plasma membrane, resulting in enhanced glucose uptake. PDPK1 phosphorylation of Akt2-T309 is required for insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation since either T309A mutation or inhibition of PDPK1 inhibits translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 and 4</xref>). These findings are in line with previous reports that T309 phosphorylation is essential for Akt activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alessi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stokoe et al., 1997</xref>). However, Akt2 phosphorylation at S474 is not required for Glut4 translocation in adipocytes, despite the fact that this phosphorylation is robustly stimulated by insulin and therefore is often used as a sentinel of insulin-sensitivity. Neither mutation of S474 to alanine nor inactivation of mTORC2 by silencing of Rictor, affected insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 and 4</xref>). Thus, insulin-regulated glucose uptake by adipocytes, a critical feature for whole body glucose homeostasis, is independent of mTORC2 phosphorylation of Akt. S6 kinase phosphorylation, an Akt-dependent activity downstream of mTORC1, was also independent of S474 phosphorylation.</p><p>Past studies have shown that mTORC2 phosphorylation of S473/4 has a role in Akt substrate selection. For example, ablation of Rictor-mTORC2 depressed FoxO1/3 phosphorylation, whereas phosphorylation of Akt substrates TSC2 and GSK3 were not affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jacinto et al., 2006</xref>). Our work contributes to understanding the role of phospho-S474 Akt in substrate selection by demonstrating this phosphorylation is required for functional regulation of Glut1 but not Glut4.</p><p>The direct role of Akt S474 phosphorylation in Glut4 translocation has not been investigated in the context of native insulin regulation of Akt activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ducluzeau et al., 2002</xref>). Two groups have shown a loss of Akt S473 phosphorylation and decreased insulin-stimulated adipocyte glucose uptake in primary adipocytes from adipocyte-specific Rictor knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kumar et al., 2010</xref>). However, neither study established that defective insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation was responsible for reduced glucose uptake nor did the studies agree on a mechanism for the decreased glucose uptake. Thus, our finding that S474 phosphorylation is not required for coupling of Akt activation to Glut4 translocation is compatible with the data reported for the Rictor knockouts. Furthermore, in light of our results, it is likely that the defect in glucose uptake in the Rictor knockout mice is not due to a defect in Glut4 translocation but rather due to another effect of the Rictor knockout on glucose metabolism. mTORC2 also phosphorylates several other kinases, including protein kinase A, protein kinase G and protein kinase C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Unexpectedly, we found that Akt2 S474 phosphorylation was required for insulin-stimulated Glut1 translocation. Both translocation of Glut1 to the plasma membrane of adipocytes and its contribution to increased glucose uptake were S474 phosphorylation-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Insulin and other growth factors stimulate an approximate 2-fold increase of Glut1 in the plasma membranes of a variety of cell types, although how this is achieved is not known. The principal Akt substrate involved in Glut4 translocation, AS160, is not required for Glut1 translocation. The dominant-inhibitory AS160 mutant, AS160-4A, which inhibits Glut4 translocation, does not affect insulin-stimulated Glut1 translocation. The S474 phosphorylation-dependent translocation of Glut1 to the plasma membrane is not a result of Akt regulation of general endocytic recycling because insulin-regulation of transferrin receptor trafficking was not dependent on S474 phosphorylation. These data establish that Akt2 specifically regulates the amount of Glut1 in the plasma membrane by a mechanism requiring S474 phosphorylation.</p><p>The control of Glut1 plasma membrane expression is not responsible for insulin regulation of glucose homeostasis. That effect of insulin is dependent on regulation of Glut4 in adipocytes and muscle, cell types that express very little Glut1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mitsumoto et al., 1991</xref>). Insulin stimulation of glucose uptake into those cells serves the postprandial needs of whole body metabolism rather than the intrinsic needs of the fat and muscle cells. In other cell types the effect of growth factors on Glut1 expression in the plasma membrane (and the resultant stimulated glucose uptake) fulfil cell-intrinsic needs, such as fueling an anabolic metabolism to support cell growth and tissue expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Olson et al., 1996</xref>). Our findings reveal a specific role for phospho-S474 Akt in cellular glucose uptake mediated by Glut1, demonstrating that mTORC2 contributes to the regulation of glucose transport into cells other than those required to maintain whole body glucose homeostasis, and it does so by signaling dependent on Akt phosphorylated at S474.</p><p>Glut1 has a role in the enhanced glucose uptake characteristic of many tumor cells. This increased Glut1 activity is achieved by increased expression as well changes in Glut1 trafficking that promote accumulation of Glut1 in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Egert et al., 1999</xref>). Akt is hyper-activated in many cancers, and our data suggest that one consequence is enhanced expression of Glut1 in the plasma membrane based on phospho-S474 Akt control of Glut1 trafficking. There is an emerging appreciation of mTORC2’s role in cancer, specifically in the control of glycolytic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Masui et al., 2014</xref>). mTORC2, via phospho-S474 Akt, may promote Glut1-mediated glucose uptake and therefore contribute to enhanced glycolytic metabolism.</p><p>SIN1, a component of mTORC2 complex, is phosphorylated by PDPK1-activated Akt, which results in activation of mTORC2, and activated mTORC2 then phosphorylates Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). This positive feedforward loop was demonstrated in a number of cell contexts and it may have a role to induce full Akt activation. However, this feedforward regulation is not required for all Akt regulated pathways since as we have shown here, S474A mutation did not quantitatively affect insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation or mTORC1 activation (i.e., S6 kinase phosphorylation).</p><p>Although S474 phosphorylation, which is within the HM domain, is not required to promote Glut4 translocation, the HM domain itself is required for Akt activity. Deletion of the HM domain blocked Akt2 signaling to Glut4 translocation, despite insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of T309 and providing the HM domain in trans did not complement the defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). However, co-expression of the HM domain fused to a PH domain restored insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation. The enforced co-localization, and subsequent local concentrations of the KD and HM domains, achieved by independently targeting the kinase and HM domains to plasma membrane sites of PI3 kinase activity is sufficient to reconstitute Akt function in Glut4 translocation. Although function is restored, S474 is not phosphorylated. These data reinforce the importance of the HM domain for Akt action and are consistent with the modular nature of Akt activation and substrate selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2002a</xref>).</p><p>The loss of function T309A mutation and the gain of function S474D mutation provide additional evidence that insulin activation of Akt is necessary and sufficient to induce Glut4 redistribution to the plasma membrane of adipocytes. The activity of S474D without insulin stimulation demonstrates that Akt can be activated based on the unstimulated levels of PI3 kinase and PDPK1 activities. Those findings raise the question of whether the activated levels of PI3 kinase and PDPK1 in growth factor-stimulated cells determine how quickly Akt is activated rather than PI3 kinase/PDPK1 stimulation determining the level of Akt activation achieved.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>Antibodies against Akt, phospho-Akt (Ser 473/4 and Thr 308/9- RRIDs- AB_329825 and AB_2255933), phospho-AS160 (Thr642), were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies.

The mechanism by which Rictor-Akt regulates Glut1 trafficking does not change the main conclusions of our manuscript.</p><p> <italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p> <italic>After careful consideration, your paper may be acceptable for publication if you can obtain additional data that significantly extends the work. Specifically, you will need to verify that the results you have obtained are physiologically relevant to the endogenous proteins you are studying by direct measurements of these endogenous proteins (Glut4, Glut1 and Akt2).</italic></p><p>We have confirmed, within the experimental restraints imposed by the biology, that the phenomenon we describe for ectopically expressed HA-Glut4-GFP, HA-Glut1 and Akt are pertinent to the behaviors of the native proteins.</p><p>It is a challenge to study the translocation of native Glut4 and Glut1 into the plasma membrane because antibodies that recognize extracellular domains are not available. A significant advance in the field of Glut biology came with the development of tagged versions of the Glut’s, like HA-Glut4-GFP and HA-Glut1 to quantitatively assess the amount of Glut4 or Glut1 in the plasma membrane. Since insulin regulates glucose flux into cells by regulating the amount of Glut4 and Glut1 in the plasma membrane, rather than controlling transporter activity, these reporters measure physiologically relevant regulation.</p><p>The Glut4 and Glut1 reporters used in this manuscript have been previously described. HA-Glut4-GFP, over the past decade, has been used in numerous publications from a number of labs, in addition to mine [e.g., (Boguslavsky et al., 2012, Zhao et al., 2009)]. We have over 15 years of experience with the HA-Glut4-GFP reporter. We have published extensive characterizations and validations of the reporter (Karylowski et al., 2004, Lampson et al., 2001, Zeigerer et al., 2002). The models for Glut4 trafficking, based on studies of the HA-Glut4-GFP reporter, are supported by glucose transport studies (physiological data) of native Glut4. We have modified the manuscript by providing additional references for readers unfamiliar with past studies using the HA-Glut4-GFP reporter (Results section).</p><p>Although the HA-Glut1 has not been as extensively studied as HA-Glut4-GFP, it is frequently used to study the distribution of Glut1. Those previous studies validate HA-Glut1 to study Glut1 trafficking (Takenouchi et al., 2007, Lee et al., 2015). We have modified the manuscript by providing additional references for readers unfamiliar with past studies using the HA-Glut1 reporter (Results, subsection “Phospho-S474 Akt2 promotes glucose uptake by increasing GLUT1 in the plasma membrane”).</p><p>That said, we agree with the reviewers that it is important to extend the results to native Glut1 and Glut4. To do so we have studied native Glut1 and Glut4 by assessing glucose transport. The amount of Glut4 and Glut1 in the plasma membrane is rate limiting for cellular glucose uptake; consequently, changes in glucose uptake reflect changes in the amount of transporter in the plasma membrane. In cultured adipocytes, we have studied: 1) endogenous Glut4 and Glut1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), 2) we used indinavir to isolate Glut1-mediated glucose uptake from Glut4-mediated uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), and 3) glucose uptake in KP1 cells to monitor plasma membrane Glut1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). In each case the change in glucose uptake correlates with the change in Glut behavior determined in studies of the reporters. We believe glucose transport studies address behaviors of the native Glut’s.</p><p>We used pharmacologic inhibition and siRNA knockdown to study the phosphorylation of native Akt at residues T308/9 and Ser473/4, and insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation to correlate the effects of reduced phosphorylation of native Akt at these sites to altered Akt function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Rictor depletion, which abrogated insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of native Akt at Ser473/4, did not inhibit glucose translocation, whereas pharmacologic inhibition of PDPK1, inhibited native Akt Thr308/9 phosphorylation and Glut4 translocation. These data are in agreement with the behaviors of ectopically expressed Akt2 mutants, and we believe demonstrate physiologic relevance of our studies for native Akt regulation.</p><p><italic>The expression levels of the introduced protein constructs, Akts and Gluts, relative to their endogenous counterparts have the possibility to confound data interpretation. Thus it is unclear what the relative levels of expressed Akt and HA tagged Gluts versus that of endogenous Glut1 and Glut4 are, and this needs to be shown.</italic></p><p>We agree with the comment and we have added new data reporting the expression levels of the introduced constructs relative to the native proteins. We have measured the relative expression levels of HA-Glut4-GFP, HA-Glut1 or various Akt2 constructs that are expressed in cultured adipocytes by electroporation, mimicking the conditions used for functional studies. Expression levels were measured by quantitative fluorescence microscopy with antibodies that recognize both the ectopically expressed and endogenous proteins. In experiments to quantify HA-Glut4-GFP expression relative to endogenous Glut4, cells that express HA-Glut4-GFP were identified by GFP fluorescence. In experiments to quantify HA-Glut1 expression relative to endogenous Glut1, cells that express HA-Glut1 were identified by anti-HA staining. In experiments to quantify ectopic Akt 2, which is Flag-tagged, cells that express the introduced Akt2 were identified by anti-Flag staining. Comparison of the anti-Glut4, anti-Glut1 and anti-Akt fluorescence power in cells that do not, to those that do express the reporters provides a measure of the relative over-expression of the transfected constructs.</p><p>These data demonstrate that HA-Glut4-GFP is expressed at about the same level as native Glut4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Similarly, different Akt2 constructs are also expressed at about the same level as total native Akts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). HA-Glut1 is expressed at about 3 times time the level of endogenous Glut1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In addition to providing quantification in the main figures, fields of cells representative of those used to quantify expression are provided as figure supplements 1 and 2. The agreement between the behaviors of introduced Glut4 and Glut1 reporters with glucose uptake (native proteins) indicates that the level of expression of the reporters are not confounding data interpretation.</p><p> <italic>Additionally, the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> on Akt would benefit by a comparison of transfected and untransfected kinase states in the same gel. In this latter regard, the editors agree with the reviewers that you will need to define the actual kinase activities of Akt2 under the conditions of your experiments rather than just the phosphorylation states of the protein kinase.</italic></p><p>The data requested is included in the revised manuscript. We have repeated the experiments to quantify the data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> in the same gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D-F</xref>). To define the kinase activities of Akt2, rather than simply relying on phosphorylation of Akt2, we have used substrate phosphorylation to demonstrate the enzymatic activity of the Akt2 constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D-F</xref>) The biochemical activity of the kinase as measured by western blotting for phosphorylation of two of the most relevant substrates, AS160 and FoxO1. The data demonstrate that Akt2-W80A construct rescues phosphorylation of AS160 and FoxO1 in MK2206-treated cells. These data support our results regarding the physiological activity of Akt2 (Glut4 translocation). These further support our previous conclusion that Akt phosphorylation of substrates are not necessarily linear readouts of Akt physiological functions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
