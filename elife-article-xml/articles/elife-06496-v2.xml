methyltransferases (KMTs). The pre-replication complex protein, origin recognition complex-associated (ORCA/LRWD1), preferentially localizes to heterochromatic regions in post-replicated cells. Its role in heterochromatin organization remained elusive. ORCA recognizes methylated H3K9 marks and interacts with repressive KMTs, including G9a/GLP and Suv39H1 in a chromatin context-dependent manner. Single-molecule pull-down assays demonstrate that ORCA-ORC (Origin Recognition Complex) and multiple H3K9 KMTs exist in a single complex and that ORCA stabilizes H3K9 KMT complex. Cells lacking ORCA show alterations in chromatin architecture, with significantly reduced H3K9 di- and tri-methylation at specific chromatin sites. Changes in heterochromatin structure due to loss of ORCA affect replication timing, preferentially at the late-replicating regions. We demonstrate that ORCA acts as a scaffold for the establishment of H3K9 KMT complex and its association and activity at specific chromatin sites is crucial for the organization of heterochromatin structure.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06496.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06496.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06496.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The genetic material inside cells is contained within molecules of DNA. In animals and other eukaryotes, the DNA is tightly wrapped around proteins called histones to form a compact structure known as chromatin. There are two forms of chromatin: loosely packed chromatin tends to contain genes that are highly active in cells, while tightly packed chromatin—called heterochromatin—tends to contain less-active genes.</p><p>How tightly DNA is packed in chromatin can be changed by adding small molecules known as methyl tags to individual histone proteins. Enzymes called KMTs are responsible for attaching these methyl tags to a specific site on the histones. Before a cell divides, it duplicates its DNA and these methyl tags, so that they can be passed onto the newly formed cells. This enables the new cells to ‘remember’ which genes were inactive or active in the original cell. A protein known as ORCA associates with heterochromatin, but it is not clear what role it plays in controlling the structure of chromatin.</p><p>Giri et al. studied ORCA and the KMTs in human cells. The experiments show that ORCA recognizes the methyl tags and binds to the KMTs in regions of heterochromatin, but not in regions where the DNA is more loosely packed. Next, Giri et al. used a technique called single-molecule pull-down, which is able to identify individual proteins within a group. These experiments showed that several KMT enzymes can bind to a single ORCA protein at the same time. ORCA stabilizes the binding of KMTs to chromatin, which enables the KMTs to modify the histones within it.</p><p>Cells lacking ORCA had fewer methyl tags on their histones, which altered the structure of the chromatin. This also affected the timing with which DNA copying takes place in cells before the cell divides. Giri et al.'s findings suggest that ORCA acts as a scaffold for the KMTs and that its activity at specific sites on chromatin is important for the organization of heterochromatin. The next step is to identify the exact regions in the genome where the timing of DNA copying is regulated by ORCA.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Origin recognition complex-associated (ORCA/LRWD1), a protein required for the initiation of DNA replication, preferentially localizes to heterochromatic regions in post-replicated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vermeulen et al., 2010</xref>). We and others have demonstrated that ORCA and ORC associate with centromeric and telomeric heterochromatin in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shen et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, using a stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based proteomic approach, ORCA-ORC complex has been shown to bind the repressive histone lysine methylation marks, specifically H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and H4K20me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vermeulen et al., 2010</xref>) that are known to be enriched at heterochromatic sites. ORCA contains a WD domain, a structure known to interact with nucleosomes/histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wysocka et al., 2005</xref>). We have previously demonstrated that the WD domain of ORCA is crucial for its binding to heterochromatin. Furthermore, ORCA is critical for stabilizing ORC binding to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shen et al., 2010</xref>). ORC, a hetero-hexameric complex, in addition to serving as the landing pad for the assembly of pre-replicative complex at the origins of DNA replication, participates in sister chromatid cohesion, heterochromatin organization, and chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shimada et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sasaki and Gilbert, 2007</xref>). In metazoans, ORC also facilitates the association of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) to the H3K9me3-containing pericentric heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pak et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Prasanth et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2010</xref>). Thus, it is obvious that ORC-ORCA complex associates with heterochromatin, but the mechanism underlying the recruitment of this multiprotein complex to the condensed chromatin and the functional relevance of such association has remained elusive for decades.</p><p>Histone lysine methylation, catalyzed by lysine methyltransferases (KMTs), plays key roles in the epigenetic regulation of chromatin organization, transcription, and replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black et al., 2012</xref>). Methylation of H3K9 is an abundant and stable modification and is an important regulator of heterochromatin formation, gene silencing, and DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martin and Zhang, 2005</xref>). The methyl modifications on H3K9 exist in distinct mono-, di-, and tri-methyl states (H3K9me1, H3K9me2, and H3K9me3, respectively), with each responsible for governing distinct cellular functions. In general, H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 are associated with gene expression/repression at euchromatic regions, whereas the H3K9me3, enriched at pericentric heterochromatin, is required for heterochromatin assembly and gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martin and Zhang, 2005</xref>). The major KMTs catalyzing these modifications are G9a and GLP, responsible for H3K9me2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tachibana et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rice et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shinkai and Tachibana, 2011</xref>); SETDB1, which establishes H3K9 di- and tri-methylation in euchromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schultz et al., 2002</xref>) and Suv39H1/H2 that establishes H3K9me3 from mono- or di-methylated H3K9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rea et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peters et al., 2003</xref>). While the idea of G9a and Suv39H1 acting in distinct, primarily in non-overlapping chromatin contexts held sway for a long time, this concept has been recently challenged by the discovery of a complex consisting of multiple H3K9 KMTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fritsch et al., 2010</xref>). The multimeric complex contains all four H3K9 KMTs G9a, GLP, Suv39H1, and SETDB1 and is recruited to both pericentromeric heterochromatin and promoter of a set of G9a-repressed genes where it aids in gene repression by maintaining H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fritsch et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, destabilizing even one of these KMTs resulted in the disintegration of the multimeric complex and loss of the enzymatic activity of this complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fritsch et al., 2010</xref>). How this multimeric KMTs complex is recruited to specific chromatin sites remained to be determined. In the broader context, the functional significance of the crosstalk between chromatin modifying and replication machineries has remained largely unexplored.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that ORCA associates with H3K9 KMTs in a chromatin context-dependent manner. By using a highly sensitive and quantitative single-molecule pull-down (SiMPull) approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jain et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shen et al., 2012</xref>), we demonstrate that ORCA preferentially binds to H3K9me3 and ORCA-ORC, and multiple H3K9 KMTs exist in a single complex. Furthermore, ORCA is required for the formation and/or maintenance of the H3K9 KMT complex. Our results indicate that ORCA is required for the integrity of global chromatin architecture. In the absence of ORCA, human cells show alterations in the binding and activity of KMTs at sites enriched for these factors with concomitant reduction in H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 marks. Finally, we observe that the cells lacking ORCA display abnormal heterochromatin organization and alteration in the replication timing, specifically at the late-replicating regions. We propose that ORCA is a scaffold protein that is required for the establishment as well as maintenance of heterochromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ORCA interacts with H3K9 KMTs</title><p>In order to address if ORCA interacts with the machinery that causes the establishment of heterochromatin, we used a candidate approach to investigate the interaction of ORCA with individual H3K9 KMTs that catalyze H3K9 repressive modifications. We observed robust interaction of endogenous ORCA with endogenous G9a and Suv39H1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Aa,Ab</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Aa,Ab</xref>). 1.31% of total G9a was found to be in a complex with ORCA. Quantitation was based on the amount of G9a immunoprecipitated with ORCA (based on 100% efficiency of ORCA IP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) (n = 7). Similarly, 1.44% of total Suv39H1 was in a complex with ORCA (n = 4). Note that only about 0.2% of the endogenous H3K9 KMTs co-purified with Suv39H1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fritsch et al., 2010</xref>). Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) using T7-tagged ORCA and Flag-tagged H3K9 KMTs revealed interaction of ORCA with G9a, GLP, and Suv39H1, all enzymes involved in the establishment of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ba,Bb</xref>).

Furthermore, transcriptional activation using doxycycline (DOX) causes the decondensation of the locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Janicki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shen et al., 2010</xref>).

EtBr selectively inhibits DNA-dependent protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lai and Herr, 1992</xref>).

The DNA-independent interactions were also corroborated by co-IP experiments in the presence of the nuclease benzonase (data not shown). Furthermore, the interaction of ORCA with G9a as well as Suv39H1 was direct and independent of DNA, as evident by the direct interaction of purified ORCA with G9a/Suv39H1 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ea,Eb</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The association of ORCA and H3K9 KMTs occurs on condensed chromatin</title><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that in addition to Suv39H1, G9a/GLP may participate in the establishment of pericentric heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vassen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kondo et al., 2008</xref>).

The WD domain of ORCA was able to recruit CFP-G9a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Ca,Cb</xref>) corroborating our IP results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1Aa</xref>). Interestingly, when CFP-LacI-ORCA was co-transfected with YFP-G9a mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1Ba</xref>), not only did the mutant YFP-G9a-1-618, which lacks the ankyrin repeats, show significantly reduced interaction but also YFP-G9a-1-965, which has an intact ankyrin repeat but lacks the SET domain, showed significantly reduced association with the locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1Ba,Bb</xref>). We next addressed if the interaction of ORCA with G9a at heterochromatic regions required the catalytic domain of G9a in addition to its ankyrin repeats. YFP-LacI-G9a triple fusion protein was found to be enzymatically active as is evident by the accumulation of H3K9me2 at the CLTon locus upon the tethering of G9a full-length construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Tethering of YFP-LacI-G9a-ΔSET or YFP-LacI-G9a-H1166K (a point mutant, which abolishes the catalytic ability of G9a) to the locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Da</xref>) failed to recruit CFP-ORCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Da,Db</xref>). However, co-IP experiments demonstrated that T7-ORCA could interact with GFP-G9a-ΔSET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These data suggest that while the ankyrin repeat of G9a is sufficient for the association with ORCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Ba</xref>), the interaction of ORCA and G9a at the heterochromatin also requires the methylating ability of G9a. Similarly, the interaction between ORCA and Suv39H1 requires the SET catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Bb</xref>).</p><p>Since we observed the interaction between ORCA and the H3K9 KMTs at the heterochromatic locus, we next asked if the interaction occurred in a chromatin context-dependent manner. We tethered ORCA to the CLTon locus and examined the recruitment of G9a upon induction of transcription from the decondensed locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Ea</xref>). In the absence of DOX, ∼80% of cells showed CFP-G9a recruitment to the locus when YFP-LacI-ORCA was tethered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Ea,Eb</xref>). Upon transcriptional activation, there was a striking reduction (∼10%) in CFP-G9a association in the YFP-LacI-ORCA-tethered decondensed locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Ea,Eb</xref>). ORCA-tethered decondensed locus, in addition to G9a, also failed to recruit HP1α, but contained Cdk9, a component of the pTEFB kinase complex, which is part of the transcription elongation complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>) Two components of the ORC, Orc2, and Orc3 that require each other for their stability associate with one another at both the condensed and the open chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). These results indicate that while ORCA can interact directly with G9a and Suv39H1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ea,Eb</xref>), the interactions could be dependent on or regulated by chromatin within the cells. In a cellular milieu, the fraction of ORCA directly interacting with G9a or Suv39H1, independent of chromatin, is likely to be a very small pool, and therefore, too weak to be detected at the CLTon locus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>ORCA-ORC and the H3K9 KMTs exist in one single complex</title><p>Our earlier work demonstrated the existence of a subset of multiple H3K9 KMTs in a single complex and functional cooperation between these molecules to regulate heterochromatin function and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fritsch et al., 2010</xref>). Since ORCA interacts with different H3K9 KMTs, we investigated if ORCA is an integral component of this multi-KMT complex.</p><p>For this purpose, we employed the process of SiMPull analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Aa,Ab</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jain et al., 2011</xref>). This method is extremely sensitive and is a tour de force to examine protein complexes and also to accurately calculate the stoichiometry of proteins within the complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shen et al., 2012</xref>). This approach obviates the need for ensemble experiments that require IPs with large quantities of cell lysates. Our initial estimates predicted that three grams of Flag-HA-Suv39H1-expressing Hela-S3 cell pellet, which is ∼3 billion cells, is required for a single glycerol gradient sedimentation to obtain other H3K9 KMT signals detectable by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fritsch et al., 2010</xref>). However, a relatively higher sensitivity can be achieved by the SiMPull approach by using only a million cells. We first measured the stoichiometry of ORCA bound ORC and H3K9 KMTs, respectively. We used cells co-expressing T7-ORCA and YFP-ORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Ba–Bd</xref>) or T7-ORCA and YFP-KMTs to perform SiMPull (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Ca–Dd</xref>). ORCA complexes containing YFP-ORC1 or YFP-KMTs were visualized as isolated fluorescent spots by single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Bb,Cb,Db</xref>). Pulldown by a control antibody (anti-HA) showed very low non-specific level of fluorescence, thereby demonstrating the high specificity of SiMPull assay. Individual fluorescence spots showed single- or multi-step decreases in fluorescence intensity corresponding to photobleaching of individual YFP molecules in a single complex (a representative schematic of the photobleaching analysis is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Aa</xref>). After photobleaching analysis of many co-immunoprecipitated YFP-ORC1, YFP-G9a, and YFP-Suv39H1, we found that primarily one molecule each of ORC1, G9a, and Suv39H1 interacts with a single molecule of ORCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Bd,Cd,Dd</xref>). In addition, we also observed that in a small population, ORCA associates with two molecules of G9a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Cd,Ce</xref>), suggesting that the ORCA-interacting-G9a may also be present as a homodimer.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06496.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>ORCA and H3K9 KMTs exist in one multimeric complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <bold>a</bold> Representative single-molecule fluorescence time trajectories for YFP-tagged molecules that exhibit one-step, two-step, and three-step photobleaching. <bold>b</bold> Key to the schematics of the SiMPull assay.

Next, we tested whether multiple H3K9 KMTs exist in a single complex with ORCA using triple transfections of T7-ORCA, YFP-Suv39H1, and mCherry-G9a in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Fa,Fc</xref>, plasmid titrations: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1Ba</xref>, lane3 used for the experiment). Interestingly, we could observe ∼55 ± 7% of YFP-Suv39H1 colocalized with mCherry-G9a, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Fc</xref>). Similar results were obtained with higher concentration of plasmid transfection: (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1Bb,Bc</xref>), suggesting the existence of a significant amount of ORCA-G9a-Suv39H1 complex. The true degree of cohabitation may be even higher because the fluorescent proteins may not all mature into active chromophores. This leads to dark molecules and appearance of either only green or only red spots even though both the KMTs are present in a complex. In addition, unequal expression of the transfected KMTs or the presence of endogenous KMTs in the complexes may also lead to a reduction in cohabitation detected by SiMPull. Finally, only a subset of G9a and Suv39H1 may exist as a single complex with ORCA (similar to reported data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fritsch et al., 2010</xref>]). Elucidation of three different proteins in a single complex is one of the promised capabilities of SiMPull (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jain et al., 2011</xref>), and the data we present here constitute one of the first demonstrations of such a capability.</p><p>In order to corroborate our SimPull observations on the existence of ORC-ORCA-H3K9 KMTs and G9a-ORCA-Suv39H1 in a single complex, we utilized sequential IPs. We carried out triple transfections of T7-ORCA, HA-ORC1, and Flag-G9a in U2OS cells, followed by immunoprecipitation of HA-ORC1. Following HA peptide elution, the eluate was used for T7-Ab immunoprecipitation. T7-ORCA was immunoprecipitated, and a robust co-IP of Flag-G9a was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This further confirmed the existence of ORC-ORCA-H3K9 KMTs in a single complex.

T7-ORCA was immunoprecipitated, and a robust co-IP of Flag-Suv39H1 was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), further confirming the existence of multiple H3K9 KMTs in a single complex with ORCA. The exogenous expression of Suv39H1 did not affect the association of G9a and ORCA; similarly, the exogenous expression of G9a did not compromise the association of Suv39H1 and ORCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Aa,Ab</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Loss of ORCA causes global changes in H3K9-containing heterochromatin structure</title><p>Previous studies indicated that ORCA along with ORC associates with heterochromatic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Prasanth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shen et al., 2010</xref>) and also specifically binds to repressive histone and DNA marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vermeulen et al., 2010</xref>).

To determine whether the H3K9-targets are directly regulated by ORCA, we conducted ChIP using HA antibody in HA-ORCA expressing stable cell line. This allowed us to address if ORCA is associated with H3K9-occupied genomic sites.

We next addressed if the loading of these KMTs onto chromatin is impaired upon ORCA KD. To investigate this, we performed G9a and Suv39H1 ChIP upon ORCA KD and analyzed the association of these enzymes to the loci that show H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 reductions. Suv39H1 showed a decrease at these loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Fa,Fb</xref>), indicating that the loading of Suv39H1 to these regions is reduced upon ORCA depletion. G9a association with these regions showed either no alteration or an increase at some regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1Ea,Eb</xref>), indicating that the reduction in H3K9me2 that was observed was possibly due to impaired catalytic activity of G9a.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>ORCA stabilizes the multimeric H3K9 KMT complex</title><p>Next, we addressed if ORCA facilitates the assembly of the multimeric H3K9 KMT megacomplex. To address this, the association between the components of the KMT megacomplex, namely G9a and Suv39H1, was evaluated in cells that were treated with control or ORCA siRNAs. Flag-G9a and HA-Suv39H1 were expressed, and HA IP was carried out in control and ORCA-depleted (ORCA KD) cells. ORCA KD showed close to 50% reduction of Suv39H1 that co-immunoprecipitated with G9a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Aa,Ab</xref>). This observation suggested that the stability of the KMT complex requires ORCA. We used SiMPull to obtain an accurate quantitative estimate of the reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Ba–Bc</xref>). YFP-Suv39H1 and mCherry-G9a were expressed in cells depleted of ORCA.

We depleted ORCA in U2OS cells and then synchronized the cells so as to analyze the spatio-temporal regulation of replication during S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

This coupled with the loss of late-replication patterns by BrdU IF in ORCA-depleted cells made us hypothesize that ORCA could also regulate the replication of late-replicating regions.</p><p>Loss of ORCA could be causing either changes in replication timing of late-replicating regions or the complete loss of replication of these regions. To investigate these possibilities, we conducted BrdU ChIP in control and ORCA-depleted U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1Ca–Cc</xref>). We depleted ORCA and arrested the cells using aphidicolin. The cells were then released into S-phase, pulse-labeled with BrdU, and analyzed by BrdU ChIP at different time points post-release (0, 4, 8, and 12 hr). The replication timing of various loci that showed significant reduction in H3K9me2 and me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1Ca</xref>) was assessed by quantitative PCR. We observed changes in replication timing of these loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1Cb,Cc</xref> shows two representative loci CELSR3 and FAM20A) upon loss of ORCA. For example, in control cells a significant population of CELSR3 locus replicates in late S (12 hr post release) as evident by the BrdU ChIP signal at 12 hr. Upon ORCA KD, there is a significant increase in the population of the locus replicating during early S (4-hr time point) and a concomitant reduction in BrdU ChIP signal at mid and late S (8 and 12 hr time points) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1Cb</xref>). The replication timing of C-FOS, a region that serves as a control showing no changes in H3K9me2 and me3 upon loss of ORCA, remains unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1Ca</xref>), suggesting that the replication timing changes observed in ORCA-depleted cells may not be because of the direct role of ORCA/ORC in establishing the pre-replicative complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>ORCA's role in heterochromatin organization is independent of its role in preRC assembly</title><p>We have previously demonstrated that ORCA plays a key role in replication initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shen et al., 2012</xref>). We addressed whether the observed defects in heterochromatin organization and replication patterning in cells lacking ORCA are due to defects in preRC assembly or reflect the more direct role of ORCA in heterochromatin organization. While it is well-known that ORC (along with ORCA) associates with heterochromatic regions in post-replicated cells in metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Prasanth et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shen et al., 2010</xref>), its direct role in heterochromatin organization vs heterochromatin replication licensing has remained to be understood.</p><p>In order to understand ORCA's role in chromatin organization and if it is independent of its role in preRC function, we wanted to deplete ORCA after the establishment of pre-replication complex (post-G1 phase) but before DNA synthesis began. Depletion of a protein within a short, specific time window by RNA interference is challenging because even if the mRNA levels are dramatically reduced, the protein levels could persist for significantly longer times. This necessitates the use of a strategy that utilizes post-translation degradation process for reducing proteins levels efficiently. To achieve this, we utilized a commercially available Proteotuner kit (Clonetech). Briefly, an siRNA resistant version of T7-ORCA (T7-ORCA-siRNA NTV: non-targetable version) was tagged with a destruction signal or DD (destabilization domain) tag, a destabilization domain of the FKBP protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banaszynski et al., 2006</xref>]). This signal is recognized by the proteosomal machinery and results in the rapid degradation of the exogenous ORCA. In the presence of a ligand, Shield1, the DD tag is masked by the binding of Shield1, thereby preventing the degradation of the exogenous ORCA protein.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06496.016</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Heterochromatin organization role of ORCA is independent of its role in preRC assembly.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of depletion of ORCA using the proteotuner system.

We transfected DD-T7-ORCA-siRNA NTV into U2OS along with siRNA to KD endogenous ORCA. Following two rounds of siRNA treatment (48 hr) in the presence of DD-T7-ORCA-siRNA NTV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), we examined the loading of ORC2 on chromatin and compared it to ORC2 loading in control and ORCA-depleted cells. We observed that while ORC2 loading was affected upon ORCA depletion (levels of ORC2 decrease in the chromatin fraction with concomitant increase in the supernatant fraction), the expression of DD-T7-ORCA-siRNA NTV construct rescued this phenotype by restoring the levels of ORC2 on chromatin to an extent comparable to that of the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). In addition, we also carried out immunoprecipitation of DD-T7-ORCA and found that it efficiently interacts with endogenous ORC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>), further confirming that DD-T7-ORCA is functional.</p><p>To determine if the role of ORCA in heterochromatin organization is independent of its role in preRC assembly, we transfected U2OS cells with DD-T7-ORCA-siRNA NTV. We then depleted endogenous ORCA by using ORCA siRNA, while the levels of exogenous DD-T7-ORCA-siRNA NTV were maintained by growing the cells in the presence of Shield1. We synchronized the cells at early S by using aphidicolin and then degraded exogenous DD-T7-ORCA at early S by removing shield from the medium. Removal of Shield1 resulted in the loss of exogenous ORCA (in addition to endogenous ORCA that was removed by siRNA treatment [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>]). The cells were then allowed to progress through S-phase and chromatin organization and replication were examined at different time points during S-phase. Specific depletion of ORCA only in post-G1 cells also resulted in reduction in the H3K9me2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). This demonstrates that the heterochromatin is disorganized in the absence of ORCA in post-G1 cells.</p><p>In these cells, we examined the replication patterning by BrdU immunofluorescence. We observed a decrease in cells showing mid- and late- patterns of DNA replication and a concomitant increase in cells showing early patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8Eb</xref>), similar to our previous observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In cells lacking ORCA, a large number of cells showing mid-replication patterns showed BrdU staining preferentially at perinucleolar regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8Ea</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Furthermore, we observed that H3K9me3 and HP1α were mislocalized and formed perinucleolar rings in cells lacking ORCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8Fa,Fb</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Such localization was reminiscent of HP1α localization in Orc1- and Orc5-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Prasanth et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, both control and ORCA-depleted cells progressed through S-phase at comparable rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D</xref>) indicating that the observed defects in HP1α localization and BrdU incorporation upon loss of ORCA are due to defects in heterochromatin and not due to indirect effects of defects in S-phase progression. Based on the results, we propose that the observed defects in heterochromatin organization in ORCA-depleted post-G1 cells are independent of its known functions in preRC assembly.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>ORCA, a key player in the initiation of DNA replication, associates with multiple components of the pre-replicative complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shen et al., 2012</xref>). The ORCA-ORC complex associates with heterochromatin, including telomeric and centromeric regions, even after replication has been accomplished suggesting that ORCA-ORC complex may play key roles in heterochromatin organization in addition to its role in pre-RC. The WD-repeat-containing domain (also found in ORCA) mediates interaction of proteins with nucleosomes/histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Suganuma et al., 2008</xref>). For example, WDR5, a component of the MLL/SET1 KMT complex, binds to H3K4me2 using WD repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ruthenburg et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, HIRA, a WD-repeat-containing protein, binds to core histones and controls transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lorain et al., 1998</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that ORCA associates with multiple H3K9 KMTs, binds to methylated H3K9, and regulates both the organization and replication of repressed chromatin marked with H3K9me2 and H3K9me3. Recently, a H3K9 KMTs multimeric complex has been identified that has been shown to be recruited to major satellite repeats and a subset of promoters of G9a-repressed genes and a functional cooperation of these enzymes is crucial for the regulation of G9a target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fritsch et al., 2010</xref>). We demonstrate that ORCA-ORC associates with the H3K9 KMT-containing complex and in the absence of ORCA, this complex disintegrates. The loss of the enzymatic activity of this complex causes changes in the H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 profile in human cells. Based on this, we propose that ORCA is a scaffold protein that stabilizes the H3K9 KMT complex.</p><p>Recent work suggests that in mouse cells ORCA associates with pericentric heterochromatin via its association to H3K9me3 and maintains silencing at the major satellite repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan and Zhang, 2012</xref>). Based on our results, we speculate that the changes in transcription of satellite repeats upon ORCA-depletion are likely caused by the changes in the heterochromatin structure.</p><p>Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that the WD-repeat of ORCA and the ankyrin repeat of G9a are crucial for the interaction between these two proteins. Ankyrin repeats of G9a also contain methyl-lysine binding modules and can therefore generate as well as read the same epigenetic mark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins et al., 2008</xref>). We have observed that the SET domain of G9a and its catalytic activity is essential for the binding of ORCA to heterochromatin, suggesting that the chromatin modifications initiated by the KMT provide docking sites for ORCA. These in turn may facilitate the recruitment of accessory factors that stabilize the interaction and help the propagation of heterochromatin. We propose that ORCA recognizes repressive histone marks, binds to KMTs that in turn facilitate the propagation of the histone mark. The newly established marks then become docking sites for ORCA and the whole process is repeated and this results in the spreading of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06496.018</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model depicting the role of ORCA in organizing heterochromatin.</title><p>Model representing mode of regulation of heterochromatin by ORCA.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06496.018">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06496.018</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06496-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>Tri-methylation of H3K9, mono-methylation of H3-K27, and tri-methylation of H4-K20 are enriched at pericentric heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peters et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rice et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schotta et al., 2004</xref>). It is well established that H3K9 tri-methylation is a prerequisite for the subsequent H4K20 tri-methylation at the pericentric heterochromatin and this in turn sets the chromatin for binding of other key heterochromatin proteins including HP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lachner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fischle et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stewart et al., 2005</xref>). It is interesting to note that ORCA also interacts with Suv420H1 and H2, enzymes that catalyze H4K20 di- and tri-methylation, respectively (data not shown). It has been previously reported that Suv420H2 is a structural component of the heterochromatin and is required for chromatin compaction as well as cohesin recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hahn et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, Reinberg and co-workers have proposed that the H4K20 me1/2/3 is also crucial for the regulation and timing of replication origin firing and that ORCA and Orc1 directly recognize these chromatin sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beck et al., 2012</xref>). We are currently addressing the functional relevance of ORCA and Suv420H1/2 interaction in heterochromatin organization and replication progression.</p><p>Work from Jenuwein and co-workers have pointed to the idea that Prdm3 and Prdm16, H3K9 mono-methyltransferases, are also required for mammalian heterochromatin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pinheiro et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, mono-methylation of H3 at K9 catalyzed by SETDB1 has been shown to be a favored substrate for Suv39h for K9 tri-methylation, which can then establish heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Loyola et al., 2009</xref>). The mechanism by which the Suv39h or H3K9me3 is targeted to pericentromere has been a long-standing question. It is generally assumed that HP1 is a key regulator of heterochromatin organization that is required for establishment and maintenance of this compacted form of chromatin. Spreading of the heterochromatin is thought to involve a mechanism where HP1 dimerizes, interacts with Suv39h1/2, and also recruits de novo DNA methyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almouzni and Probst, 2011</xref>). The fact that HP1 associates with heterochromatin in a transient manner has suggested that other perhaps constitutively bound factors contribute to the organization of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheutin et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, recent work has demonstrated that pericentric heterochromatin can be generated independent of Suv39h-HP1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Muramatsu et al., 2013</xref>). A transcription factor-based mechanism has also recently been suggested as an intrinsic mechanism for the formation of heterochromatin in mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2012</xref>). Based on our results, we propose that in human cells, ORCA facilitates the recruitment, accumulation, and also the propagation of the heterochromatin by a self-sustaining loop mechanism, whereby ORCA binds to specific chromatin marks, associates with Suv39H1, that in turn propagates more H3K9me3 marks, generating more docking sites for ORCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>We previously demonstrated that ORCA can facilitate the binding of ORC to chromatin and in the absence of ORCA, the binding of ORC to chromatin is compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shen et al., 2010</xref>). However, it remains to be determined if the loss of chromatin-bound ORC in ORCA-depleted cells occurs at specific origins or at heterochromatic sites or both. Our data unequivocally demonstrate that ORCA binds to H3K9-methylated chromatin and facilitates the recruitment of KMTs as well as other components of ORC and MCMs to these sites. It is possible that the regulation of these epigenetic modifications by ORCA may provide identity to repressed chromatin and this in turn is crucial for proper replication. This idea is supported by our observation that ORCA associates with repressive KMTs only in a heterochromatic environment. It is known that G9a mediates di-methylation of H3K9 at late-replicating chromatin and this occurs predominantly at the nuclear periphery. H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 are enriched at the late-replicating facultative or constitutive heterochromatin, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). The reduction of these marks upon loss of ORCA leads to changes in the replication timing only of these regions as indicated by the significant decrease in late-replication patterns upon ORCA KD. This is very similar to previous reports that show that loss of Rif1 causes reduction in mid-replication patterns and global changes in replication timing primarily due to Rif1's role in organizing chromatin loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cornacchia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yamazaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kumar and Cheok, 2014</xref>). ORCA could be functioning in a similar fashion as an organizer of heterochromatin, and therefore, in cells lacking ORCA replication timing is altered. Furthermore, using the proteoTuner system, we demonstrate that the role of ORCA in chromatin organization is independent of its role in preRC assembly.</p><p>Heterochromatin is formed as a result of a maturation process that requires several steps and ORCA acts early in this process. Our results demonstrate that ORCA is a chromatin reader that facilitates the assembly of the writer KMT complex and its associated partners to specific chromatin sites. These together regulate key cellular events, including DNA replication and heterochromatin organization.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid constructs</title><p>Human G9a (hG9a) full-length and mutant clones were obtained using PCR using pCDNA3 Flag G9a plasmid provided very kindly by Dr Martin Walsh.

Appropriate biotinylated antibody was immobilized on PEG passivated surfaces at approximately 20 nM concentration for 20 min after coating the flow chambers with 0.2 mg/ml NeutrAvidin for 5 min.

The error bars represent standard deviation of the mean values from 20 imaging areas. Number of fluorescence photobleaching steps was determined for each YFP-tagged molecule and accumulated to obtain the stoichiometry of the complex. Colocalization percentage between YFP and mCherry was calculated as the number of coaligned molecules of one fluorescent molecule with respect to the fluorescent molecules found in lower density on the surface. This was needed since the number of YFP and mCherry tagged proteins was not pulled down to the same extent due to their independent interaction with ORCA. Colocalization criterion was set at 2 pixels, which correspond to a diffraction limited spot (∼300 nm) for our TIRF setup. Error bars represent standard deviation of the mean values obtained from three independent experiments. For pulled down experiments performed using H3K9 peptides, the expression level of YFP-WT ORCA and YFP-mutant-ORCA was compared in the beginning by performing a direct pulldown by anti-GFP.

Five to fifteen nanograms of ChIP DNA or un-enriched whole cell extract (Input) were prepared for sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq2000. Libraries were constructed with the Truseq DNA sample prep kit V2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with the following modifications: 10 ng of ChIP DNA were used as input material. DNA fragments were blunt-ended, 3′-end A-tailed and ligated to indexed TruSeq adaptors. The adaptors were diluted in a ratio of 1:20 to adjust for the input amount of DNA. Indexed adaptors allow for sequencing of multiple samples on the same lane (multiplexing). The adaptor-ligated ChIP DNAs were individually size selected on a 2% agarose gel (Ex-Gel, Life Technologies, CA) to obtain the ligated fragments 300–800 bp in length. Size-selected DNAs were amplified by PCR to selectively enrich for those fragments that have adapters on both ends. Amplification was carried out for 15 cycles with the Kapa HiFi polymerase (Kapa Biosystems, Woburn, MA) to reduce the likeliness of multiple identical reads due to preferential amplification. The final libraries were quantitated by qPCR on an ABI 7900, to allow for accurate quantitation and maximization of number of clusters in the flowcell. Final amplified libraries were also run on Agilent bioanalyzer DNA 7500 LabChips (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) to determine the average fragment size and to confirm the presence of DNA of the expected size range.</p><p>The libraries were pooled and loaded onto a lane of an 8-lane flowcell for cluster formation and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000.

Your article has been overall favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The Reviewing editor, Michael Botchan, and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript has important new data that could in principle be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. However as you will see from the comments below, a considerable amount of additional experiments will be required and some of your major conclusions may be difficult to substantiate. But we would like to see if you can provide such work in a revised manuscript.</p><p>The association of the Lysine methytransferase complexes with ORCA and ORC is important and ORCA's role as a scaffold for this megacomplex is certainly something of potential wide importance. The authors' conclusion that ORCA brings the histone modification enzymes to heterochromatin and that these modifications in turn effect replication within heterochromatin is also a key result of potential impact.</p><p>The novel and key biological relevance sections of this paper hinges on the idea that ORCA-mediated heterochromatin formation is affecting DNA replication. The trouble the reviewers all have with this conclusion that needs to be addressed is that previously Prasanth and colleagues have shown some rather profound S phase phenotypes from ORCA depletion that they originally argued were due to a direct recruitment of ORC to DNA via ORCA. This S phase defect is documented again here in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>. In this submission, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig7">Figures 5 and 7</xref> are replication-timing phenotypes from asynchronous ORCA-depleted cells which presumably, given previous data, have too little ORC on DNA. Thus these experiments can't distinguish between heterochromatin-mediated origin firing effects and indirect effects of just having too little bound ORC, which could have its own effects on chromatin (i.e. via HP1).</p><p>The main attempt to address this issue of what ORCA does to ORC vs. ORCA's effect on histone methylation is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; the description of this very key experiment didn't get the attention it deserves in the writing and lacks some important details. The idea, not at all clearly described, is to remove endogenous ORCA with siRNA (which takes days) but keep cells healthy with the DD ORCA that they can then degrade rapidly after G1. Then they arrest cells after S phase starts (not G1/S as they claim since they're using aphidicolin) so presumably ORC loading is fine, and then they endeavor to see what happens to the next S phase progression if ORCA is degraded. There are a lot of controls they didn't show and must be done for further consideration:</p><p>1) Is ORC binding in fact fine? And if so some key data supporting that conclusion is required.</p><p>2) Does the degradable ORCA construct complement si-ORCA-depleted cells? If that all works the way they intended, then what do the authors feel about the phenotype in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8Cb</xref>? Is it likely to be biologically important? The effects seem much smaller than in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Bb</xref> that is the asynchronous (and therefore combination) phenotype. The reviewers think the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8Cb</xref> differences are really small, and can't tell what one is supposed to be noticing that's different in the micrographs of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8Ca</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>. Could almost all the heterochromatin effects they document in other figures be co-dependent on ORC?</p><p>3) A related but different issue is the following: there's a critical control missing that should compare the overall progression through S phase of ORCA-depleted cells to controls. Given the strong S phase reduction from ORCA depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and in the authors' 2010 paper), the changes in replication of loci queried at a given time point may appear different just because there's overall fewer origins firing. The details of the replication timing analysis are also missing from the methods; how were the signals normalized, and what exactly are the BrdU-ChIP plots showing? Some of the key points about ORCA scaffolding come only from experiments in which the proteins of interest are overproduced. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> is one of those, and all of the SiMPull assays are done with transient transfections of fluorescent fusion constructs. Given that this is their first use of SiMPull colocalization to claim that three proteins are in a complex together, and that this is one of their major findings, a second method should be added as corroboration (e.g. FRET, ip-/re-IP, etc.).</p><p>Another set of important and major considerations of concern to all of the reviewers is the fact that most of the experiments are with over-expressed proteins and very little confidence is provided by the quality of the western blots shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Some quantification of levels of the endogenous complex will be required as indicated below. Furthermore, the manuscript if it is to be published in <italic>eLife</italic> should use some corroborating evidence beyond the elegant SimPul fluorescence images to show that there's an endogenous complex scaffolded by ORCA.</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Aa</xref> and 1Ab are endogenous co-IPs but the labeling and quality seems rather poor. Perhaps better antibodies or purification of the reagents will cut out the background and enhance the signal. From such improved westerns some indication of complex levels as opposed to simply free protein can be made.</p><p>2) The manuscript cites a previous paper that describes the KMT “mega complex”. If a major point here is that ORCA is the scaffold, then the data in this manuscript should be able to show that by knocking down ORCA and repeating the G9A/Suv39H1 co-IP that's shown in 1Ab with anticipated results.</p><p>3) The fluorescent single molecule experiments do all have to use ectopic expression, but the reviewers think it would be better if the manuscript had at least one experiment with controlled expression levels so that the fluorescent molecules are in the range of the endogenous proteins. They could easily do that with stable cell lines.</p><p>Another major concern of the reviewers focused on the replication timing experiments. There was agreement that this is a point that might deserve a more specific analysis. A much more thorough demonstration for the points claimed, including a genome-wide analysis of the replication timing, is required. All the replication timing data is from cells that have a serious S phase defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), and reviewers agreed that even though the authors have done a considerable amount of work on this aspect, they were not convinced that the conclusions were substantiated by the data. Do cells depleted of ORC to the same extent as the ORCA depletion have the same sort of replication timing phenotype? This comes back to the overall question of what are the direct effects and what are indirect that were discussed above.</p><p>If the authors are convinced that the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> is true, then they would predict that simply knocking down ORC should have little effect on heterochromatin formation.</p><p>Finally some internal discrepancies from the figures arise and are key to what is actually happening to histone modification levels genome wide and in heterochromatin specifically:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows that ORCA depletion does not affect the total level of H3K9me3 (as measured by Western blotting). However, from the Chip-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), the authors conclude that the H3K9me3 signal is significantly reduced. The reviewers are making the assumption that the modification of H3K9 takes place on chromatin and therefore, do not understand this apparent discrepancy. The authors also claimed that the H3K9me3 signal was significantly reduced at satellite repeats, but this is less than obvious in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Ca</xref>.</p><p>2) Upon ORCA depletion, the authors found that the reduction of H3K9me3 peaks is localized in late replicating domains. However, we point out that most H3K9me3 sites are normally in late replicating domains and therefore the reduction must basically “mainly” affect late replication domains.</p><p><italic>Minor comments:</italic></p><p>1) The effect of transcriptional activation on the LacI array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and associated supplemental figures) is very interesting, but is not easily reconciled with the evidence that ORCA binds G91 and Suv38H1 independently and directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). It may be that the direct interactions are very weak since the authors needed to use western blotting to detect them. If so, then the interactions may in fact be chromatin dependent in cells rather than just chromatin-influenced; the use of EtBr in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> doesn't sway me on this since those are all co-IPs from overproduced proteins. The interactions with purified proteins show that they proteins can interact directly, but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> suggests that in cells any direct interaction is too weak to detect. The authors should make it clear what they mean in their interpretation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>.</p><p>2) Some parts of the figures are quite hard to read without major magnification. This is most common for graphs and some gels; should there be visible signal in the inputs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>? Also, what is “Hela S3 G1b 1” and “HeLa S3 S1 1”? I assume one is the control and one is the ORCA knockdown, but that's not said in the text or legends, and there is not enough information to interpret the replication timing graphs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06496.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The novel and key biological relevance sections of this paper hinges on the idea that ORCA-mediated heterochromatin formation is affecting DNA replication.

And if so some key data supporting that conclusion is required</italic>.</p><p>To evaluate if ORC loading is indeed fine during G1 phase when only DD-ORCA is expressing, we have evaluated the Orc2 loading in cells that are depleted of ORCA in the presence or absence of DD- ORCA (please see experimental details below, also included in the Materials and methods section). We deplete endogenous ORCA in cells having DD-ORCA. In the presence of Shield, DD-ORCA is stabilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). We observe that in the absence of ORCA, Orc2 loading to chromatin is reduced, with a concomitant increase in the soluble pool of Orc2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). However, in cells expressing DD-ORCA, when the endogenous ORCA is depleted, DD-ORCA is able to rescue the chromatin-loading defect suggesting that DD- ORCA is functional.</p><p>Since the key role of ORC in loading MCM is restricted to G1 phase of the cell cycle, we have not evaluated how ORC loading is affected in ORCA- depleted S-phase cells. Further, the role of ORC binding to chromatin in postG1 cells remains to be understood.</p><p>Rescuing of ORC loading by using DD-T7-ORCA-siRNA NTV: U2OS cells were transfected with of DD-T7- ORCA-siRNA NTV construct along with siRNA against ORCA. Five hours later Shield1 (0.5µM) was added to the medium. 24 hours after the first round of knockdown, a second round of ORCA siRNA treatment was carried out in the presence of Shield1. Samples were collected 24h later for chromatin fractionation to examine ORC loading.</p><p><italic>2) Does the degradable ORCA construct complement si-ORCA-depleted cells?</italic></p><p>In addition, to demonstrating that DD-ORCA can rescue chromatin loading of Orc2 in the absence of endogenous ORCA, we have now conducted additional experiments to evaluate the functionality of DD-ORCA. Immunoprecipitation using T7-antibody in cells expressing DD-T7-ORCA showed efficient association of the DD-ORCA with ORC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p><italic>If that all works the way they intended, then what do the authors feel about the phenotype in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8Cb</italic></xref><italic>?

We believe that the decrease though small, is statistically significant. This might be a reflection of the multiple, additive layers of regulation exerted by ORCA on the process of preRC assembly and heterochromatin organization. One possibility could be that the defects in preRC assembly as well as changes in heterochromatin organization cause changes in replication timing. Therefore, in cells where preRC is assembled appropriately, and ORCA is depleted in postG1 cells, the defects in heterochromatin organization cause defects in replication timing, but not to the same extent when initiation is also affected.</p><p><italic>The reviewers think the</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8Cb</italic></xref> <italic>differences are really small, and can't tell what one is supposed to be noticing that's different in the micrographs of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8Ca</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8D</italic></xref><italic>.

We are now also providing higher magnification of these images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8Ea</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8Fa</xref>). We would like to bring to the reader’s attention that in the absence of ORCA, there is accumulation of BrdU and HP1a and H3K9me3 in the form of perinucleolar rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8Ea, 8Fa, 8Fb</xref>). Such a phenotype is reminiscent of the defects observed in HP1a and H3K9me3 distribution in Orc1 and Orc5 depleted human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Prasanth et al., 2010</xref>, Supplementary figure).</p><p>We have demonstrated earlier, that ORC binding to chromatin is abrogated in the absence of ORCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shen et al., 2010</xref> Mol. Cell). Also, ORCA degrades in the absence Orc2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shen et al., 2010</xref> Cell Cycle). So, we know that ORCA cannot exist without Orc2. In the current manuscript also, we have shown that ORCA- ORC-HMTs are in one single complex and that all the heterochromatin effects are indeed co-dependent on ORC.</p><p>To understand, whether this role of ORCA/ORC in heterochromatin organization was independent of its role in preRC assembly, we carried out the experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> of the manuscript and that makes us believe that ORCA/ORC have a distinct role in heterochromatin organization beyond a role in preRC assembly.</p><p><italic>3) A related but different issue is the following: there's a critical control missing that should compare the overall progression through S phase of ORCA-depleted cells to controls</italic>.</p><p>We have now carried out flow cytometry in our proteo-tuner experimental set up, where ORCA is depleted in post-G1 cells. FACS profile in control and ORCA-depleted cells at 0, 4, 8 and 12 h did not show any changes in the length of S-phase and the progression through S-phase was comparable in control and in cells lacking ORCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p><italic>Given the strong S phase reduction from ORCA depletion (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7C</italic></xref> <italic>and in the authors' 2010 paper), the changes in replication of loci queried at a given time point may appear different just because there's overall fewer origins firing</italic>.</p><p>We have now provided details of our BrdU ChIP experiment and also included detailed discussion and interpretation related to this part (please see details below). Our BrdU ChIP experiment shows that there are major transitions (late to early and early to middle) in replication timing. It is true that there are fewer origins firing because ORC loading is affected upon ORCA KD, when ORCA is depleted from asynchronously growing cells. But, if that were the only effect on replication, then for a given locus, the BrdU ChIP plot would have shown exactly the same trend for control and knockdown experiments. The difference would have been that the heights of the plots would have significantly reduced in ORCA KD samples. Instead, what we observe is that the pattern of the plot changes dramatically with loci now showing a replication timing profile strikingly different from control with large scale late to early (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1Cb</xref>) and early to mid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1Cc</xref>) transitions.</p><p><italic>The details of the replication timing analysis are also missing from the methods; how were the signals normalized, and what exactly are the BrdU-ChIP plots showing?</italic></p><p>We plot the H3K9me3 and replication timing enrichment sites over the genome (black bars). We used our H3K9me3 data set in Control condition and the Hela replication timing data from Encode consortium. This information has now been included in the manuscript as described below.</p><p>BrdU ChIP after ORCA knockdown and data analysis: two rounds of ORCA knockdown were carried out, 24h apart. The cells were then arrested using aphidicolin for 12h followed by release into S phase and samples were collected 0, 4, 8 and 12h post release for BrdU ChIP. Prior to each time point collection, cells were pulsed for 2h with BrdU (10µM).</p><p>Cells for each time point were then lysed with 300ul of SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10mM EDTA, 50mM Tris pH 8.0). The lysates were subjected to sonication with Bioruptor Power- up (Diagenode). 100ul sheared chromatin aliquots were then placed on 95°C heat block for 10 minutes. This was followed by snap chilling the samples for 10 minutes. The samples were then diluted, precleared and processed further in a manner identical to the ChIP protocol described in the previous section.</p><p>qPCRs were carried out with purified DNA of input, BrdU ChIP and mouse IgG ChIP samples obtained at 0, 4, 8 and 12h post aphidicolin release timepoints. The qPCR signals of BrdU and mouse IgG samples were calculated as percent input values. Fold enrichment of BrdU ChIP over mouse IgG ChIP was calculated for each time point.</p><p><italic>Some of the key points about ORCA scaffolding come only from experiments in which the proteins of interest are overproduced.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6A</italic></xref> <italic>is one of those, and all of the SiMPull assays are done with transient transfections of fluorescent fusion constructs. Given that this is their first use of SiMPull colocalization to claim that three proteins are in a complex together, and that this is one of their major findings, a second method should be added as corroboration (e.g. FRET, ip-/re-IP, etc.)</italic>.</p><p>Our collaborators who developed this technology, have just recently, also published the use of single-molecule pull down to establish multiple components within a complex (Jain et al., PNAS Dec 2014 111(50):17833-38). In their manuscript, as a proof of principle they demonstrated the existence of the triple complex using Flag-mTOR, mCherry-Raptor and YFP-PRAS40.</p><p>As per the reviewers’ suggestions, we have now performed IP/re-IP and provide evidence for the existence of the complex containing ORCA- ORC-G9a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1C</xref>) and ORCA- G9a-Suv39h1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p><italic>Another set of important and major considerations of concern to all of the reviewers is the fact that most of the experiments are with over-expressed proteins and very little confidence is provided by the quality of the western blots shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>. Some quantification of levels of the endogenous complex will be required as indicated below. Furthermore, the manuscript if it is to be published in eLife should use some corroborating evidence beyond the elegant SimPul fluorescence images to show that there's an endogenous complex scaffolded by ORCA</italic>.</p><p><italic>1)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1Aa and 1Ab</italic></xref> <italic>are endogenous co-IPs but the labeling and quality seems rather poor. Perhaps better antibodies or purification of the reagents will cut out the background and enhance the signal. From such improved westerns some indication of complex levels as opposed to simply free protein can be made</italic>.</p><p>We have evidence that ORCA IP and G9a IP can deplete ORCA and G9a respectively to completion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1B</xref>). Based on 7 independent experiments, we have now estimated that 1.31% of total G9a is in a complex with ORCA. Similarly, 1.44% of total Suv39H1 is in a complex with ORCA (N=4). It has previously been reported that about 0.2% of endogenous H3K9 HKMTs co-purified with Suv39h1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fritsch et al., 2010</xref>). We are also providing two new sets of endogenous IP data to demonstrate that ORCA associates with G9a and that this interaction is not affected by the exogenous expression of FL-and SET (151-412)-Suv39H1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1Aa</xref>). Similarly, ORCA associates with Suv39h1, and this interaction is not affected by the exogenous expression of FL or Ankyrin-G9a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1Ab</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) The manuscript cites a previous paper that describes the KMT “mega complex”. If a major point here is that ORCA is the scaffold, then the data in this manuscript should be able to show that by knocking down ORCA and repeating the G9A/Suv39H1 co-IP that's shown in 1Ab with anticipated results</italic>.</p><p>We would like to bring it to the reviewers’ kind attention, that we need 30X10cm plates to conduct endogenous IPs (this is equivalent to 3X10e8 cells). As also pointed out in the original manuscript on the KMT megacomplex, ∼3 billion cells expressing FLAG-HA- Suv39H1 were required for a single glycerol gradient sedimentation to obtain the H3K9KMT signals detectable by western blotting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fritsch et al., 2010</xref>). Conducting siRNA knockdown of 30X10cm plates for control and additional 30X10cm for ORCA knockdown (and attempt this thrice) is extremely difficult, expensive and an arduous task. We did however attempt this experiment without success. Because of this problem, we carried out SiMpull, since this can be achieved with 1 million cells. I hope the reviewers’ understand and agree with the logistics relating to this experiment.</p><p><italic>3) The fluorescent single molecule experiments do all have to use ectopic expression, but the reviewers think it would be better if the manuscript had at least one experiment with controlled expression levels so that the fluorescent molecules are in the range of the endogenous proteins. They could easily do that with stable cell lines</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this and we have now carefully titrated the levels of plasmid transfected and the levels of expression. We have now carried out SimPull using transiently transfected proteins whose levels are carefully titrated and are comparable to endogenous levels. Kindly note that we have now used only 100ng of each plasmid (T7-ORCA, mCherry- G9a and YFP-Suv39H1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1Ba</xref>) and found results similar to what we reported previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Similarly, we have now used 100ng of T7ORCA, mCherry-G9a and YFP-Orc1 and conducted SimPull analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1Aa</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We have now replaced these figures in the manuscript.</p><p>In order to look at the formation of ORCA-G9a- Suv39H1 triple complex in a more endogenous context, we carried out SiMPull in a HA- ORCA U2OS stable cell line established in our lab. Towards this end, we transfected YFP- Suv39H1 and mCherry-G9a into the stable cell line and carried out SiMPull with both HA and ORCA antibody. Unfortunately, the signal to noise ratio was very low in both the pull-downs making further analysis of co-localization difficult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>). In addition, we also utilized a Flag-HA-Suv39H1 HeLa stable cell line into which we transfected YFP-ORC1 and mCherry-G9a. We then carried out SiMPull using Flag antibody. While mCherry-ORCA was pulled down efficiently by this process, YFP-ORC1 pulldown showed a very low signal to noise ratio, again making co-localization analysis difficult.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06496.023</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06496.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06496.023</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06496-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>Another major concern of the reviewers focused on the replication timing experiments. There was agreement that this is a point that might deserve a more specific analysis. A much more thorough demonstration for the points claimed, including a genome-wide analysis of the replication timing, is required. All the replication timing data is from cells that have a serious S phase defect (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7C</italic></xref><italic>), and reviewers agreed that even though the authors have done a considerable amount of work on this aspect, they were not convinced that the conclusions were substantiated by the data</italic>.</p><p><italic>Do cells depleted of ORC to the same extent as the ORCA depletion have the same sort of replication timing phenotype? This comes back to the overall question of what are the direct effects and what are indirect that were discussed above</italic>.</p><p>As pointed earlier, ORCA cannot exist in cells without ORC and therefore we believe that ORCA-ORC complex is critical for the heterochromatin organization function.</p><p>Kindly note that loss of Orc2 in human HeLa cells also shows changes in replication patterning. As documented previously, during a 10 min pulse in HeLa cells, 26% cells that incorporate BrdU, show 60% early, 25% mid and 15% late S pattern. In contrast, in Orc2 siRNA treated cells, 15% cells incorporate BrdU, out of which 75% represent early, 19% in mid and 6% are late S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Prasanth et al., 2004</xref> EMBO).</p><p><italic>If the authors are convinced that the model in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"><italic>Figure 9</italic></xref> <italic>is true, then they would predict that simply knocking down ORC should have little effect on heterochromatin formation</italic>.</p><p>Since ORCA-ORC is always in one complex, our model supports that this complex binds to KHMTs and together establish heterochromatin organization. We apologize that this was not clearly mentioned in the previous version. We have accordingly made the necessary changes to the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Finally some internal discrepancies from the figures arise and are key to what is actually happening to histone modification levels genome wide and in heterochromatin specifically</italic>:</p><p><italic>1)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref> <italic>shows that ORCA depletion does not affect the total level of H3K9me3 (as measured by Western blotting). However, from the Chip-seq data (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>), the authors conclude that the H3K9me3 signal is significantly reduced. The reviewers are making the assumption that the modification of H3K9 takes place on chromatin and therefore, do not understand this apparent discrepancy</italic>.</p><p>We too have been baffled by this observation. Please note that we observe 18% reduction in H3K9me3 binding to chromatin upon ORCA knockdown. The explanation, we believe is that this reduction may not be detectable at the western blotting level.</p><p><italic>The authors also claimed that the H3K9me3 signal was significantly reduced at satellite repeats, but this is less than obvious in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5Ca</italic></xref>.</p><p>As the reviewers pointed out, we observe approximately 15% decrease in H3K9me3 on total satellite repeats. This small but significant decrease is consistent with reports, which show marginal decrease of H3K9me3 marks at pericentromeric heterochromatin upon loss of critical regulatory factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2012</xref>). For example, upon loss of Pax3 or Pax9, there is a temporary decrease in H3K9me3 at heterochromatin from which the cell recovers in a couple of generations. As a result, only a marginal reduction of H3K9me3 is observed at mouse major satellites after extended knockdown of these transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2012</xref>). While that is the case with knockdown of Pax3 and Pax9 individually, the results are very dramatic upon knocking down of Pax3 and Pax6 together, indicating cooperativity.</p><p>In addition, while the analysis H3K9me3 marks on total satellite repeats shows a small reduction, there is approximately a 50% reduction of this mark at specific telomeric (TAR1) and centromeric (SST1) repeats, indicating that the reduction of repressive marks could possibly be more pronounced at certain genomic loci as compared to others.</p><p><italic>2) Upon ORCA depletion, the authors found that the reduction of H3K9me3 peaks is localized in late replicating domains. However, we point out that most H3K9me3 sites are normally in late replicating domains and therefore the reduction must basically “mainly” affect late replication domains</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer completely.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p><italic>1) The effect of transcriptional activation on the LacI array (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2E</italic></xref> <italic>and associated supplemental figures) is very interesting, but is not easily reconciled with the evidence that ORCA binds G91 and Suv38H1 independently and directly (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1E</italic></xref><italic>). It may be that the direct interactions are very weak since the authors needed to use western blotting to detect them. If so, then the interactions may in fact be chromatin dependent in cells rather than just chromatin-influenced; the use of EtBr in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1D</italic></xref> <italic>doesn't sway me on this since those are all co-IPs from overproduced proteins. The interactions with purified proteins show that they proteins can interact directly, but</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2E</italic></xref> <italic>suggests that in cells any direct interaction is too weak to detect. The authors should make it clear what they mean in their interpretation of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2E</italic></xref>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer and we have modified the text and discussed the relevant results in the above-mentioned manner.</p><p><italic>2) Some parts of the figures are quite hard to read without major magnification. This is most common for graphs and some gels; should there be visible signal in the inputs in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5A</italic></xref><italic>? Also, what is “Hela S3 G1b 1” and “HeLa S3 S1 1”? I assume one is the control and one is the ORCA knockdown, but that's not said in the text or legends, and there is not enough information to interpret the replication timing graphs</italic>.</p><p>We apologize. We have now increased the font size of the labeling. We are also providing a better intensity image for 5A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p>Initial analysis of the available repli-seq dataset from various human cell lines in UCSC Genome Browser and ENCODE consortium revealed that the replication timing of large domains remain the same across cell lines. We therefore compared the H3K9me3 ChIP-seq data set to the HeLa repli-seq dataset. HeLa-S3 G1b and HeLa-S3 S1 are deep sequencing data sets for late G1 and early S replicating regions in HeLa-S3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>). The chromosomal regions that are replicating at these two stages are shown in black (early) and gray (late) along the length of the chromosome.</p><p>Using the dataset mentioned above, we examined the replication timing of the regions that showed reduction in H3K9me3 by ChIP-seq. On chromosome 19, the total H3K9me3 peaks in the control sample and the regions, which show greater than 5 fold decrease in H3K9me3 upon ORCA depletion are represented as black bars above the HeLa-S3 G1b and HeLa-S3 S1 tracks. Upon ORCA depletion, most of the affected H3K9me3 peaks resided in late replicating domains. This coupled with the loss of late replication patterns by BrdU IF in ORCA-depleted cells made us hypothesize that ORCA could also regulate the replication of late replicating regions.</p><p>We have included the above details in the text of the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
