The ganglioside (glycolipid) GM1 is thought to be the sole CT receptor; however, the mechanism by which CTB binding to GM1 mediates internalization of CT remains enigmatic. Here we report that CTB binds cell surface glycoproteins. Relative contributions of gangliosides and glycoproteins to CTB binding depend on cell type, and CTB binds primarily to glycoproteins in colonic epithelial cell lines. Using a metabolically incorporated photocrosslinking sugar, we identified one CTB-binding glycoprotein and demonstrated that the glycan portion of the molecule, not the protein, provides the CTB interaction motif. We further show that fucosylated structures promote CTB entry into a colonic epithelial cell line and subsequent host cell intoxication. CTB-binding fucosylated glycoproteins are present in normal human intestinal epithelia and could play a role in cholera.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09545.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09545.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09545.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cholera is a serious diarrheal disease that can be deadly if left untreated. It is caused by eating food, or drinking water, contaminated by the bacterium <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>. This bacterium can survive passage through the acidic conditions of the stomach. Inside the small intestine, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> attaches to the intestinal wall and starts producing cholera toxin. The toxin enters intestinal cells, causing them to release water and ions, including sodium and chloride ions. The salt-water environment created inside the intestine can, by osmosis, draw up to a further six liters of water into the intestine each day. This results in the copious production of watery diarrhea and severe dehydration.</p><p>Cholera toxin is composed of six protein subunits, including five copies of cholera toxin subunit B (CTB). CTB subunits help the uptake of the toxin by intestinal cells, and it has long been reported that CTB subunits attach to intestinal cells by binding to a cell surface molecule called GM1. CTB subunits have a high affinity for GM1, yet recent work suggests CTB may not bind exclusively to GM1; one or more additional cell surface molecules may be directly involved in cholera toxin uptake.</p><p>Wands et al. now reveal that numerous cell surface molecules are recognized by CTB, and that these molecules can assist cholera toxin uptake by host cells. Glycoproteins, proteins that are marked with sugar molecules, were shown to be the primary CTB binding sites on human colon cells, and it was the glycoprotein’s sugar component, not the protein itself, that interacted with CTB. Wands et al. discovered that in particular glycoproteins containing a sugar called fucose were largely responsible for CTB binding and toxin uptake. Together these findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism for cholera toxin entry into host cells, and suggest that fucose-containing or fucose-mimicking molecules could be developed as new treatments for cholera.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09545.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09545.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The bacterium <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> is the etiological agent of cholera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foster and Baron, 1996</xref>). Cholera toxin (CT) is secreted by <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and is the direct cause of the profuse, watery diarrhea that characterizes fatal cholera. CT is a heterohexamer comprising one copy of cholera toxin subunit A (CTA) and five copies of subunit B (CTB). Mechanistic studies have yielded the following model for how CT intoxicates host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sánchez and Holmgren, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lencer, 2003</xref>). The CTB subunits of the holotoxin bind receptors on the surface of host enterocytes, enabling endocytosis of CT. CT follows a retrograde trafficking pathway to the ER where it is disassembled to release CTA. CTA enters the cytoplasm and catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of the α-subunits of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (Gα<sub>s</sub>). The resulting extended activation of Gα<sub>s</sub> leads to increased activity of adenylate cyclase, raising intracellular cAMP levels. Elevated cAMP causes activation of chloride channels and chloride efflux, followed by massive secretion of water and ions into the intestinal lumen. Affected individuals can experience rapid and severe dehydration, sometimes leading to death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foster and Baron, 1996</xref>).</p><p>The initial and required step in host cell intoxication is recognition of cell surface receptors by CT. In the 1970s, the ganglioside GM1 was identified as a host cell receptor for CT. A role for gangliosides was first postulated when Van Heyningen <italic>et al.</italic> discovered that a lipid extract from the brain inhibited CT activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Heyningen et al., 1971</xref>); subsequently, multiple groups showed that purified gangliosides inhibited CT binding, with GM1 the most potent inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cuatrecasas, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holmgren et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">King and van Heyningen, 1973</xref>). To test whether GM1 could function as a receptor, exogenous GM1 was incorporated into host cell membranes, where it was shown to increase sensitivity to toxin, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cuatrecasas, 1973</xref>) even sensitizing toxin-resistant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moss et al., 1976</xref>). Holmgren and co-workers examined intestinal mucosa from several species and found that the extent of CT binding correlated with GM1 content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holmgren et al., 1975</xref>). Further, addition of exogenous GM1 to intestinal mucosa resulted in increased secretory activity in response to CT stimulation, implying that GM1 serves as a functional receptor. Recognition of GM1 occurs exclusively through the CTB subunit. Indeed, the high affinity CTB-GM1 interaction has been extensively characterized through binding assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuziemko et al., 1996</xref>) and x-ray crystallography analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Merritt et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>CTB is closely related to the B subunit of <italic>E. coli</italic> heat-labile toxin (LTB) at the levels of sequence, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dallas and Falkow, 1980</xref>) structure, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sixma et al., 1991</xref>) and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Spangler, 1992</xref>). While LTB is known to bind both GM1 and glycoprotein receptors, GM1 is commonly  described to be the sole host cell receptor recognized by CTB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foster and Baron, 1996</xref>). However, a variety of experimental approaches have pointed to the possibility that CTB may also recognize glycoproteins present on mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morita et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Monferran et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balanzino et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Platt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hansen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blank et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Day et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, CTB binding to cells does not uniformly parallel GM1 levels, implying the existence of additional CTB-binding molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Platt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yanagisawa, 2006</xref>). Moreover, GM1 binding does not always correlate with intoxication. For example, treatment of intestinal mucosa with <italic>V. cholerae</italic> sialidase yielded more GM1 but had no effect on toxin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holmgren et al., 1975</xref>). Also, a point mutant of CTB (H57A) was shown to maintain GM1 binding but the corresponding holotoxin did not intoxicate host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aman et al., 2001</xref>). Finally, a recent analysis of a normal human intestinal epithelia found that GM1 comprises only 0.01% of the glycosphingolipid content, raising the question of whether its concentration in enterocytes is sufficient to account for intoxication by CT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Breimer et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here we report that fucosylated molecules and glycoproteins are recognized by CTB and can function as receptors in host cell intoxication. Glycoproteins, not gangliosides, are responsible for the majority of CTB binding to human colonic epithelial cell lines. Using a metabolically incorporated photocrosslinking sugar analog, we isolated and identified one CTB-interacting glycoprotein, CEACAM5. The carbohydrate portion of the glycoprotein, not the amino acids, provides the CTB interaction motif. We show that fucose-containing glycans are recognized by CTB, resulting in internalization, the first step in host cell intoxication. Finally, we report evidence suggesting that fucosylated glycoconjugates recognized by CTB are present in normal human tissue. These results shed new light on mechanisms by which CT can enter and intoxicate host cells. In addition, the demonstration that CTB recognizes molecules other than GM1 has important implications for the interpretation of experiments where CTB is used to study the organization of lipids in the plasma membrane. Overall, these observations reveal a previously unrecognized, and potentially physiologically relevant, molecular mechanism for CT entry into epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GM1 is not required for CTB crosslinking in human colonic epithelial cell lines</title><p>Previously, we reported a cell-permeable precursor sugar (Ac<sub>4</sub>ManNDAz) that can be metabolized to a photocrosslinking sialic acid analog (SiaDAz) and incorporated into glycoconjugates – both glycoproteins and glycolipids – in place of natural sialic acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanaka and Kohler, 2008</xref>).

Appearance of the high molecular weight bands was dependent on both inclusion of Ac<sub>4</sub>ManNDAz and UV irradiation, suggesting that these bands also represent CTB crosslinked to sialylated molecules, but of much larger molecular weight than GM1. Surprised by the difference we observed between Jurkat and colonic epithelial cell lines, we also examined SiaDAz-mediated CTB crosslinking in two additional cell types, a human brain capillary endothelial cell line (hCMEC/D3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weksler, 2005</xref>) and a human bronchial epithelial cell line (HBEC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ramirez, 2004</xref>). In hCMEC/D3 cells, we observed both a complex with molecular weight consistent with CTB crosslinked to GM1, as well as a high molecular weight complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In HBECs, we also observed a complex consistent with CTB-GM1 crosslinking, as well as a faint higher molecular complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, CTB crosslinking patterns are cell type dependent, and CTB crosslinking to GM1 is not observed in all cell types.</p><p>We considered two possible explanations for the high molecular weight CTB crosslinked complex. One possibility was that the complex represented CTB crosslinked to GM1, or another glycolipid, but behaving as an aggregate in the SDS-PAGE analysis. The second possibility was that the complex represented CTB crosslinked to a sialylated glycoprotein. To distinguish between these possibilities and to determine which class of glycoconjugates was required for formation of the high molecular weight complex, we made use of small molecule inhibitors and a decoy substrate that specifically interfere with production of different classes of glycoconjugates. The colonic epithelial T84 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>) or Colo205 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) cell lines were therefore cultured with both Ac<sub>4</sub>ManNDAz and an inhibitor of glycosylation.

In contrast, culturing Jurkat cells with NB-DGJ completely eliminates formation of the CTB-GM1 crosslinked complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bond et al., 2010</xref>). These data imply that the high molecular weight band does not represent an aggregate of the CTB-GM1 crosslinked complex.</p><p>Next, we examined inhibitors of protein glycosylation. To test if <italic>N</italic>-linked protein glycosylation is required for CTB crosslinking, cells were cultured with either deoxymannojirimycin or kifunensine, small molecules that interfere with the maturation of <italic>N</italic>-linked glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fuhrmann et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elbein et al., 1990</xref>). Immature <italic>N-</italic>linked glycans will not contain SiaDAz and will be unable to engage in crosslinking. If the CTB crosslinked complex depends on <italic>N-</italic>linked protein glycosylation, then culturing cells with these inhibitors should reduce or eliminate the complex. We first confirmed the effectiveness of these inhibitors in T84 cells by observing a reduction in the apparent molecular weight of LAMP1, a protein with multiple sites of <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Likewise, in Colo205 cells, we observed increased binding of lectin concanavalin A (ConA), reflecting accumulation of immature high mannose structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Both deoxymannojirimycin and kifunensine caused subtle effects on the high molecular weight crosslinked CTB complexes, altering the intensities and increasing the apparent molecular weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>).

Benzyl-α-GalNAc also inhibited maturation of <italic>O</italic>-linked glycans  in Colo205 cells, demonstrated by the observed increase in binding of the lectin peanut agglutinin (PNA), which binds to the T-antigen disaccharide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Culturing either T84 or Colo205 cells with benzyl-α-GalNAc resulted in dramatic reductions in the intensity of the high molecular weight crosslinked complexes, suggesting that CTB crosslinks to glycoproteins bearing <italic>O</italic>-linked glycans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>). However, use of benzyl-α-GalNAc also resulted in the appearance of a new CTB-containing species at lower apparent molecular weight (∼100 kDa). Because appearance of the 100 kDa band was not dependent on the addition of Ac<sub>4</sub>ManNDAz, it does not represent crosslinking through SiaDAz, and may relate to the UV absorbance properties of the benzyl group in benzyl-α-GalNAc. Overall, the results of the inhibition experiments demonstrate that CTB crosslinks to glycoproteins, with both <italic>N</italic>-linked and <italic>O</italic>-linked glycans playing roles.</p><p>Because of the potential for small molecule inhibitors to exert unanticipated effects, we sought a second approach to gain insight into the role of glycoproteins in CTB crosslinking. We used Colo205 cells in which elongation of GalNAc-type <italic>O</italic>-linked glycans is blocked due to zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) targeting of <italic>C1GALT1C1</italic>, which encodes a chaperone required for biosynthesis of GalNAc-type O-linked glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Steentoft et al., 2011</xref>).

In contrast, culturing Jurkat cells with benzyl-α-GalNAc or kifunensine had no significant effect on CTB binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The inability of benzyl-α-GalNAc to affect CTB binding to Jurkat cells is consistent with the known <italic>O</italic>-linked glycosylation defect in these cells, caused by a frame-shift mutation in the gene encoding chaperone C1GALT1C1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ju and Cummings, 2002</xref>).

Because of difficulties associated with performing flow cytometry on the highly adherent T84 cells, CTB binding to the surface of T84 cells was measured by other methods. In the first approach, binding of biotin-labeled CTB to T84 monolayers was measured by an ELISA method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In the second approach, binding of Alexa Fluor 647-labeled CTB to clusters of cells was quantified by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). In the fluorescence microscopy approach, fluorescence was observed primarily to the outer surface of cell clusters, suggesting that Alexa Fluor 647-labeled CTB has limited access to the interior of the cell clusters, or that the CTB ligand is not displayed on the interior surface. Despite the differences in format, the results obtained by the ELISA and fluorescence microscopy methods were in agreement. NB-DGJ, the inhibitor of ganglioside biosynthesis, had no effect on CTB binding. Kifunensine, an inhibitor of <italic>N</italic>-linked  glycan maturation, resulted in only small effects on CTB binding. In contrast, culturing cells with benzyl-α-GalNAc, which blocks elaboration of <italic>O</italic>-linked  glycans, resulted in reductions in CTB binding in both assays. We conclude the glycoproteins are the dominant CTB binding partners in T84 cells and that gangliosides do not make a large contribution to CTB binding to T84 cells.</p><p>To measure CTB binding to Colo205 cells, we used flow cytometry. NB-DGJ treatment did not affect CTB binding to Colo205 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). However, in contrast to the results observed for T84 cells, benzyl-α-GalNAc did not cause a reduction in CTB binding to Colo205 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), nor did Colo205 cells lacking C1GALT1C1 show reduced CTB binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Instead, Colo205 cells cultured with the <italic>N</italic>-linked inhibitor kifunensine exhibited enhanced CTB binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), consistent with a small increase in SiaDAz crosslinking that kifunensine causes in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We considered the possibility that CTB binds to multiple classes of glycoconjugates in Colo205 cells. We cultured Colo205 cells with pairs of inhibitors and measured CTB binding. The only case where we observed decreased CTB binding was when the two protein glycosylation inhibitors – kifunensine and benzyl-α-GalNAc – were used together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In no case did culturing cells with NB-DGJ result in decreased CTB binding. Based on these data, we propose that CTB binds primarily to glycoproteins on Colo205 cells, with contributions from both <italic>N</italic>-linked and <italic>O</italic>-linked glycans. Gangliosides do not make a large contribution to CTB binding to Colo205 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>CTB interacts directly with glycoproteins, including CEACAM5</title><p>To demonstrate conclusively that CTB binds glycoproteins, we isolated crosslinked CTB complexes and used mass spectrometry to identify one of the crosslinked glycoproteins.

Biotinylated, crosslinked complexes were purified on streptavidin-agarose and subjected to trypsin digest, followed by LC-MS/MS analysis.

We tested whether either of these proteins were present in the CTB-glycoprotein crosslinked complex. Cells were cultured with Ac<sub>4</sub>ManNDAz, then incubated with CTB. After UV irradiation, the cells were lysed. Immunoprecipitation of CEACAM5 resulted in purification of the CTB crosslinked complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Similarly, immunoprecipitation performed with anti-CD44 resulted in purification of the CTB crosslinked complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We also performed immunoprecipitation with anti-CTB, which resulted in efficient purification of CEACAM5, but only weak purification of CD44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Notably, anti-CTB immunoprecipitated CEACAM5 even when the Ac<sub>4</sub>ManNDAz crosslinker was omitted, suggesting that the CTB-CEACAM5 interaction is relatively strong (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). Furthermore, the material purified by anti-CTB and recognized by anti-CEACAM5 had a slightly higher apparent molecular weight when the crosslinker was included than when it was omitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, we observe direct crosslinking between CTB and CEACAM5.

Epidemiological studies implicate variation among fucose-containing glycoconjugates in human susceptibility to cholera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barua and Paguio, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Swerdlow et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harris et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holmner et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, some glycan array binding experiments performed by the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG) suggest that fucosylated glycans can be recognized by CTB, albeit with lower avidity than GM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Consortium for Functional Glycomics, 2010</xref>). Importantly, fucose is not present in GM1, which is recognized by CTB through interactions with its terminal Neu5Ac and galactose residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Merritt et al., 1994</xref>). We therefore tested whether monosaccharides, including fucose, Neu5Ac, and galactose, could competitively inhibit CTB binding to different cell lines. We found that 100 mM Neu5Ac potently blocked CTB binding to Jurkat cells, while 100 mM galactose inhibited slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Other monosaccharides had no effect.

We also examined AAL and <italic>Lens culinaris</italic> agglutinin (LCA), which both recognize α1-6-fucosylated structures, although AAL has a broader substrate scope and also binds fucose in other linkages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kochibe and Furukawa, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matsumura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). AAL was able to block biotin-CTB binding, but LCA was not. We titrated the amount of lectins used in this blocking assay, while holding the biotin-CTB concentration constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). AAL, but not other lectins, blocked biotin-CTB binding to T84 cells in a concentration-dependent way. We used flow cytometry to test the ability of lectins to block CTB binding to Colo205 cells. Colo205 cells were first incubated with lectin, then CTB was added. Similar to what we observed for T84 cells, AAL effectively blocked CTB binding, while other lectins had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). AAL blocked CTB binding to Colo205 cells in a concentration-dependent way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), and when free fucose was included during the AAL pre-incubation, AAL was no longer able to block CTB binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). While AAL effectively blocked CTB binding to both T84 and Colo205 cells, this fucose-recognizing lectin was not able to block biotin-CTB binding to Jurkat T cells, even when used in excess over toxin concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Taken together, results from lectin blocking experiments are consistent with the idea that CTB binds fucosylated structures on the surface of colonic epithelial cell lines, while fucosylated structures do not contribute significantly to CTB binding to Jurkat cells. In contrast, neither MAL-II, which recognizes α2-3-linked sialic acid, nor <italic>Sambucus nigra</italic> lectin (SNA), which recognizes α2-6-linked sialic acid, affected biotin-CTB binding to colonic epithelial cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09545.018</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title><italic>Aleuria aurantia</italic> lectin (AAL) blocks CTB binding to human colonic epithelial cell lines.</title><p>(<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>) T84 cells were incubated with 40 µg/mL of the indicated lectin, then variable concentrations of CTB were added.

As the 2F-Fuc concentration increased, reduced amounts of the CTB-glycoprotein crosslinked complex were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>), indicating that fucosylation is required for SiaDAz-dependent CTB crosslinking to glycoproteins. Next, we assessed whether fucosylation was required for the direct interaction between CTB and CEACAM5. T84 cells were cultured with Ac<sub>4</sub>ManNDAz and 2F-Fuc, then crosslinking to CTB was performed. CEACAM5 was isolated by immunoprecipitation and probed with anti-CTB to assess CTB-CEACAM5 crosslinking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Less crosslinked CTB-CEACAM5 was observed when fucosylation was inhibited. One possible explanation for this result is that the CEACAM5-CTB interaction is mediated by a fucosylated glycan.

First, we confirmed the effectiveness of 2F-Fuc to reduce cell surface fucose in T84 cells by showing that it caused a reduction in binding of UEA-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Then, T84 cells were cultured with or without inhibitory concentrations of 2F-Fuc, followed by incubation with increasing concentrations of biotin-CTB. The amount of biotin-CTB bound to the cell surface was measured by an ELISA method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Inhibition of fucosylation reduced the plateau value for biotin-CTB binding to T84 cells. We also used fluorescence microscopy to measure binding of Alexa Fluor 647-labeled CTB to T84 cells cultured with or without 2F-Fuc. Cells cultured with the fucosylation inhibitor displayed a reduction in Alexa Fluor 647-CTB binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). Similarly, Colo205 cells were cultured with 2F-Fuc and CTB binding was measured by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Inhibition of fucosylation reduced CTB binding to Colo205 cells, too. In contrast, Colo205 cells cultured with a sialylation inhibitor, 3F-NeuAc, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rillahan et al., 2012</xref>) displayed enhanced binding to CTB, consistent with a small increase in binding of a fucose-recognizing lectin that also occurs with inhibition of sialylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>). We conclude that recognition of fucosylated structures is an important and general mechanism for CTB binding to colonic epithelial cells. The data regarding sialylation are less clear-cut and additional experiments will be required to determine whether sialic acids are components of the glycan motifs that CTB recognizes on colonic epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Fucosylation and protein glycosylation mediate CTB internalization and host cell intoxication</title><p>Having discovered that fucosylation and protein glycosylation are important factors mediating CTB binding on the surface of colonic epithelial cell lines, we next tested whether fucosylated glycoproteins were involved in the mechanism by which CT intoxicates host cells. We used an in-cell ELISA method to measure the effects of inhibitors of glycosylation on the uptake of biotin-CTB by T84 cells. Cells were first cultured with glycosylation inhibitors, as described above. To quantify internalized biotin-CTB, cells were incubated in the presence of biotin-CTB at 37°C for the indicated times, then unbound biotin-CTB was washed away and the cells were rapidly cooled to 4°C to arrest internalization. Remaining surface-bound biotin-CTB was blocked with avidin, and also removed by acid washing. After permeabilizing cells, internalized biotin-CTB was measured by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Total surface bound biotin-CTB was simultaneously assessed by maintaining control cells at 4°C (no endocytosis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>) and yielded values consistent with other measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D,E</xref>). The amount of biotin-CTB internalized by cells treated with NB-DGJ was indistinguishable from that observed for control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), suggesting that gangliosides do not mediate the majority of biotin-CTB internalization. Kifunensine caused a slight enhancement in internalization, suggesting that <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation of proteins might serve as an impediment to CTB internalization. Culturing cells with either benzyl-α-GalNAc or 2F-Fuc each nearly abolished internalization, implying that fucosylated and/or <italic>O</italic>-linked glycoproteins may play functional roles in biotin-CTB internalization.<fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09545.023</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Fucosylation mediates CT internalization and intoxication in a human colonic epithelial cell line.</title><p>(<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>) Internalized biotin-CTB for vehicle-, NB-DGJ-, and kifunensine-treated cells and vehicle-, benzyl-α-GalNAc-, and 2F-Fuc-treated cells are displayed as a function of time.

T84 cells were cultured in monolayers in the presence of glycosylation inhibitors. First, we evaluated whether inhibitors of glycosylation caused off-target effects on adenylate cyclase activity. Indeed, both benzyl-α-GalNAc and kifunensine caused reductions in the amount of cAMP that accumulated in response to stimulation with forskolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2A</xref>), and with vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2B</xref>), and similarly reduced cAMP accumulation in response to CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2C</xref>). While the effects of benzyl-α-GalNAc and kifunensine on adenylate cyclase activity make it difficult to interpret how these inhibitors modulate CT intoxication, interpreting the effects of NB-DGJ and 2F-Fuc is more straightforward since neither affected cAMP accumulation in response to forskolin or VIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>).</p><p>CT holotoxin was incubated with cells at 37°C for 1 hr, then cAMP accumulation was measured. 2F-Fuc treatment resulted in dramatically decreased accumulation of cAMP, while treatment with NB-DGJ had a more moderate effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Thus, host cell fucosylation is important for intoxication by CT. Since 2F-Fuc treatment also causes reduced CTB binding and cell entry, the most likely explanation for this result is that reduced fucosylation leads to less CT entering cells, and thereby reduces host cell intoxication. In contrast, NB-DGJ does not dramatically affect CTB binding or internalization, so the explanation for this result is less clear. One possibility is that there is a small amount of GM1 in the cells, which is capable of mediating host cell intoxication via pathway that operates in parallel to the fucosylated glycoproteins. A second possibility is that GM1 is not required for the initial steps of CT binding and internalization, but is required for later steps in intoxication. A final possibility is that GM1 is not essential, but other glucosylceramide glycolipids, which are also reduced due to NB-DGJ treatment, play roles in the trafficking and intoxication process. Notably, CT intoxication appeared to be sensitive to brefeldin A in both untreated cells and in cells that were cultured with NB-DGJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3</xref>), implying that in both cases, CT intoxication of host cells occurs via retrograde transport through the secretory pathway, consistent with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lencer, 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>CTB recognizes fucosylation and glycoproteins in normal gut epithelia</title><p>The results implicating fucosylation and protein glycosylation in CTB binding and internalization are unexpected since the ganglioside GM1 is generally accepted to be the sole receptor for CT. The experiments reported here were performed in T84 and Colo205 cell lines, both colorectal cancer cell lines. While T84 cells are widely used as a model for host cell intoxication by CT, we wondered whether fucosylation and protein glycosylation might also function in CTB binding to normal colonic epithelial cells. To investigate, we used a human colonic epithelial cell line (HCEC) derived from normal human colon cells and immortalized by expression of Cdk4 and hTERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roig et al., 2010</xref>). HCEC cells were cultured with inhibitors of glycosylation (NB-DGJ, kifunensine, benzyl-α-GalNAc, or 2F-Fuc), then CTB binding was measured by an in-cell ELISA method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). CTB binding to HCECs was low overall and unaffected by culturing the cells with either kifunensine or NB-DGJ. Culturing HCECs with benzyl-α-GalNAc resulted in an increase in CTB binding, while culturing HCECs with 2F-Fuc resulted in a decrease in CTB binding. These results suggest that GM1 is not an important determinant for CTB binding to HCECs, and point to a contribution from fucosylated structures, potentially displayed on glycoproteins.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09545.027</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>CTB binds fucosylated glycoproteins present in normal gut epithelia.</title><p>(<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>) HCEC cells were cultured with inhibitors of glycosylation.

In contrast, in the Jurkat T cell line, GM1 is the main CTB binding ligand. Further, the results presented here implicate glycoproteins as functional receptors that can mediate toxin internalization. Our findings are in conflict with dogma, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foster and Baron, 1996</xref>) but not inconsistent with previous results. The earliest studies identifying GM1 as the CT receptor were based on inhibition assays and gain-of-function experiments. Indeed, CTB binds GM1 with high affinity, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuziemko et al., 1996</xref>) so it is not surprising that GM1 is an effective inhibitor of CTB binding and that adding GM1 to cells leads to enhanced CTB binding. However, experimentally addressing how loss of GM1 affects CTB binding and host cell intoxication has been more difficult. Use of selective inhibitors of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis allowed two groups to observe that a portion of CTB binding is GM1-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Platt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blank et al., 2007</xref>). Our data extend this observation, showing that CTB binding is mostly GM1-independent in cell types more closely related to the physiological site of CT action. Further, we report evidence that CTB binds directly to glycoproteins, relying on glycan recognition motifs. Our observation that inhibition of ganglioside biosynthesis does not affect CTB binding to colonic epithelial cell lines is consistent with the low level of GM1 in these cells. Similarly, the normal human intestinal epithelia contains very little GM1, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Breimer et al., 2012</xref>) suggesting that glycoproteins could be important contributors to CTB binding during <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> infection.</p><p>In addition to its critical role in human disease, host cell intoxication by CT is an important model system for studying endocytic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chinnapen et al., 2007</xref>). CT has been shown to enter cells through both clathrin- and caveolin-dependent mechanisms, as well a clathrin- and caveolin-independent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Orlandi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Torgersen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Massol, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Howes et al., 2010</xref>). Studies to identify the dominant endocytic mechanism have yielded variable results, raising the possibility that CT uses different endocytic mechanisms to enter different cell lines. The existence of multiple glycoprotein receptors provides a plausible explanation for the use of multiple endocytic pathways and for cell type differences. The exact structure of the glycan might also play a functional role in the endocytic mechanism, as modification of proteins with a GM1 ganglioside is sufficient to engender CT binding, but not host cell intoxication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pacuszka and Fishman, 1990</xref>). In addition, a long-standing conundrum about CT internalization is how binding to GM1 located in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane can trigger endocytosis. Our results show that CTB can bind glycoproteins, offering a possible mechanism for receptor-mediated endocytosis.</p><p>While we show that CEACAM5 binds directly to CTB through a glycan-dependent interaction, it seems unlikely that CEACAM5 is an important physiological receptor for CT. Our detection of CEACAM5 in T84 cells likely reflects the increased CEACAM5 expression and altered CEACAM5 glycosylation often found in colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saeland et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, while <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation is critical for the CTB-CEACAM5 interaction, the majority of CTB binding to T84 cells depends on <italic>O</italic>-linked glycosylation of proteins. Another protein previously reported to interact with CTB in pig enterocytes is sucrase-isomaltase (SI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hansen et al., 2005</xref>); however, we did not detect any peptides corresponding to SI in our proteomics analysis of the CTB crosslinked complex. Intriguingly, though, SI is subject to GalNAc-type <italic>O</italic>-linked glycosylation, which controls its association with detergent-insoluble membrane microdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alfalah et al., 1999</xref>). We speculate that certain GalNAc-type <italic>O</italic>-linked glycans may serve as determinants for both CTB recognition and membrane microdomain targeting, potentially explaining why CTB binding fractionates with detergent-insoluble material, an observation that is typically interpreted to result from the binding of CTB to GM1.</p><p>The demonstration that glycoproteins can be important contributors to CTB binding has implications for the use of CTB to study the organization of lipids in the plasma membrane. Indeed, differences in observed diffusion rates for bound CTB may reflect the identity of the CTB ligand, rather than the fluidity of the membrane in which it resides. Day and Kenworthy noticed that CTB bound to COS-7 cells diffused surprisingly slowly for a lipid-bound protein and speculated that an interaction with a protein might slow its diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Day et al., 2012</xref>). Our results predict that CTB diffusion rates will differ in different cell types, with rapid diffusion in GM1-rich cell lines, like Jurkat cells, and slower diffusion in GM1-deficient cell lines, such as T84 and Colo205 cells.</p><p>The functional assays reported here do not directly address whether glycoproteins serve as functional CT receptors in the normal human gut. However, a consistent theme among the results reported here is that fucose plays an important role in CTB binding, both to cell lines and ex vivo to freshly isolated human epithelial cells. While the lectin blocking studies demonstrate overlap among the sets of glycans recognized by AAL and CTB, additional work is needed to determine the exact structure of the fucosylated glycans to which CTB prefers to bind. More broadly, identification of fucose as an important determinant of CTB binding adds to a growing body of literature that implicates fucose in host-microbe discourse in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pacheco et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pickard et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate that fucosylated glycoproteins mediate a large portion of CTB binding to human colonic epithelial cell lines, that fucosylated glycoproteins play an important role in the mechanism by which CTB enters T84 cells, and that entry of CT into T84 cells via a fucose-dependent mechanism is on-pathway to host cell intoxication. These findings raise the possibility that fucose-containing or -mimicking molecules may have utility in cholera therapy. In addition, the observation that CTB binds to cell surface molecules other than GM1 implies that caution should be applied in the interpretation of experiments where CTB is used to visualize membrane microdomain structures.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>General</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Chemicals</title><p>Ac<sub>4</sub>ManNDAz was synthesized in very good purity according to TLC and <sup>1</sup>H-NMR as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanaka and Kohler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bond et al., 2009</xref>).

The antibodies used were anti-CD45 - APC-H7 (clone 2D1, BD), anti-EpCAM - Alexa Flur 488 (clone 9C4, BioLegend, San Diego, CA), and the protein CTB - Alexa Fluor 647 (C34778, Invitrogen). Some samples were stained in the presence of l-fucose (F2252, Sigma-Aldrich), d-galactose (G0750, Sigma-Aldrich), or d-glucose (G8270, Sigma-Aldrich). The staining cocktail was then preincubated for 5 min before addition to the cells. After staining, the cells were washed and analyzed on a flow cytometer (LSR-II, BD) and the results were analyzed using the FlowJo software.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the assistance of the UT Southwestern Live Cell Imaging Facility, a Shared Resource of the Harold C Simmons Cancer Center.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this report, the authors challenge the widely accepted view that ganglioside GM1 is the glycan ligand of cholera toxin (CT), enabling CT to enter and intoxicate intestinal cells. GM1 is indeed the highest affinity glycan ligand of CT, and is known to support CTA entry into host cells in model systems. But the apparent lack of this ligand on gut epithelial cells has raised the possibility that other weaker avidity ligands mediate CT entry and intoxication. Here, using a method involving metabolic labeling of cells to contain UV reactive sialic acids that crosslink glycan ligands to CT, the authors present compelling evidence that glycoproteins can bind CTB on the surface of the intestinal epithelial cell lines and mediate toxin uptake by endocytosis. There is, however, incomplete evidence that the glycoprotein receptors can mediate intoxication. Clear evidence is presented for fucosylated ligands to mediate CTB binding, and depending on the intestinal cell line O-linked glycans (T84) or both O-linked and N-linked glycans (Colo205) can carry ligands for CT.</p><p>The manuscript from Wands et al. investigates binding of cholera toxin to a number of different cell lines, some of which do not express detectable amounts of GM1, the most widely recognized receptor for cholera toxin. The authors cite previous studies indicating that GM1 may not be the sole cell surface receptor for cholera toxin. However, these alternative glycoprotein receptors have not been characterized, nor is it known whether N-linked or O-linked oligosaccharides are the ligands that bind the toxin. The authors use a diverse set of experimental tools (photoactivatable sugars, glycosylation inhibitors, lectins and monosaccharides, etc.) to document binding of cholera toxin to N-linked and O-linked glycans on cell surface glycoproteins, apparently via terminal fucose residues. The effort to extend this conclusion to normal gut epithelia yielded results that were less conclusive. While fucosylated protein-linked oligosaccharides may contribute to cholera toxin binding, they do not appear to be the only class of receptor. Overall, this manuscript makes a significant contribution towards characterizing glycoprotein receptors for cholera toxin on human cells.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The text does not mention extensive glycan array data obtained by the Consortium for Functional Glycomics by several investigators, including detailed studies titrating CT on the array from nanogram to 100 microgram (The data can be accessed at http://www.functionalglycomics.org/glycomics). This data shows that fucosylated ligands are lower avidity ligands of CT. This glycan array data has not been published, so it does not detract from this manuscript's evidence that terminal fucose residues contribute to cholera toxin binding. The glycan array data has been presented at numerous public meetings as an example of the power of glycan arrays to detect lower avidity ligands. It would be good to cite the glycan array data in some way since it supports the use of fucosyltransferase inhibitors.</p><p>2) The use of Ac<sub>4</sub>ManNDAz that introduces a photoactivatable group into cell surface sialic acids implies that the glycan ligands also contain sialic acid, otherwise, how do you account for crosslinking? But the authors conclude that sialic acids are not involved? The inability of lectins to block CT binding is a negative experiment, and is weak evidence at best that sialic acids are not involved. Have the authors tried the sialyltransferase inhibitor 3F-NeuAc? It is likely that the functional ligand of CT contains both sialic acid and fucose?</p><p>3) The text often includes statements that overstate the results. For example the text states that fucose is critical for cholera toxin binding, in reference to an experiment where a fucose inhibitor causes a 2-fold reduction in binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Given that binding of UEA-1 is entirely blocked, the authors need to consider the possibility that fucose-deficient oligosaccharides may also be recognized by CT. In this regard, the authors should test whether galactose has inhibitor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Also, GM1 does not contain fucose.</p><p>4) The authors need to provide additional information about the internalization experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and Figure 7—figure supplement 1. The confusing issue here is the effect of inhibitors on total cell-surface binding of CT (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). A previous figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) showed that 2F-Fuc causes a ∼2-fold reduction in CT binding to T84 cells and Colo205 cells. Benzyl-α-GalNAc treatment also caused a ∼2-fold reduction in CT binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). Figure 7—figure supplement 1, shows that these compounds cause only a mild reduction in cell surface binding, but instead reduce internalization. Were the earlier binding assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) done under conditions that allowed internalization? If so, this distinction needs to be clearly stated in the manuscript. Does the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> only monitor internalization of CT molecules that are not bound to fucosylated proteins (+2F-Fuc)?</p><p>5) The evidence against the presence of GM1 in intestinal cell membranes is weak. This is an important point for the paper's central thesis as it underlies the interpretation of the functional studies for the glycoprotein receptors for CTB. Several studies show GM1 in intestinal cells (Critchley et al. 1981, J Biol Chem 256: 8724-8731 as an example), so the lack of detection in this paper is unexpected. The result might be explained by the low level of GM1 in intestinal cells coupled with the relatively insensitive approach used in this paper to detect the gangliosides (resorcinol stain). The authors should re-examine these studies by making use of &quot;far-western&quot; toxin blots of TLC plates as described (Magnani et al. 1980, Anal Biochem 109:399-402 and Critchley et al. 1981, J Biol Chem 256: 8724-8731 as examples).</p><p>6) Are cell surface glycoproteins functional receptors for CT? This would be a most important discovery with major implications to the fields of toxin and cell and membrane biology. It would imply that a cell surface membrane protein can traffic retrograde through the endosome/Golgi network all the way to the ER – a very unusual event (I cannot think of an example). Almost all toxins and viruses that use the ER to enter host cells bind glycosphingolipids. Ricin, an &quot;apparent possible&quot; exception, binds highly promiscuously to membrane components containing galactose – so its trafficking receptor is not well defined and may well be the glycosphingolipids.</p><p>7) The evidence that glycoproteins are acting as functional trafficking receptors leading to toxicity for cholera toxin is also weak. It is based entirely on use of the chemical inhibitors of glycan synthesis which undoubtedly have off-target effects. And the experiment that tests the idea lacks controls for off-target inhibition of adenylyl cyclase or its coupling to Gs (a frequent event with chemical inhibitors). These studies need to be reproduced using the Gs agonist vasointestinal peptide (VIP) and forskolin to measure maximal adenylyl cyclase activity under each condition – and compared directly with the toxin-induced signals (or calculated as a ratio).</p><p>It is also necessary to explain the result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> that NB-DGJ inhibits CT toxicity in intestinal cells – what is explanation for this if the cells lack GM1 gangliosides?</p><p>8) The intoxication experiments included several puzzling results. Why does kifunensine treatment enhance internalization, but reduce intoxication? Why does NB-DGJ treatment reduce intoxication if the T84 cells do not synthesize detectable amounts of gangliosides including GM1? The possibility that multiple steps in intoxication are sensitive to perturbation of oligosaccharide biosynthesis weakens the conclusion that fucosylated oligosaccharides are the most critical receptor.</p><p>9) Examine the intestinal cell lines for GM1 by ligand blot of TLC plates using radiolabeled or HRP-labeled CT beta-subunit or other mass spectrometry methods after treatment with ganglioside inhibitors(s) (NB-DGJ) to show complete loss of GM1. Test for toxicity (or retrograde trafficking into the ER) after showing complete loss of GM1 expression by treatment with NB-DGJ (or other inhibitor of ganglioside sphingolipid synthesis). Toxicity in those intestinal cells lacking GM1 should also be shown to be sensitive to brefeldin A (will block retrograde transport to ER and provide additional control unrelated to GM1).</p><p>It is also necessary to explain the result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> that NB-DGJ inhibits CT toxicity in intestinal cells – what is explanation for this if the cells lack GM1 gangliosides?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09545.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>In this report, the authors challenge the widely accepted view that ganglioside GM1 is the glycan ligand of cholera toxin (CT), enabling CT to enter and intoxicate intestinal cells.

Based on the reviewers’ comments, we focused our revision on the following points: 1) using more sensitive detection methods to confirm that GM1 levels in the intestinal epithelial cell lines were indeed low and to validate that the NB-DGJ concentration we chose to use for our assays was effective, 2) assessing contributions that sugars other than L-fucose play in glycoprotein recognition by CTB, and 3) evaluating off-target effects that glycosylation inhibitors exert on cAMP accumulation.</p><p><italic>1) The text does not mention extensive glycan array data obtained by the Consortium for Functional Glycomics by several investigators, including detailed studies titrating CT on the array from nanogram to 100 microgram (The data can be accessed at http://www.functionalglycomics.org/glycomics).

Indeed, examination of the CFG microarray data played an essential role in our decision to test whether fucose contributes to cholera toxin binding. We omitted this fact in the original submission because the CFG data contains some conflicting results for different trials of CTB binding. Nonetheless, we now acknowledge the essential role of the CFG data by citing the CFG website in the revised submission.<italic>2) The use of Ac<sub>4</sub>ManNDAz that introduces a photoactivatable group into cell surface sialic acids implies that the glycan ligands also contain sialic acid, otherwise, how do you account for crosslinking? But the authors conclude that sialic acids are not involved? The inability of lectins to block CT binding is a negative experiment, and is weak evidence at best that sialic acids are not involved. Have the authors tried the sialyltransferase inhibitor 3F-NeuAc? It is likely that the functional ligand of CT contains both sialic acid and fucose?</italic></p><p>The reviewers point out that the SiaDAz crosslinking data imply that CTB is capable of recognizing sialylated glycoproteins, raising the question of whether sialic acid is required for CTB recognition of glycoproteins. With respect to the crosslinking data, one possible interpretation is that sialic acid is not required, but can fortuitously capture some interactions through proximity to the preferred fucosylated ligand. Thus, additional experiments are required to assess the role of sialylation. As suggested, we used the sialyltransferase inhibitor 3F-NeuAc to assess whether sialylation is required for CTB binding to Colo205 cells. (Note that we cannot use 3F-NeuAc in crosslinking experiments because it would be expected to block SiaDAz incorporation.) We observed that inhibition of sialylation resulted in slightly <italic>increased</italic> binding to CTB, consistent with a slight increase in binding of a fucose-recognizing lectin that also occurs with inhibition of sialylation (new data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We also attempted to use 3F-NeuAc to assess the role of sialylation in CTB binding to T84 cells, but did not observe inhibition of sialylation at the 3F-NeuAc concentrations tested. Finally, we tested whether free Neu5Ac could inhibit binding to colonic epithelial cell lines. We found that Neu5Ac strongly inhibited CTB binding to T84 cells (new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>), but only slightly inhibited CTB binding to Colo205 cells (new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,G</xref>). Based on these data and the lectin data shown in the previous submission (now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>), we cannot make a definitive conclusion regarding a role for sialic acid in CTB binding to colonic epithelial cell lines. Since the role of sialylation is not central to the main conclusions of the current manuscript, we chose to curtail these experiments and moderated our language in the manuscript regarding the role of sialylation in binding of CTB to glycoproteins in these cell lines. We will continue to pursue understanding the role of sialylation in future work.</p><p>As a side note, the fact that inhibition of sialylation results in increased binding of CTB to Colo205 cells is an additional piece of evidence suggesting that GM1 is not the dominant CTB ligand on Colo205 cells.</p><p><italic>3) The text often includes statements that overstate the results. For example the text states that fucose is critical for cholera toxin binding, in reference to an experiment where a fucose inhibitor causes a 2-fold reduction in binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Given that binding of UEA-1 is entirely blocked, the authors need to consider the possibility that fucose-deficient oligosaccharides may also be recognized by CT. In this regard, the authors should test whether galactose has inhibitor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Also, GM1 does not contain fucose.</italic></p><p>We edited the manuscript to modulate statements about the role of fucose in CTB binding. We wished to emphasize the fact the 2F-Fuc inhibitor caused a substantial decrease in CTB binding, but did not intend to imply that every CTB ligand contains fucose. Indeed, we agree with the reviewers’ proposal that multiple ligands, including fucose-deficient glycans, could contribute to CTB binding. In line with the reviewers’ suggestion, we tested additional monosaccharides to attempt to identify other structures recognized by CTB. For Colo205 cells, fucose was the most potent inhibitor. Galactose and Neu5Ac inhibited moderately, while glucose, GlcNAc, and GalNAc did not inhibit CTB binding (new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–H</xref>). For T84 cells, both fucose and Neu5Ac were strong inhibitors, galactose inhibited slightly, and glucose, GlcNAc, and GalNAc did not inhibit (new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>). Finally, for primary intestinal epithelial cells, fucose inhibits CTB binding, but glucose and galactose do not inhibit (new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). Thus, fucose was the only monosaccharide that potently inhibited CTB binding to both colonic epithelial cell lines and to primary cells, distinguishing this cell type from the Jurkat cell line where fucose does not inhibit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Other monosaccharides, namely Neu5Ac and galactose, showed variable and/or weaker inhibition on colonic epithelial cells, a fact that we now point out in the text.</p><p><italic>4) The authors need to provide additional information about the internalization experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and Figure 7—figure supplement 1. The confusing issue here is the effect of inhibitors on total cell-surface binding of CT (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). A previous figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) showed that 2F-Fuc causes a ∼2-fold reduction in CT binding to T84 cells and Colo205 cells. Benzyl-α-GalNAc treatment also caused a ∼2-fold reduction in CT binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). Figure 7—figure supplement 1, shows that these compounds cause only a mild reduction in cell surface binding, but instead reduce internalization. Were the earlier binding assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) done under conditions that allowed internalization? If so, this distinction needs to be clearly stated in the manuscript. Does the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> only monitor internalization of CT molecules that are not bound to fucosylated proteins (+2F-Fuc)?</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for calling our attention to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, which allowed us to identify a problem in the data reported in the initial submission, as outlined below. First, to be clear, the binding assays reported in the earlier figures (formerly <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> in the revised manuscript) were performed at 4°C, conditions that did not allow CTB internalization. The problem we identified was in the data initially reported as Figure 7—figure supplement 1, showing the total binding of CTB to T84 cells, as measured by ELISA. The incubation times used for this experiment resulted in strong OPD signals that fell outside the linear range of detection. These skewed values diminished the differences in CTB binding for the different glycosylation inhibitors. Further, these values for total CTB binding were also used, together with measurements of internalized CTB, to calculate internalization efficiencies, shown in the previous version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Thus, the internalization efficiency plots were also inaccurate. In the revision, we have modified the experimental protocol to avoid saturating OPD signals, so that we accurately measure total CTB binding in this experiment. These results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref> and are now consistent with the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. We now report the amount of internalized CTB in the main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>. Notably, little to no CTB was internalized when either fucosylation or O-linked glycosylation was inhibited. In answer to the reviewers’ question, any CTB that is internalized when cells are cultured with 2F-Fuc could reflect CTB molecules that are not bound to fucosylated proteins, or possibly CTB bound to a small amount of fucosylated proteins that might remain present even with 2F-Fuc inhibition. Finally, in the revised manuscript, we chose not to show calculated internalization efficiencies (internalized CTB divided by total CTB bound), out of concern that the low amount of total CTB bound under some conditions could comprise the accuracy of these calculations. Based on these results, the main conclusions for internalization experiments are that inhibition of fucosylation and of O-linked glycosylation each result in a dramatic reduction in the amount of CTB that enters cells, and that NB-DGJ treatment does not substantially affect CTB internalization. The text has been modified to more clearly state these conclusions.<italic>5) The evidence against the presence of GM1 in intestinal cell membranes is weak. This is an important point for the paper's central thesis as it underlies the interpretation of the functional studies for the glycoprotein receptors for CTB. Several studies show GM1 in intestinal cells (Critchley et al. 1981, J Biol Chem, 256: 8724-8731 as example), so the lack of detection in this paper is unexpected. The result might be explained by the low level of GM1 in intestinal cells coupled with the relatively insensitive approach used in this paper to detect the gangliosides (resorcinol stain). The authors should re-examine these studies by making use of &quot;far-western&quot; toxin blots of TLC plates as described (Magnani et al. 1980, Anal Biochem 109:399-402 and Critchley et al. 1981, J Biol Chem 256: 8724-8731 as examples).</italic></p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we pursued the more sensitive technique of using <sup>125</sup>I-labeled CTB to probe TLC plates in an attempt to detect GM1 in Colo205 and T84 cells. To perform these experiments, we enlisted the help of Susann Teneberg (University of Gothenburg), an expert in the practice of this technique specifically and in glycolipid analysis in general. Even with the use of this sensitive detection method, GM1 was not detectable in either Colo205 or T84 extracts (new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These experiments do not formally exclude the possibility that GM1 may be present in Colo205 or T84 cells, but they greatly reduce the upper limit for the amount of GM1 in the cell lines.</p><p>TLCs of the extracts were also probed with <sup>125</sup>I-labeled <italic>E. cristagalli</italic> lectin, revealing a single reactive species in T84 cells, likely corresponding to neolactotetraosylceramide (Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer; new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This band was absent from T84 cells cultured with NB-DGJ, confirming the effectiveness of the NB-DGJ inhibitor at blocking production of glucosylceramide glycolipids. Thus, even if some GM1 is present in T84 cells, it is reasonable to assume that this level is further reduced by culturing the cells with NB-DGJ.</p><p><italic>6) Are cell surface glycoproteins functional receptors for CT? This would be a most important discovery with major implications to the fields of toxin and cell and membrane biology. It would imply that a cell surface membrane protein can traffic retrograde through the endosome/Golgi network all the way to the ER – a very unusual event (I cannot think of an example). Almost all toxins and viruses that use the ER to enter host cells bind glycosphingolipids. Ricin, an &quot;apparent possible&quot; exception, binds highly promiscuously to membrane components containing galactose – so its trafficking receptor is not well defined and may well be the glycosphingolipids.</italic></p><p>We propose that cell surface glycoproteins are functional CT receptors in the sense that they enable CT to enter the cell via a pathway that leads to host cell intoxication. However, we recognize that the mechanism of host cell intoxication by CT includes multiple steps. The data we report in the manuscript demonstrate (1) that fucosylated glycoproteins mediate a large fraction of CTB binding to T84 and Colo205 cells, (2) that fucosylated glycoproteins play an important role in the mechanism by which CTB enters T84 cells, and (3) that entry of CT into T84 cells via a fucose-dependent mechanism is on-pathway to host cell intoxication. However, these data do not exclude the possibility that CT might also enter cells via additional mechanisms, a point that we attempted to make more clearly in the revised manuscript. Further, once CT enters cells, we do not know whether it remains bound to fucosylated glycoproteins. CT might be handed off to other molecules for further trafficking steps. Indeed, GM1 could play role in these later trafficking steps, consistent with our observation that NB-DGJ treatment does not affect CTB entry, but does reduce host cell intoxication. In addition, others have reported that the C-terminal KDEL on CTA can enhance the efficiency of host cell intoxication through interactions with the KDEL receptor that mediate retrograde trafficking (for example, see J. Cell Biol. 131: 951-962), providing a potential mechanism for CT to traffic to the ER. We revised the manuscript to make clear that the data reported in this manuscript do not report directly on the trafficking steps that occur after CT enters the host cell, and to point out that CT might exploit multiple parallel pathways for host cell intoxication. We plan to explore whether fucosylated glycoproteins remain associated with CT throughout later trafficking steps, but feel that these studies are beyond the scope of the current manuscript.<italic>7) The evidence that glycoproteins are acting as functional trafficking receptors leading to toxicity for cholera toxin is also weak. It is based entirely on use of the chemical inhibitors of glycan synthesis which undoubtedly have off-target effects. And the experiment that tests the idea lacks controls for off-target inhibition of adenylyl cyclase or its coupling to Gs (a frequent event with chemical inhibitors). These studies need to be reproduced using the Gs agonist vasointestinal peptide (VIP) and forskolin to measure maximal adenylyl cyclase activity under each condition – and compared directly with the toxin-induced signals (or calculated as a ratio).</italic></p><p><italic>It is also necessary to explain the result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> that NB-DGJ inhibits CT toxicity in intestinal cells – what is explanation for this if the cells lack GM1 gangliosides?</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing up this point, as the suggested experiments helped to clarify interpretation of our data. As proposed, we tested whether the inhibitors of glycosylation affected activation of adenylyl cyclase activity by VIP and forskolin. Both kifunensine and benzyl-α-GalNAc caused reduced activation of adenylyl cyclase activity by both VIP and forskolin (new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, we feel that we cannot interpret the effects of kifunensine and benzyl-α-GalNAc on cholera toxin-induced cAMP production and we have moved these results to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>. In contrast, neither NB-DGJ nor 2F-Fuc affected activation of adenylyl cyclase activity by either VIP or forskolin, but both of these inhibitors do cause reduced CT-induced cAMP production, with 2F-Fuc causing a more dramatic effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Since 2F-Fuc treatment also causes reduced CTB binding and cell entry, the most likely explanation for this result is that reduced fucosylation leads to less CT entering cells, and thereby reduces host cell intoxication. Since NB-DGJ treatment does not grossly affect CTB binding or internalization, we think it is reasonable to consider three possible explanations for the effect that NB-DGJ exerts on CT-induced cAMP production. One possibility is that the cells contain a level of GM1 that is not detectable by the sensitive methods employed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, but which is nonetheless capable of mediating host cell intoxication via a pathway that operates either in parallel or in concert with that mediated by fucosylated glycoproteins. A second possibility is that GM1 is not required for the initial steps of CT binding and internalization, but is required for later steps in intoxication (i.e. the potential hand-off mechanism discussed in our response to item #6 above). A final possibility is that GM1 is not essential, but other glucosylceramide glycolipids, which are also reduced due to NB-DGJ treatment, play roles in the trafficking and intoxication process. We now enumerate these possibilities explicitly in the manuscript. In summary, with the addition of these control experiments, the data now clearly demonstrate a role for fucosylation in the mechanism of host cell intoxication by CT.</p><p><italic>8) The intoxication experiments included several puzzling results. Why does kifunensine treatment enhance internalization, but reduce intoxication? Why does NB-DGJ treatment reduce intoxication if the T84 cells do not synthesize detectable amounts of gangliosides including GM1? The possibility that multiple steps in intoxication are sensitive to perturbation of oligosaccharide biosynthesis weakens the conclusion that fucosylated oligosaccharides are the most critical receptor.</italic></p><p>As discussed above in response to item #7, we now show that kifunensine exerts a general effect that reduces adenylyl cyclase activation, which is not specific to host cell intoxication by CT and that there are several potential explanations for the result that NB-DGJ reduces the severity of host cell intoxication. To be clear, we have not excluded the possibility that GM1 can function as a receptor. Rather, we provide positive evidence that fucosylated glycoproteins mediate CTB binding and internalization and, further, that fucose-dependent internalization of CT is on-pathway to host cell intoxication.</p><p><italic>9) Examine the intestinal cell lines for GM1 by ligand blot of TLC plates using radiolabeled or HRP-labeled CT beta-subunit or other mass spectrometry methods after treatment with ganglioside inhibitors(s) (NB-DGJ) to show complete loss of GM1. Test for toxicity (or retrograde trafficking into the ER) after showing complete loss of GM1 expression by treatment with NB-DGJ (or other inhibitor of ganglioside sphingolipid synthesis). Toxicity in those intestinal cells lacking GM1 should also be shown to be sensitive to brefeldin A (will block retrograde transport to ER and provide additional control unrelated to GM1).</italic></p><p>As suggested, we used <sup>125</sup>I-labeled CTB to probe Colo205 and T84 extracts separated by TLC, but were unable to detect GM1 in either cell line (new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We did demonstrate the effectiveness of the NB-DGJ inhibitor by showing that it reduced that amount of another glucosylceramide glycolipid recognized by <italic>E. cristagalli</italic> lectin (new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, if there is a small amount of GM1 in T84 cells, we expect that the level will be reduced by NB-DGJ treatment. In new data presented in Figure 9—figure supplement 4, we show that CT toxicity in control cells is sensitive to brefeldin A. Similarly, in cells that were cultured with NB-DGJ and treated with brefeldin A, the amount of CT-induced cAMP production is equivalent to the background level observed with no CT treatment. Since the magnitude of CT-induced cAMP production in the NB-DGJ-treated cells is small, the difference attributable to brefeldin A has a p value of 0.06. Despite the borderline significance of the p value, the data are most consistent with the residual CT intoxication in NB-DGJ-treated cells occurring through mechanism that depends on the secretory pathway.</p><p>As discussed in the response to item #7, there are several possible explanations for the fact that NB-DGJ inhibits CT toxicity, including the possibility that there is GM1 in these cells that cannot be detected by the sensitive methods employed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, but that functions as a receptor for some fraction of the CT. We now discuss these possibilities explicitly in the manuscript. We emphasize that we have not excluded a role for GM1 in host cell intoxication by CT, rather our data provide positive evidence that fucosylation and glycoproteins play significant roles.</p></body></sub-article></article>
