But the underlying molecular mechanisms of neuroligin functions remain unclear. We found that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Neuroligin 1 (DNlg1) regulates synaptic structure and function through WAVE regulatory complex (WRC)-mediated postsynaptic actin reorganization. The disruption of DNlg1, DNlg2, or their presynaptic partner neurexin (DNrx) led to a dramatic decrease in the amount of F-actin. Further study showed that DNlg1, but not DNlg2 or DNlg3, directly interacts with the WRC via its C-terminal interacting receptor sequence. That interaction is required to recruit WRC to the postsynaptic membrane to promote F-actin assembly. Furthermore, the interaction between DNlg1 and the WRC is essential for DNlg1 to rescue the morphological and electrophysiological defects in <italic>dnlg1</italic> mutants. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which the DNrx-DNlg1 trans-synaptic interaction coordinates structural and functional properties at the neuromuscular junction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Neuroligin</kwd><kwd>WAVE regulatory complex</kwd><kwd>postsynaptic assembly</kwd><kwd>F-actin</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31430035</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31171041</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Basic Research Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2012CB517903</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31401107</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Moyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002858</institution-id><institution>China Postdoctoral Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015T80476</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Moyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002858</institution-id><institution>China Postdoctoral Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014M560369</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Moyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CCI117959</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jia</surname><given-names>Zhengping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NSFC-CIHR</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81161120543</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neurexin–Neuroligin1 complex positively regulates F-actin assembly through direct interaction with WAVE complex to control normal synaptic growth and electrophysiological function in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synapses are fundamental components of neural circuits that are essential for normal brain function. The formation and maturation of synapses require coordination between presynaptic and postsynaptic apparatuses and are tightly controlled to ensure proper synaptic structure and function. A number of critical synaptic proteins have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kittel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Owald et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Petzoldt and Sigrist, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Waites et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yamagata et al., 2003</xref>). Among those are the heterotypic synaptic adhesion molecules neurexins and neuroligins, which have captured special attention because of their potent synaptogenic properties and their genetic linkage to autism and other mental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jamain et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Laumonnier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lawson-Yuen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Neuroligins are postsynaptic adhesion molecules involved in synaptic formation and maturation and in postsynaptic assembly. An important early discovery regarding neuroligins was that they can induce formation of new synapses <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Scheiffele et al., 2000</xref>). Expression of neuroligins in nonneuronal cells is sufficient to induce presynaptic differentiation in axons that form contacts between nonneuronal and neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Scheiffele et al., 2000</xref>). The overexpression of neuroligins in neuronal cultures increases the number of spines and induces the accumulation of postsynaptic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chih et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chubykin et al., 2007</xref>). Because of the existence of multiple, functionally redundant family members, it is difficult to directly assess the effects of neuroligins on synaptic formation <italic>in vivo</italic>. The current data from both mammals and flies strongly support the critical involvement of neuroligins in synaptic function and the maturation of the postsynaptic apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banovic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chubykin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Poulopoulos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Varoqueaux et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xing et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). However, it is still not elucidated how neuroligins regulate those processes.</p><p>Actin is a key cytoskeletal component that plays a central role in many cellular processes, including cell morphology, motility, and vesicle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaksonen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Le Clainche and Carlier, 2008</xref>). It is well known as a critical factor for synaptic formation and function. In mammalian central synapses, actin cytoskeletons are enriched in the dendritic spines, the major sites of excitatory input, and are crucial for spine formation, morphology, and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dillon and Goda, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Takahashi et al., 2003</xref>). Actin dynamics are involved in the postsynaptic cell-surface expression and trafficking of the glutamate receptor (GluR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cingolani and Goda, 2008</xref>) and in various forms of synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation and depression, which are widely regarded as synaptic mechanisms for learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collingridge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Malenka and Bear, 2004</xref>). Among the many factors that have been characterized to regulate the actin cytoskeleton, the members of the Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family have been extensively studied. WASP family proteins are characterized by a conserved C-terminal tripartite verprolin-homology, central, acidic (VCA) domain, which binds to and stimulates the nucleating activity of the Arp2/3 complex to promote actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pollitt and Insall, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Takenawa and Suetsugu, 2007</xref>). The WASP family Verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) is constitutively incorporated into the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC), a five-component complex that consists of Sra1/Cyfip1, Hem2/Nap1/Kette, Abi2, HSPC300/Brick1, and WAVE/SCAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eden et al., 2002</xref>). Activation of the WASP family members is largely restricted to cell membranes, and several membrane proteins have been shown to bind to WRC to regulate actin dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nakao et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Similar to the mammalian system, <italic>in vivo</italic> studies indicated strong involvement of <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroligins (DNlgs) in synapse development and function. <italic>Drosophila</italic> has four neuroligin genes (<italic>dnlg1–4</italic>), which have a close evolutionary relationship to their vertebrate homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banovic et al., 2010</xref>). Using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a model, we and others previously showed that all four DNlgs play roles in synaptic formation and function, including the regulation of bouton growth, subsynaptic reticulum (SSR) assembly, GluR recruitment, and synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banovic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xing et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Exactly how DNlgs regulate those processes remain to be fully understood. Given the critical role of actin in postsynaptic regulation, we hypothesized that the abnormalities observed in <italic>dnlg</italic>-mutant NMJs are related to actin deficits.</p><p>In this study, we reveal a significant role of DNlg1 in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in the postsynaptic NMJ. We find that mutations in <italic>dnlg1, dnlg2,</italic> and <italic>dnrx</italic> each resulted in a dramatic reduction in the amount of actin filaments (F-actin). And it is DNlg1, but not DNlg2 or DNlg3, able to directly interact with the WRC via the WRC interacting receptor sequence (WIRS) motif. This motif is present in the C-terminal tail of DNlg1 but is absent in DNlg2 and DNlg3. Mutant DNlg1 that could not bind to WRC failed to reverse NMJ synapse undergrowth and reduced NMJ synaptic transmission capability in <italic>dnlg1</italic> mutants. Altogether, DNlg1 promotes postsynaptic F-actin assembly via binding and recruiting WRC to postsynaptic sites. And that interaction between DNlg1 and WRC is indispensable to maintain normal synaptic formation and transmission in <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJs. This study unravels a fundamental mechanism how certain synaptic adhesion molecules regulate synaptic formation and function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DNlg1 and DNlg2 positively regulate postsynaptic F-actin assembly</title><p>To explore the relationship between neuroligins and the postsynaptic actin cytoskeleton, we analyzed the level of F-actin at the NMJ in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroligin mutants. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> body-wall muscles are innervated by numerous motor neurons that branch over the muscles and form stereotypic NMJ terminal boutons, each containing dozens of glutamatergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Prokop, 2006</xref>). F-actin is usually concentrated around the postsynaptic site of the bouton, which can be visualized by using fluorophore-conjugated phalloidin. Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coyle et al., 2004</xref>), F-actin in the wild type (WT) NMJ was highly enriched at the postsynaptic sites, displaying a diffuse meshwork-like appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the <italic>dnlg1</italic> and <italic>dnlg2</italic> mutant NMJs, the amount of F-actin was dramatically reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C and F</xref>). The amount of α-Spectrin, an actin cytoskeleton-associated protein, was similarly reduced in the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C and F</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mosca et al., 2012</xref>. In addition to the lower fluorescence intensity, the <italic>dnlg1</italic> mutants had a significantly less relative area of F-actin distribution [ratio of F-actin area/horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled area; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and E</xref>]. The alterations in F-actin and α-Spectrin were specific, as they were not accompanied by changes in the levels of other synaptic proteins, including the postsynaptic scaffolding protein DLG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Those results suggested that DNlg1 and DNlg2 promote F-actin assembly at NMJs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30457.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>DNlg1 and DNlg2 promote postsynaptic F-actin assembly.</title><p>(A–D) Confocal images of (<bold>A</bold>) WT, (<bold>B</bold>) <italic>dnlg1</italic> mutant (<italic>dnlg1<sup>ex1.9/ex2.3</sup></italic>), (<bold>C</bold>) <italic>dnlg2</italic> mutant (<italic>dnlg2<sup>KO70/KO70</sup></italic>), and (<bold>D</bold>) <italic>dnlg1; dnlg2</italic> double mutant (<italic>dnlg2<sup>KO70/KO70</sup>; dnlg1<sup>ex1.9/ex2.3</sup></italic>) third instar larvae NMJ type Ib boutons at muscles 12/13 labeled with Texas Red phalloidin (red), anti-α-Spectrin (green), and anti-HRP (blue).

Compared with type I boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A3</xref>, yellow wedges), type II boutons are typically smaller in size, extend for a longer distance on the muscle fibers, and are connected by a long, thin axonal process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A3</xref>, pink wedges). Indeed, type I and type II boutons form different types of synapses with different presynaptic and postsynaptic properties, such as the lack of defined SSR structures in type II boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Budnik and Gorczyca, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jia et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johansen et al., 1989</xref>).

A major unresolved issue is how that trans-synaptic interaction regulates those processes. In this study, we revealed a novel mechanism mediated by the actin cytoskeleton. DNlg1 directly interacts with and recruits the WRC, a potent regulator of actin reorganization, to the postsynaptic membrane. That interaction is both necessary and sufficient for DNlg1 to assemble actin filaments. Furthermore, the DNlg1-WRC interaction is essential for DNlg1 to regulate both synaptic morphology and synaptic function. Those findings establish a key role for actin in mediating the effects of neurexin–neuroligin at NMJs.</p><p>A recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banerjee et al., 2017</xref>) showed that the DNrx-DNlg1 complex regulates synaptic cytoarchitecture and growth through bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. According to that conclusion, while DNlg1 may affect actin networks, the effect is not direct, because the BMP signaling regulates actin reorganization via small G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ball et al., 2010</xref>). Our study provides compelling evidence that DNlg1 actually is a direct regulator of the actin cytoskeleton through its interaction with the WRC. First, the amount and distribution of postsynaptic F-actin are severely impaired in <italic>dnlg1</italic> mutants. Second, DNlg1 binds to the WRC through the WIRS motif in its cytoplasmic tail, and that binding is crucial for WRC postsynaptic localization. Third, the interaction between DNlg1 and the WRC is required for postsynaptic F-actin assembly. Fourth, ectopic expression of DNlg1 is sufficient to induce postsynaptic F-actin formation, and that effect is dependent on the interaction between DNlg1 and WRC. Finally, the regulation of F-actin assembly by DNlg1 is indispensable for the functions of DNlg1 in bouton growth and synaptic transmission. Postsynaptic expression of WT DNlg1, but not mutant DNlg1<sup>SF-AA</sup>, could rescue the defects in <italic>dnlg1</italic> mutants, highly suggesting the necessity of the interaction between DNlg1 and the WRC for those biological events. An interesting observation was that the postsynaptic expression of DNlg1<sup>SF-AA</sup> in <italic>dnlg1</italic> mutants could partially rescue the defects of <italic>dnlg1</italic> mutants in GluR recruitment. That means, if WRC is not the only factor, but at least it is one of the factors to affect DNlg1 mediated GluR recruitment. Other regulators able to interact with DNlg1, which participate into GluR recruitment somehow, wait to be revealed in the near future.</p><p>Consistent with the previous finding that DNrx is required for the stabilization of postsynaptic DNlg1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banovic et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>dnrx</italic> mutants showed defects in postsynaptic F-actin similar to those seen in the <italic>dnlg1</italic> mutants. Our results also showed that DNlg2 has a positive effect on F-actin similar to that of DNlg1, but it remains unknown how DNlg2 regulates postsynaptic F-actin assembly, because DNlg2 does not interact with the WRC. Because <italic>dnrx</italic>, <italic>dnlg1</italic>, and <italic>dnlg2</italic> single mutants, <italic>dnrx; dnlg1/2</italic> double mutants, and <italic>dnlg1; dnlg2</italic> double mutants all exhibit similar defects in F-actin, we hypothesize that DNlg1, DNlg2, DNrx, and the WRC may form a large protein complex, so that single deletions of any of the components of the complex may have similar effects on actin regulation. There are several other possibilities to consider if that hypothesis is not correct. One possibility is that DNlg2 regulates F-actin via p21 protein (Cdc42/Rac)-activated kinase (DPAK), an important regulator of F-actin assembly that has been shown to be reduced in <italic>dnlg2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sun et al., 2011</xref>). Another possibility is that as the PDZ-binding motif of mouse Nlg1 can bind to spine-associated Rap guanosine triphosphatase–activating protein (SPAR) and subsequently activate the LIMK1/cofilin pathway to regulate actin filaments, spine morphology, and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), it is reasonable to ask whether the PDZ-binding motif of DNlg2 can bind to Rap GTPase activating protein 1 (RapGAP1), the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of SPAR. In those contexts, it is important to note that different DNlg mutants exhibit somewhat different defects. The loss of <italic>dnlg1</italic> leads to reduced SSR areas and the disruption of GluR alignment with the presynaptic active zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banovic et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>dnlg2</italic> mutants, the clustering of GluRIIA is increased, whereas that of GluRIIB and the size of the SSR area are reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sun et al., 2011</xref>). In <italic>dnlg3</italic> mutants, only the clustering of GluRIIA is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xing et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that members of the neuroligin family utilize diverse mechanisms to regulate synapse development and function. It will be important to identify which of those mechanisms involves actin reorganization and how the different mechanisms interact.</p><p>Sequence analysis shows that the WIRS motif is prevalent in neuroligins, especially vertebrate neuroligins. Four have been identified in rodents and humans, including a less conserved Nlg4 in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Südhof, 2008</xref>). Among the neuroligins, Nlg1, Nlg3, and Nlg4 (4X, 4Y) have more amino acid sequence similarity with each other than they do with Nlg2. Biochemistry and immunocytochemistry studies show that all human neuroligins are postsynaptic proteins and that Nlg2 is specifically expressed at inhibitory synapses, whereas Nlg1 and Nlg3 are expressed at excitatory synapses or at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. All vertebrate neuroligins, except Neuroligin 2, contain the WIRS motif, implying that the regulation of F-actin assembly by neuroligins may determine the specification of the postsynaptic apparatus.</p><p>In summary, we identified a novel process by which neuroligins regulate the postsynaptic actin cytoskeleton, which we propose as a key mechanism to mediate the regulatory effect of neuroligins and neurexins on synapse development and function at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ. We believe that further investigations of the regulation of the postsynaptic cytoskeleton by neuroligins will provide an important avenue of research to dissect the molecular mechanisms governing brain development and function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>dnlg1<sup>ex1.9</sup></td><td>PMID: 20547130</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>dnlg1<sup>ex2.3</sup></td><td>PMID: 20547130</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>dnlg2<sup>KO70</sup></td><td>PMID: 21228178</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>dnlg2<sup>KO17</sup></td><td>PMID: 21228178</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>dnrx<sup>83</sup></td><td>PMID: 23352167;

We generated UAS-DNlg1, UAS-DNlg1<sup>SF-AA</sup>, UAS-DNlg1-EGFP, and UAS-DNlg1<sup>SF-AA</sup> -EGFP by inserting the coding sequences into an attp-pUAST vector and injecting the resulting constructs into embryos of phiC31 attB-bearing flies (Bloomington stock center, #24870). The strategy used for the generation of EGFP-tagged DNlg1 was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banovic et al., 2010</xref>). We used the following Gal4 flies: motor neuron Gal4 OK6-Gal4 (Bloomington Stock center), muscle-specific Gal4: C57-Gal4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Budnik et al., 1996</xref>), 24B-Gal4 (Kyoto Stock center), and Mef 2-Gal4 (Bloomington Stock center).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>NMJ staining and image analysis</title><p>The procedure for immunostaining the larval body-wall muscle was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xing et al., 2014</xref>). In brief, the body-wall muscles from third instar larvae were dissected in PBS solution and fixed them for 40 min with 4% paraformaldehyde. Then, the fixed samples were washed four times in 0.3% PBST (PBS + 0.3% Triton X-100), blocked them in blocking solution (1% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 hr, and incubated them with primary antibody at 4°C overnight. The following primary antibodies were used in this study: mouse anti-α-Spectrin (DSHB, 1:25), mouse anti-DLG (DSHB, 1:50), mouse anti-SCAR (DSHB; 1:50), mouse anti-GluRIIA (DSHB; 1:50), rabbit anti-GluRIIB (1:1000) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tu et al., 2017</xref>); rabbit anti-HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:1000), and Texas Red<sup>®</sup>-X Phalloidin (Molecular probe, 1:6). AlexaFluor-488-conjugated, AlexaFluor-555-conjugated, and AlexaFluor-633-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, 1:500) were used at room temperature for 1 hr. All images were collected using an LSM 710 Confocal Station (Zeiss) and processed with Adobe Illustrator CS6.</p><p>Image J software was used to quantify the relative F-actin areas and fluorescence intensities. For measurements of the relative F-actin areas, we selected single boutons and calculated the F-actin signal area and the anti-HRP signal area in each bouton using Image J. The relative F-actin area was expressed as the ratio of the F-actin area to the anti-HRP area. For measurements of fluorescence intensity, we set an arbitrary threshold for each channel based on the difference in intensity between the NMJ and the background regions. The sum of the pixels with intensities above the threshold was recorded by ImageJ. For comparison of fluorescence intensities between genotypes, all samples were processed simultaneously and under identical conditions. Similar to a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>), anti-HRP staining signal was used as a control signal. For F-actin staining, NMJ samples were incubated with a high concentration of Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin (1:6) for 13 min at room temperature. Images were collected at muscles 12/13, because the distance between the boutons and the myofibril in that muscle is relatively large, thus reducing the interference from a strong F-actin-stained background due to myofibril (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ramachandran et al., 2009</xref>). We performed statistical analyses as described in the source data tables.</p><p>Quantification of active zones was performed using a modified method according to Banovic’s description (2010). The unopposed active zones were defined as active zones lacking GluR alignment. We co-applied GluRIIB rabbit polyclonal antibody and Brp mouse monoclonal antibody (nc82) for immunofluorescence staining. A branch of bouton clusters (usually 8–10 boutons) from muscle 4 of segment A3 were included in the analysis instead of quantifying only terminal boutons. To avoid subjective variation in the counting the numbers of non-overlapping Brp/GluRIIB spots, the ratio of non-overlapping Brp area to the total Brp area, namely percentage unopposed AZ area was used to represent the extent of unapposed active zones. That method is very similar to the way that the extent of co-localization of presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins in mammalian systems is quantified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Singh et al., 2016</xref>). The Brp spots in single-channel images and the overlapping spots of Brp and GluRIIB in corresponding two-channel merged images were respectively detected using ImageJ. Then, the total area of the Brp spots and that of the Brp/GluRIIB overlapping spots were quantified using the ‘analyze particles’ function in ImageJ. We defined the percentage apposed AZ area as the ratio of the total Brp/GluRIIB overlapping spot area to the total Brp spot area. The percentage unapposed AZ area was acquired by subtracting the percentage apposed AZ from 100%.</p><p>To quantify immunofluorescent signals on the cytoplasmic membrane or in the cytoplasm of S2 cells, plot profile analysis in ImageJ was performed according to the ImageJ user guide. The extent of SCAR recruitment from the cytoplasm to the cytoplasmic membrane was indicated by the ratio of the plasma membrane SCAR intensity (the mean value of two plot profile values on the membrane) to the cytoplasmic SCAR intensity (the mean value of all values within the cytoplasm).</p><p>All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7. We applied nonparametric one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test to evaluate the differences among multiple groups of samples. We used the Mann–Whitney U test to evaluate the difference between two groups of samples. The methods used for the statistical analyses in all statistical graphs are described in the source data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Immunoblotting analysis</title><p>Fly brain samples were homogenized with 1 × SDS loading buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromophenol blue, 10% glycerol, 1% β-mercaptoethanol). The lysate samples and pull-down samples were separated by 10% or 8% SDS-PAGE and electro-transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. We probed the immobilized proteins on the membranes with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. The following primary antibodies were used in this study: mouse anti-SCAR (DSHB, 1:500) and mouse anti-Tubulin (Sigma, 1:10000). The samples were then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody at room temperature for 1.5 hr.

Briefly, GST protein and GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 cells with PGEX-5X-1 vector. We then purified and immobilized the cells with glutathione Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare, SWE). WT fly heads were homogenized and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 × Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, GER). Then, the lysate was incubated with GST protein or GST-tagged proteins immobilized on beads. We then washed the beads three times with lysis buffer and eluted them by boiling in 2 × SDS loading buffer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Third instar larvae were dissected and intracellular membrane potentials were recorded as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jan and Jan, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sun et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, we chose muscle 6 in the A3 segment for recording. The free segmental nerve end was drawn into a microelectrode using an injector and stimulated with a Master-8 pulse stimulator (A.M.P.I, IL) at 0.3 Hz with a suprathreshold stimulating pulse and the electrodes (20–50 MΩ) filled with 3 M KCl for EJP recording. We recorded mEJPs for 20 s starting 8 s after EJP recordings. All recordings were conducted at room temperature with an Axoclamp 900A amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) in bridge mode. The data were digitized with a Digitizer 1322A (Molecular Devices). We used Clampfit 10.2 to analyze the data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Cell culture, transfection, and staining</title><p>S2 cells were cultured on six-well cell culture plates overlaid with round glass cover slips (Corning) and incubated at 25°C in HyClone SFX-Insect Cell Culture Media (ThermoFisher Scientific, UK). We co-transfected the cells with PAC5.1/V5-His-A plasmid containing an actin 5C promoter and pUAST vector including the desired protein coding sequence using X-treme GENE HP (Roche) transfection reagent. Two days after transfection, the cells were fixed for 10 min with 4% formaldehyde (Sigma, GER), permeabilized with PBS solution containing 1% BSA and 0.1% TritonX-100, and incubated with primary antibodies (rabbit anti-GFP, 1:1000, Invitrogen; mouse anti-SCAR, 1:50, DSHB) at 4°C overnight. After washing the cells three times, we incubated them with Alexa-488-conjugated or Alexa-555-conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 hr. We then washed the cells and mounted them in mounting media with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). For siRNA assays, siRNAs were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY). After 3 days, the cells were collected for western blotting and immunostaining. The following siRNAs were used: Ctr-siRNA, ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT; SCAR-siRNA, AUAGACAUUAAGCUUGUCGAG.</p><p>The S2 cell line was acquired from the China Center for Type Culture Collection (CCTCC). To test the mycoplasma contamination status, we used the MycoBlueTM Mycoplasma Detector kit (Vazyme, CHN), which works based on an improved short tandem repeat (STR) profiling technique. According to the kit manual, if the cell culture has mycoplasma contamination, the conserved sequence of mycoplasma DNA will be amplified by isothermal DNA polymerase, which will turn the reaction liquid from purple to blue. Thus, the results can be visualized by direct observation. All of the S2 cells used in this study were negative for mycoplasma contamination.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>DNlg, <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroligin; WRC, WAVE regulatory complex; NMJ, neuromuscular junction; GluR, glutamate receptor; GluRIIA, glutamate receptor IIA subunit; GluRIIB, glutamate receptor IIB subunit; EJP, excitatory junction potential; mEJP, miniature excitatory junction potential; SSR, subsynaptic reticulum; BRP, bruchpilot; DLG, Discs large 1; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr Hermann Aberle for the <italic>dnlg1</italic> mutants, the Bloomington Stock Center for providing <italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks, DSHB for antibodies, and the members of the Xie laboratory for their critical comments on the manuscript and experimental design.

Here are my questions:a) It is much easier to obtain a large number of S2 cells for quantitative imaging than animals. The current p-value is only &lt;0.05, which could be significantly improved by having larger sample size. Why did the authors only use 10 cells for each sample for statistical analysis?

Differing from the previous study of Banovic et al., we used a branch of bouton clusters instead of terminal boutons for statistical analysis. To quantify misalignment between BRP spots and GluRIIB, we calculated the ratio of unapposed area to the total area of all BRP spots in a chain with multiple boutons. This is very similar with the method applied in mammalian system to quantify colocalization extent of presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins (Singh et al., 2016). Instead of numbering unapposed BRP spots, we chose to calculate the unopposed area percentage as it’s sometimes hard to distinguish if BRP and GluRIIB signals are partially overlapped or they are really unopposed. We added a paragraph in Materials and methods section to describe our method in detail too.</p><p>You might notice that the percentage numbers we observed are different to the numbers reported in Banovic’s work (WT: 1.4% unopposed AZ; <italic>dnlg1</italic> mutant: 15.7% unopposed AZ). That is because we used different index (area percentage rather than number percentage) to reflect this phenotype. But we did detect similar difference between WT and <italic>dnlg1</italic> mutants, which is close to 15-20% between WT and <italic>dnlg1</italic>, and we found rescue-AA could not completely rescue this phenotype as rescue-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and I</xref>). Meanwhile, we quantified type Ib boutons completely losing GluR receptors (orphan boutons) in perspective mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H and J</xref>). Similar to what was reported in Banovic’s article, we observed ~10% of orphan bouton in <italic>dnlg1</italic> mutants. But rescue-AA and rescue-WT have similar frequency of orphan bouton as WT. These data suggest that F-actin reduction might be at least the partial reason for GluR mislocalization in <italic>dnlg1</italic> mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Analyse whether Neuroligin 2 mutant also leads to loss of the WRC, and if a Neuroligin 1/Neuroligin 2 double mutant gives the same phenotype as the single mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we analyzed the SCAR distribution in neuroligin 2 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), and found that loss of DNlg2 also caused a remarkable decrease in SCAR level.

As suggested, we performed RNA interference with SCAR siRNA in S2 cells this time. Compared with untreated S2 cells or control siRNA treated cells, SCAR protein level in SCAR siRNA treated S2 cells was dramatically reduced. This thus demonstrated specificity of immunostaining signals from recognition of SCAR protein by its antibody in this cell line. And it is clearly proved that the observed changes of SCAR distribution in DNlg1-EGFP or DNlg1<sup>SF-AA</sup>-EGFP overexpressed S2 cells are actually due to WAVE, instead of something nonspecific.

And we thought if we always chose the first 10 cells microscopically scanned for each group, this was a way to avoid subjective bias. But we absolutely agree with reviewers that what we used is not an ideal N number for statistical analysis for S2 cells especially considering our p value (only &lt;0.05) and easy availability of these cells. And the way we avoid subjective bias is not very strict too. As suggested, in this revised version, we increased N number to around 25 cells. And our p value reached to &lt;0.001(new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>) this time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref> to J and L panels, the membrane recruitment of SCAR signal was dramatic with WT DNlg1 expression.

We realized that this could be misleading to potential users of this method too. As suggested, in this revised version, we changed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref> to more representative images (new Figure3K1-K3). Furthermore, we improved our quantification strategy for SCAR intensity plot profile analysis. In our previous analysis, the extent of SCAR recruitment from cytoplasm to cytoplasmic membrane was indicated using the ratio of plasma membrane SCAR intensity (the mean value of two plot profile values on the membrane) to nearby cytoplasmic SCAR intensity (the mean value of two neighbor-peak values in the cytoplasm). Now we turn to using the ratio of plasma membrane SCAR intensity (the mean value of two plot profile values on the membrane) to the cytoplasmic SCAR intensity (the mean value of all values within cytoplasm) to indicate this event. And we do get a more significant difference between DNlg1-EGFP and DNlg1<sup>SF-AA</sup>-EGFP using this new quantification strategy and increasing N number (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>). We thought all these changes will further improve the stringency of our data and make our conclusions more convincing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I cannot see a real difference comparing the Scar signal in dnlg1 and dnlg2 mutants.

Can you at least provide a more detailed discussion on this point?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we added more detailed discussion on how DNlg2 possibly regulates postsynaptic F-actin in Discussion section. Briefly, the first possibility is that DNlg1, DNlg2, DNrx, and the WRC may form a large protein complex, so that single deletions of any of the components of the complex may have similar effects on actin regulation. The second possibility is that DNlg2 regulates F-actin via p21 protein (Cdc42/Rac)-activated kinase (DPAK), an important regulator of F-actin assembly that has been shown to be downregulated in <italic>dnlg2</italic> mutants (Sun et al., 2011). Another possibility is that as the PDZ-binding motif of mouse Nlg1 can bind to spine-associated Rap guanosine triphosphatase–activating protein (SPAR) and subsequently activate the LIMK1/cofilin pathway to regulate actin filaments, spine morphology, and plasticity (Liu et al., 2016), it is reasonable to explore whether the PDZ-binding motif of DNlg2 can bind to Rap GTPase activating protein 1 (RapGAP1), the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of SPAR.</p></body></sub-article></article>
