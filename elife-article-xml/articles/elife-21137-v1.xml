Yet the molecular determinants of allosteric connectivity in tyrosine kinase domain are incompletely understood. By means of structural (X-ray and NMR) and functional characterization of pathogenic gain-of-function mutations affecting the FGF receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinase domain, we elucidated a long-distance allosteric network composed of four interconnected sites termed the ‘molecular brake’, ‘DFG latch’, ‘A-loop plug’, and ‘αC tether’. The first three sites repress the kinase from adopting an active conformation, whereas the αC tether promotes the active conformation. The skewed design of this four-site allosteric network imposes tight autoinhibition and accounts for the incomplete mimicry of the activated conformation by pathogenic mutations targeting a single site. Based on the structural similarity shared among RTKs, we propose that this allosteric model for FGFR kinases is applicable to other RTKs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21137.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21137.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21137.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many growth factors and hormones instruct cells to act in particular ways – for example, to divide, specialize or migrate – by binding to proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases on the surface of the cell. Receptor tyrosine kinases comprise a region that binds to the signaling molecules outside the cell (the receptor domain) and a region that interacts with and modifies other proteins within the cell (the kinase domain). When a growth factor or hormone binds to the receptor domain, the receptor domains of two identical receptor tyrosine kinases form a dimeric complex, bringing the kinase domains close together so that they can activate each other. This activation initiates a long chain of protein-protein interactions that leads to a cellular response.</p><p>Some mutations that occur in the kinase domain cause the kinase to frequently sample the activated state without needing to bind to a signaling molecule. This can lead to cancer or growth disorders. It is not known how these mutations allow the kinase domain to bypass the control mechanisms that prevent it from activating at the wrong time.</p><p>Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor is a receptor tyrosine kinase in which many disease-causing mutations have been identified in the kinase domain. Chen, Marsiglia et al. have now used the human form of the FGF receptor to investigate how some of these mutations affect kinase structure and activity. The structures of normal and mutant forms of the FGF receptor were determined using X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Combining these results with activity data from the diseased receptors revealed four key interdependent sites in the protein that play essential roles in maintaining the receptors in an inhibited state. Disease-causing mutations are generally located in these sites, and take advantage of their interdependence to make the kinase active more frequently, even when the receptor domain is not bound to a signaling molecule.</p><p>Chen, Marsiglia et al. suggest that these sites may act in the same way in other receptor tyrosine kinases, as these proteins have many similarities in their structures. The findings reveal important regions within the kinase domain that could be targeted by inhibitors to prevent the harmful effects of disease-causing mutations. Future studies will be needed to understand in more detail how interactions between the key sites change the activity of the kinases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21137.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21137.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>FGF receptor</kwd><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd>receptor tyrosine kinase</kwd><kwd>crystal structure</kwd><kwd>NMR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE13686</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mohammadi</surname><given-names>Moosa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 NS050276</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neubert</surname><given-names>Thomas A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI108889</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Traaseth</surname><given-names>Nathaniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A four-switch long-range allosteric network controls FGF receptor kinase conformational dynamics as well as activity and is applicable to other receptor tyrosine kinases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling fulfills fundamental functions in development, tissue homeostasis, and metabolism of metazoan organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Manning et al., 2002</xref>). The 58 human RTKs are divided into ~17 subfamilies, each featuring unique architectures in their extracellular domain that are specialized to bind and mediate the biological actions of distinct growth factors, cytokines and hormones such as EGF, FGF, PDGF, VEGF, IGF, insulin and NGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>). The divergent extracellular domains of RTK subfamilies are linked via a single transmembrane helix to the intracellular domain that harbors the conserved tyrosine kinase domain. Despite exhibiting major structural diversity in their ectodomains, all RTKs must rely on the universal process of ligand-induced dimerization or rearrangement of preformed dimers to elevate the intrinsic activity of the intracellular kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>). In the case of EGFR subfamily, receptor dimerization facilitates the formation of an asymmetric kinase dimer, wherein a donor kinase allosterically stabilizes the active conformation of the receiver kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kovacs et al., 2015</xref>). Other RTK subfamilies require trans-phosphorylation on regulatory tyrosines located in the activation loop (A-loop) in order to trigger activation. Analysis of crystal structures of unphosphorylated receptor tyrosine kinase domains representing every RTK subfamily show that in the resting state (i.e. in the absence of extracellular ligand engagement) kinase domains are autoinhibited through a variety of mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huse and Kuriyan, 2002</xref>). In the case of insulin receptor, MUSK, and TRK subfamilies, kinase autoinhibition is mediated by the A-loop itself whereby the conserved DFG motif at the N-terminal end of the A-loop blocks ATP binding and a regulatory tyrosine at the C-terminus of the A-loop acts as a pseudo substrate competing with substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hubbard, 2002</xref>). In another model based on the crystal structure of FLT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Griffith et al., 2004</xref>), the juxtamembrane region located outside the conserved kinase domain is involved in maintaining the autoinhibited kinase conformation along with the A-loop. Hydrophobic residues from the juxtamembrane insert into the ATP binding cleft to both compete with ATP binding and to facilitate the inactive conformation of the A-loop. Akin to the first model, a regulatory tyrosine in the A-loop inserts in the substrate binding site and acts as a competitive inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hubbard, 2002</xref>). In the case of the FGFR, KIT, PDGFR, and VEGFR subfamilies, kinase autoinhibition is principally mediated by a network of hydrogen bonds in the vicinity of the kinase hinge region that constrains the ability of the kinase to adopt the active conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, in FGFR kinase an arginine at the C-terminal end of the A-loop makes a salt-bridge with the catalytic base resulting in occlusion of the enzyme’s active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mohammadi et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Despite employing different modes of autoinhibition, all receptor tyrosine kinases adopt a common active state conformation upon A-loop tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hubbard and Till, 2000</xref>). The available structures of A-loop phosphorylated kinases each display a salt-bridge between the phosphotyrosine and a conserved arginine residue within the A-loop that causes a dramatic structural rearrangement of the A-loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huse and Kuriyan, 2002</xref>). This conformational change sets in motion a series of poorly characterized long-range allosteric events that ultimately enables the kinase to adopt the active conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2007</xref>). While crystal structures have provided atomistic insight into the two major conformational states (i.e. autoinhibited and activated forms), the role of enzyme dynamics and allosteric communication involved in this structural change can only be indirectly inferred from the static depictions.</p><p>The FGFR subfamily of tyrosine kinases has emerged as an excellent model system to elucidate the molecular basis underlying allosteric regulation of RTKs in a physiologically relevant and unbiased fashion. There are over 30 different naturally occurring germline and somatic gain-of-function mutations that map to the kinase domain of the four human FGF receptors (FGFR1-FGFR4) with the hinge region and A-loop representing the two most common hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Ravel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McGillivray et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zankl et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deutz-Terlouw et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grigelioniené et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mortier et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bellus et al., 2000</xref>). These activating mutations give rise to many forms of human congenital skeletal disorders of varying clinical severity and acquired cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wilkin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wilkie, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Webster and Donoghue, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Passos-Bueno et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rand et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chesi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Richelda et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cappellen et al., 1999</xref>). Indeed, structural and biochemical analyses of gain-of-function mutations mapping to the kinase hinge region led us to identify a network of hydrogen bonds formed by three residues termed the molecular brake that suppress the ability of FGFR kinase to attain the active conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2007</xref>). Mutation at each of the three constituents of the molecular brake disrupts the network of hydrogen bonds resulting in a profound increase in the intrinsic kinase activity of FGFRs and a variety of human skeletal disorders and cancers. More recently, through crystallographic and solution NMR analyses of five pathogenic FGFR2 kinases at a conserved lysine in the A-loop (the second hotspot), we showed that these mutations introduce additional hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic contacts to differentially stabilize the active conformation of the A-loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) in a dynamic two-state equilibrium regimen. In this model, FGFR kinase domain toggles between a conformationally rigid autoinhibited state and a conformationally flexible activated state. Notably, the kinase activity was found to directly correlate with the fractional population of the active state.</p><p>In all structures of A-loop mutants, the hydrogen bonds at the molecular brake, which are over 25 Å from the mutational site, were broken leading us to infer the existence of a long-range allosteric connectivity between the A-loop and molecular brake. In this report, we took advantage of an additional panel of naturally occurring pathogenic and acquired drug-resistant mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Byron et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kant et al., 2015</xref>) to chart the trajectory of this allosteric connectivity using X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and an in vitro kinase assay coupled with mass spectrometry. Our data reveal two clusters of hydrophobic interactions, termed ‘DFG latch’ and ‘αC tether’, which relay allosteric signals between the A-loop and the molecular brake. These hydrophobic networks, located strategically at the interface between the N- and C-lobes of the kinase, sense the structural fluctuations in the A-loop and molecular brake and undergo rearrangements to determine the kinase interlobe angle and hence kinase activation. Naturally occurring pathogenic and acquired drug-resistant mutations seize the four-site allosteric control pathway to bias the kinase equilibrium toward the active state thereby causing excessive signaling in human skeletal disorders and cancers. In addition to enriching our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of FGFR-related diseases, these findings are anticipated to make a major impact for ongoing drug discovery efforts targeting FGFRs and other RTKs such as PDGFRs, KIT, VEGFRs, and CSF1R that share the four-site allosteric mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structural analysis of pathogenic FGFR2K mutations suggests a long-range allosteric crosstalk between A-loop and the molecular brake</title><p>We recently reported the crystal structures of a panel of five pathogenic FGFR2 kinases (FGFR2K) harboring substitutions for glutamic acid, methionine, asparagine, glutamine and threonine of an FGFR-invariant lysine (K659 in FGFR2) in the A-loop, and showed that these mutations confer gain-of-function by introducing novel intramolecular hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic contacts to stabilize the active state conformation of the A-loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, in these pathogenic kinases, the hydrogen bond network at the molecular brake located 25 Å from the site of mutation was disrupted indicating that conformational changes of the A-loop propagate across the enzyme via long-range allostery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Previously, we also solved crystal structures of pathogenic FGFR2Ks (N549H, N549T, E565A, E565G, K641R) that directly target the three constituents of the molecular brake, namely N549, E565 and K641, and showed that these mutations disrupt the autoinhibitory network of hydrogen bonds leading to profound kinase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2007</xref>). Surprisingly, however, the A-loop conformation and angle between the N- and C-lobes of the kinase in these mutants remained identical to unphosphorylated wild-type (WT) FGFR2K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This observation prompted us to consider the possibility that crystal packing contacts might have affected the A-loop conformation in these molecular brake mutant structures. Indeed, overlay of the crystal structure of unphosphorylated WT FGFR2K (PDB ID: 2PSQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2007</xref>]) onto those of unphosphorylated autoinhibited FGFR1K (PDB ID: 1FGK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mohammadi et al., 1996</xref>]) and FGFR4K (PDB ID: 4QQT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2015</xref>]), phosphorylated active FGFR1K (PDB ID: 3GQI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bae et al., 2009</xref>]) and FGFR2K (PDB ID: 2PVF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2007</xref>]), and mutationally activated FGFR3K<bold><sup>K650E</sup></bold> (PDB ID: 4K33 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2013</xref>]) shows that the unphosphorylated WT FGFR2K is not in a genuine inhibited state. First, the location of the αC helix in the unphosphorylated FGFR2K crystal structure is very similar to that in the phosphorylated active FGFR1K and FGFR2K and mutationally activated FGFR3K<bold><sup>K650E</sup></bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>); second, the conformation of the first seven residues of the A-loop (DFGLARD) in the unphosphorylated FGFR2K matches those of the phosphorylated activated FGFR1K and FGFR2K and the mutationally activated FGFR3K<bold><sup>K650E</sup></bold> including β9 strand formation, which is a characteristic feature of the activated kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>); third, the substrate tyrosine binding site in the unphosphorylated FGFR2K is fully accessible which is in stark contrast to that in the unphosphorylated FGFR1K (PDB ID: 3KY2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bae et al., 2010</xref>]) and FGFR4K (PDB ID: 4QQT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2015</xref>]) where a prominent salt-bridge between an FGFR-invariant arginine from the A-loop and the catalytic base occludes the active site, which we have termed the A-loop plug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Notably in the crystal structures of the unphosphorylated FGFR2K (2PSQ) and its molecular brake mutants (2Q0B, 2PWL, 2PZ5, 2PY3, 2PZR), a tightly bound sulfate ion occupies a similar location as the phosphate moiety of the phosphorylated A-loop tyrosine 657 (pTyr-657) in the phosphorylated active FGFR2K structure. This sulfate ion makes hydrogen bonds with the invariant arginine from the DFGLARD motif reminiscent of pTyr-657 in the phosphorylated active FGFR2K. Hence, it appears that the partially active kinase conformation seen in the crystal structures of the unphosphorylated WT FGFR2K (2PSQ) and its molecular brake mutants have been influenced by crystal packing and the presence of the sulfate ion trapped in the A-loop.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21137.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Single mutations at the A-loop cause disengagement of the molecular brake while single mutations at the molecular brake constituents are unable to drive the A-loop to the active conformation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overlays of crystal structures corresponding to unphosphorylated K659E FGFR2K (PDB ID: 4J97 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2013</xref>], in magenta), unphosphorylated K659M FGFR2K (PDB ID: 4J96 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2013</xref>], in cyan), unphosphorylated WT FGFR2K (PDB ID: 2PSQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2007</xref>], in green) and the A-loop phosphorylated WT FGFR2K (PDB ID: 2PVF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2007</xref>], in grey).

However, these attempts were to no avail. We would like to mention that other groups have faced the same problem with FGFR2K crystals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eathiraj et al., 2011</xref>). Evidently, strong lattice contact forces prevail and conceal a truly autoinhibited conformation of the A-loop in the unphosphorylated form of FGFR2K. Hence, we decided to use NMR spectroscopy to assess the conformation of the unphosphorylated FGFR2K in solution (i.e. free of crystal lattice contacts). Guided by crystallographic data, two sets of NMR experiments were designed to obtain proximity information between the A-loop and the C-lobe in the unphosphorylated form of FGFR2K in solution. According to the crystal structures, the A-loop tyrosines in unphosphorylated FGFR1K (and FGFR4K) are tethered to the C-lobe, whereas in the unphosphorylated FGFR2K the A-loop including the tyrosines are stabilized away from the C-lobe by the favorable lattice contacts. Notably, in all the activated forms of FGFRKs, the A-loop adopts a common open conformation and makes few contacts with the C-lobe. Hence, if the A-loop tyrosines in the unphosphorylated FGFR2K were positioned similarly as in FGFR1K (and FGFR4K) then upon A-loop phosphorylation, the residues in the C-lobe of FGFR2K would be expected to experience chemical shift perturbations. Plotting of the chemical shift differences between the unphosphorylated and monophosphorylated (pY657) activated FGFR2K onto the crystal structures of unphosphorylated FGFR1K (3KY2) and FGFR2K (2PSQ) shows significant perturbations for several residues in the C-lobe including the αEF helix (L675), αF helix (V691), and αG helix (I707, V709, E711, L712, F713, K717, E718, and M722) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These NMR results cannot be reconciled with the observed conformation of the A-loop in the FGFR2K structure (2PSQ) as the A-loop tyrosines in this structure do not interact with these perturbed residues in the C-lobe. Hence, the chemical shift mapping analysis implies that the true autoinhibited conformation of the A-loop in FGFR2K is more similar to that observed in crystal structures of FGFR1K (3KY2) and FGFR4K (4QQT) than in the unphosphorylated FGFR2K structure. In addition to mapping chemical shift differences, we also carried out paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) experiments to directly probe the distance between the A-loop tyrosines and the C-lobe of the enzyme. PRE effects are strong up to a distance of ~20 Å for nitroxide spin labels and start to dissipate at distances longer than ~25 Å. Since PRE experiments require a surface-exposed free cysteine for covalently attaching a paramagnetic spin label onto the protein, we mutated I707 to cysteine. Located in the αG helix of FGFR2K, I707 is ideally suited to discern the A-loop conformational difference between unphosphorylated FGFR2K (2PSQ) and FGFR1K/FGFR4K (3KY2/4QQT) structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In the unphosphorylated FGFR2K structure (2PSQ), the Cγ of I707 and the nitrogen atom of Y656 are ~27 Å apart, whereas the corresponding distance between V704 and Y653 in FGFR1K (3KY2) is much shorter (~15 Å). Following selective enrichment with <sup>15</sup>N tyrosine, the I707C FGFR2K mutant was covalently reacted with MTSL nitroxide (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-pyrroline-3-methyl)-methanethiosulfonate), and <sup>1</sup>H/<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra were then acquired on both the oxidized (paramagnetic) and reduced forms (diamagnetic; treated with ascorbic acid) of the MTSL labeled I707C mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The intensity retentions were calculated by dividing the peak heights for the oxidized and reduced sample spectra, and following the approach from Battiste and Wagner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Battiste and Wagner, 2000</xref>), these values were converted into the distances shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>. Both Y656 and Y657 were found to be ~19 Å away from the MTSL-labeled C707, which is in better agreement with the A-loop conformation in the FGFR1K structure (3KY2) than the A-loop conformation in FGFR2K (2PSQ). While this distance is slightly longer than that measured in the FGFR1K crystal structure, it is within the typical range of experimental uncertainty (±4 Å) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Battiste and Wagner, 2000</xref>) stemming from the packing of MTSL against the protein. Hence, as with the chemical shift data, our PRE results also imply that the A-loop conformation in the unphosphorylated FGFR2K structure (2PSQ) is not a genuinely inhibited conformation, and that in solution the A-loop of FGFR2K most likely adopts a similar conformation as that displayed by the A-loops of unphosphorylated FGFR1K (3KY2) and FGFR4K (4QQT) in the crystal.</p><p>To resolve the ambiguity surrounding the A-loop conformation of the molecular brake mutants, we also retried crystallizing FGFR2K mutants bearing single and double mutations of the molecular brake constituents. Fortunately, we succeeded in obtaining the crystal structure of the FGFR2K<bold><sup>E565A/N549H</sup></bold> double mutant in a different space group than we previously solved for WT FGFR2K (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

communication between the A-loop and the molecular brake</title><p>Next, we aimed to delineate the trajectory of the allosteric connectivity between the A-loop and molecular brake. A clue into the hotspots of this allosteric path was provided by the analysis of five gain-of-function mutations from the FGFR2K isoform that map to the aαC helix (M537I), αC–β4 loop in the close vicinity of molecular brake (I547V), αE helix (L617M/F), and A-loop (D650V) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The M537I and L617M mutations confer resistance to the anticancer drug ponatinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Byron et al., 2013</xref>), and M537I also corresponds to the M528I mutation in FGFR3 that was recently identified in patients with proportionate short stature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kant et al., 2015</xref>). I547V is a somatic mutation detected in endometrial carcinoma patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pollock et al., 2007</xref>) and corresponds to the gain-of-function I538V mutation in FGFR3, which is responsible for hypochondrolasia syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grigelioniené et al., 1998</xref>).

This hydrophobic cluster, which we have termed the DFG latch, determines the conformation of the N-terminal part of the A-loop and hence the N-lobe rotation. Specifically, in the autoinhibited FGFR1K, FGFR3K, and FGFR4K structures, the conformations of the DFG and adjacent LAR residues are physically incompatible with downward rotation of the αC helix toward the C-lobe, a well-documented mandatory event in kinase activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The inhibited conformation of the DFGLAR motif is primarily dictated by the DFG latch where the phenylalanine is fixed in its observed inhibitory position through tight hydrophobic interactions with L617 from the αE helix, I553 from the αC-β4 loop, and I541 from the αC helix of FGFR2K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,E and G</xref>). In the phosphorylated activated FGFRK structures, however, an RTK-invariant salt bridge between the arginine within the DFGLAR motif and the phosphotyrosine in the A-loop is formed. This intraloop salt bridge facilitates backbone hydrogen bonding between this same arginine and the conserved I623 situated in the catalytic loop resulting in the formation of the short β6-β9 sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This structural change alters the conformation of the preceding DFG latch causing the χ<sub>1</sub> side chain dihedral angle of F645 to rotate by 120° which places the side chain of F645 in a new location that is now conducive with downward rotation of the N-lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Notably, in the activated kinase, the hydrophobic DFG latch becomes less engaged relative to the autoinhibited kinase as indicated by longer distances between the phenylalanine and the other three constituents of the latch (I541, I547, L617) as well as a decrease in shape complementarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,F and I</xref>). According to this structural analysis, the L617M/F and I547V gain-of-function mutations act by weakening the DFG latch that encourages the movement of the N-lobe toward the C-lobe, which under physiological conditions would be accomplished by A-loop tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, we postulate that the weakened hydrophobic contact between F645 of the DFG motif and I547, which is situated on the same αC-β4 loop as N549, perturbs the hydrogen bonding network at the molecular brake resulting in its disengagement. It should be noted that the DFG conformation seen in the activated FGFRK structures is distinct from the so-called ‘DFG-out’ conformation induced by binding of type II ATP competitive inhibitors such as Ponatinib and Gleevec (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schindler et al., 2000</xref>).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21137.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The hydrophobic DFG latch in FGFR kinases restrains N-lobe rotation necessary for kinase activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of the orientation of αC helix and the conformation of the DFGLAR motif at the start of the A-loop between the unphosphorylated autoinhibited WT FGFR1K (PDB ID: 1FGK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mohammadi et al., 1996</xref>], in green) and A-loop tyrosine phosphorylated WT FGFR1K (PDB ID: 3GQI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bae et al., 2009</xref>], in blue) structures.

In autoinhibited FGFRK structures, the conserved aspartic acid (D650 in FGFR2K) does not play any role in stabilizing the autoinhibited conformation of the A-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). However, in activated kinase structures, it makes van der Waals contacts with two conserved methionines (M537 and M540 in FGFR2K) at the C-terminal end of the αC helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These van der Waals/hydrophobic contacts cooperate with the aforementioned arginine-phosphotyrosine salt bridge to further promote the β9-β6 strand formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), thus encouraging movement of the phenylalanine from the DFG motif to facilitate N-lobe rotation. The structural changes at the αC tether and DFG latch results in breakage of hydrogen bonds at the A-loop plug, which frees up the substrate-binding site. Based on this structural analysis, D650V or M537I mutations in FGFR2K may accentuate the hydrophobic contacts between the A-loop and the aαC helix to facilitate N-lobe rotation and hence kinase activation. Thus, according to our four-site allosteric model, phosphorylation on the A-loop tyrosine triggers a series of concerted allosteric motions to couple all four sites thereby conferring catalytic competency on FGFRKs (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). It should be stressed that the DFG-latch and αC tether terms are not synonymous to the canonical DFG motif and aαC helix terminology. Rather the DFG-latch and αC tether describe two previously unrecognized clusters of interacting residues that are involved in modulating kinase dynamics between the autoinhibited and activated forms of the enzyme. Neither of these clusters were previously known in the RTK field, which were discovered by studying the effects of naturally occurring gain-of-function mutations in FGFRKs.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21137.010</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The hydrophobic αC tether in FGFR kinase facilitates N-lobe rotation, a mandatory event in kinase activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structural comparison of the conformation of the αC helix and A-loop between unphosphorylated WT FGFR1K (PDB ID: 1FGK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mohammadi et al., 1996</xref>], in green) and A-loop tyrosine phosphorylated WT FGFR2K (PDB ID 2PVF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2007</xref>], in purple).

To weaken the hydrophobic tether, single-site mutations including D650G, M537A and M540A were introduced into FGFR2K.

According to our model, the D650V mutation should drive the kinase toward the active conformation by fortifying the hydrophobic contacts at the αC tether. Consistent with our prediction, D650V crystallized in a fully activated conformation displaying a disengaged molecular brake and an activated A-loop conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,D and E</xref>).

Finally, mutations at the molecular brake (N549T, E565A, K641R) induced significant chemical shift changes to residues at or proximal to the molecular brake, DFG latch, αC tether, and catalytic loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The corresponding methyl group chemical shift perturbation data of E565A and K659E relative to WT are mapped onto the unphosphorylated FGFR1K crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>; PDB ID: 3KY2). The E565A mutant incurred major chemical shift changes at residues both proximal to the molecular brake (I548, L551, V564) and distal from the molecular brake at the DFG motif (I541, I547) and A-loop (L647, I651). These data demonstrate that disruption of the hydrogen bonding network of the molecular brake influences the conformation of the A-loop via long-range allostery. Surprisingly, however, the K659E mutant did not exhibit significant backbone or methyl chemical shift perturbations at the molecular brake region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Therefore, to supplement the <sup>1</sup>H/<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC and <sup>1</sup>H/<sup>13</sup>C HMQC chemical shift perturbation data on the K659E mutant, amide <sup>15</sup>N and methyl <sup>13</sup>C (Ile, Leu, and Val) CPMG relaxation dispersion measurements were carried out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Loria et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Korzhnev et al., 2004a</xref>). Note that the CPMG technique is a more sensitive method than chemical shift perturbation analyses to detect sparsely populated conformational states and is routinely used to explore protein dynamics on the µsec-msec timescale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mittermaier and Kay, 2009</xref>). Indeed, several residues in the K659E mutant showed significant relaxation dispersions (i.e. ΔR<sub>2,eff</sub> &gt;2 s<sup>−1</sup>) both at the backbone amide and side chain methyl groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C–F</xref>). These residues map to the DFG latch (I541, I547, F645), A-loop (L647), catalytic loop (I623, L627), molecular brake (I548, V699), αC tether (M538), and P+1 pocket (I707, V709). To determine the rate of conformational exchange, methyl group CPMG dispersion curves at two magnetic fields corresponding to I548, I623, L627, L647, I707, and V709 were fit in a global fashion using the two-site exchange equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Luz and Meiboom, 1963</xref>). Based on this analysis, an exchange rate (k<sub>ex</sub>) of 2000 ± 500 s<sup>−1</sup> was estimated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>) indicating that this pathogenic mutant interconverts between the autoinhibited/active states on a µsec-msec timescale (i.e. fast-intermediate exchange). By contrast, CPMG relaxation dispersion measurements on unphosphorylated WT FGFR2K showed very few residues exhibiting relaxation dispersions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A and B</xref>). Based on these observations, we conclude that the unphosphorylated form of FGFR2K is conformationally rigid (i.e. only a small fraction of kinase molecules are in the active state conformation). These NMR data are congruent with the X-ray crystal structures showing that the kinase domain of FGFR is subject to a three-level autoinhibition mechanism via the molecular brake, the DFG latch and the blockade of the active site by the A-loop/catalytic loop salt bridge (A-loop plug).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21137.018</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Comparison and quantification of microsecond-to-millisecond dynamics for wild-type and K659E FGFR2K.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) ΔR<sub>2,eff</sub><sup>15</sup>N CPMG relaxation dispersion values for WT (panel <bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>) and K659E mutant (panel <bold>C</bold>, <bold>D</bold>) plotted onto unphosphorylated WT FGFR1K (PDB ID: 3KY2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">[Bae et al., 2010</xref>]) note that the residue numbering convention corresponds to that of FGFR2K.

Comparison of these spectra with those of unphosphorylated (inhibited) WT FGFR2K showed a substantial reduction in peak intensities for the DFG motif and catalytic loop in the monophosphorylated activated FGFR2K. These observations reiterate that the DFG motif in the autoinhibited kinase is conformationally rigid (i.e. DFG latch on), whereas in the active form it becomes mobile with conformational fluctuations occurring on the µsec-msec timescale. Notably, CPMG relaxation dispersions experiments performed on K659E also showed significant relaxation dispersions for F645 and the surrounding methyl groups of I541 and I547. These data further support that kinase activation by A-loop phosphorylation or by pathogenic mutations enhances conformational dynamics of the enzyme and leads to a weakening of the DFG latch consistent with our structural analysis. Thus, the observed conformation of F645 side chain seen in the static X-ray structures of activated FGFR kinases represents the thermodynamically most stable orientation of the highly mobile phenyl ring in the active state. Our data are consistent with the previously published NMR data for other activated protein kinases including protein kinase A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Masterson et al., 2008</xref>) and p38 MAP kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vogtherr et al., 2006</xref>), which also showed broadening around the DFG motif. Hence, it appears that enhanced conformational dynamics on the µsec-msec timescale for the DFG motif upon activation might be a general feature of all protein kinases.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>CHESCA analyses of the panel of five gain-of-function mutations at K659 in the A-loop provide further support for long-range allostery</title><p>To gain further insight into the trajectory of the long-range allosteric network, we applied chemical shift covariance analysis (CHESCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Selvaratnam et al., 2011</xref>) to the backbone chemical shift data of unphosphorylated and A-loop phosphorylated wild-type and unphosphorylated mutated FGFR2Ks carrying a pathogenic mutation at lysine 659 (K659T, K659Q, K659N, K659M, K659E). Specifically, inter-residue pairwise correlations (|r<sub>ij</sub>| &gt; 0.97) were clustered using the complete linkage clustering approach as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Selvaratnam et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boulton et al., 2014</xref>). Three individual clusters of residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C,D</xref>) were found to each match closely with the relative kinase activities of the K659 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, the single value decomposition method was used to show that each of these residues within the individual clusters aligned along the same principle component axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>), which further confirmed the existence of a common allosteric network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Selvaratnam et al., 2011</xref>). In total, 18 residues were found to comprise the same allosteric network shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C and D</xref>. Mapping these sites onto the autoinhibited FGFR1K structure (PDB ID: 3KY2) illuminated a network of allosterically coupled residues belonging to the catalytic loop (D626 to N631), region surrounding the molecular brake (T635), αF helix (F689), Gly-rich loop (G488, F492), and A-loop (A643). The identification of A643, which is located immediately before D644 of the DFG motif, is harmonious with the crystallographically deduced role of the DFG latch as a conduit in the allostery transmission from the A-loop to the molecular brake. Likewise the identification of D626 and other catalytic loop residues by CHESCA strongly supports a major conformational change of the A-loop between the inhibited and activated structures, which is induced by A-loop tyrosine phosphorylation and mimicked by pathogenic mutations. As mentioned earlier, in the autoinhibited FGFRK structures (e.g., FGFR1K, PDB ID: 3KY2), D623 in FGFR1K corresponding to D626 in FGFR2K engages in a salt bridge with R661 from the A-loop thereby blocking the substrate-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Upon activation this arginine residue disengages from the aspartate and makes a cation-Π interaction with the incoming substrate tyrosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). Taken together, the chemical shift perturbation data and CHESCA analysis support the existence of an allosteric connectivity between the molecular brake and A-loop that is mediated through the DFG latch and αC tether. Importantly, the regions of the kinase identified using CHESCA match to those identified by CPMG experiments, although the latter method detected additional residues involved in the conversion between the activated and autoinhibited conformations not picked up by CHESCA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>ATP binding is a poor extrinsic effector of the conformational balance between the active and inhibited states</title><p>Binding of ATP into the cleft between the N- and C-lobes of the kinase involves residues from the molecular brake and the conserved DFG motif. Notably the amino group of the ATP adenine ring makes a direct hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of an FGFR-invariant glutamic acid whose side chain is a central mediator of the hydrogen bonding network at the molecular brake. Moreover, the conserved aspartic acid from the tyrosine kinase-invariant DFG motif participates in ATP binding by coordinating a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion in concert with the α and β phosphate groups of ATP. Based on these structural observations, ATP binding may potentially promote the active state conformation of FGFRK by impinging on the molecular brake and DFG latch regions, which form part of the allosteric communication network we propose in our study. However, a direct comparison of the crystal structures of inhibited and activated kinases in complex with AMP-PCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mohammadi et al., 1996b</xref>), a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, clearly shows that ATP binding alone is ineffective in altering the hydrogen bonding network of the molecular brake or switching the phenylalanine position in the DFG latch. In other words, despite binding the ATP analog, unphosphorylated FGFRK remains in the inhibited conformation. Notably, in contrast to the fully ordered ATP analog in the crystal structure of the phosphorylated kinase-ATP complex, only the adenosine portion of the ATP analog is ordered in the crystal structure of unphosphorylated kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This is due to the fact that the DFG conformation for the unphosphorylated kinase is not permissive for Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion coordination by the conserved aspartic acid resulting in a disordered state of the phosphate moieties within the ATP analog. It is also noteworthy that the adenosine of the bound analog exhibits a high-temperature factor further suggesting a less tightly bound conformation by the unphosphorylated kinase. Therefore, compared to pathogenic mutations that directly target the four regions of the allosteric network, ATP is a poor extrinsic effector of conformational equilibrium between the active and inhibited states.</p><p>To support these static crystallographic observations, we acquired NMR spectra aimed at probing chemical shift perturbations induced upon AMP-PCP binding in solution. Specifically, we compared the <sup>1</sup>H/<sup>13</sup>C Ile/Val/Leu methyl and <sup>1</sup>H/<sup>15</sup>N amide chemical shift changes upon addition of a saturating amount of AMP-PCP:Mg<sup>2+</sup> mix. The rationale behind comparing chemical shifts is essentially the same as that described above for probing the effect of A-loop phosphorylation. Namely, if ATP binding facilitated a conformational switch of the autoinhibited kinase to the activated state, then we would detect significant chemical shift perturbations in C-lobe residues that tether the A-loop tyrosines to the C-lobe. As expected, addition of AMP-PCP induced large chemical shift changes for residues in the proximity of the ATP binding pocket including the ‘gatekeeper’ residue (V564) and glycine-rich loop residues (i.e. G488, G490). By contrast, most C-lobe residues including residues V691 and L712, that tether A-loop tyrosine to the C-lobe, were completely insensitive to the presence of AMP-PCP or experienced only minor perturbations (i.e. L675) implying that nucleotide binding does not significantly impact the A-loop conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, phosphorylation at Y657 induced several major chemical shift changes in the kinase C-lobe. Hence, in agreement with X-ray data, the NMR results also demonstrate that AMP-PCP (mimic of ATP) binding to an autoinhibited enzyme cannot force the A-loop to the active conformation. Therefore, compared to pathogenic mutations that directly target the four regions of the allosteric network, ATP is a relatively poor extrinsic effector of conformational switching between the active and inhibited states. Furthermore, given that ATP concentration in the cytosol is relatively constant between 1 and 10 mM, ATP is unlikely to serve as a physiological means in modulating intrinsic dynamics of the FGFRK.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Multi-site design of allosteric network minimizes the deleterious impact of gain-of-function pathogenic mutations while creating multiple entry points for opportunistic mutations</title><p>The kinase activity data establish that none of the FGFR2K pathogenic mutants are capable of achieving the activity exerted by A-loop phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

Specifically, three out of the four sites of the allosteric network (molecular brake, DFG latch, A-loop plug) mediate strong hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic intramolecular contacts that repress the kinase from adopting an active conformation. Only the αC tether site provides van der Waals forces to encourage the active conformation. Thus, evolution of the FGFR kinase structure has favored a biased design to impose tight autoinhibition on the kinase that severely limits the ability of the enzyme to adopt the active state. Consequently, mutational derepression of only one of the three autoinhibitory sites (molecular brake, DFG latch or A-loop plug) or mutational strengthening of the αC tether alone does not completely convert the kinase to the active state, which implies that mutation in one site partially accesses the conformation of the remaining three sites. In other words, A-loop phosphorylation and the subsequent formation of an intra-loop pTyr-Arg salt bridge is the most effective way to fully couple the four sites to give rise to the largest fraction of activated kinase population. Notably, the differential abilities of pathogenic mutations to couple all four sites translate into differences in active state populations for these mutations which correlate with the gradations in gain-of-function and the associated clinical severity found in skeletal syndromes caused by the mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The multi-site design of the allosteric network implies that double mutations from two sites may work in conjunction to push the kinase toward the active state. To test this hypothesis, we engineered the following double mutants that combine mutations from two different sites namely: molecular brake and A-loop (E565A/K659M), molecular brake and DFG latch (E565A/I547V and E565A/L617M), molecular brake and αC tether (E565A/D650V, and E565A/M537I), and DFG latch and αC tether (I547V/M537I and L617M/D650V) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). In order to assess whether strengthening the αC tether alone could overcome the repressive forces that are exerted by three autoinhibitory sites, an additional M537I/D650V double mutant was also prepared. Lastly, as a control, we constructed the N549H/E565A double mutant in which two mutations target the same allosteric site (i.e. the molecular brake). The activities of the double mutants were directly compared against those of respective single mutants as well as the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated WT kinases using a mass spectrometry-based in vitro substrate phosphorylation assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>, the activities of all double mutants targeting different allosteric regions were higher than the individual mutants. In fact, the activity of the E565A/K659M double mutant nearly reached the maximal activity achieved by A-loop phosphorylated WT FGFR2K. The D650V/M537I mutant was more active than either of the D650V and M537I single mutants as well as their added activities, but was unable to reach the activity of the A-loop phosphorylated WT kinase. By contrast, double mutants targeting the same allosteric site (N549H/E565A) or two adjoining sites (I547V/E565A) gave only a subtle increase in activity beyond those of the single mutants. This lack of synergy between N549H and E565A mutations in elevating kinase activity is expected as either mutation alone is sufficient to disrupt the hydrogen bonding network at the molecular brake. These extensive kinase assay data show that double mutations among the four sites of the allosteric network can reinforce each other in increasing the enzymatic activity. The physiological evidence for synergism between gain-of-function mutations is provided by a recent discovery of a rare case of Thanatophoric Dysplasia (TD) caused by double missense FGFR3 mutations in cis (N540K and V555M) located in the molecular brake and near the DFG latch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pannier et al., 2009</xref>). While the N540K mutation accounts for 70% of Hypochondroplasia cases and results in a mild form of dwarfism, the combination of this mutation with V555M results in TD, a neonatal lethal skeletal syndrome, presumably due to greater gain-of-function of the double mutant relative to the single mutations alone.<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21137.020</object-id><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Combined mutations from two sites of the allosteric network further stabilize the active state conformation of FGFR2K.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of substrate phosphorylation activities of nine double mutants that carry combined mutations from the same site (N549H/E565A) or two different sites.

In agreement with their elevated kinase activities, both double mutants crystallized in an activated conformation displaying an active A-loop conformation, a disengaged molecular brake, a weakened DFG latch and an engaged αC tether (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Taken together with our extensive structural and functional results on single mutants, these data on the double mutants further support a four-site long-range allosteric network that controls FGFRK conformational dynamics and activity. Although the four-site design of the allosteric network introduces additional entry points for pathogenic mutations, we surmise it might be more advantageous over a single switch mechanism from a pathophysiological perspective. Specifically, pathogenic mutations in a one-switch mechanism involving idealized cooperativity would fully activate the kinase thus leading to more dire consequences than in the multi-site mechanism where a single mutation can only achieve partial kinase activation. Since the probability of acquired mutations simultaneously occurring at two sites in a cis fashion is extremely low, we propose that this multi-site mechanism has evolved as a defense mechanism to diminish the detrimental effects of opportunistic mutations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Protein expression, purification, and crystallization</title><p>The cDNA fragments encoding residues P455 to E765 of human FGFR1c (Accession code: P11362-1), P458 to E768 of human FGFR2c (Accession code: P21802-1) were amplified by PCR and subcloned into a pET bacterial expression vector with an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal 6XHis-tag to aid in protein purification.

Of particular interest is the finding that in the active conformation many regions of a FGFR kinase, including the DFG motif, is more flexible than in the inactive conformation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While this paper is primarily concerned with autoinhibition <italic>FGFR2</italic> kinase, a definitive crystal structure of the auto-inhibited kinae remains unavailable. The only one discussed in the manuscript (PDB: 2PSQ) was thought to be complicated by crystal lattice packing by authors. Although the functional data and NMR data implies that FGFR2K, like FGFR1K, is autoinhibited in the unphosphorylated state, no direct evidence indicates that, as this study assumes, the autoinhibited structure of FGFR2K is necessarily highly similar to the other FGFR kinases. This is a potentially important weakness of this study, especially because allosteric communication can be sensitive to subtle structural differences and vary significantly among homologue proteins. In the revision the authors need to address this issue with new data or with additional discussions.</p><p>2) Presumably in addition to changes in residue packing in key regions, ATP binding, which occurs between the molecule brake and the DFG motif, may also affect the balance between the active and the inactive conformations of FGFR2K. This should be addressed in the revision.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> shows that different members in the FGFR family respond differently to mutations. This raises doubts as to whether the findings with FGFR2K will be generally applicable across all members of this family protein.</p><p>4) The reviewers take issue with the choice of the key terms the manuscript uses. Specifically, the reviewers question the usage of the terms &quot;allosteric networks&quot; and &quot;switches&quot; in describing the findings. By way of analogy, one can assume two proteins bind through an extensive interface and a mutation at the interface that abolishes the binding. This would disrupt the interface interactions, including those involving residues distal to the mutation site, but it would be inappropriate to describe the binding interface as an allosteric network and the mutated residues as switches, despite the distal affects. The reviewers think, for similar reasons, the two terms may not be appropriate to describe this work, which identifies key structural determinants involved in FGFR autoinhibition and activation. It appears that the mutational data (including those that have pathogenic effects and those that are rationally introduced by authors) can also be explained just by the structure features captured in crystal structures, without invoking the concept of a &quot;four switch allosteric network&quot;. DFG, α-C and activation loop are already well known important elements for kinase activation. The reviewers suggest that the authors explain why the usage of these terms are necessary or use different terms.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21137.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) While this paper is primarily concerned with autoinhibition FGFR2 kinase, a definitive crystal structure of the auto-inhibited kinae remains unavailable.

However, despite numerous attempts, we failed to crystallize the unphosphorylated FGFR2K in a different space group. We would like to mention that other groups have faced the same problem<sup>1</sup>. Evidently, strong lattice contact forces prevail and conceal a truly autoinhibited conformation of the A-loop in FGFR2K. To overcome this problem, we decided to carry out additional NMR experiments to assess the conformation of the A-loop of FGFR2K in solution (free of lattice contacts). As discussed in the manuscript (Results and Discussion), the conformations of A-loop in both the crystal structures of unphosphorylated FGFR1K (3KY2) and FGFR4K (4QQT) are essentially identical and both show the A-loop tyrosines to pack tightly against the C-lobe. In stark contrast, in the FGFR2K structure (2PSQ) the N-terminal half of A-loop adopts an active-like conformation while the C-terminal half of A-loop adopts an alternative conformation (neither inhibited nor active). Importantly, in 2PSQ, the A-loop tyrosine residues face away from the C-lobe and are completely solvent exposed. Based on these crystallographic data, we devised two NMR experiments to obtain proximity information between the A-loop tyrosines and the C-lobe in the unphosphorylated FGFR2K in solution that would help resolve ambiguity regarding the A-loop conformation:</p><p>A) In the first approach, we analyzed the chemical shift differences between the unphosphorylated and monophosphorylated (pY657) activated FGFR2K by plotting them onto the crystal structures of unphosphorylated FGFR1K (3KY2) and FGFR2K (2PSQ). We reasoned that if the A-loop tyrosines in the unphosphorylated FGFR2K were interacting with the C-lobe as observed in the unphosphorylated FGFR1K and FGFR4K structures, then we would detect chemical shift differences upon A-loop phosphorylation for the A-loop tyrosines and for the C-lobe residues that pack against the A-loop tyrosines. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, we plotted the chemical shift perturbations onto FGFR1K and FGFR2K structures and found substantial perturbations that clustered in a region directly surrounding the location of the A-loop tyrosines in the FGFR1K structure (i.e., catalytic loop, αEF, αF, αG helices). These NMR results cannot be reconciled with the observed conformation of the A-loop in the FGFR2K structure (2PSQ) as the A-loop tyrosines in this structure do not interact with these perturbed residues in the C-lobe. This NMR analysis supports the notion that the unphosphorylated FGFR2K structure (2PSQ) represents a partially activated conformation due to crystal packing.</p><p>B) In the second approach, we carried out new NMR experiments utilizing the paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) technique to directly measure distances between A-loop tyrosine residues and the kinase C-lobe. PRE effects are strong up to a distance of ~20 Å but diminish at distances greater than ~25 Å. PRE experiments require a free cysteine for covalently linking a paramagnetic spin label onto the protein. To this end we selected I707 of FGFR2K for introducing a free cysteine since this isoleucine is positioned ideally to dissect the A-loop conformational difference between unphosphorylated FGFR2K (2PSQ) and FGFR1K/FGFR4K (3KY2/4QQT) structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In the unphosphorylated FGFR2K structure (2PSQ), the Cγ of I707 and the nitrogen atom of Y656 are ~27 Å apart, whereas the corresponding distance between V704 in Y653 in FGFR1K (3KY2) is much shorter (~15 Å). To carry out these experiments with good confidence and resolution, the I707C FGFR2K mutant was selectively labeled with <sup>15</sup>N tyrosine prior to covalently attaching an MTSL label. <sup>1</sup>H/<sup>15</sup>N HSQC experiments on the mutant sample in the absence and presence of reducing agent showed notable reductions in peak intensities for the two A-loop tyrosines in the oxidized samples that are consistent with a distance less than 20 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We estimated the distance from the intensity retention using the approach of Battiste and Wagner and calculated a value of ~19 Å. While this is slightly longer than the distance measured in the FGFR1K crystal structure (3KY2), it is within the acceptable range of experimental uncertainty stemming from the packing of MTSL against the protein (i.e., possible side-chain rotamers). Hence, as with the chemical shift data, our PRE results also imply that the A-loop conformation in the unphosphorylated FGFR2K structure (2PSQ) is not a genuinely inhibited conformation, and that in solution the A-loop of FGFR2K likely adopts a similar conformation as that displayed by the A-loops of unphosphorylated FGFR1K (3KY2) and FGFR4K (4QQT) in the crystal.</p><p><italic>2) Presumably in addition to changes in residue packing in key regions, ATP binding, which occurs between the molecule brake and the DFG motif, may also affect the balance between the active and the inactive conformations of FGFR2K. This should be addressed in the revision.</italic> </p><p>As noted by the reviewer, binding of ATP into the cleft between the N- and C-lobes of the kinase involves residues from the molecular brake and the conserved DFG motif. Notably the amino group of the ATP adenine ring makes a direct hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of an FGFR-invariant glutamic acid whose side chain is a central mediator of the hydrogen bonding network at the molecular brake. Moreover, the conserved aspartic acid from the tyrosine kinase-invariant DFG motif participates in ATP binding by coordinating a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion in concert with the α and β phosphate groups of ATP. Based on these structural observations, we concur with the reviewer that ATP binding may potentially promote the active state conformation of FGFR kinase by impinging on the molecular brake and DFG latch regions which form part of the allosteric communication network we propose in our study. However, a direct comparison of the crystal structures of inhibited and activated kinases in complex with AMP-PCP, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, clearly shows that ATP binding alone is ineffective in altering the hydrogen bonding network of the molecular brake or switching the phenylalanine position in the DFG latch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2</xref></sup>. In other words, despite binding to the ATP analog, the unphosphorylated FGFR kinase remains in the inhibited conformation. Notably, in contrast to the fully ordered ATP analog in the crystal structure of the phosphorylated kinase-ATP complex, only the adenosine portion of the ATP analog is ordered in the crystal structure of unphosphorylated kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This is due to the fact that the DFG conformation for the unphosphorylated kinase is not permissive for Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion coordination by the conserved aspartic acid resulting in a disordered state of the phosphate moieties within the ATP analog. It is also noteworthy that the adenosine ring of the bound analog exhibits a high temperature factor further suggesting a less tightly bound conformation by the unphosphorylated kinase.</p><p>To support these static crystallographic observations, we acquired new NMR spectra aimed at probing chemical shift perturbations induced upon AMP-PCP binding in solution. Specifically, we compared the <sup>1</sup>H/<sup>13</sup>C Ile/Val/Leu methyl and <sup>1</sup>H/<sup>15</sup>N amide chemical shift changes upon addition of a saturating amount of AMP-PCP:Mg<sup>2+</sup> mix. The rationale behind comparing chemical shifts is essentially the same as that described above for probing the effect of A-loop phosphorylation. Namely, if ATP binding facilitated a conformational switch of the autoinhibited kinase to the activated state, then we would detect significant chemical shift perturbations in C-lobe residues that tether the A-loop tyrosines to the C-lobe. As expected, addition of AMP-PCP induced large chemical shift changes for residues in the proximity of the ATP binding pocket including the “gatekeeper” residue (V564) and glycine-rich loop residues (i.e., G488, G490). By contrast, most C-lobe residues including residues V691 and L712, that tether A-loop tyrosine to the C-lobe, were completely insensitive to the presence of AMP-PCP or experienced only minor perturbations (i.e., L675) implying that nucleotide binding does not significantly impact the A-loop conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, phosphorylation at Y657 induced several major chemical shift changes in the kinase C-lobe. Hence, in agreement with X-ray data, the NMR results also demonstrate that AMP-PCP (mimic of ATP) binding to an autoinhibited enzyme cannot force the A-loop to the active conformation. Therefore, compared to pathogenic mutations that directly target the four regions of the allosteric network, ATP is a relatively poor extrinsic effector of conformational switching between the active and inhibited states. Furthermore, given that ATP concentration in the cytosol is relatively constant between 1-10 mM, ATP is unlikely to serve as a physiological means in modulating intrinsic dynamics of the FGFR kinase.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> shows that different members in the FGFR family respond differently to mutations. This raises doubts as to whether the findings with FGFR2K will be generally applicable across all members of this family protein.</italic> </p><p>We are a bit puzzled by this comment because all the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> including those in the inset pertain to the FGFR2K isoform only. Specifically, the data in the main part of 7B show the activities of point mutations in FGFR2K that strengthen the αC tether and lead to gain-of-function while the data in the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> show the activities of the FGFR2K mutations that weaken the αC tether and lead to loss-of-function. These functional data are congruent with our hypothesis that residues with smaller side chains and hence weaker van der Waals packing potential (e.g., D650G, M537A, M540A) lead to poorer αC tether formation, while larger residue substitutions such as D650L and M537I are better adept at forming the αC tether and stabilizing the activated form of FGFR2K.</p><p>So perhaps the reviewers were referring to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> contain activities of FGFR1K (in the inset) and FGFR2K (in the main part) isoforms. The activity data for I544V and L614V of FGFR1K shown in the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> should be directly compared to those for I547V and L617V of FGFR2K in the main part of the panel. Consistent with the conservation of the allosteric network among FGFR isoforms, similar mutations in FGFR1K and FGFR2K both lead to kinase activation by influencing the DFG latch. While there is a two-fold difference in activity between L617V of FGFR2K and L614V of FGFR1K, we emphasize that the only appropriate conclusion to be drawn is that both mutations are activating. Analyzing quantitative differences among isoforms would have to factor in additional sequence differences that might favor one amino acid substitution over the other. This is a challenging endeavor which we plan to address in future studies focused on delineating subtle differences in the composition of the allosteric network that give rise to subtle differential activities of the four FGFR isoforms. Instead we only comment on the activating nature of the mutations, which is consistent with the shared DFG latch hypothesis among different FGFRK isoforms. To avoid any potential confusion to the readers, in the revised version of the manuscript we have stated explicitly that the inset data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> correspond to loss-of-function FGFR2K mutations and those inset data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> correspond to FGFR1K mutations.</p><p><italic>4) The reviewers take issue with the choice of the key terms the manuscript uses. Specifically, the reviewers question the usage of the terms &quot;allosteric networks&quot; and &quot;switches&quot; in describing the findings. By way of analogy, one can assume two proteins bind through an extensive interface and a mutation at the interface that abolishes the binding. This would disrupt the interface interactions, including those involving residues distal to the mutation site, but it would be inappropriate to describe the binding interface as an allosteric network and the mutated residues as switches, despite the distal affects.

It appears that the mutational data (including those that have pathogenic effects and those that are rationally introduced by authors) can also be explained just by the structure features captured in crystal structures, without invoking the concept of a &quot;four switch allosteric network&quot;. DFG, α-C and activation loop are already well known important elements for kinase activation. The reviewers suggest that the authors explain why the usage of these terms are necessary or use different terms.</italic> </p><p>The term allostery is commonly used to describe intramolecular long-range structural or dynamic changes between remote sites in proteins that control functional conformational equilibria in protein. This usage of the allostery term has been consistently employed over the last decade (see references: Motlagh et al. 2014, The ensemble nature of allostery, Nature 508, 331-339; Hilser 2010, An ensemble view of allostery, Science 327, 653-654; Kar et al. 2010, Allostery and population shift in drug discovery, Curr Opin Pharmacol 10, 715-722; Tsai and Nussinov 2014, A unified view of “how allostery works”, PLoS Comput Biol 10, e1003394) and was stated concisely in a recent Commentary published in <italic>PNAS</italic> by Melacini et al. (2016, <italic>PNAS</italic> 113, 9407-9):</p><p><italic>“One of the broadest definitions of allostery is in terms of long-range couplings between remote sites within a molecular system.”</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, we used a combination of structural (X-ray and NMR) and functional methods to characterize a set of naturally selected pathogenic gain-of-function mutations allowing us to identify four dynamically coupled regions in FGFR kinase that form a long-range allosteric conduit. These four regions are involved in regulating the kinase conformational exchange between activated and inhibited states. We describe NMR data showing that structural perturbations induced by a pathogenic gain-of-function mutation in one region propagate to the remaining sites to affect the composition/packing and ultimately alter the ratio of inactive:active kinase equilibrium. Hence, we believe that usage of the term “allosteric network” is justified and consistent with published literature.</p><p>With regard to the reviewers’ analogy with interfacial interactions between two proteins, we agree that the entire surface does not automatically constitute an allosteric network. However, if a mutation within one position on the surface caused an intramolecular conformational change at a distant site on the surface in the same protein, this may constitute an interconnected allosteric network provided that the conformational change at the distant site further reduced the binding affinity in addition to the effect of the mutation. We think this refined analogy is a more apt comparison with what we have observed in FGFR kinase. Indeed, we measured the effects of distant structural perturbations within the monomeric enzyme using NMR and showed using kinase assays that double mutations gave an additive functional effect, which is consistent with long-range communication (i.e., an allosteric network). With regard to the other term, “switch”, we agree with the reviewers that this terminology may be unconventional and we have replaced it with “site” in the revised manuscript.</p><p>As to the DFG-latch and αC tether terminology, we are not using these terms to refer to the canonical DFG motif and αC helix which are well known elements in kinase activation as the reviewer mentioned. Rather, these terms are used to describe two previously unrecognized clusters of interactive residues that cooperate to modulate kinase dynamics. The DFG latch refers to a network of hydrophobic contacts centered around the phenylalanine of the DFG motif that discourages the rotation/movement of the αC helix towards the C-lobe of the enzyme. Conversely, the αC tether refers to a set of hydrophobic/van der Waals contacts between hydrophobic residues on the αC helix and the A-loop that encourages rotation/movement of the αC helix towards the C-lobe. Neither of these two clusters were known in the field, which we discovered by studying the effects of naturally occurring gain-of-function mutations in FGFR kinases. We have now revised the text to better highlight our discovery of these two new allosteric sites.</p><p>References:</p><p>1) Eathiraj, S. et al.
