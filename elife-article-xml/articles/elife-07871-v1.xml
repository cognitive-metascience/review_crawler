crucial role in learning and memory. It remains unclear how NMDAR might contribute to the wiring of adult-born granule cells (GCs). Here we demonstrate that nascent GCs lacking NMDARs but rescued from apoptosis by overexpressing the pro-survival protein Bcl2 were deficient in spine formation. Insufficient spinogenesis might be a general cause of cell death restricted within the NMDAR-dependent critical time window for GC survival. NMDAR loss also led to enhanced mushroom spine formation and synaptic AMPAR activity throughout the development of newborn GCs. Moreover, similar elevated synapse maturation in the absence of NMDARs was observed in neonate-generated GCs and CA1 pyramidal neurons. Together, these data suggest that NMDAR operates as a molecular monitor for controlling the activity-dependent establishment and maturation rate of synaptic connections between newborn neurons and others.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07871.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07871.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07871.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain contains billions of cells called neurons. Although most neurons have already formed by the time we are born, part of the brain called the hippocampus produces new neurons throughout our life. These new neurons are thought to be important for learning and forming new memories.</p><p>Neurons send signals to each other across connections called synapses. Small protrusions called spines stick out of the neuron and each tends to have one synapse that receives a signal from another neuron. Via these connections, the neurons are organized into networks and circuits that control how different parts of the brain work. Therefore, once new neurons are made, they also need to be connected to the correct neurons.</p><p>The NMDA receptor is found in the surface of neurons, and mutated neurons that lack this receptor often die shortly after birth. The NMDA receptor is also known to be important for organizing synapses. Exactly how NMDA receptors help new neurons to survive and integrate into circuits has not been investigated in detail. Mu, Zhao et al. now address this issue by using mice in which a gene called NR1, which produces one of the proteins that makes up the NMDA receptor, can be deleted at specific stages of neuron development.</p><p>Analyzing brain slices from the mice showed that deleting NR1 from newly-formed neurons caused them to die within two or three weeks. When these neurons were forced to survive, they had fewer spines than normal.</p><p>By contrast, deleting NR1 from neurons that has already survived for longer than four weeks did not alter how many spines the neurons had. Instead, the synapses on the spines worked better. Mu, Zhao et al. therefore suggest that NMDA receptors have different roles at different stages of a neuron's development. Initially, NMDA receptors help the neurons to survive and form spines. The receptors then help to ensure the spines become the correct size, and enable the neurons to connect into the right neural circuits by helping to control the strength of synapses.</p><p>Mu, Zhao et al. theorize that the mere presence of NMDA receptors suppresses spine maturation. Furthermore, this inhibitory effect is only released when the NMDA receptor is activated, or when the NMDA receptor is absent due to the deletion of the NR1 gene. Further studies will be needed to validate this hypothesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07871.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07871.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>NMDA receptor</kwd><kwd>adult neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>spine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000913</institution-id><institution>James S.

These neurons become granule cells (GCs), the principal neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, and they functionally integrate into the hippocampal circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van Praag et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Toni et al., 2008</xref>). This extreme form of structural remodeling, similar to many other forms of experience-dependent plasticity, requires activation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Platel and Kelsch, 2013</xref>). Blockade of NMDARs rapidly increases the proliferation of neural precursor cells, whereas stimulation of NMDARs promotes neuronal fate specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cameron et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deisseroth et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, deletion of the NMDAR subunit NR1 reduces the survival rate of adult-born GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tashiro et al., 2006a</xref>). Other than these studies, the role of NMDAR in circuit assembly during new neuron development has so far received little attention, even though NMDAR has been primarily known for its involvement in synapse organization and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Constantine-Paton, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Malenka and Nicoll, 1993</xref>).</p><p>The wiring of new neurons in mature circuits involves a coordinated series of events, from the initial cell contact to the final maturation of functional synapses. Not only the cells themselves but also the connections between newly recruited members and their old counterparts are survivors of a selection process depending upon neuronal activity patterns. The vast majority of excitatory inputs are received by small bulbous protrusions residing on the dendrites of glutamatergic neurons, called dendritic spines. In newborn GCs, dendritic spines first appear around 16 days after neuronal birth. The spine density increases sharply before cells reach 4 weeks of age and continues to increase at a slower pace until reaching a plateau at 8 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>). Notably, the NMDAR-dependent survival/death of adult-born GCs is restricted to the time window of 2–3 weeks after neuronal birth, shortly after formation of the first dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tashiro et al., 2006a</xref>). This temporal overlap suggests that the survival of newborn GCs may be related to the state of spinogenesis or synaptogenesis. Indeed, cell death can be induced by non-innervation at the peak of synaptogenesis during embryonic and postnatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Naruse and Keino, 1995</xref>). Since activation of NMDARs has been shown to support new spine formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Maletic-Savatic et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kwon and Sabatini, 2011</xref>), we hypothesize that NMDAR is required for initial spine gain on dendrites of newborn GCs and that insufficient spine growth may be the underlying cause of the cell death associated with the genetic deletion of the NMDAR subunit NR1 in newborn GCs.</p><p>There is a positive correlation between spine volume and the number of AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptors (AMPARs) or, more generally, the synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Matsuzaki et al., 2001</xref>), supporting the model that spine outgrowth and enlargement are tightly coupled to the formation and maturation of glutamatergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zito et al., 2009</xref>). Subject to activity-dependent modifications, spines are highly dynamic in their number, shape and size. Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) at mature synapses, expressed by synaptic insertion and removal of AMPARs, respectively, are associated with NMDAR-dependent enlargement and shrinkage of dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yuste and Bonhoeffer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhou et al., 2004</xref>). Stimuli that induce LTP or LTD may also result in rapid outgrowth or loss of spines, and these changes can be prevented by NMDAR blockers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Engert and Bonhoeffer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Toni et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nagerl et al., 2004</xref>). The structural plasticity of spines is thought to complement functional plasticity (e.g., LTP and LTD) and play a central role in learning and memory in mature animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bourne and Harris, 2007</xref>). In contrast, emerging evidence suggests that, during early postnatal development, AMPARs can be delivered to spines independently of NMDAR signaling. NMDARs actually restrict AMPAR trafficking to the postsynaptic density and limit synapse maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ultanir et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adesnik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gray et al., 2011</xref>). Due to variables in experimental designs, the observed opposite effects of NMDARs on AMPAR recruitment in developing vs mature neurons need further examination. Adult-born neurons undergo a long process of maturation resembling embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Esposito et al., 2005</xref>); however, adult neurogenesis happens in mature circuits that differ substantially from the developing brain. We aimed to characterize NMDAR functions during integration of new GCs into the circuit at distinct stages of their development using the tool of single-cell gene deletion and labeling.</p><p>To address the above issues, we performed an analysis of spine morphogenesis in immature NR1 knockout (KO) GCs that either survived naturally or were rescued by the apoptosis regulator Bcl-2. Both groups of cells were found to be deficient in spine formation. In parallel, we observed an elevation in mushroom spine density and in synaptic AMPAR activity in the absence of NR1. Furthermore, NMDAR loss initiated at a later stage of GC development, similar to NR1 KO in fully mature GCs or CA1 pyramidal neurons, resulted in enhanced functional synapses without affecting total spine numbers. Thus, NMDAR appears to play two distinct roles during GC development. First, it promotes the initial spine formation and its presence is required for the survival of immature GCs. Second, the receptors monitor spine enlargement and the recruitment of AMPAR once spines are formed. Both aspects of NMDAR function contribute to experience-driven construction of circuits formed by new neurons, even though NMDAR signaling might make less of a contribution to the control of overall spine density upon neuronal maturation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NMDAR loss in newborn GCs leads to decreased spine density and increased mushroom spine density</title><p>To determine the role of NMDAR in circuit assembly of new neurons in the adult brain, we first examined the morphology of NR1 KO GCs at 4 weeks of age.

When tested in the ROSA-lacZ reporter mice, rv GFP-ires-cre induced recombination in 97% of GFP+ cells at 6 days post infection (dpi) and in all GFP+ cells at 14 and 28 dpi.

There was no obvious difference in overall cell morphology between NR1 KO and WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Dendritic tracing with the ICL TRACE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://synapses.clm.utexas.edu/tools/trace/trace.stm">http://synapses.clm.utexas.edu/tools/trace/trace.stm</ext-link>) showed that WT and KO cells were similar in both dendritic length (WT: 601.8 ± 36.6, n = 47 frames, KO: 515.1 ± 29.3, n = 38 frames, p = 0.08) and branching points (WT: 5.92 ± 0.33, KO: 5.68 ± 0.37, p = 0.64). These data indicate that gross development of dendrites does not require NMDARs. However, detailed analyses of the dendritic segments in the outer third of the molecular layer revealed significant differences between WT and KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). According to the criteria described by Harris and Yuste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harris et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Parnass et al., 2000</xref>), all dendritic protrusions were classified into four categories: filopodia, stubby, thin and mushroom spines. Briefly, ‘stubby’ were neckless spines whose head diameters were about equal to their lengths. Spines were defined as ‘filopodia’ if they were long, thin and did not have a head. In contrast, ‘thin’ spines had long, thin necks and obvious heads. ‘Mushroom’ spines were similar to ‘thin’ spines in shape, but with larger heads (see ‘Materials and methods’). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, total spine density was significantly decreased in NR1 KO cells (WT: 2.14 ± 0.08, n = 59 frames, KO: 1.53 ± 0.09, n = 37 frames, p &lt; 0.0001). Surprisingly, the percentage of mushroom type relative to total spine numbers was drastically enhanced, whereas the other spine types remained unchanged (p &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In line with this observation, mushroom spine density was increased by more than twofold in NR1 KO cells (WT: 0.026 ± 0.004, KO: 0.064 ± 0.010, p = 0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). A cumulative probability graph of the size of all measured spines showed that the spine head area in NR1 KO cells was bigger than that in control cells (p &lt; 0.0001, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>).</p><p>The size of the spine head has been positively correlated with synaptic AMPAR level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Matsuzaki et al., 2001</xref>). Since NR1 KO cells displayed increased mushroom spines, we postulated that NMDAR KO cells might have more synaptic AMPAR activity. Therefore, we measured AMPAR-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). While mEPSCs were infrequent in mCherry+GFP− NR1 WT cells, they were evident in GFP+ NR1 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Both the amplitude and frequency of mEPSCs were significantly increased in neurons lacking NR1 as compared to control cells (WT: n = 5 cells, KO: n = 6 cells, p &lt; 0.001, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K,L</xref>). These data confirmed that NR1 KO cells had enhanced functional glutamatergic synapses. Utilizing serial immuno-electron microscopy for GFP, we consistently observed that GFP+ dendritic spines were associated with GFP− axon terminals containing presynaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), verifying that newborn NR1-null GCs could form normal synapses. We also noted that all stubby, thin and mushroom spines were asymmetric and presumably excitatory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). While the axo-dendritic synapses located on dendritic shafts had a typical morphology of symmetric or GABAergic synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), they could be initially excitatory in newly born GCs due to the high intracellular chloride concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ge et al., 2006</xref>). Total head volumes of randomly selected spines averaged 0.035 ± 0.005 µm<sup>3</sup> (n = 130 spines) and 0.078 ± 0.014 µm<sup>3</sup> (n = 74 spines) in WT and NR1 KO GCs, respectively, indicating a significant difference between these two groups (p = 0.0008; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, we found that this difference was mainly due to increased volume of big or mushroom spines in NR1 KO neurons, whereas the volumes of small spines (presumably filopodia or thin) were roughly the same across groups. These results suggest that changes in the amount of depolarization-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx may affect the survival of nascent neurons, although the role of a possible re-distribution of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through different spine categories cannot be excluded.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07871.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Electron microscopic description of dendritic spines.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Electron micrograph illustrating dendrites of newborn NR1 KO neurons.

To clarify this issue, we engineered a new retroviral vector expressing a fusion protein of the pro-survival gene Bcl2 and GFP in addition to Cre recombinase (rv GFPBcl2-ires-cre; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) to prevent NR1 KO cells from dying. The logic behind this set of experiments is: NR1 deletion in new GCs results in certain defects that eventually lead to cell death. Since Bcl2 is an important anti-apoptotic protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tsujimoto et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cleary et al., 1986</xref>), it may suppress apoptosis and drive NR1 KO cells to survive even though they have deficiencies. Therefore, neurons rescued by Bcl2 expression should exhibit features distinct from those surviving normally, and these differences presumably reflect defects caused by NR1 loss. We first tested the virus efficiency of cell death regulation in WT C57Bl/6 mice. In line with prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dayer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tashiro et al., 2006b</xref>), within 28 dpi of rv CAG-GFP, we found a significant decrease in the quantity of GFP+ GCs in C57Bl/6 mice (GFP, relative cell number to that of 14 dpi, 14 dpi: 1.00 ± 0.11, n = 5 mice, 28 dpi: 0.30 ± 0.22, n = 4 mice, p = 0.019; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Because the fluorescent signal from GFPBcl2 fusion protein was not strong enough for morphological analyses, rv GFPBcl2-ires-cre was injected together with rv CAG-GFP. In this case, we identified rv GFPBcl2-ires-cre targeted cells by Cre immunostaining and imaged Cre+GFP+ cells when the newborn cells were 4 weeks old (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). GFP-labeled GCs from animals injected with pure rv CAG-GFP or rv GFP-ires-cre were imaged in parallel for control purposes. In C57Bl/6 mice, Bcl2-expressing cells displayed decreased dendritic length (GFP: 378.2 ± 32.0, n = 58 frames, cre: 351.5 ± 45.6, n = 33 frames, Bcl2: 283.8 ± 22.0, n = 93 frames, p = 0.013 Bcl2 vs GFP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The number of dendritic branching points was not significantly different between the samples (GFP: 5.2 ± 0.3, cre: 4.9 ± 1.5, Bcl2: 4.4 ± 0.2, p = 0.056 Bcl2 vs GFP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Similarly, in <italic>Grin1</italic><sup><italic>f/f</italic></sup> mice, Bcl2-expressing cells displayed a significant decrease in dendritic length (GFP: 342.4 ± 32.9, n = 55 frames, cre: 302.7 ± 22.8, n = 85 frames, Bcl2: 256.0 ± 18.0, n = 133 frames, p = 0.014 Bcl2 vs GFP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) but not in branching points (GFP: 5.4 ± 0.4, cre: 5.1 ± 0.3, Bcl2: 4.7 ± 0.3, p = 0.14 Bcl2 vs GFP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Since NR1 KO neurons did not display impairment of dendrite length and complexity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>), we infer from these data that Bcl2 expression promoted survival of a mixed population of nascent GCs, including both WT and NR1 KO cells.</p><p>Detailed analyses of the dendritic processes in the outer molecular layer showed that Bcl2-expressing cells in C57Bl/6 mice had much lower total spine density (GFP: 2.13 ± 0.11, n = 28 frames, cre: 2.22 ± 0.11, n = 17 frames, Bcl2: 1.39 ± 0.14, n = 31 frames, p = 0.0001 Bcl2 vs GFP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,I</xref>). A closer examination of the data identified a unique population of dendritic branches with low spine density (&lt;1.5 spines/µm) in the Bcl2-expressing group but not in samples expressing GFP or Cre alone, although the cumulative fractions of spine counts in these groups were not statistically different (p &gt; 0.1, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). However, neither the mushroom spine density (GFP: 0.015 ± 0.006, cre: 0.013 ± 0.004, Bcl2: 0.017 ± 0.006) nor the percentage of mushroom spines (GFP: 0.80 ± 0.27, cre: 1.06 ± 0.30, Bcl2: 1.08 ± 0.34) relative to total number of protrusions showed any difference between samples in C57Bl/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K,L</xref>). These results suggest that WT adult-born GCs selected for death had fewer spines, specifically fewer thin spines (p &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>), as compared to those destined for survival. In <italic>Grin1</italic><sup><italic>f/f</italic></sup> mice, deletion of NMDAR in newborn GCs led to a decrease in total spine density, and the spine density was even lower in Bcl2-rescued cells (GFP: 1.96 ± 0.06, n = 68 frames, cre: 1.47 ± 0.11, n = 35 frames, Bcl2: 1.06 ± 0.08, n = 45 frames, p = 0.0054 cre vs Bcl2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M,N</xref>), whereas the cumulative distribution of total spine density did not exhibit significant differences between each pair (p &gt; 0.09, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O</xref>). We noted that, in comparison with WT GFP-expressing cells, Bcl2-expressing GCs did not show dramatically increased density (GFP: 0.028 ± 0.004, cre: 0.053 ± 0.011, Bcl2: 0.032 ± 0.007, p = 0.0092 cre vs GFP) or percentage (GFP: 1.40 ± 0.21, cre: 4.76 ± 0.66, Bcl2:2.13 ± 0.39, p &lt; 0.0001 cre vs GFP) of mushroom-like spines as naturally surviving NMDAR KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3P–Q</xref>).

Taken together, these data support that NMDAR was critical for spine outgrowth and that newborn GCs destined to die without the protection of Bcl2 were defective in spine formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mushroom spine density is increased in mature neurons upon deletion of NR1</title><p>Since Bcl2-rescued GCs exhibited a total spine reduction, but not a mushroom spine enhancement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–Q</xref>), it seems unlikely that the increases in spine volume and AMPA currents associated with NMDAR loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–L</xref>) simply represent a homeostatic change in response to the decrease of total synaptic drive. However, two scenarios may explain the increase in mushroom spines found in surviving NR1 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The alteration of spine head diameter could be a direct consequence of NMDAR loss. Alternatively, the survival selection was biased towards neurons that happened to bear lots of mushroom spines or mature synapses. To test these possibilities, we developed a cre-ER retrovirus in which the expression of GFP and the inducible Cre recombinase creER<sup>t2</sup> was bridged by the 2A sequence from Picornavirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Szymczak et al., 2004</xref>) (rv CGS-creER; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) to induce NMDAR deletion in newborn GCs after their critical time window for survival. We injected rv CGS-creER or control rv CAG-GFP into <italic>Grin1</italic><sup><italic>f/f</italic></sup> and <italic>Grin1</italic><sup><italic>f/+</italic></sup> mice, respectively, and injected oil or tamoxifen (180 mg/kg, daily for 4 days) into the animals at 28 dpi. Mouse brains were collected at 56 dpi (28 days after the induction with tamoxifen) for morphological analyses. We first quantified GFP+ cell number from <italic>Grin1</italic><sup><italic>f/f</italic></sup> mice injected with rv CGS-creER and found no significant difference between oil and tamoxifen treatment (oil: 84 ± 48, n = 4 mice, tamo: 117 ± 15, n = 4 mice, p = 0.54; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). Therefore, NMDAR activity was not required for the survival of newborn GCs that were 4 weeks old or older. Although there was no statistically significant decrease in total spine density in NMDAR KO cells (oil/creER: 2.20 ± 0.10, n = 20 frames, tamo/creER: 1.91 ± 0.12, n = 14 frames, tamo/GFP: 2.29 ± 0.11, n = 21 frames; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>), there appeared to be a strong trend of increased mushroom spine density (oil/creER: 0.133 ± 0.016, tamo/creER: 0.188 ± 0.027, tamo/GFP: 0.131 ± 0.015, p = 0.054 comparing tamo/creER with tamo/GFP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,F</xref>). In particular, the percentage of mushroom-shaped spines was markedly increased by 62% (oil/creER: 6.38 ± 0.91, tamo/creER: 10.35 ± 1.68, tamo/GFP: 6.17 ± 0.92, p = 0.024 comparing tamo/creER with tamo/GFP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).

To resolve this concern, and also to determine whether NMDAR-mediated inhibition of spine maturation was specific to GCs, we examined lv GFP-ires-cre-targeted CA1 pyramidal cells in <italic>Grin1</italic><sup><italic>f/f</italic></sup> mice at 28 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Since no neurogenesis occurs in the CA1 area, the pyramidal cells we examined in this area should be exclusively mature cells. Images of the apical and basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells were obtained from stratum lacunosum-moleculare and stratum oriens, respectively, and were analyzed separately. NMDAR KO pyramidal cells displayed a decreased total spine density in the apical dendrites but not the basal dendrites (apical GFP: 2.63 ± 0.12, n = 38 frames, cre: 2.12 ± 0.17, n = 15 frames, p = 0.023, basal GFP: 2.59 ± 0.11, n = 28 frames, cre: 2.44 ± 0.15, n = 15 frames, p = 0.44; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons have distinct compartments with differential inputs, plasticity characteristics and mechanisms crucial for integrative function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Spruston, 2008</xref>). It is possible that NMDAR subunit composition, distribution and associated signaling pathways are different in apical and basal domains. Therefore, the spine turnover rate may be low and not sufficient to amount to a visible difference in total spine number in basal but not apical dendritic branches. For example, 96% of spines in the adult mouse visual cortex remained stable through weeks of live imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grutzendler et al., 2002</xref>). Consistent with the data in lentivirus-transduced GCs, mushroom spine density was significantly higher in both apical and basal dendrites of NMDAR KO pyramidal cells (apical GFP: 0.105 ± 0.012, cre: 0.192 ± 0.034, p = 0.0037, basal GFP: 0.050 ± 0.012, cre: 0.125 ± 0.030, p = 0.0077; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

We found that NMDAR activity was required for initial spinogenesis and that a low level of spine density correlated with a defect in cell survival during the 3–4 weeks after new GCs were born, although NMDAR signaling did not appear to have a major impact on total spine numbers in mature neurons, whether they were neonate- or adult-generated. However, NMDAR was not critical for the maturation of dendritic spines once spines were formed. On the contrary, the density of mushroom spines was increased in NR1 KO GCs, accompanied by increased synaptic AMPAR activity. The latter phenomenon was observed not only in newborn GCs but also in mature GCs and CA1 pyramidal cells. Taken together, our data suggest that NMDARs serve to regulate the genesis of dendritic spines in developing neurons. Furthermore, NMDARs restrict synapse maturation and control spine morphology after spines have been formed, independently of the developmental stage.</p><p>We reported previously that NMDAR was required for the survival of newborn GCs in the adult mouse hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tashiro et al., 2006a</xref>). Through detailed analyses, we found that NMDAR KO newborn GCs that were forced to survive with the expression of the pro-survival gene Bcl2 had defects in spine growth and synaptogenesis. Because the time window of initial spine growth and synapse formation correlated with that of NMDAR-dependent cell survival, we deduced from these observations that the failure of synapse formation may be the underlying mechanism of cell death in NMDAR KO newborn GCs. In addition, we analyzed newborn GCs forced to survive through Bcl2 expression in WT mice and found that the overall population had lower total spine density compared to the cells that were selected to survive under natural conditions. This finding suggests that natural death of WT adult-born GCs might also be a result of the failure of spine formation in certain cell populations. Both voluntary exercise and enriched environment (EE) housing increased cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van Praag et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tashiro et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Muotri et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). However, unlike the forced survival through Bcl2 expression, increased survival of GCs through physical exercise or EE did not lower the average spine density of newborn GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that exercise and EE likely promote cell survival through enhancing spine formation in newborn GCs.</p><p>Many of the functional properties of NMDARs are highly sensitive to their subunit composition. Early expression of NR2A in organotypic hippocampal slices reduces the number of synapses and the volume and dynamics of spines, whereas overexpression of NR2B increases spine motility, indicating that the ratio of NR2B over NR2A controls spine motility and synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gambrill and Barria, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, overexpression of NR3A reduces spine density over time by increasing spine elimination and decreasing spine stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kehoe et al., 2014</xref>). In adult-born GCs, there is a switch in synaptic NMDAR subunit composition from predominantly NR2B to NR2A during their development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ge et al., 2007</xref>). Although the expression pattern of NR3A is unclear in nascent GCs, it is reasonable to speculate that NMDAR may be required for spine stabilization in addition to spine formation, depending on developmentally regulated synaptic expression of NMDARs containing a specific type of subunit. Alternatively, NMDARs are located not only at synapses but also at extrasynaptic sites. The roles played by extrasynaptic NMDARs are generally still elusive. It has been shown that filopodia-like protrusions or spines appear de novo after exogenous glutamate application or LTP induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Engert and Bonhoeffer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Maletic-Savatic et al., 1999</xref>), raising a possibility that extrasynaptic NMDARs participate in the regulation of new spine formation. Given that newborn GCs display high levels of NMDARs before the formation of glutamatergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schmidt-Salzmann et al., 2014</xref>), it is possible that the distinct roles of NMDARs during different stages of GC development may be attributed to different locations of NMDARs. Further study is needed to find out whether NMDAR location or subunit composition, or both, could be the determining factor of NMDAR's functional diversity.</p><p>NR1 deletion leads to decreased numbers of total spines and increased mushroom spines in developing cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ultanir et al., 2007</xref>). Here we revealed a very similar impact of NR1 loss on neurons born in the adult hippocampus and have provided additional evidence that adult neurogenesis follows a pattern resembling early development. However, the observation that NMDAR KO newborn GCs, irrespective of their age, displayed higher mushroom spine density and more synaptic AMPAR activity was unexpected. It contradicted the notion that NMDAR activity is required for spine enlargement and AMPAR recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang and Kriegstein, 2008</xref>) and cannot be interpreted simply by differences between developing and mature synapses as previously speculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ultanir et al., 2007</xref>). Several possible mechanisms could account for enhanced spine maturation in the absence of NMDAR. First, the surviving cell population could be selected to survive because those cells have more mushroom spines or functional synapses. This possibility was ruled out because we observed a similar phenomenon in newborn GCs when NR1 was deleted at a later stage, after the NMDAR-dependent critical time window for cell survival. Furthermore, mature GCs and CA1 pyramidal cells also displayed increased mushroom spine density and synaptic activity in the absence of NMDAR, supporting our conclusion that enhanced synapse maturation is not a compensatory effect of NMDAR-dependent cell survival in newborn GCs. Alternatively, elevated mushroom spines could be potentially explained by a synaptic scaling mechanism, namely, NR1 KO cells might increase AMPAR activity in compensation for the loss of NMDAR activity. Indeed, we observed that AMPAR activity was significantly enhanced in both frequency and amplitude in the absence of the functional NMDAR. However, it has been reported that NMDAR activity itself is required for synaptic scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Turrigiano et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, it is unlikely that enhanced spine maturation was a result of synaptic scaling. In an effort to resolve the discrepancy between our current observation and the traditional notion that NMDAR activity is required for AMPAR recruitment and spine enlargement, we tried to compare the systems used in our studies and others. Among the many differences between study systems, we found that one difference could potentially account for the different observations. In studies that indicated an inhibitory role for NMDAR on spine maturation and AMPAR recruitment, NMDAR activity was lost due to the deletion of the <italic>Grin1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ultanir et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adesnik et al., 2008</xref>), whereas in studies that supported NMDAR-dependent spine enlargement and AMPAR recruitment, NMDAR activity was blocked by antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Engert and Bonhoeffer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Maletic-Savatic et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhu et al., 2000</xref>). It was previously pointed out that a genetic approach might offer certain advantages over pharmacological manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ultanir et al., 2007</xref>). Here we propose that NMDAR in its inactive form inhibits spine maturation and AMPAR recruitment. The activation of NMDAR by binding of the neurotransmitter glutamate reverses its inhibitory function and allows the recruitment of AMPAR and spine enlargement. When NMDAR activity was blocked by antagonists, NMDAR was kept in its inactive state and thus prevented spine enlargement and AMPAR recruitment. However, when NMDAR was absent due to the loss of its essential subunit NR1, there was no longer inhibition from the inactive NMDAR, which resulted in uncontrolled spine enlargement and AMPAR recruitment. This hypothesis is in line with the critical role of NMDAR in LTP and reconciles the discrepancies observed when different methods were used to modulate NMDAR activity. Another possibility—not mutually exclusive—is that lack of NMDARs triggers expression of calcium-permeable AMPARs in newborn neurons and these receptors confer upon dendritic spines the ability to potentiate and to grow in the absence of NMDARs; this hypothesis awaits experimental clarification.</p><p>Experience constructs the neural network in the form of activity-dependent spine morphogenesis, which is central to memory formation and other adaptive changes of the brain. Although the current study has been mainly focused on newborn neurons in the adult brain, our findings suggest that the major neuronal activity detector, NMDAR, regulates the connectivity of specific neurons by common mechanisms in developing and mature nervous systems, including facilitation of new spine formation and control of the pace of existing spine maturation. By preventing precocious synapse maturation, NMDAR participates in ‘neoteny’, or the extension of the immature state of the brain, which is critical for subsequent and more complete maturation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p><italic>Grin1</italic> floxed mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tsien et al., 1996</xref>) and the ROSA-lacZ reporter mice (B6;129S4-Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm1sho</sup>) were maintained as homozygous in the Salk mouse facility.

In the rv GFP-ires-cre vector, the Cre cDNA was placed after the internal ribosomal entry site to minimize the expression of Cre and potentially reduce cre-associated vector recombination in bacteria. When tested in the ROSA-lacZ reporter mice, rv GFP-ires-cre induced recombination in 97% of GFP+ cells at 6 dpi and in all GFP+ cells at 14 and 28 dpi. Secondly, a retrovirus CAG-GFPBcl2-ires-cre (rv GFPBcl2-ires-cre) was constructed so that the Cre-targeted cells also expressed the fusion protein of GFP and Bcl2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, 14 dpi). This virus allowed the deletion of the <italic>Grin1</italic> gene in newborn GCs and the expression of the pro-survival protein Bcl2 in the same cells so that NR1 KO cells would be prevented from going through apoptosis. The recombination efficiency of rv GFPBcl2-ires-cre was 100% at 7 dpi. Thirdly, an inducible retrovirus CAG-GFP-t2A-creER (rv GFP-t2A-creER) was generated so that deletion of the <italic>Grin1</italic> gene could be initiated at the desired age to bypass NR1-depedent cell survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, induction at 14 dpi). To test the recombination efficiency of rv GFP-t2A-creER virus in vivo, we gave tamoxifen (180 mg/kg, daily for 4–5 days) to virus-injected ROSA26-lacZ reporter mice starting from 14 and 28 days after virus injection. At 14 dpi, we observed 16% background recombination with oil control and 85% recombination in GFP+ cells. At 28 dpi, recombination efficiency was 97%.

GFP+ cells with at least one dendritic process terminating at the outer molecular layer were randomly picked for imaging (every nth cell depending on the labeling efficiency). If the number of labeled cells from the one-in-six series was too low to allow for 5–10 cells to be imaged, more sections were sampled to obtain enough cells from an individual mouse or until all sections were used. For spine analyses, dendritic processes of GFP+ cells in the outer molecular layer were imaged with a 60× oil objective (NA 1.4, Nikon, on Bio-Rad R2100) or with a 63× oil objective (NA 1.4, Zeiss, on Zeiss 710).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Both reviewers expressed interest in this manuscript but also felt that the manuscript needs to be improved before it can be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>One reviewer wrote: “This study follows up on an extensive literature on the role of NMDA receptors in synaptic formation and plasticity. The authors used several mouse models and viral constructs to test whether lack of NMDA R1 affects spine formation of newborn neurons as well as their survival in the dentate gyrus. It is very well known that NMDA receptors are essential for spine formation both during embryonic development and throughout the adulthood, and the findings reported in this paper confirm that this is the case for adult-born neurons in the dentate gyrus. The novelty of the paper comes from the apparent role of NR1 in the survival of newborn neurons”. The other reviewer wrote: “The study by Mu, Zhao and colleagues reveals a role for NMDA receptors in the development of dentate gyrus neurons and the regulation of spine number and size. They find that loss of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor in these neurons in the first 4 weeks of their development leads to a decreased number of spines and an increase density of mushroom spines. This is accompanied by an increase in mEPSC amplitude and frequency, indicating an increase in functional Glu synapses. I think this study is an interesting addition to the neurogenesis field, and the experiments are well executed and presented”.</p><p>Both reviewers have specific suggestions about how the manuscript can be improved:</p><p>1) The report can be substantially improved by providing far more detailed analysis, as the data already exist. There are several observations indicating that spine size, which can range over two orders of magnitude, is likely to be important for their function. Larger spines can greatly outlast small spines (months compared with hours); they contain large synapses with more AMPA receptors and hence are functionally stronger than small spines. It appears that insertion of GluR1 is the key link that maintains the balance between synaptic strength and spine size. With this already established knowledge, the authors could present their own study in a more informative way. For example, given the large heterogeneity of spine structure and more-or-less continuum from filopodia to thin to stubbed to mushroom spines, I would like the authors to define exactly what is included in “total spine density”; what is the proportion of the other types of spines (and not only the mushroom ones); what exactly they mean by the mushroom spine (neck size, length)? Can they provide the absolute numbers for each type, at least in the supplementary table? Can they calculate the volume of spines – if the overall volume is not significantly different, perhaps there is a re-distribution of the calcium entry which may affect the survival of neurons? For example, in the absence of spines, neurons can still maintain synapses made directly onto their dendritic shafts. Shaft synapses are likely to produce larger synaptic currents than spine synapses, leading to larger increase in intracellular calcium concentrations. Such inputs may lead to cell death. The authors have already done EM, but they report only synapses onto the mushroom spine heads. Are there any synapses on dendrites? In addition, it would be very informative to provide some data on the plasticity of spines – they have all the tools and time-lapse imaging could be accomplished.</p><p>2) In the Discussion, the authors try to reconcile their findings with already published ones, as it has been accepted that NMDARs are required for recruitment of AMPA receptors to transition the spine from silent to functionally active synapse. They cite differences in methodology (genetic vs. pharmacological manipulation) as a cause for discrepancy. But – their findings actually may be the foundation of a major discovery: that lack of NR1 may trigger expression of calcium permeable AMPA receptors on the mushroom spines of newborn neurons, thus ensuring that the given synapse is functional, i.e. that it can be potentiated regardless of the presence of NMDA receptor?</p><p>3) The primary finding that NR1 deletion leads to decreased total spines and increased mushroom spines is quite interesting. This was shown previously by Anirvan Ghosh's lab in cortical neuron development (Ultanir et al PNAS 2007). This similarity in findings should be discussed.</p><p>4) The Bcl2 expression experiment should be unpackaged and discussed more, as in its current form it is difficult to extract conclusions. First, in normal mice overexpression of Bcl2 leads to a decrease in dendritic length and spine density. Why would this be? Is this a consequence of Bcl2 expression or due to activity dependent competition processes? Next, the authors show that cells with overexpression of Bcl2 and deletion of NR1 show reduced spine density without a change in mushroom spine number. The authors are making a link between NR1 deletion and mushroom spines, however, wouldn't one expect the NR1KO cells rescued from cell death should also show increased mushroom spines? Why does Bcl2 expression “rescue” the effect of NR1KO on mushroom spines?</p><p>5) By the way the Bcl2 experiments are presented and discussed, it remains unclear whether spine formation is required for the survival of adult born GCs. In the Discussion, the authors state: “this finding suggests that natural death of WT adult-born GCs might also be a result of the failure of spine formation in certain cell populations.” Its not clear to me as a reader how the forced survival of cells with less spines (Bcl2-overexpression, NR1KO) can lead to this conclusion.</p><p>6) The loss of NR1 from mature neurons leading to an increase in mushroom spines is an interesting finding. Can the authors comment on why this produces a decrease in apical spine density in mature CA1 neurons?</p><p>7) In the fourth paragraph of the Discussion the authors discuss their findings of enhanced spine maturation in NR1KO. This paragraph should include citations to statements made about previous studies (for example they argue differences in studies using pharmacological vs genetic manipulations without citations to the relevant literature). Also, this part of the discussion would be a good place to compare their findings to the Ultanir PNAS paper, as the Ultanir paper had a similar discussion as to how their findings of increased spine size/AMPA currents and decreased spine density compares to other pharmacological manipulations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07871.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The report can be substantially improved by providing far more detailed analysis, as the data already exist.

We have reanalyzed the imaging data sets for the old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figure 1 and 2</xref> and provided the proportions and absolute numbers for each spine type in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3l</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3q</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1 tbl2 tbl3">Tables 1-3</xref>, respectively. Correspondingly, we have explained clearly what was included in “total spine density” and how we defined a mushroom spine in the revised text. Thanks to the reviewer for pointing out the possibility that a re-distribution of calcium entry may affect the survival of neurons. We have checked our EM data more carefully and found symmetric, presumably GABAergic, synapses made directly onto dendritic shafts. Calculation of the total volume of spine heads was also performed on the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, which indicated a significant difference between WT and NR1 KO GCs. Since the spines included in volume measurement were randomly selected and comprised of mainly thin and mushroom spines, we cannot differentiate whether the volume change is owing to mushroom spine alone or distinct spine forms. Furthermore, the GABAergic synapses located on dendritic shafts could be excitatory in newborn GCs due to their high intracellular chloride concentration and allow Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Therefore, we concluded that changes in the amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and/or a re-distribution of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry may affect the survival of nascent neurons. As for the time-lapse imaging experiment suggested by the reviewers, we agree that data on the plasticity of spines would be very informative. However, LTP induction together with two-photon imaging has to be performed in the NR1 knockout neurons, which is technically difficult given the very low number of available cells and will take much longer than two months to set up and complete. In addition, while the reviewers indicate we have the equipment to do the live imaging, that was from a study years ago and we do not currently have that method working in the lab. Since this could be a subject of another study, we did not provide experimental results about spine plasticity in the present manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) In the Discussion, the authors try to reconcile their findings with already published ones, as it has been accepted that NMDARs are required for recruitment of AMPA receptors to transition the spine from silent to functionally active synapse.

Why does Bcl2 expression “rescue” the effect of NR1KO on mushroom spines?</italic></p><p>We agree that the current form of Bcl2 experiment expression is not clear enough. The logic behind this set of experiment is: Bcl2 suppresses apoptosis and therefore rescues general cell death, including the death caused by NR1 loss (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref>). Since the rescued cells exhibit a decrease in spine density as compared to those surviving naturally, it can be deducted that spine reduction may be a defect and Bcl2 overexpression cancels out this effect.
