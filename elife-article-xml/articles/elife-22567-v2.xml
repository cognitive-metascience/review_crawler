plasticity processes. It is unclear how the functions of the multiple domains of Munc13–1 are coordinated. The crystal structure of a Munc13–1 fragment including its C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>B and MUN domains (C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN) reveals a 19.5 nm-long multi-helical structure with the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains packed at one end. The similar orientations of the respective diacyglycerol- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites of the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains suggest that the two domains cooperate in plasma-membrane binding and that activation of Munc13–1 by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and diacylglycerol during short-term presynaptic plasticity are closely interrelated. Electrophysiological experiments in mouse neurons support the functional importance of the domain interfaces observed in C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN. The structure imposes key constraints for models of neurotransmitter release and suggests that Munc13–1 bridges the vesicle and plasma membranes from the periphery of the membrane-membrane interface.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22567.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22567.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22567.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human brain contains billions of cells called neurons that communicate with each other using molecules called neurotransmitters. An electrical signal in one neuron triggers the release of neurotransmitters from the cell, which then activate or inhibit electrical signals in neighboring neurons. Inside the cell, neurotransmitters are stored in small bubble-like structures called synaptic vesicles. The vesicles fuse with the membrane that surrounds the cell to release the neurotransmitters. This process must be tightly controlled to ensure that neurotransmitters are released rapidly and at the right time.</p><p>A protein called Munc13 is a key component of the machinery that regulates the fusion of synaptic vesicles. It helps the synaptic vesicle to dock onto the cell membrane and get ready for fusion. Munc13 is a large protein and contains several different regions, including three domains called C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>B and MUN. These three domains control the release of neurotransmitters, but how they do so is poorly understood.</p><p>Xu, Camacho et al. used a technique called X-ray crystallography to analyse the three-dimensional shape of the part of Munc13 that contains the three domains. The experiments reveal that the MUN domain forms a long rod-like shape with the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains packed at one end. Several mutations that reduce the ability of the domains to interact with each other altered the release of neurotransmitters from mouse neurons to different extents.</p><p>These findings suggest that the overall architecture of the region containing the C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>B and MUN domains is important for the normal activity of Munc13. The structure revealed by Xu, Camacho et al. sets a framework for understanding how Munc13 controls neurotransmitter release, and thus mediates diverse forms of information processing in the brain.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22567.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22567.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>neurotransmitter release</kwd><kwd>Munc13</kwd><kwd>presynaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>synaptic vesicle fusion</kwd><kwd>calcium binding</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB958</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenmund</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB665</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenmund</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 NS097333</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rizo</surname><given-names>Josep</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1304</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rizo</surname><given-names>Josep</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS037200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rizo</surname><given-names>Josep</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS049044</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rizo</surname><given-names>Josep</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The crystal structure of a large C-terminal fragment of Munc13-1 provides a key framework to understand how Munc13-1 mediates neurotransmitter release and presynaptic plasticity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The release of neurotransmitters by synaptic vesicle exocytosis is critical for neuronal communication. This exquisitely regulated process involves several steps, including tethering of synaptic vesicles to specialized sites of the presynaptic plasma membrane called active zones, a priming step(s) that leaves the vesicles ready to release, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Südhof, 2013</xref>). Each of these steps can be modulated in a variety of presynaptic plasticity processes that underlie multiple forms of information processing in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Regehr, 2012</xref>). The protein machinery that controls release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rizo and Xu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Südhof and Rothman, 2009</xref>) includes the neuronal soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) synaptobrevin, syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25, which play a key role in membrane fusion by forming a tight four-helix bundle (the SNARE complex) that brings the vesicle and plasma membranes into close proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Söllner et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hanson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Poirier et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sutton et al., 1998</xref>). This complex is disassembled by N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) and soluble NSF attachment proteins (SNAPs; no relation to SNAP-25) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Söllner et al., 1993</xref>) to recycle the SNAREs for another round of fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mayer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 1996</xref>). The Sec1/Munc18 protein Munc18–1 and the large (200 kDa) active zone proteins called Munc13s are also crucial for release. Munc18–1 binds to a self-inhibited ‘closed’ conformation of syntaxin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dulubova et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Misura et al., 2000</xref>) and orchestrates SNARE complex assembly in an NSF-SNAP-resistant manner together with Munc13, which helps to open syntaxin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Richmond et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2013</xref>).</p><p>Because of their multiple functions, Munc13s have emerged as particularly central regulators of neurotransmitter release that link the core membrane fusion apparatus to diverse forms of presynaptic plasticity through their multidomain architecture (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> for Munc13–1, the most abundant mammalian isoform). Thus, neurotransmitter release is completely abrogated in the absence of Munc13s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Augustin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Richmond et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aravamudan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</xref>). This phenotype most likely arises because Munc13s play key roles in docking and priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weimer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hammarlund et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Imig et al., 2014</xref>) that are associated at least in part to their activity in opening syntaxin-1 and thus stimulating SNARE complex formation through their MUN domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Richmond et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). However, the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region and the C-terminal C<sub>2</sub>C domain are also critical for release, which may arise because these domains help bridge the vesicle and plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). There is also evidence for a role of Munc13s in events downstream of priming [e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hammarlund et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, Munc13s are involved in multiple presynaptic plasticity processes, including isoform-specific depression and augmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rosenmund et al., 2002</xref>), diacyglycerol (DAG)-phorbol ester-dependent potentiation of release via the C<sub>1</sub> domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rhee et al., 2002</xref>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent short-term plasticity through the C<sub>2</sub>B domain and a calmodulin-binding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Junge et al., 2004</xref>). Binding of the Munc13–1 C<sub>2</sub>A domain to RIMs also provides a connection to RIM-dependent forms of short- and long-term presynaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Betz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dulubova et al., 2005</xref>). The crucial physiological importance of these modulatory processes was emphatically illustrated by the finding that knock-in mice bearing a point mutation in the Munc13–1 C<sub>1</sub> domain that disrupts phorbol-ester-dependent potentiation of release die 2–3 hr after birth even though the mutation causes no impairment of evoked release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rhee et al., 2002</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22567.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Crystal structure of Munc13–1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain diagram of rat Munc13–1, with A-D corresponding to the four subdomains of the MUN domain.

Here, we report the crystal structure of a Munc13–1 fragment spanning its C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>B and MUN domains (C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN), revealing a long, 195 Å rod formed by 26 α-helices that packs at one end against the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains. The DAG-binding region of the C<sub>1</sub> domain and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding region of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain are near each other and point in the same direction, which is expected to facilitate cooperation between the two domains in membrane binding and thus enable synergy between the effects of DAG and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in neurotransmitter release during repetitive stimulation. Electrophysiological experiments show that mutations designed to disrupt interfaces between different domains of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN impair evoked release and vesicle priming to different extents, and also have differential effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent short-term plasticity as well as phorbol ester-induced potentiation. These results suggest that the highly elongated nature of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN and the relative disposition of its domains in our crystal structure are critical for the normal functions of Munc13–1 in neurotransmitter release and presynaptic plasticity, placing important structural constraints on possible models for the mechanisms of neurotransmitter release and presynaptic plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Crystal structure of Munc13–1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN</title><p>The work presented herein culminates 12 years of efforts dedicated to determine the three-dimensional structures of fragments encompassing part of or the entire highly conserved C-terminal region of Munc13–1, which includes the C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>B, MUN and C<sub>2</sub>C domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). While crystals were obtained for several of the fragments that we prepared, they tended to diffract poorly. Key for the success in obtaining crystals of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN of sufficient quality to diffract in the 3–3.5 Å range were the choice of N- and C-termini (residues 529 and 1531, respectively), as well as the removal of residues 1408–1452, which correspond to a long loop within the MUN domain that is poorly conserved and is subject to alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brose et al., 1995</xref>). Removal of this loop generally increases the solubility of C-terminal Munc13–1 fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2011</xref>). Even with the best diffraction data obtained with C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN, structure determination was hindered by low resolution, significant anisotropy, non-isomorphism and an inability to obtain selenomethionyl-derivatized protein. These problems were overcome by the use of single wavelength anomalous dispersion phases obtained from a dataset collected at the tantalum LIII edge on native crystals soaked with a tantalum bromide cluster, coupled with molecular replacement phases obtained from the previously determined structures of the C<sub>1</sub> domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shen et al., 2005</xref>), the C<sub>2</sub>B domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2010</xref>) and the nearly complete MUN domain of Munc13–1. For this purpose, it was necessary to first re-refine the structure of the nearly complete MUN domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2015</xref>) using the deposited structure factors (PDB code 4Y21) to reduce the level of side chain outliers and of steric clashes, as well as to correct the sequence numbering (see Materials and methods). Placement of the C<sub>1</sub> domains in the cell of the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN crystals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) was verified by an anomalous difference map calculated from data collected on native crystals at the zinc K-edge energy.

unit of its crystals are very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The structure of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN can be viewed as a highly elongated rod spanning ca. 195 Å and is formed mostly of α-helical bundles, with a total of 26 helices; the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains pack at the N-terminal end of the rod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Much of the long rod is formed by the MUN domain, which is homologous to subunits of complexes that mediate tethering in diverse membrane compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pei et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yu and Hughson, 2010</xref>) and was previously shown to be formed by four subdomains of about five helices each (named A-D and colored in blue, green, yellow and orange on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Comparison of our C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN structure with the crystal structure of the almost complete MUN domain (with the N-terminus at residue 933), which was described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al. (2015)</xref> and we re-refined, shows that the MUN domain is very similar in both structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), as expected because this structure was used in crystallographic phase determination by the molecular replacement method. However, the structure of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN shows that the MUN domain actually starts at residue 828 and contains five additional helices (helices H6-H10), resulting in a total of seven helices for subdomain A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition, there are five more helices preceding the MUN domain (helices H1-H5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Four of these helices correspond to the linker sequence between the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains, whereas one helix (H1) is spanned by a sequence preceding the C<sub>1</sub> domain (colored in red).</p><p>These observations nicely explain a few findings made during our crystallization efforts. For instance, Munc13–1 fragments starting right at the beginning of the C<sub>1</sub> domain were unstable and we were not able to express fragments containing only the C<sub>1</sub> domain, the C<sub>2</sub>B domain and the linker between them in soluble form. As the structure of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN now reveals, there are extensive contacts between helix H1, the four helices of the linker, the MUN domain, the C<sub>1</sub> domain and the C<sub>2</sub>B domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D–F</xref>), and hence it is not surprising that elimination of some of these interfaces impairs proper folding. We also note that the structures of the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains in C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN are similar to those determined for the isolated domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2010</xref>), although the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops are not visible in the C<sub>2</sub>B domain of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This correlates with the previous finding that these loops were observable in the crystal structure of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain bound to Ca<sup>2+</sup> but not in its crystal structure without Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2010</xref>), as our C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN structure was determined in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>The architecture of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN has important implications to understand the functions of Munc13–1 in docking and priming, as well as the regulatory roles of its various domains. First, the elongated structure and the overall packing of the different domains at the N-terminal end of the structure suggest that C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN may function as a rigid or semi-rigid unit that bridges the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes. Note in this context that the similarity in the structures of the two molecules from the asymmetric unit of the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN crystals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and between these structures and that of the nearly complete MUN domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) suggest that the overall architecture of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN has limited flexibility. Second, a model of the structure of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN incorporating the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain, which mediate its interactions with PIP<sub>2</sub>-containing membranes in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2010</xref>), shows that these loops are proximal to the DAG-phorbol ester-binding region of the C<sub>1</sub> domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). This arrangement is expected to promote cooperation between the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains in membrane binding, thus suggesting a natural mechanism for synergy between increases in DAG and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations to enhance release probability upon repetitive stimulation. However, it is noteworthy that there are abundant basic residues in the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) that could potentially mediate membrane binding in alternative orientations in the absence of DAG and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound to the C<sub>2</sub>B domain (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These observations suggest that increased DAG and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations may alter release probability by promoting a different orientation of the Munc13–1 C-terminal region that is more efficient in promoting priming and/or fusion (see Discussion and models described therein). Third, the finding that helix H1 is packed against the MUN domain, with the N-terminus pointing toward the center of the long rod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggests that N-terminal sequences of Munc13–1 not included in this structure could perform their regulatory functions by influencing MUN domain activity. For instance, the calmodulin-binding region of Munc13–1 might inhibit release by binding to the middle of the MUN domain, where an NF sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) is known to be critical for opening syntaxin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2015</xref>), and binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin to this region may enhance release by relieving this inhibition. Interactions of homodimerized Munc13–1 C<sub>2</sub>A domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2006</xref>) with the MUN domain might also underlie the inhibition caused by homodimerization, which is relieved by RIM binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deng et al., 2011</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22567.010</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Distribution of basic residues clusters in C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ribbon diagram of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN where the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains were replaced with the structures of the isolated C<sub>1</sub> domain (cyan; PDB code 1Y8F) and the isolated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound C<sub>2</sub>B domain (salmon; PDB code 3 KWU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2010</xref>) to include basic residues that are not observed in the structure of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN, likely because they are disordered.

To address this question, we designed three mutations to strongly disrupt domain interfaces observed in the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN structure: (i) a V549E,L554E double mutation designed to disrupt the hydrophobic packing of helix H1 against the linker region and against the MUN domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>); (ii) an R750E,K752E double mutation to disrupt salt bridges formed between the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>); and (iii) an N940W mutation designed to perturb the interface between the C<sub>2</sub>B and MUN domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We tested the physiological consequences of these mutations by performing rescue experiments in autaptic hippocampal neuronal cultures from Munc13-1/2 double KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</xref>) that express WT or mutant Munc13–1s through a lentiviral vector. To dissect which aspects of neurotransmitter release and its regulation might be affected by the mutations, we evaluated spontaneous release, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent release triggered by a single action potential (AP), vesicle priming, high-frequency stimulation and PDBu-induced facilitation. Western blot analyses showed that the WT and mutant proteins were detectable at comparable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the differences observed in our electrophysiological measurements arise in part from distinct expression levels, this possibility is unlikely because no significant changes in synaptic properties are observed in heterozygous Munc13–1 (+/-) neurons and WT neurons mildly overexpressing WT munc13–1 in a Munc13–2 KO background (MC and CR, unpublished results).</p><p>We first assessed the effects on spontaneous release measuring the frequency and the amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs).

We next recorded excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) induced by a single AP to characterize evoked release. Analysis of the EPSC amplitudes revealed that the R750E,K752E mutation in the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B interface and the N940W mutation in the C2B-MUN interface impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>).

We found that the N940W mutation in the C<sub>2</sub>B-MUN interface caused a decrease in RRP size of close to 40%, similar to the change seen in the evoked response. The H1 helix mutation V549E,L554E decreased the RRP size by nearly 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>), which contrasts with the lack of an effect of this mutation on evoked release. Furthermore, the disruption of the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B interface by the R750E,K752E mutation led to normal vesicle priming despite reducing the evoked response. These experiments demonstrate that all three mutations impact Munc13–1 function but, interestingly, each mutation displays distinct effects on evoked release and vesicle priming. This finding strongly suggests that the domain interfaces differentially regulate the efficiency of the vesicle fusion process, which may lead to differences in vesicle release probability.</p><p>We calculated the vesicular release probability (Pvr) by dividing the EPSC charge by the charge of the RRP. The V549E,L554E mutation in the H1 helix increased the vesicular release probability significantly, as expected, while the small differences in Pvr observed for the R750E,K752E and N940W mutants with respect to WT were not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The impact on release probability in these mutants was further corroborated by analyzing the degree of facilitation or depression quantified by the paired pulse ratio of two consecutive AP-induced EPSC amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>). Compared to WT, the V549E,L554E mutant showed more depression, in correlation with our finding of enhanced release probability, while the other two mutants showed similar paired-pulse behavior to WT rescues, in agreement with the conclusion that these mutations did not disrupt basal release probability substantially.</p><p>In general, vesicular release probability is also a major determinant for release during sustained AP trains. Initial high vesicular release probability predicts more depression of synaptic responses due to more prominent depletion of primed vesicles. However, structure function studies on Munc13 have identified changes in sustained release that are not explained by the initial release probability, and this has been interpreted as Munc13 playing an additional role in synaptic augmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rosenmund et al., 2002</xref>) and in modifying vesicle replenishment through activity-dependent vesicle re-priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2010</xref>). To test how disruption of the interfaces in Munc13–1 can affect the activity-dependent vesicle re-priming, we monitored synaptic responses during 10 Hz AP trains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We first defined the function of steady-state depression versus release probability in WT neurons by applying AP trains at various external Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, and found as expected a robust correlation between release probability and steady state depression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, the V549E,L554E mutation in the H1 helix and the R750E,K752E mutation in the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B interface caused more pronounced depression of sustained release than expected from the initial release probability, while disrupting the C<sub>2</sub>B-MUN interface with the N940W mutation caused less depression than expected from the initial release probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). These results suggest that each one of the interfaces disrupted by the mutations plays a role in activity-dependent vesicle re-priming, and reinforce the notion that Munc13 exerts multiple functions in shaping release properties at synapses.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22567.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Difference in sustained release during a high-frequency action potential train upon disruption of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN domain interfaces.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Exemplary traces of EPSCs evoked by 10 Hz stimulation trains of Munc13-1/2 DKO neurons rescued with WT and mutant Munc13–1s.

To test how the mutations in the domain interfaces of Munc13–1 alter the coupling of phorbol-ester binding to changes in release probability, we examined the effects of acute application of 1 µM PDBu, which causes a 60% increase in the evoked postsynaptic responses in WT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The N940W mutation in the C<sub>2</sub>B-MUN interface showed more pronounced potentiation than WT Munc13–1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), which correlates with the reduction in steady-state depression during 10 Hz AP trains observed for this mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and indicates an easier transition for Munc13–1 to a potentiated state. Conversely, the V549E,L554E in helix H1 led to reduced potentiation by PDBu compared to WT, which likely arises because of the initial high vesicular release probability observed for this mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Remarkably, the R750E,K752E mutation in the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B interface caused an even more pronounced decrease in PDBu potentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), which contrasts with the limited effect of this mutation on vesicular release probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) but correlates with the strong depression observed in the 10 Hz AP trains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

These results contrast with the impairment of vesicle priming and increment of vesicular release probability observed for the V549E,L554E mutant in naive synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). Thus, the enhanced depression during the AP train observed for this mutant compared to WT Munc13–1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) was due to a failure to potentiate release probability and not due to a failure in vesicle replenishment.

Unfortunately, multiple attempts to express C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C bearing the V549E,L554E mutation failed to yield sufficient amounts of soluble protein, and we were also unable to obtain C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C bearing a single V549E or L554E mutation, suggesting that both substitutions strongly destabilize the fragment. Since the V549E,L554E mutant was expressed at levels comparable to WT Munc13–1 in our rescue experiments, it is plausible that this mutation is less destabilizing in the context of these experiments because of interactions of that region with N-terminal sequences of Munc13–1, with other components of the release machinery, or with molecular chaperones.</p><p>In our reconstitution experiments, we use an assay that simultaneously measures lipid mixing and content mixing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zucchi and Zick, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2016</xref>) to ensure that true membrane fusion is observed, as lipid mixing can occur without content mixing [e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zick and Wickner, 2014</xref>)]. We start the experiments in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> is added after 300 s to examine its effect on liposome fusion. Under the standard conditions of our experiments, in which we use 500 nM C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C and we include DAG and PIP<sub>2</sub> in the T-liposomes, fusion is highly efficient upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence arises from Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the C<sub>2</sub>B domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). In initial experiments, we observed only mild effects of the R750E,K752E and N940W mutations in Munc13–1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C on fusion. To allow better discrimination, we lowered the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C concentration to 100 nM, and we compared results obtained with T-liposomes that contained DAG+PIP<sub>2</sub>, DAG only, or PIP<sub>2</sub> only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). WT C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C was still highly active under all these conditions, supporting Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent membrane fusion that strictly required Munc13–1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C and was optimal when the T-liposomes included both DAG and PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). When the T-liposomes contained DAG and PIP<sub>2</sub>, the N940W mutation in the C<sub>2</sub>B-MUN interface slightly impaired fusion while the R750E,K752E mutation in the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B interface led to a considerably stronger impairment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref> for quantification).

These two additional substitutions partially compensated for the effects of the R750E,K752E mutation, as the quadruple mutation recovered some of the activity lost in the R750E,K752E mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The recovery was modest, but this result is not unexpected because the orientation of the mutated side chains in the quadruple mutant may not be as favorable to form salt bridges as in the WT protein. Hence, the observed functional recovery in the quadruple mutant supports the notion that the effects of the R750E,K752E mutation in the fusion assays are due to disruption of C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B interactions. We note that all these reconstitution experiments were performed in the absence of synaptotagmin-1 because this Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor does not have a marked influence in the results obtained in these bulk assays under the conditions used, although it may cause an acceleration of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent fusion that can only be detected at faster time scales than those used in our measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Correspondingly, the relative activities of the WT and mutant C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C Munc13–1 fragments in reconstitution experiments that incorporated synaptotagmin-1 into the V-liposomes yielded similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>) to those obtained in the absence of synaptotagmin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>).</p><p>The impairment of fusion caused by the R750E,K752E in our reconstitution assays correlates with the impairment of evoked release observed in the rescue experiments, as well as with the strong depression observed for this mutation in the 10 Hz trains and the impairment of PDBu-induced augmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Altogether, our results strongly support the notion that the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B interface observed in the crystal structure of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN is important for evoked release and for cooperation between the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains in membrane binding during repetitive stimulation to generate an activated state that is stabilized by binding of the C<sub>1</sub> domain to DAG and of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-PIP<sub>2</sub>. Thus, as we noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), our reconstitutions including DAG and PIP<sub>2</sub> in the T-liposomes may recapitulate more closely this activated state than the normal state that leads to release evoked by a single action potential. Interpreting the results of the N940W mutation in the reconstitutions is hindered by the fact that this mutation impaired evoked and sucrose-induced release but had less depression than WT in the 10 Hz trains and a slightly higher potentiation by PDBu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). The small impairment of fusion observed in the reconstitutions for this mutant may reflect a balance between the inhibitory and stimulatory effects observed in the rescue experiments but, overall, the mild nature of the effect on fusion appears to be more reminiscent of the small (albeit contrary) effects observed in the PDBu treatment, thus supporting also the notion that the reconstitutions emulate an activated state of the release machinery.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Munc13–1 acts as a master regulator of neurotransmitter release, playing a crucial role in release itself and multiple functions in integrating the effects of diverse signals that alter release probability during presynaptic plasticity. Thus, elucidating how the functions of the multiple domains of Munc13–1 are coordinated to control release and plasticity constitutes a major, fundamental challenge in neuroscience. The crystal structure of Munc13–1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN and the functional data presented here represent critical steps to meet this challenge, revealing a highly elongated structure that is key to understanding how Munc13–1 bridges the vesicle and plasma membranes to control SNARE complex formation, and how the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains mediate presynaptic plasticity processes that depend on Ca<sup>2+</sup> and DAG.</p><p>Notable features of the structure of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN include its length, which is close to 20 nm and is thus comparable to the radius of a synaptic vesicle, and the interfaces between its different domains. The observation that the three mutations designed to disrupt domain interfaces observed in the structure have distinct effects on evoked release, vesicle priming, vesicle release probability, high-frequency stimulation and PDBu-induced facilitation demonstrates the functional relevance of the overall structure and shows that the different domain interfaces perturbed by the mutations play differential roles in release and short-term presynaptic plasticity. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that each of the three mutations uniquely alters the normal relation between vesicle release probability and steady-state EPSC amplitude in 10 Hz AP trains in neurons expressing WT Munc13–1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), a relation that arises from the natural increase in RRP depletion rate as vesicle release probability increases. Similarly, the three mutations also change the normal inverse relation between the extent of PDBu-induced facilitation and the vesicle release probability. This finding is not surprising, as the effects of PDBu are likely to be at least partially related to those observed in 10 Hz trains. Thus, phorbol ester activation of the Munc13 C<sub>1</sub> domain is believed to mimic the effects of increased DAG levels during repetitive stimulation, which result from accumulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and activation of PLCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rhee et al., 2002</xref>). Accumulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> also activates Munc13s by binding to the C<sub>2</sub>B domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The finding that the DAG/phorbol ester-binding region of the C<sub>1</sub> domain and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain are close to each other and point in the same direction in our C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup>, DAG and PIP<sub>2</sub> can cooperate in inducing binding of Munc13–1 to the plasma membrane, indicating that these different forms of activation are closely interrelated. These conclusions are supported by the physiological effects of the R750E,K752E mutation in the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B interface. This mutation leads to a modest impairment of evoked release and to no significant change in the RRP, resulting also in no significant change in vesicular release probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However, this mutation causes a considerably stronger depression during 10 Hz trains than observed for WT Munc13–1 and to severe impairment of PDBu-dependent facilitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). These results suggest that the interaction between the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains observed in our crystal structure is important for evoked release but is particularly critical for activation of Munc13–1 by phorbol esters as well by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and DAG during repetitive stimulation. Note also that this mutation strongly disrupts the ability to increase the release probability after repetitive stimulation observed for WT Munc13–1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Because the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains pack at the N-terminal end of the long helical structure, far from the middle region of the MUN domain that contains the NF residues involved in opening syntaxin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), our structure does not support models whereby the C<sub>1</sub> and C2B domains impair the activity of the MUN domain by direct intramolecular interactions, and binding to DAG or Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases these inhibitory interactions [e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rizo and Rosenmund, 2008</xref>)]. Instead, our structure suggests that activation of Munc13–1 by PDBu or by repetitive stimulation involves cooperative binding of the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains to the plasma membrane in a defined orientation that is promoted by increases in the levels of DAG and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>; this activated state may be more effective in mediating priming and/or downstream events leading to fusion than the state existing under resting conditions, which may involve a different orientation of Munc13–1 with respect to the plasma membrane favored by Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and DAG-independent interactions involving multiple basic residues of the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and discussion below).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22567.021</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Models of neurotransmitter release inspired by the structure of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN and our functional data.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C is represented by the structure of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN, with the C<sub>2</sub>B domain replaced by the structure of the isolated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound C<sub>2</sub>B domain (colored in salmon), and by a blue ellipse corresponding to the C<sub>2</sub>C domain.

C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C is represented as in A but, instead of being located between the two membranes, is bridging the two membranes from a peripheral location. The model must be visualized in three dimensions, such that the C<sub>2</sub>C domain is bound to the outer surface of the vesicle membrane rather than inserted into the vesicle lumen. On the right side, the C<sub>2</sub>C domain is in the front, whereas in the left side the C<sub>2</sub>C domain is in the back of the vesicle, which is represented by a semitransparent gray surface. In both panels, C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C is shown in the orientation proposed for the activated state induced during repetitive stimulation, where binding to the plasma membrane is mediated by the DAG-binding region of the C<sub>1</sub> domain and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding region of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain.

The arrows in the top panel are meant to illustrate that complete assembly of the C-terminus of the SNARE complex might pull the membranes radially outwards, which could create strong membrane tension to trigger membrane fusion.

Correspondingly, this mutant exhibits more depression during 10 Hz trains than WT neurons, but the depression is stronger than expected from the observed vesicle release probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The V549E,L554E mutation also leads to a strong impairment in PDBu-induced facilitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) that likely arises from the increased Pvr. Overall, the effects of this mutation resemble those caused by the H567K mutation that is expected to unfold the C<sub>1</sub> domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rhee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basu et al., 2007</xref>). The decreases in the RRP observed for both the V549E,L554E and the H567K mutants may result from disruption of coupling between the C-terminal region and the N-terminus containing the C<sub>2</sub>A domain, which contributes to the docking-priming activity of Munc13–1 (MC and CR, unpublished results). The increased release probability observed for both mutants suggests that the disruptive structural effects of the two mutations may mimic to some extent the changes involved in activating Munc13–1 during repetitive stimulation, which may involve in part the release of inhibitory effects caused by N-terminal sequences. However, note that the V549E,L554E mutation prevented the increase in Pvr observed after repetitive stimulation for WT Munc13–1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), indicating that different features govern this increase in Pvr and the release probability in naïve synapses.</p><p>The N940W mutation in the C<sub>2</sub>B-MUN interface impairs evoked release and decreases the RRP, leading to a release probability similar to that of WT Munc13–1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However, this mutant exhibits smaller depression during 10 Hz trains than WT Munc13–1 and a slightly larger PDBu-induced facilitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). These results suggest that the packing of the C<sub>2</sub>B-MUN interface observed in our structure is important for normal vesicle priming and release caused by a single action potential, but the alteration of this interface caused by the N940W mutation favors the activated state that is generated during repetitive stimulation. This view is reinforced by the finding that the N940W mutation causes a larger increase in release probability after repetitive stimulation than that observed with WT Munc13–1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p><p>The neurotransmitter release machinery is highly complex, including several large proteins of hundreds of kDa that form the active zone in addition to the SNARES, Munc18–1, Munc13–1, NSF, αSNAP, synaptotagmin-1 and multiple additional components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Südhof, 2013</xref>). Without knowing how Munc13–1 interacts with other proteins, interpretation of the structure of Munc13–1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN in terms of specific models of neurotransmitter release is necessarily speculative. Nevertheless, the structure poses critical constraints on working models of release and its regulation. For instance, the model of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> is based on the finding that the Munc13–1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragment bridges V-liposomes to T-liposomes in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Such bridging might facilitate the activity of the MUN domain in opening syntaxin-1 to initiate SNARE complex formation and may involve interactions of the polybasic face of the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) with the T-liposomes and of C<sub>2</sub>C with the V-liposomes. Binding of the C<sub>1</sub> domain to DAG and of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain to Ca<sup>2+</sup> during repetitive stimulation could change the orientation of Munc13–1 with respect to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) in such a way that the two membranes are brought into closer proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) and the SNARE complex is formed more efficiently. Importantly, if Munc13–1 is located between the two membranes, progress toward complete SNARE complex assembly and fusion would require release of Munc13–1 from the fusion complex because otherwise its large size would hinder further membrane proximity. In this scenario, Munc13–1 could not underlie changes in release probability directly, but its enhanced activity could lead to an increase in the number of preassembled SNARE complexes that might underlie the increases in release probability caused by up-regulation of DAG, by PDBu treatment or by the K630W mutation in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding loop of the Munc13–2 C<sub>2</sub>B domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rhee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2010</xref>). However, it is difficult to explain with this type of model why the H567K mutation in the C<sub>1</sub> domain does not alter the vesicle refilling rate under resting conditions while increasing the Pvr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rhee et al., 2002</xref>), and why PDBu changes the vesicle release probability without altering the RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basu et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The distinct effects of Munc13 mutations on evoked release, RRP, vesicular release probability, synaptic responses to repetitive stimulation and PDBu-dependent facilitation [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rhee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2010</xref>) are more readily explained by models postulating that Munc13–1 remains bound to the SNARE complex and/or other components of the release apparatus after SNARE complex assembly, forming part of the fusion complex. Such models predict at least two major actions for Munc13s, one in docking-priming (i.e. orchestrating SNARE complex assembly) and another in fusion. The length of the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN structure suggests that the Munc13–1 C-terminal region cannot remain in the central space between two membranes (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) after the SNARE complex is even partially assembled. However, the activities of Munc13–1 in bridging the two membranes and mediating SNARE complex assembly, as well as potential downstream functions, could be performed with Munc13–1 located in the periphery of the membrane-membrane interface, with an arrangement where the large size of Munc13–1 does not hinder completion of SNARE complex assembly and membrane fusion (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). With such an arrangement, reorientation of Munc13–1 upon binding to DAG and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-PIP<sub>2</sub> could still underlie an increased activity in facilitating SNARE complex formation, but such reorientation could also lead to an optimization of the primed state that can lead more readily to membrane fusion upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx than that observed without Munc13–1 activation. This separation of the roles of Munc13–1 into at least two steps can easily explain the differential effects of the V549E,L554E, R750E,K752E and N940W mutations in the different functional assays, including the finding that N940W impairs priming and evoked release, but enhances Munc13–1 function during 10 Hz trains or PDBu treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>).</p><p>Clearly, the primed fusion complex depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> (top) might contain additional components such as Munc18–1, αSNAP, NSF, synaptotagmin-1 and complexins, among others. An attractive feature of this model is that it places the SNAREs on the periphery of the membrane-membrane interface rather than between the membranes, consistent with electron microscopy images of SNARE-mediated liposome fusion intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hernandez et al., 2012</xref>) and of presynaptic terminals showing practically direct contact between docked-primed vesicles and the plasma membrane [e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harlow et al., 2001</xref>)]. With this architecture, the SNARE complex could not induce fusion by bringing the vesicle and plasma membranes into proximity, as they are already in contact before Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, but could pull the two membranes radially outwards as assembly of the SNARE complex is completed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). In this case, fusion would result from the tension created in both membranes, which would favor transient formation of non-bilayer intermediates that might or might not resemble a stalk. Components of the fusion complex that are bound to the SNARE complex and bridge the membranes (e.g. Munc13–1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>) would play an important role to establish support points from which the SNAREs can exert their force on the membranes more efficiently.</p><p>As discussed in the results section, the strong effect of the R750E,K752E mutation in our fusion assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) suggests that our reconstitutions recapitulate better the mechanism of release during repetitive stimulation than release evoked by a single action potential. This proposal is supported by the findings that the tight Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of membrane fusion in our reconstitution assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) arises largely from Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the Munc13–1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), and that disrupting the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites of the Munc13–2 C<sub>2</sub>B domain did not impair evoked release in rescue experiments but did impair release during repetitive stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2010</xref>). However, it is plausible that functional redundancy with other proteins and/or compensatory effects may have masked an actual role for the Munc13–2 C<sub>2</sub>B domain in Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensing during evoked release, in cooperation with synaptotagmin-1. A primed state that contains Munc13 as key component bodes well for such a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing role of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain, which is also suggested by the increased release probability caused by a K630W mutation in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops of the Munc13–2 C<sub>2</sub>B domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2010</xref>) and may be reflected in the tight Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of our fusion assays.</p><p>Clearly, further research is needed to test all these ideas, and it will be particularly critical to assess whether Munc13–1 is indeed part of the primed fusion complex and, if this is the case, how Munc13–1 binds to the SNAREs and other potential components of the complex. Regardless of these possibilities, the structure of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN presented here provides a fundamental framework to design and interpret future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and recombinant proteins</title><p>To express rat Munc13–1 fragments encoding the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN and C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C regions (residues 529–1531 and 529–1735, respectively; both constructs have residues 1408–1452 from a flexible loop deleted), the corresponding DNA sequences were originated from full-length rat Munc13–1 (NM_022861, L756W, Δ1415–1437, Δ1533–1551, E1666G).

The reference model restraints were removed for the final cycles of refinement. A superposition of chains A and B yield a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 1.51 Å for 809 aligned Cα carbons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The higher-than-average R<sub>free</sub> value is probably due to the relative dearth of lattice contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) for the CD subdomains of MUN chain A of C1C2BMUN, as evidenced by weak electron density and high average thermal displacement factors (ADP) (151.2 Å<sup>2</sup>) for those subdomains (residues 1255–1517) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Due to the high ADP values for the CD subdomain of chain A, the authors recommend that interpretation of the CD subdomain should be performed on residues in chain B. The density for the remaining domains of chain A as well as chain B of C1C2BMUN is strong and well connected; in fact, the average ADPs for residues 541–950 are lower for chain A (41.0 Å<sup>2</sup>) than chain B (62.4 Å<sup>2</sup>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mechanistic Insights into Neurotransmitter Release and Presynaptic Plasticity from Munc13-1 C1C2BMUN Crystal Structure&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Matthijs Verhage (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors combined crystallography with biochemical and functional assays to investigate the structure and function of a functionally active fragment of Munc13 containing its C1, C2B and MUN domains. Munc13 is essential for exocytosis, and it undergoes multiple interactions with other proteins, particularly SNARE proteins, and the plasma membrane, but its precise mechanism of action is not yet understood. Based on the crystal structure that was obtained, the authors designed different mutations to specifically target the interactions between these domains and study the potential cooperation and synergy between the domains. These mutants were expressed in neurons in which the Mun13 isoforms were deleted, thus allowing for assessing the effect of each of the mutations on the function of the protein, yielding novel insights into the cooperative functions of the different domains.</p><p>Generally, all reviewers appreciate the novel structure and agree that it constitutes an important contribution to the field. They also are very supportive of the rescue experiments but there are some concerns that need to be addressed, involving additional experiments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The data completeness of native data set of the C1C2BMUN fragment is only ~ 80%, the Ramachandran statistics indicates some outliers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), and the RSRZ score (provided in the PDB validation report) is not ideal. The model might benefit from checking these outliers and regions of poor fit to the density map. Moreover, representative omit electron density maps should be provided as a supplementary figure.</p><p>2) There is a structure of the MUN domain reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, but it seems that it is not discussed in the text. Apologies if I may have missed it. I assume this structure of the MUN domain includes the extra residues at the N-terminus that were found to belong to the MUN domain?</p><p>3) Is there potential flexibility (e.g., bending) of the fragment? Please provide an overlay of the two NCS mates.</p><p>4) All three reviewers appreciate the site-directed mutagenesis experiments but are concerned that mutations may result in folding defects. We realize that a structural characterization of the mutants (although certainly desirable and interesting) goes beyond what can be done, particularly when considering that the purification of these mutant proteins may be difficult. However, we suggest to express these mutants (or at least the domains containing the mutants) in a eukaryotic cell and then check expression of the intact fragments by western blotting. Since unfolded proteins are usually degraded, the presence of non-degraded protein would increase confidence that the expressed proteins do not have major folding defects.</p><p>5) The phenotype of the N940W mutation is interpreted as &quot;an easier transition for Munc13-1 to a potentiated state&quot; (subsection “Functional consequences caused by disruption of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN domain interfaces”, last paragraph). However, the functional consequence of this &quot;potentiated state&quot; is not demonstrated. Is there a higher Pvr or more priming in this state? Therefore, priming and Pvr should tested right after the 10Hz train by hypertonic (500mM) sucrose stimulation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22567.040</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The data completeness of native data set of the C1C2BMUN fragment is only ~ 80%, the Ramachandran statistics indicates some outliers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), and the RSRZ score (provided in the PDB validation report) is not ideal.

The corrections applied in <italic>HKL-3000</italic> for effects resulting from absorption in a crystal and for radiation damage to the diffraction data as described in the methods section of the manuscript also performs <italic>B</italic>-factor sharpening; thus the differences observed between the Wilson <italic>B</italic>-value without sharpening (104.7 Å2) versus with sharpening (49.6 Å2). This <italic>B</italic>-factor sharpening improved the connectivity in the electron density maps and allowed for the tracing of the main chain for many loops that connect secondary structural elements. Unfortunately, in many of these loops the density for the side chains is almost or completely non-existent, and the density that is typically observed in a 3.35 Å resolution map does not often indicate where to place main chain carbonyl oxygens. Even when certain residues are modeled into acceptable regions of the Ramachandran plot, subsequent reciprocal space refinement may move these residues to unfavorable regions. In this structure, all of the Ramachandran outliers are in loop regions that connect secondary structural elements.</p><p>Further rounds of refinement of the C1C2BMUN model, which included both non-crystallographic symmetry restraints and carefully optimized TLS atomic displacement parameter refinement has reduced the R(free) to 29.0% and the R(work) to 25.4%, with excellent geometry as evidenced by both the PDB validation report and the results from the <italic>MolProbity</italic> web server, with both the Clashscore and the overall <italic>MolProbity</italic> score in the 100<sup>th</sup> percentile for the resolution range of 3.35 Å +/- 0.25 Å.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22567.022</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22567.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22567.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-22567-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22567.023</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22567.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22567.023</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-22567-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig></p><p>Regarding the RSR Z-score, the PDB in fact recognizes that there are difficulties in interpreting these scores for low-resolution structures, especially ones “that have been refined using <italic>PHENIX</italic> where hydrogen atoms are involved”.

(2012) D68, 454–467), he addresses the problems with the Real-space R (RSR) as a validation statistic (see p. 456 and section 4.2 of this article). Basically, the values of the limiting radii used for calculation of the atomic scattering factors are chosen arbitrarily and differ between software implementations used to calculate the electron density maps, which causes RSR to vary according to the software used. Additionally, the value of the RSR increases as a function of the increasing value of the <italic>B</italic>-factor. This latter problem with the RSR Z-score relates directly to the C1C2BMUN structure, and most especially to the portions of the structure with high values for the <italic>B</italic>-factor. As mentioned in the Methods section of our paper, the average <italic>B</italic>-factor of residues 1255 – 1517 of C1C2BMUN chain A (151.2 Å2) is considerably higher than the overall average of the rest of the chain (54.1 Å2 for residues 541-1254). Average values do not tell the whole story in this case, but a plot of <italic>B</italic>-factor values versus residues for the two chains are illustrative (the blue trace is for chain A, and the green for chain B). This plot is now provided as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>.</p><p>The average <italic>B</italic>-factor for chain A rises precipitously at residue 1255, which corresponds with the high RSR Z-score in the PDB validation report (the residues with the red dots).<fig id="fig14" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22567.026</object-id><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22567.026">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22567.026</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-22567-resp-fig5-v2"/></fig></p><p>The electron density for this region of chain A is of poor quality; however, there is no indication that this portion of chain A is not present in the crystal used in this experiment (i.e., it is not a fragment due to proteolysis). Two observations support the existence of an intact C1C2BMUN fragment for chain A: 1) SDS PAGE gels of crystalline samples do not indicate proteolysis, and 2) a fragment that terminated at residue 1255, which is in the loop between H19 and H20, would destabilize the fragment by splitting the 5-helical bundle of the C subdomain. Reciprocal-space refinement after removal of residues A1255-A1517 from the model resulted in a worsening of the R(free) and model geometry. It is for this reason that we have included a plot of atomic thermal displacement parameters (<italic>B</italic>-factors) versus residue for both chains as a supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>) and included the following statement in the Methods section: “Due to the high ADP values for the CD subdomain of chain A, the authors recommend that interpretation of the CD subdomain should be performed on residues in chain B. The density for the remaining domains of chain A as well as chain B of C1C2BMUN is strong and well connected; in fact, the average ADPs for residues 541-950 are lower for chain A (41.0 Å2) than for chain B (62.4 Å2).”</p><p>The high RSR Z-score values in chain B also correspond to localized regions of high average <italic>B</italic>- factor, most commonly in loop regions connecting secondary structural elements.<fig id="fig15" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22567.027</object-id><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22567.027">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22567.027</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-22567-resp-fig6-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>2) There is a structure of the MUN domain reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, but it seems that it is not discussed in the text.

Unfortunately the geometry of the coordinates as originally deposited were deemed worse than coordinates relative to a similar resolution in the PDB, especially in terms of Clashscore and Sidechain outliers.<fig id="fig16" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22567.028</object-id><label>Author response image 7.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22567.028">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22567.028</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-22567-resp-fig7-v2"/></fig></p><p>A more detailed assessment of the issues with the coordinates can be found by using the <italic>MolProbity</italic> server, which classified the Clashscore in the 91<sup>st</sup> percentile, and the overall <italic>MolProbity</italic> score in the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile for the resolution range of 2.90 Å +/- 0.25 Å.<fig id="fig17" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22567.029</object-id><label>Author response image 8.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22567.029">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22567.029</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-22567-resp-fig8-v2"/></fig></p><p>After re-refinement of the coordinates versus the original structure factors, the geometric parameters are more reasonable, with both the Clashscore and the overall <italic>MolProbity</italic> score in the 100<sup>th</sup> percentile for the resolution range of 2.90 Å +/- 0.25 Å.<fig id="fig18" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22567.030</object-id><label>Author response image 9.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22567.030">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22567.030</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-22567-resp-fig9-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig19" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22567.031</object-id><label>Author response image 10.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22567.031">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22567.031</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-22567-resp-fig10-v2"/></fig></p><p>The plot of <italic>B</italic>-factor values for the MUN domain versus the two chains of C1C2BMUN are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20">Author response image 11</xref> (the blue trace is for C1C2BMUN chain A, the green for C1C2BMUN chain B, and the red for the MUN domain).<fig id="fig20" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22567.032</object-id><label>Author response image 11.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22567.032">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22567.032</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-22567-resp-fig11-v2"/></fig></p><p>The high RSRZ values from the PDB validation report for the MUN domain also correspond to localized regions of high average <italic>B</italic>-factor, most commonly in loop regions connecting secondary structural elements.<fig id="fig21" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22567.033</object-id><label>Author response image 12.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22567.033">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22567.033</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-22567-resp-fig12-v2"/></fig></p><p>We note that the program <italic>REFMAC</italic> was used in the refinement of the MUN domain for the original PDB deposition of 4Y21.</p><p><italic>3) Is there potential flexibility (e.g., bending) of the fragment?

In this figure, C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN chain A is green and C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN chain B is red. The magnitude of bending in the fragment is relatively small, and the differences observed in this study are highest in the CD subdomain, which is the region of weakest density in chain A. Note that an alignment of the fragments from residue 541-1254 of chains A and B results in an r.m.s.d. of 0.71 Å, not terribly different than the maximum likelihood coordinate error estimate of 0.41 Å. Please also keep in mind that initial rounds of refinement of the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN structure used the MUN domain as a reference model for geometry restraints, and the final rounds of refinement removed the reference model restraints but included torsional-angle NCS geometry restraints between chains A and B.

We realize that a structural characterization of the mutants (although certainly desirable and interesting) goes beyond what can be done, particularly when considering that the purification of these mutant proteins may be difficult. However, we suggest to express these mutants (or at least the domains containing the mutants) in an eukaryotic cell and then check expression of the intact fragments by western blotting. Since unfolded proteins are usually degraded, the presence of non-degraded protein would increase confidence that the expressed proteins do not have major folding defects.</italic> </p><p>The rescue experiments already involved expression in eukaryotic cells (neurons) and the Western blots of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> show that full-length proteins were detectable. The mutant C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragments used for the reconstitution assays were expressed in another type of eukaryotic cell (Sf9). Hence, we believe that expression in yet another type of eukaryotic cell would not be very informative. In the Materials and methods section we have added the following sentence: “The finding that the mutants eluted at the same volumes as WT C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C in gel filtration and did not exhibit a higher tendency to degradation strongly suggest that the mutations do not cause folding problems.” Below we show the gel filtration chromatograms obtained for the WT and three C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C mutants, but we feel is not necessary to include them into the paper. As we pointed out in the manuscript, we did have problems expressing the V549E,L554E mutant in Sf9 cells. However, the finding that this mutant rescues evoked release as efficiently as WT Munc13-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) strongly suggests that the mutation does not cause major folding problems.<fig id="fig22" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22567.034</object-id><label>Author response image 13.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22567.034">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22567.034</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-22567-resp-fig13-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>5) The phenotype of the N940W mutation is interpreted as &quot;an easier transition for Munc13-1 to a potentiated state&quot; (subsection “Functional consequences caused by disruption of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN domain interfaces”, last paragraph). However, the functional consequence of this &quot;potentiated state&quot; is not demonstrated. Is there a higher Pvr or more priming in this state? Therefore, priming and Pvr should tested right after the 10Hz train by hypertonic (500mM) sucrose stimulation.</italic> </p><p>We fully appreciate this criticism, which has led us to analyze which of the release parameters in the rescue mutants were affected during high frequency stimulation. We have performed additional electrophysiological experiments, recording EPSCs and evoked sucrose release immediately after a 10 Hz action potential train to investigate whether RRP or release probability underlie the changes in steady-state responses during the train (data shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and described in subsection “Functional consequences caused by disruption of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN domain interfaces”, seventh and eighth paragraphs). In general, no large change in vesicle priming was observed for WT or any of the mutants, but we found that Pvr was a main modulator underlying train behavior. Thus, the vesicular release probability doubled after the AP train for WT Munc13-1, and increased even more for the N940W mutant. In contrast, no increase in Pvr was observed for the V549E,L554E and R750E,K752E mutants, which depress more strongly than WT Munc13-1 during the AP trains.</p></body></sub-article></article>
