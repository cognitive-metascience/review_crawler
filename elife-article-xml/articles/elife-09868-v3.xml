By selectively reducing responses to frequently, but not rarely, occurring sounds, auditory cortical neurons are thought to enhance the brain's ability to detect unexpected events through stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA). The majority of neurons in the primary auditory cortex exhibit SSA, yet little is known about the underlying cortical circuits. We found that two types of cortical interneurons differentially amplify SSA in putative excitatory neurons. Parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PVs) amplify SSA by providing non-specific inhibition: optogenetic suppression of PVs led to an equal increase in responses to frequent and rare tones. In contrast, somatostatin-positive interneurons (SOMs) selectively reduce excitatory responses to frequent tones: suppression of SOMs led to an increase in responses to frequent, but not to rare tones. A mutually coupled excitatory-inhibitory network model accounts for distinct mechanisms by which cortical inhibitory neurons enhance the brain's sensitivity to unexpected sounds.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09868.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09868.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09868.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In everyday life, we are often exposed to a mix of different sounds. An essential task for our brain is to separate the important sounds from the unimportant ones. For example, stepping out onto a busy street, you may at first be very aware of the noise of traffic. Later, you may start to ignore the din and instead only notice sounds that break the monotony: a honking car horn or maybe a stranger's voice. This is because the neurons in the auditory pathway respond differently to common and rare sounds. In particular, excitatory neurons in the region termed the ‘auditory cortex’ send fewer nerve impulses in response to frequent sounds, but respond vigorously to rare sounds. This phenomenon is called ‘stimulus-specific adaptation’, but it is not known exactly which neurons in this brain region enable this process to occur.</p><p>Now, Natan et al. have combined different cutting-edge neuroscience techniques to identify the circuit of brain cells that drives this stimulus specific adaptation. A technique called optogenetics was used to effectively ‘turn off’ each of two kinds of inhibitory neuron in the auditory cortex of mice, by exposing the brain to colored light from a laser.</p><p>Natan et al. found that both kinds of inhibitory neuron amplified stimulus-specific adaptation, but via different mechanisms. One of these neuron types, called ‘parvalbumin-positive interneurons’, exerted a general effect on excitatory neurons and suppressed responses to both frequent and rare sounds As the responses to rare sounds started off greater than the responses to frequent sounds, suppressing both by an equal amount actually led to an increase in the relative difference between them. On the other hand, the second kind of inhibitory neuron, called ‘somatostatin-positive interneurons’, only reduced the excitatory neurons' responses to frequent sounds; these neurons had no effect on responses to rare noises.</p><p>Future studies will test how specific adaptation in different contexts can help us to behaviorally detect rare sounds while ignoring common ones, and search for the circuits beyond the auditory cortex that support hearing in complex sound environments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

Adaptation to stimulus context is thought to increase efficiency of sensory coding under the constraints of limited resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barlow, 1961</xref>). Yet, the neuronal-circuit mechanisms that facilitate adaptation in the cortex remain poorly understood. In the primary auditory cortex (A1), the vast majority of neurons exhibit stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). When presented with a sequence of two tones, one of which occurs frequently (termed ‘standard’) and another rarely (termed ‘deviant’), the neuron's response to the standard tone becomes weaker, but the response to the deviant tone remains strong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ulanovsky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Szymanski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Farley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fishman and Steinschneider, 2012</xref>). Whereas SSA has also been found in sub-cortical structures e.g. in the auditory midbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Malmierca et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Thomas et al., 2012</xref>) and the auditory thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kraus et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antunes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bauerle et al., 2011</xref>), it is weak in the lemniscal areas of the auditory pathway, which project to A1, and stronger in those non-lemniscal areas which receive feedback from A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ulanovsky et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Perez-Gonzalez et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Duque et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, cortical circuits are proposed to contribute to and amplify SSA in A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ulanovsky et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Szymanski et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bauerle et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fishman and Steinschneider, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Escera and Malmierca, 2014</xref>), through a combination of plastic modulation of thalamocortical inputs and intra-cortical inhibitory circuits, which would allow for selective suppression of neuronal responses to specific stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nelken, 2014</xref>).

While different interneuron types have been hypothesized to carry out specialized complementary functions in sensory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DeFelipe, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Markram et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kepecs and Fishell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Marlin et al., 2015</xref>), their function in driving changes in dynamic auditory processing has not been previously established. We hypothesized that the two most common types of interneurons in the cortex, parvalbumin- (PVs) and somatostatin-positive interneurons (SOMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rudy et al., 2011</xref>), facilitate SSA in excitatory neurons of A1 in a complementary fashion. PVs, a subset of which receive direct thalamic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Staiger et al., 1996</xref>), may amplify SSA in excitatory neurons by providing a constant inhibitory drive; equally strong inhibitory drive would attenuate the weak response to standard tones relatively more than the strong response to deviant tones, leading to a greater differential between standard vs deviant tone spiking response. SOMs, which target distal dendrites of pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McGarry et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gentet et al., 2012</xref>), have excitatory synapses that exhibit facilitation upon repetitive stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Reyes et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Silberberg and Markram, 2007</xref>). Therefore, inputs from SOMs may exert a stimulus-specific increase in suppression of excitatory neurons that is selective to the standard tone and does not generalize to the deviant tone. Alternatively, they may contribute to selective adaptation in excitatory neurons through differential post-synaptic integration.</p><p>To tease apart the function of different inhibitory types in SSA, we tested whether optogenetic suppression of either PV or SOM interneurons during sound presentation reduced SSA in putative excitatory neurons in the auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hamilton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Weible et al., 2014</xref>).

Photosuppression of either PVs or SOMs affected the responses of neurons to the tones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>), resulting in a significant reduction in SSA index across the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>, PV-Cre: Δ = −41%, p1 = 1e<sup>−12</sup>, t(66) = 8.6.

The effects of PV and SOM suppression on SSA had differential laminar distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). The effect of PVs on SSA was equally strong in the supra-granular and infra-granular layers, but stronger in the granular layer, that is, the thalamo-recipient layer. This differential effect is consistent with the relative proportion of cortical interneurons that are PVs, which is higher in granular than either in infra- or supra-granular layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ouellet and de Villers-Sidani, 2014</xref>). In contrast, suppressing SOMs reduced SSA in the granular and infra-granular, but not supra-granular layers. The relative proportion of cortical interneurons that are SOMs is greatest in the granular and infra-granular layers, but still present in supra-granular layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ouellet and de Villers-Sidani, 2014</xref>). As some SOMs predominantly target the distal dendrites of pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Markram et al., 2004</xref>), the effect of suppressing SOMs in supra-granular layers may be evident in recordings of pyramidal neurons with cell bodies in deeper layers, supporting our results. In addition, cortical extracellular recordings may be biased toward neurons in granular and infra-granular layers, precluding adequate sampling of activity in superficial layers. In controls, we did not observe a difference in the effect of light on SSA across layers, demonstrating that the differences are not due to differential artifact of light stimulation.</p><p>Our results indicate that both PVs and SOMs affect SSA, but in different ways: (1) the increase in the FR of putative excitatory neurons due to PV suppression is constant, either during presentation of the standard or the deviant, and greater than changes in spontaneous activity. Thus, PVs amplify SSA in excitatory neurons by exerting a <italic>relatively</italic> stronger inhibitory drive for the standard than for the deviant. (2) Suppression of SOMs leads to increased putative excitatory neuron activity only during the spontaneous firing or the presentation of the standard, but not for the deviant. This suggests that the strength of SOM-mediated inhibitory drive is not significant in response to the deviant but increases with repeated presentations of the standard.</p><p>In neurons exhibiting SSA, responses to the deviant are stronger than to the standard. This difference might lead to a ‘ceiling’ effect, reducing the effect of PV photosuppression on FR to the deviant, but not standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Olsen et al., 2012</xref>). However, restricting the analysis to two subpopulations of neurons, which have matched mean and standard deviation of FR to the standard vs the deviant tones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ulanovsky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rust and Dicarlo, 2010</xref>), preserved the observed effects of photosuppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Suppressing PVs led to an equal increase in FR to both the standard and the deviant tone (N = 54—standard: Δ = 62%, p2 = 6e<sup>−8</sup>, t(53) = 6.3. Deviant: Δ = 55%, p2 = 3e<sup>−5</sup>, t(53) = 4.5. Standard vs deviant: p2 &gt; 0.05, t(53) = 0.5). In contrast, suppressing SOMs led to a significant increase in FR to the standard, but no change in FR to the deviant (N = 44—standard: Δ = 30%, p2 = 7e<sup>−6</sup>, t(43) = 5.1. Deviant: p2 &gt; 0.19, t(43) = 1.3. Standard vs deviant: Δ = 382%, p2 = 6e<sup>−4</sup>, t(43) = 3.7).</p><p>For neurons that responded more strongly to one of the tones (‘strong’ vs ‘weak’ tone), a ceiling effect would predict that the effect of interneuron suppression would be stronger for the weak than the strong tone. However, PV and SOM suppression exhibited a similar effect on responses to the strong and the weak tones in neurons that exhibited differential responses to two tones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5 fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplements 5, 6</xref>). Suppressing PVs led to similar increases in tone-evoked FR between weak and strong tones for both deviant (N = 51, p2 &gt; 0.05, t(50) = 1.0) and standard tones (p2 &gt; 0.05, t(50) = −1.9). Suppressing SOMs also led to similar differential effects between strong and weak tones; standard tone-evoked FR increased equally (N = 34, p2 &gt; 0.05, t(33) = 1.1) and deviant tone-evoked FR was equally unchanged (p2 = 0.05, t(33) = −0.1). Combined, these analyses demonstrate that the effect of PV photosuppression on SSA cannot be explained by the ceiling effect for either PVs or SOMs.</p><p>Although Arch drove strong currents in both SOM and PV neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1 fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 1, 2</xref>), there might be a difference in expression level or efficacy of Arch between SOM-Cre and PV-Cre mice, leading to a stronger effect of photosuppression in PV-Cre than in SOM-Cre mice on tone-evoked FRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,E</xref>). Alternatively, the difference might be attributable to the morphological or functional differences between SOMs and PVs. To address this confound, we selected tone responses that exhibited matched difference in standard tone-evoked FR between light-on and light-off trials (N = 66, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7</xref>). Within these matched subpopulations, PV and SOM photosuppression exhibited differential effects similar to those of the whole population. The change in FR due to PV suppression was not significantly different between responses to the standard and deviant (p2 &gt; 0.05, t(65) = −0.3, C = 3). By contrast, the change in deviant tone-evoked FR due to SOM suppression was significantly weaker than that for the standard tone (Δ = −78%, p2 = 0.003, t(3.5), C = 3). By the design of the analysis, the effect of PV or SOM suppression on standard tone-evoked FR was nearly identical (p1 &gt; 0.05, t(65) = −0.1, C = 3). However, the change in deviant tone-evoked FR was greater for PV photosuppression than SOM photosuppression (Δ = 404%, p1 = 0.029, t(65) = 2.4, C = 3). Since the observed differential effects of PV and SOM suppression persisted in subsets of neurons that were matched for photosuppression-induced change in standard tone-evoked FR, these differences are unlikely due to differential expression or efficacy of Arch in the PV-Cre and SOM-Cre mice, but rather reflect functional differences between the two types of interneurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>SOM-mediated suppression of putative excitatory neurons increases with repeated presentations of the standard tone, whereas PV-mediated suppression remains stable</title><p>Within the oddball sequence, after the presentation of the deviant tone, SSA takes several repeats of the standard tone to reach an adapted state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ulanovsky et al., 2004</xref>).

Spontaneous, standard, and deviant input levels all fall within the linear portion of the transfer function between inputs and change in the excitatory neuron activity. On the other hand, for SOMs, modulation of their activity in the deviant tone-evoked regime drives small to no changes in excitatory neuronal activity, whereas modulation of SOM activity in the spontaneous and standard tone-evoked regime drives significant changes in excitatory neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, right inset). The deviant tone-evoked activity falls on the saturating part of the input–output transfer function, whereas the standard tone-evoked and spontaneous inputs fall on the linear part of the transfer function. Then, shifts in SOM inputs due to photosuppression evoke small changes during deviant tone responses, but larger changes during either standard or spontaneous activity. Either PV or SOM manipulation would result in reduction of combined SSA of excitatory neurons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The majority of neurons in the auditory cortex selectively reduce their responses to frequent, but not rare sounds, exhibiting SSA. However, the cortical mechanisms involved in the production and stimulus-specificity of SSA within the auditory cortex are not well understood. Here, we found that, in addition to adaptation at the level of thalamocortical inputs, two distinct types of interneurons, PVs and SOMs, differentially contributed to SSA in the primary auditory cortex. Optogenetic suppression of either PVs or SOMs led to a reduction in SSA in putative excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Suppression of PVs led to an equal increase in the FR of the putative excitatory neurons in response to the standard tone and the deviant tone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). By contrast, suppression of SOMs significantly increased the response to the standard tone but lacked a significant effect on the response to the deviant tone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This series of findings expands on the ‘adaptation in narrowly tuned units’ model, which proposes that repeated presentation of the standard stimulus drives adaptation within more narrowly tuned inputs, such as thalamocortical inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mill et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Taaseh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nelken, 2014</xref>). Our data indicate dual effects of cortical inhibition on SSA: (1) PVs contribute to SSA by providing a constant level of inhibition, resulting in a <italic>relatively</italic> higher inhibitory drive during the presentation of the standard, as compared to the deviant. Taking into account the non-linear synaptic input to FR output function of a typical pyramidal neuron, the constant inhibition amplifies the effect of thalamocortical depression in suppressing the response of the neuron to repeated stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). (2) The selective increase of the inhibitory drive from SOMs for standard stimulus as compared to the deviant stimulus responses might be explained by a shift in the non-linear transfer function between inputs to SOMs and their outputs to excitatory neurons, possibly due to facilitation of SOM-to-excitatory neuron synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beierlein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Silberberg and Markram, 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, we found that, despite the differential effect of PV and SOM suppression on tone-evoked responses in putative excitatory neurons, both PVs and SOMs exhibit SSA. This finding is consistent with previous results that found that thalamocortical synapses onto inhibitory neurons and synapses from inhibitory neurons to excitatory cells can be depressing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ma et al., 2012</xref>). How does suppression of these interneurons result in differential reduction in SSA in excitatory neurons? Our model provides an intuition for this effect: the mutually coupled excitatory–inhibitory network model demonstrates that the observed differential effects of PV and SOM suppression may be due to their differential action on excitatory neuronal responses in the unadapted and adapted state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Tone-evoked responses of PVs would fall on the linear portion of the transfer function between PV activity and excitatory neuron depolarization, while the same tones maximally affect inputs from SOMs onto excitatory neurons, with SSA shifting the inputs to the linear, more sensitive range of inputs from SOMs. Thus, SSA may serve an additional function: to adjust the responses of neurons in a range that is more sensitive to small changes in the inputs from both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations. More generally, the simulation demonstrates that a circuit element, such as PVs or SOMs, that itself adapts may further amplify adaptation in the excitatory neurons.</p><p>To estimate the differential contribution of PVs or SOMs inputs to the excitatory neurons, we measured the difference in the FR of neurons due to optogenetic partial suppression of their firing. This measurement provides an estimate of the change in the FR of the putative excitatory neurons with the change in combined inputs to the inhibitory neurons, thereby allowing estimation of the synaptic transfer function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, insets). A simple biologically plausible network incorporating these transfer functions can reproduce the observed responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). There are several caveats to this interpretation. First, the FR may not linearly translate onto synaptic input strength because of the spiking non-linear rectification between the inputs and outputs of the putative excitatory neuron: a small change in FR in the low-FR regime might correspond to a greater change in the synaptic drive than a similar-sized change in FR in the high-FR regime. However, our findings would still hold were this the case: in examining the effect of SOM suppression on response to the deviant, the actual difference in the synaptic drive between the deviant and the standard would then be even greater than observed. At the other end of the non-linearity, the analysis of neuronal responses sorted based on their FR to the standard tone and the deviant tone revealed that the ‘ceiling effect’ would not contribute to a decreased effect of photostimulation on the response to the deviant in SOM-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4 fig4s5 fig4s6 fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplements 4–7</xref>). Second, PVs and SOMs may inhibit not only the excitatory neurons, but also each other. SOMs make synapses onto PVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cottam et al., 2013</xref>), thereby potentially suppressing them with repeated presentation of the standard. Therefore, when SOMs are suppressed, some PVs may be disinhibited and provide a stronger suppression of excitatory neurons. The null effect on responses to the deviant tone during SOM suppression could result from a combination of increase in inhibition from disinhibited PVs in addition to reduced inhibition of SOMs onto excitatory neurons. Including inhibition from SOMs to PVs in the proof-of-principle model supported experimental findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Third, other interneuron types, such as vasopressin-positive interneuron may be involved in the circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pi et al., 2013</xref>), and the changes that we observe may reflect several inhibitory stages of processing.</p><p>One must be cautious in translating the data from our experiments as a strict description of neuronal activity in awake animals, as our results were based on recordings from mice under light isoflurane anesthesia. Other forms of anesthesia, such as pentobarbital-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheung et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gaese and Ostwald, 2001</xref>), ketamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Otazu et al., 2009</xref>) and high concentrations of isoflurane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheung et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ter-Mikaelian et al., 2007</xref>), can affect multiple aspects of sound-evoked responses in the auditory cortex. Nonetheless, our results are likely to extend for awake mice, since isoflurane anesthesia-induced effects on neuronal activity decrease as the concentration of isoflurane is reduced to the levels used in our recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Land et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, all recordings and manipulations were performed under identical anesthetic conditions, and our conclusions are based on the relative comparison of the effects of suppressing PVs and SOMs, which are expected to hold under awake conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Centanni et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>While not demonstrated directly, SSA has been linked to detection of deviant sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ulanovsky et al., 2003</xref>), which may be facilitated by a relatively enhanced neuronal response to a change in the ongoing sound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nelken et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Winkler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grimm and Escera, 2012</xref>). By suppressing the responses to a frequently presented tone, the responses of neurons to a rare stimulus become relatively enhanced. However, whether and how modulating SSA in the auditory cortex affects auditory behavior has not yet been tested. Inhibitory interneurons may prove to have a complementary role in shaping auditory perception in addition to receptive field reorganization driven by synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Froemke et al., 2013</xref>). The use of optogenetic methods to test the function of inhibitory interneurons in SSA overcomes the limitations of lesion or pharmacological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Elliott and Trahiotis, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duque et al., 2014</xref>), which only allow for prolonged, non-selective inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Moore et al., 2001</xref>). By combining optogenetic manipulation of interneuron activity with behavioral measurements, future experiments will explore whether interneuron-mediated SSA indeed affects the auditory behavior of the subject, such as enhanced ability to detect unexpected events.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>In vivo experimental preparation</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experiments were performed in adult male mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, United States; age, 12–15 weeks; weight, 22–32 g; PV-Cre mice, strain: <italic>B6;129P2-Pvalbtm1(cre)Arbr/J</italic>; SOM-Cre: <italic>Ssttm2.1(cre)Zjh/J</italic>) housed at 28°C on a 12-hr light:dark cycle with water and food provided ad libitum.

Electrodes were targeted to A1 on the basis of stereotaxic coordinates and in relation to blood vessels. In electrophysiological recordings, the location was confirmed by examining the click and tone-pip responses of the recorded units for characteristic responses of neurons in core auditory areas, as described previously by our group in the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carruthers et al., 2013</xref>) and by other groups in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Linden and Schreiner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Marlin et al., 2015</xref>). While the electrodes were targeted to A1, some recordings may include data from the anterior auditory field, adjacent to A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Linden et al., 2003</xref>). Mice were placed in the recording chamber, anesthetized with isoflurane, and the headpost secured to a custom base, immobilizing the head. After drilling a craniotomy and creating a durotomy exposing auditory cortex, a silicon multi-channel probe (A1x32-Poly2-5mm-50s-177 [Poly-2] or A1x32-tri-5mm-91-121-A32 [Triode], Neuronexus Ann Arbor, MI, United States) was slowly lowered to between 750 µm and 1 mm into the cortex, perpendicular to the cortical surface and used to record electrical activity. Raw signals from 32 channels were bandpass filtered at 600–6000 Hz and thresholded for spike analysis, or at 10–300 Hz for LFP and CSD analysis (Poly-2 probe only), digitized at 32 kHz and stored for offline analysis (Neuralynx, Bozeman, MT, United States). Common-mode noise was removed by referencing a probe inserted in the brain outside the auditory cortex. On the Poly-2 probe, two rows of 16 electrodes each on a single shank were arranged such that each electrode site was 50 µm away from all three closest neighbors. This arrangement allowed us to record densely across depth, that is, one electrode for every 25 µm in depth. On the triode, electrodes were arranged in groups of three equidistant sites, forming an equilateral triangle (25-µm separation). The triodes were separated vertically by 91-µm center-to-center distance, spanning 1 mm, with two additional single sites, one on each end.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-5"><title>Unit identification</title><p>Spike sorting was performed using commercial software (Offline Sorter, Plexon, Dallas, TX, United States) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carruthers et al., 2013</xref>).

First, to measure tuning, a train of 50 pure tones of frequencies spaced logarithmically between 1 and 80 kHz, at 65-dB sound pressure level (SPL) relative to 20 µPa, in pseudorandom order, was presented 20 times. Each tone was 100-ms long, with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 300 ms. Frequency response functions were calculated online for several multiunits, and two frequencies (separated by 0.39 octaves), which elicited spiking responses of similar strength, were selected as tone A and B. Next, a series of stimuli composed of tones A and B were presented in interleaved blocks, repeated four times. Each oddball stimulus consisted of a train of 653 A and B tones (100-ms long, 300-ms ISI, 65-dB SPL). In oddball stimulus 1, 90% of the tones were A (standard), while 10% of the tones were B (deviant). We used a frozen sequence of standard and deviant tones in pseudorandom order and counterbalanced with respect to the number of standard tones preceding each deviant.

FR was measured separately for each tone, A and B, as standard, deviant, and equal probabilities, and for light-off and light-on trials. FR normalization was carried out separately for each tone, A and B, for each neuron by dividing the response under all conditions by the maximum FR (across 5-ms bins) of the deviant tone, light-off condition. Performing this normalization by dividing response in all conditions by the mean, rather than maximum FR of the deviant tone, light-off condition did not alter significant results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8</xref>). For all FR analyses, each neuron's responses to tones A and B were treated separately, and each was only included if the light-off deviant tone-evoked FR was significantly greater than the spontaneous FR (Wilcoxon signed-rank test p &lt; 0.05). Further, tone responses were only included in analysis if the neuronal FR during each oddball stimulus exceeded 0.02 Hz, and the neuron was significantly tuned to the tone. Tuning was considered significant if the spike count in response to a tone (A or B) was significantly higher than the pool of spike counts across all tones outside one octave band centered on tones A and B (N = 42, t-test, p1 &lt; 0.05). Population responses in each condition were measured as the mean and standard error of FRs across tone responses in each experimental group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>SSA index</title><p>For each neuron, SSA index is a measure of the strength of SSA based on its mean FR with respect to tone probability.

Criteria for inclusion in the analysis were the same as in <italic>tone response FR</italic> analysis described above, with the added criterion that the deviant tone-evoked FR must be greater than spontaneous FR for each of tones A and B (Wilcoxon signed-rank test p &lt; 0.05).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Localization of cortical layers and CSD</title><p>To calculate the CSD, the net current density moving through cortical tissue at 32 positions along the cortical axis was calculated based on LFPs of responses to tones recorded on each electrode, by using the second order central finite difference to calculate the second spatial derivative across the LFPs over the vertically arranged electrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Szymanski et al., 2009</xref>).

The tone-evoked amplitude of the CSD was measured by first calculating root mean square of each channel during the first 50-ms post-tone onset, and then calculating the mean across all electrodes determined to fall within either the deepest short latency sink (granular layer) or pooled across all electrodes either above (supra-granular layer) or below (infra-granular layer). For each session, the granular layer CSD amplitude for all tone conditions was normalized across conditions by the deviant tone, light-off condition, and the mean across sessions was statistically analyzed. The SSA index was calculated as described in <italic>SSA index</italic> on the basis of the amplitude.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Statistical tests</title><p>For all statistical tests in which N ≥ 30, we applied the Student's <italic>t</italic>-test (Matlab, Mathworks, Natick, MA, United States) unless specified otherwise, and reported the p-value, degrees of freedom, and t-statistic.

If any group's variance was non-normal, we applied a non-parametric test, for example, Wilcoxon sign rank or rank sum test (Matlab), and provided the z-statistic for any group with a normal distribution. For all tests, Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons and reported as ‘C = X’ where X is the factor by which the p-value was adjusted.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior editor), and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Andrew King (Reviewing editor); Jennifer Linden (peer reviewer); Ben Willmore (peer reviewer).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper investigates the contribution of two types of inhibitory interneuron to the generation of stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA) by neurons in the mouse auditory cortex. SSA is exhibited by neurons in non-lemniscal regions of the inferior colliculus and medial geniculate body, but appears to be a largely emergent property in the primary auditory cortex. Consequently, investigating the cortical circuitry that gives rise to this phenomenon is an important and largely unexplored question.</p><p>The authors show that optogenetic suppression of parvalbumin-positive (PV) cells produces a non-specific reduction of inhibition, which augments cortical responses to both deviant and standard tones by a similar amount (but produces an apparent reduction in the conventional “SSA index”, because the increase in response is proportionally greater for standard than for deviant tones). More interestingly, this work also shows that optogenetic suppression of somatostatin-positive (SOM) cortical interneurons specifically augments cortical responses to standard over deviant tones, and therefore reduces SSA. These results therefore suggest that PV cells contribute to SSA only through non-specific inhibition of responses to both deviant and standard tones, but that SOM cells selectively reduce cortical responses to frequently repeated standard tones and specifically amplify SSA.</p><p>The authors provide a large number of important and worthwhile controls to rule out alternative explanations for their findings, and also include a mathematical model to support their hypothesis that differences in the impact of PV and SOM inhibition on SSA could arise if the two interneuron types operate in different ranges of an essentially sigmoidal synaptic transfer function. The reviewers agree that this study provides a valuable insight into the mechanisms of SSA, but have raised a number of concerns about the analysis, modeling and presentation of the results.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Low impedance linear probes with recording sites separated by 50 µm were used. In a number of places, the authors refer to single unit activity. It is unlikely that the authors would have been able to isolate single units with low-impedance Neuronexus probes. At very least, more information about spike sorting and sorting quality, as well as the percentage of recordings that were actually multi-unit clusters need to be provided. The results of the present experiments are likely to be robust even if the proportion of multi-unit recordings is high, but this needs to be made clear in the manuscript (for example, for interpretation of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig6">Figures 4 and 6</xref>).</p><p>2) Most of the figures show normalized firing rate measures, and most of the reported analyses were conducted on normalized firing rates. The Methods section indicates that firing rates were normalized for each neuron by dividing by the *maximum* response evoked by a deviant tone. Response measures based on a maximum (or minimum) are extremely sensitive to noise. It is very important to confirm that none of the key results would have been different had the authors used a more noise-robust normalization strategy, such as normalizing by the average response to deviant tones rather than the maximum.</p><p>3) The statistics in this paper are poorly presented, which undermines confidence in the results. Details of the statistics used are missing throughout, and need to be presented in a conventional format. The paragraph on “Statistical tests” in the Methods makes a general statement, but does not clarify what was done in individual cases. Multiple t-tests appear to be have been over used. In most places it would have been better to use a non-parametric test, such as the Wilcoxon tests that are referred to in 3 places. Where the use of multiple t-tests can be justified, it is essential to state when one- or two-tailed tests were used, and to provide effect sizes and indicate when p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons. Faith in the authors' statistical analysis is not helped by the fact that greater-than (&gt;) signs appear to have been used where less-than (&lt;) signs were intended in many cases (e.g. p&gt;0.05).</p><p>4) The known impact of isofluorane and other volatile anesthetics on temporal aspects of neuronal responses – as demonstrated in rodent barrel cortex – could be a significant issue for SSA measurements Published data in cats suggests that isoflurane suppresses responses, increases latencies and increases thresholds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheung et al. 2001</xref>). Whilst acknowledging that the effects of modulating the activity of two different inhibitory interneuron populations were studied under the same anesthetic conditions, this issue should be mentioned in the Discussion.</p><p>5) It appears that the parameters of the mathematical model (e.g. for synaptic transfer functions for simulated PV and SOM cells) were not taken from experimental data, but rather were chosen to ensure that model replicated as closely as possible the impact of PV and SOM manipulations on SSA. There is a reference in the third paragraph of the Discussion, to direct estimation of the synaptic transfer function for PV and SOM cells, but it is not evident what data were used for this estimation (and the referenced insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> have no quantitative axis labels). Justification for the parameters and sigmoid functions used needs to be provided. Also the model assigns equivalent connectivity patterns between PV, SOM and excitatory neurons. Although both types of interneuron receive local excitatory inputs, only PV interneurons receive thalamocortical and feedforward corticocortical inputs and PV neurons provide largely unidirectional inhibition of SOM neurons. This should be taken into account in the model. At the very least, the authors should discuss this issue as a major limitation of the model (along with the fact that there is no attempt made to model differences in the location of PV versus SOM synaptic connections of the proximal versus distal parts of the excitatory cell's dendritic tree). While it is interesting that differences in the operating ranges for PV versus SOM synaptic transfer functions might in principle explain the observed differences in their impact on SSA, the model does not “reveal” mechanisms by which the different interneuron types exert their effects – and could not do so unless the underlying parameter choices were independently validated experimentally. We are not recommending that the modelling should be removed completely, but this section of the paper is currently rather weak.</p><p>6) The way the paper is written implies that the origin of SSA in the cortex is explained here (e.g. first sentence of Discussion). In fact, however, it seems that the explanation presented here depends on SSA already being present in excitatory, SOM and PV neurons. This paper is therefore really more about how PV/SOM neurons amplify SSA effects, rather than the origin of SSA itself. This needs to be clarified throughout. In particular, the PV interneurons appear to provide a general amplification of inhibition, rather than having any role that is specific to SSA.</p><p>7) The authors show using the expression of chanelrhodopsin in cre-PV and cre-SOM mice that both types of interneuron exhibit SSA. This is an important result, but are there any differences in the SSA exhibited by these interneurons and by cortical excitatory neurons? The hypothesis put forward in the Introduction that SOM neurons show facilitation to repetitive stimulation – and are therefore likely to have a greater suppressive effect on the response of excitatory neurons to the frequently presented standard tones – implies that this effect would be mediated at the level of the synaptic inputs to the SOM neurons. Consequently, SOM neurons should respond differently from PV neurons to repeated stimulation. Moreover, if, as suggested in the subsection “PVs and SOMs differentially suppress putative excitatory neuron responses to standard and deviant tones”, SOM neurons are firing at saturation to deviant tones, the authors should have the data to show this. It would strengthen the paper if the authors could show that SOM neurons eventually facilitate with repetitive stimulation, and that SOM cell responses are saturated for deviant tones.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09868.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We thank the reviewers and the editors for their careful reading, thoughtful comments and detailed critiques of our manuscript.

At very least, more information about spike sorting and sorting quality, as well as the percentage of recordings that were actually multi-unit clusters need to be provided.

We added the details in text. In particular, we did not specify the different configuration of the electrode sites on the two probes. On the Poly-2 probe, two rows of 16 electrodes each on a single shank were arranged such that each electrode site was 50 µm away from all closest neighbors. This arrangement allowed us to record densely across depth, i.e. one electrode for every 25 µm in depth. On the triode probe, electrodes were arranged in groups of 3 equidistant sites (25 µm apart). The triodes were separated vertically by 91 µm center-to-center distance, spanning 1 mm, with single sites on each end. Spike sorting was performed using commercial software (Offline Sorter, Plexon)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carruthers et al., 2013</xref>). In order to improve isolation of single units from recordings using low-impedance probes, spiking activity was sorted across three (Triode, separation 25 µm) or four (Poly-2, separation 50 µm) adjacent electrode sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Niell and Stryker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Olsen et al., 2012</xref>). We used a stringent set of criteria to isolate single units from multiunit clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Otazu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bizley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brasselet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Durand et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carruthers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Picard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carruthers et al., 2015</xref>), following published methods from our and other groups. Single-unit clusters contained &lt;1% of spikes within a 1.0-ms interspike interval, and the spike waveforms across 3 or 4 channels had to form a visually identifiable distinct cluster in a projection onto a three-dimensional subspace.</p><p>Methods now state:</p><p>“After drilling a craniotomy and creating a durotomy exposing auditory cortex, a sillicon multi-channel probe (A1x32-Poly2-5mm-50s-177[Poly-2] or A1x32-tri-5mm-91-121-A32 [Triode], Neuronexus) was slowly lowered to between 750 µm and 1 mm into the cortex, perpendicular to the cortical surface and used to record electrical activity. Raw signals from 32 channels were bandpass filtered at 600-6000 Hz and thresholded for spike analysis, or at 10-300 Hz for local field potential (LFP) and current-source density (CSD) analysis (Poly-2 probe only), digitized at 32 kHz and stored for offline analysis (Neuralynx). Common-mode noise was removed by referencing a probe inserted in the brain outside the auditory cortex. On the Poly-2 probe, two rows of 16 electrodes each on a single shank were arranged such that each electrode site was 50 µm away from all three closest neighbors. This arrangement allowed us to record densely across depth, i.e. one electrode for every 25 µm in depth. On the triode, electrodes were arranged in groups of 3 equidistant sites, forming an equilateral triangle (25 µm separation). The triodes were separated vertically by 91 µm center-to-center distance, spanning 1 mm, with single sites on each end.</p><p>Unit identification.

Single-unit clusters contained &lt;1% of spikes within a 1.0-ms interspike interval, and the spike waveforms across 3 or 4 channels had to form a visually identifiable distinct cluster in a projection onto a three-dimensional subspace. Putative excitatory neurons were identified based on their expected response patterns to sounds and the lack of significant suppression of the spontaneous FR due to light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lima et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Moore and Wehr, 2013</xref>). While this subpopulation may still contain inhibitory neurons, only 2% of all recorded neurons were significantly photo-suppressed at baseline (one-sided paired t-test, significance taken at p&lt;0.05). The low impedance of the extracellular probes precluded us from conducting a more detailed analysis of cortical subpopulations based on the spike waveform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartho et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Moore and Wehr, 2013</xref>).”</p><p><italic>2) Most of the figures show normalized firing rate measures, and most of the reported analyses were conducted on normalized firing rates. The Methods section indicates that firing rates were normalized for each neuron by dividing by the *maximum* response evoked by a deviant tone. Response measures based on a maximum (or minimum) are extremely sensitive to noise. It is very important to confirm that none of the key results would have been different had the authors used a more noise-robust normalization strategy, such as normalizing by the average response to deviant tones rather than the maximum.</italic></p><p>This is an important point. Our rationale for using the peak response for normalization of the data when the measurements are combined across neurons was to maximize the dynamic range of representation. However, the reviewer makes an important point that potentially, such analysis might be less robust to noise than using the mean firing rate. To double-check that the results would not change quantitatively if we used a different normalization procedure, we recomputed the statistics for the key results (presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) based on normalization by the mean, rather than maximum response. The results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4–figure supplement 8</xref> and confirm the findings done using the original normalization analysis. We find that suppression of PVs leads to a similar increase in firing rate in response to deviants and standards, whereas suppression of SOMs leads to a selective increase in response to the standard, but not the deviant. This additional analysis demonstrates that our results do not depend on the specific aspect of normalization in averaging the data across neurons.</p><p>Methods now state:</p><p>“FR normalization was carried out separately for each tone, A and B, for each neuron by dividing the response under all conditions by the maximum FR (across 5ms bins) of the deviant tone, light-off condition. Performing this normalization by dividing response in all conditions by the mean, rather than maximum FR of the deviant tone, light-off condition did not alter significant results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4–figure supplement 8</xref>).”</p><p><italic>3) The statistics in this paper are poorly presented, which undermines confidence in the results. Details of the statistics used are missing throughout, and need to be presented in a conventional format. The paragraph on “Statistical tests” in the Methods makes a general statement, but does not clarify what was done in individual cases. Multiple t-tests appear to be have been over used. In most places it would have been better to use a non-parametric test, such as the Wilcoxon tests that are referred to in 3 places. Where the use of multiple t-tests can be justified, it is essential to state when one- or two-tailed tests were used, and to provide effect sizes and indicate when p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons. Faith in the authors' statistical analysis is not helped by the fact that greater-than (&gt;) signs appear to have been used where less-than (&lt;) signs were intended in many cases (e.g. p&gt;0.05).</italic></p><p>We double-checked and adjusted, if necessary, all statistical tests in the manuscript. T-tests were used for single sample, paired and unpaired comparisons of data with N &gt; 30, or when tested for normality at p&lt; 0.05 (using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). Bonferroni correction, which is stringent, was used for multiple comparisons. For N &lt; 30, when the data did not meet the conditions for normality, we used the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test for single sample and paired comparisons and the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test for unpaired comparisons.</p><p>We now include an extended presentation of statistical tests. For each statistical test, we now report percent change, test used, p-value, whether one- or two-tailed test was used, z-statistic or t-statistic and number of free parameters, e.g. “..., resulting in a significant reduction in SSA index across the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, f</xref>, PV-Cre: Δ = -41%, p1 = 1e-12, t(66) = 8.6. SOM-Cre: Δ = -25%, p1 = 2e-6, t(42) = 5.4).” We use the abbreviation p1 when one-sided test was used, and p2 when two-sided test was used.</p><p>Methods now state:</p><p>“Statistical tests. For all statistical tests in which N&gt;=30, we applied the student’s t-test (Matlab) unless specified otherwise, and reported the p-value, degrees of freedom and t-statistic. For all tests with N &lt; 30, sample variance was tested for normality using the Komogorov-Smirnov test. If any group’s variance was non-normal, we applied a non-parametric test, e.g. Wilcoxon sign rank or rank sum test (Matlab), and provided the z-statistic for any group with a normal distribution. For all tests, Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons, and reported as “C=X” where X is the factor by which the p-value was adjusted. Statistical tests were single-tailed if there was a reasonable prior expectation about the direction of the difference between samples. p1 refers to one-sided, and p2 refers to two-sided statistics set. In all figures, single, double and triple stars indicate p &lt; 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001 respectively. Error bars in all figures represent the standard error of the mean, unless otherwise noted.”</p><p><italic>4) The known impact of isofluorane and other volatile anesthetics on temporal aspects of neuronal responses – as demonstrated in rodent barrel cortex – could be a significant issue for SSA measurements Published data in cats suggests that isoflurane suppresses responses, increases latencies and increases thresholds (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16"><italic>Cheung et al. 2001</italic></xref><italic>). Whilst acknowledging that the effects of modulating the activity of two different inhibitory interneuron populations were studied under the same anesthetic conditions, this issue should be mentioned in the Discussion.</italic></p><p>We added discussion of the effect of anesthetics on auditory responses in the Discussion:</p><p>“One must be cautious in translating the data from our experiments as a strict description of neuronal activity in awake animals, as our results were based on recordings from mice under light isoflurane anesthesia. Other forms of anesthesia, such as pentobarbital-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheung et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gaese and Ostwald, 2001</xref>), ketamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Otazu et al., 2009</xref>) and high concentrations of isoflurane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheung et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ter-Mikaelian et al., 2007</xref>), can affect multiple aspects of sound-evoked responses in the auditory cortex. Nonetheless, our results are likely to extend for awake mice, since isoflurane anesthesia-induced effects on neuronal activity decrease as the concentration of isoflurane is reduced to the levels used in our recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Land et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, all recordings and manipulations were performed under identical anesthetic conditions, and our conclusions are based on the relative comparison of the effects of suppressing PVs and SOMs, which are expected to hold under awake conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Centanni et al., 2013</xref>).”</p><p><italic>7) The authors show using the expression of chanelrhodopsin in cre-PV and cre-SOM mice that both types of interneuron exhibit SSA. This is an important result, but are there any differences in the SSA exhibited by these interneurons and by cortical excitatory neurons? The hypothesis put forward in the Introduction that SOM neurons show facilitation to repetitive stimulation – and are therefore likely to have a greater suppressive effect on the response of excitatory neurons to the frequently presented standard tones – implies that this effect would be mediated at the level of the synaptic inputs to the SOM neurons. Consequently, SOM neurons should respond differently from PV neurons to repeated stimulation. Moreover, if, as suggested in the subsection “PVs and SOMs differentially suppress putative excitatory neuron responses to standard and deviant tones“, SOM neurons are firing at saturation to deviant tones, the authors should have the data to show this. It would strengthen the paper if the authors could show that SOM neurons eventually facilitate with repetitive stimulation, and that SOM cell responses are saturated for deviant tones.</italic></p><p>One of our original interpretations of the differential effect of suppressing SOMs and PVs on SSA in putative excitatory neurons is that SOMs facilitated with repeated stimulus presentation, whereas PVs did not. However, when we examined the responses of optogenetically identified PVs and SOMs to the oddball stimulus, we were surprised to find that both types of interneurons themselves exhibited SSA, which was not consistent with this prediction. Rather, these results implied that the transformation may be achieved at the level of post-synaptic integration of inputs from PVs or SOMs rather than at the level of interneuron firing. Our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) was developed as a proof-of-principle, in order to understand whether such transformation was possible. Indeed, our model confirmed that an excitatory-inhibitory network with the properties for the non-linear transformation that we identify in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> can account for the observed effects: differential amplification of SSA by interneurons, which themselves exhibit SSA, subject to the constraints in the non-linear transfer function that we discuss.</p><p>We edited the Introduction to state:</p><p>“ We hypothesized that the two most common types of interneurons in the cortex, parvalbumin- (PVs) and somatostatin-positive cells (SOMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rudy et al., 2011</xref>), facilitate SSA in excitatory neurons of A1 in a complementary fashion. PVs, a subset of which receive direct thalamic inputs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Staiger et al., 1996</xref>), may amplify SSA in excitatory neurons by providing a constant inhibitory drive; equally strong inhibitory drive would attenuate the weak response to standard tones relatively more than the strong response to deviant tones, leading to a greater differential between standard versus deviant tone spiking response. SOMs, which target distal dendrites of pyramidal cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McGarry et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gentet et al., 2012</xref>), have excitatory synapses that exhibit facilitation upon repetitive stimulation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Reyes et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Silberberg and Markram, 2007</xref>). Therefore, inputs from SOMs may exert a stimulus-specific increase in suppression of excitatory neurons that is selective to the standard and does not generalize to the deviant. Alternatively, they may contribute to selective adaptation in excitatory neurons through differential post-synaptic integration.”</p><p>In addition, we now conducted further analyses to test whether there were differences in adaptation between PVs and SOMs by examining their responses to both the oddball (in which tones A and B were presented at 90-10 or 10-90 ratio) and the “equal” stimulus (in which tones A and B were presented at 50-50 ratio). We found some significant differences that are potentially of interest, but that still do not provide evidence for saturation at the level of Somatostatin outputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2</xref>): The equal stimulus does not drive adaptation in PVs, whereas it drives significant adaptation in SOMs, which suggests that initial adaptation to repeated tones in SOMs occurs on a faster time scale than in PVs. For both PVs and SOMs, the response to the standard tone is significantly lower than response to the equal stimulus, providing evidence for an additional time scale of adaptation.</p><p><italic>5) It appears that the parameters of the mathematical model (e.g. for synaptic transfer functions for simulated PV and SOM cells) were not taken from experimental data, but rather were chosen to ensure that model replicated as closely as possible the impact of PV and SOM manipulations on SSA. There is a reference in the third paragraph of the Discussion, to direct estimation of the synaptic transfer function for PV and SOM cells, but it is not evident what data were used for this estimation (and the referenced insets in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7A</italic></xref> <italic>have no quantitative axis labels). Justification for the parameters and sigmoid functions used needs to be provided. Also the model assigns equivalent connectivity patterns between PV, SOM and excitatory neurons. Although both types of interneuron receive local excitatory inputs, only PV interneurons receive thalamocortical and feedforward corticocortical inputs and PV neurons provide largely unidirectional inhibition of SOM neurons. This should be taken into account in the model. At the very least, the authors should discuss this issue as a major limitation of the model (along with the fact that there is no attempt made to model differences in the location of PV versus SOM synaptic connections of the proximal versus distal parts of the excitatory cell's dendritic tree). While it is interesting that differences in the operating ranges for PV versus SOM synaptic transfer functions might in principle explain the observed differences in their impact on SSA, the model does not “reveal” mechanisms by which the different interneuron types exert their effects – and could not do so unless the underlying parameter choices were independently validated experimentally. We are not recommending that the modelling should be removed completely, but this section of the paper is currently rather weak.</italic></p><p>As explained above, the model was constructed as a proof-of-principle for understanding our experimental findings, rather than with the goal of replicating a detailed biological network. Therefore, the parameters, including the strength of synaptic constants and the details of the transfer function, were empirically chosen to achieve a good match between model output and experimental data.</p><p>The reviewers draw on two important observations that we did not include in the original model: (1) SOMs do not seem receive direct thalamic inputs, whereas PVs do; and (2) PVs and SOMs may inhibit each other. The connectivity between PVs and SOMs is highly complex, and there are controversial findings on functionality of the connections, which is why we opted in the original version of the manuscript to start with examining the simplest possible excitatory-inhibitory network without including details about interneuron connectivity. For instance, some papers have found that SOMs do receive inputs directly from the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tan et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, while the reviewers suggest that there is inhibition from PVs to SOMs, several recent studies find that PVs do not contribute to inhibition of SOMs, whereas SOMs provide inhibition to PVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cottam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sturgill and Isaacson, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the revision, we examined the effect of incorporating these connections in the model by making the following modifications:</p><p>A) We modified the model such that, compared to PVs, SOMs received delayed tone-evoked inputs as would be expected if there were at least one synapse in-between thalamic inputs and SOMs – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> has now been adjusted with the new parameters. Incorporating this delay did not affect the results.</p><p>B) We incorporated inhibition from SOMs to PVs in the model and tested whether the prediction for differential effect of SOMs and PVs in SSA still held. We found that the model with added inhibitory inputs from SOMs to PVs could still replicate the experimental results. This figure is now included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>Results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1 fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplements 1 and 2</xref> demonstrate that the excitatory-inhibitory model still supports our experimental results, after these adjustments. Furthermore, our manuscript now discusses that the model serves as a proof-of-principle to verify the interpretation of our results, rather than to reveal a specific mechanism.</p><p>Results now state: “Excitatory and inhibitory neurons form tight mutually coupled networks in A1, and we hypothesized that through differential post-synaptic integration by excitatory neurons, interneurons can amplify adaptation in excitatory neurons. As a proof-of-principle that would account for our findings that PVs and SOMs exhibit similar magnitude of SSA, yet have a differential effect on SSA in putative excitatory neurons, we constructed a simplified model of mutually coupled inhibitory-excitatory neuronal populations. ... SOMs have been shown to inhibit PVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cottam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sturgill and Isaacson, 2015</xref>). Including inhibition between SOMs and PVs did not affect the model outcome, with suppression of PVs resulting in suppression of excitatory responses to both the standard and the deviant, and suppression of SOMs driving specific suppression of excitatory responses to the standard, but not the deviant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2</xref>).”</p><p><italic>6) The way the paper is written implies that the origin of SSA in the cortex is explained here (e.g. first sentence of Discussion). In fact, however, it seems that the explanation presented here depends on SSA already being present in excitatory, SOM and PV neurons. This paper is therefore really more about how PV/SOM neurons amplify SSA effects, rather than the origin of SSA itself. This needs to be clarified throughout. In particular, the PV interneurons appear to provide a general amplification of inhibition, rather than having any role that is specific to SSA.</italic></p><p>We corrected the Discussion throughout to emphasize that interneurons serve to amplify SSA, which may already be present upon integration of thalamo-cortical inputs.</p><p>Abstract: “We found that two types of cortical interneurons differentially amplify SSA in putative excitatory neurons… A mutually coupled excitatory-inhibitory network model accounts for the distinct mechanisms by which cortical inhibitory neurons enhance sensitivity to unexpected sounds.”</p><p>Impact Statement: “We discover that two distinct types of inhibitory neurons increase the brain’s sensitivity to unexpected acoustic signals, by amplifying selective suppression of cortical responses to frequent, but not rare sounds.”</p><p>Introduction: “Therefore, cortical circuits are proposed to contribute to and amplify SSA in A1… We found that both types of interneurons contribute to SSA in the cortex, with PVs providing constant inhibition, and SOMs increasing their effect with repeated tones.”</p><p>Discussion: “Across sensory modalities, cortical neurons exhibit adaptation, attenuating their responses to redundant stimuli(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Das and Gilbert, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ulanovsky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Garcia-Lazaro et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asari and Zador, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Khatri et al., 2009</xref>).
