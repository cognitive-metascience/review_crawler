protozoan parasite, undergoes a complex and poorly understood developmental process that is critical for establishing a chronic infection in its intermediate hosts. Here, we applied single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) on &gt;5,400 Toxoplasma in both tachyzoite and bradyzoite stages using three widely studied strains to construct a comprehensive atlas of cell-cycle and asexual development, revealing hidden states and transcriptional factors associated with each developmental stage. Analysis of SAG1-related sequence (SRS) antigenic repertoire reveals a highly heterogeneous, sporadic expression pattern unexplained by measurement noise, cell cycle, or asexual development. Furthermore, we identified AP2IX-1 as a transcription factor that controls the switching from the ubiquitous SAG1 to rare surface antigens not previously observed in tachyzoites. In addition, comparative analysis between <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium</italic> scRNA-seq results reveals concerted expression of gene sets, despite fundamental differences in cell division. Lastly, we built an interactive data-browser for visualization of our atlas resource.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is a single-celled parasite that can infect most warm-blooded animals, but only reproduces sexually in domestic and wild cats. Distantly related to the malaria agent, it currently infects over a quarter of the world’s human population. Although it is benign in most cases, the condition can still be dangerous for foetuses and people whose immune system is compromised.</p><p>In the human body, <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> cells infiltrate muscle and nerve cells; there it undergoes a complex transformation that helps the parasites to stop dividing quickly and instead hide from the immune system in a dormant state. It is still unclear how this transition unfolds, and in particular which genes are switched on and off at any given time.</p><p>To understand this transformation, scientists often measure which genes are active across a group of parasites. However, this approach gives only an ‘average’ picture and does not allow each parasite to be profiled, missing out on the diversity that may exist between individuals. One area of particular interest, for example, is a set of genes called SAG1-related sequences. They code for the ‘molecular overcoat’ of the parasite, an array of proteins that sit on the surface of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> cells. More than 120 SAG1-related genes exist in the genome of each <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> parasite, creating a whole wardrobe of proteins that potentially hide the parasites from the immune system.</p><p>Here, Xue et al. harnessed a technique called single-cell RNA sequencing, which allowed them to screen which genes were active in 5,400 individual <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> parasites from different strains. The analysis included both the rapidly dividing form of the parasite (present in the initial stage of an infection), and the slowly dividing form found in people who carry <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> without any symptoms. The resulting ‘atlas’ contains previously hidden information about the genes used at each stage of parasite development: this included unexpected similarities between <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and the malaria agent, as well as subtle differences between two of the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains.</p><p>The atlas also sheds light on how individual parasites turns on SAG1-related sequences. It reveals a surprising diversity in the composition of the protein coats sported by <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> cells at the same developmental stage, a strategy that may help to thwart the immune system. One individual parasite in particular had an unusual combination of coat and other proteins found in both the fast and slow-dividing human forms. This parasite had been grown in human cells, yet a closer analysis revealed that it had activated several genes (including ones encoding the protein coat) that are normally only ‘on’ in the parasites going through sexual reproduction in domestic and wild cats.</p><p>This new data atlas helps to understand how <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> are transmitted to and grow within humans, which could aid the development of treatments. Ultimately, a better knowledge of these parasites could also bring new information about the agent that causes malaria.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Toxoplasma gondii</kwd><kwd>single-cell RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>protozoa</kwd><kwd>surface antigen repertoire</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>AP2 transcription factor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005492</institution-id><institution>Stanford University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Stanford Interdisciplinary Graduate Bio-X Fellowships</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xue</surname><given-names>Yuan</given-names></name><name><surname>Theisen</surname><given-names>Terence C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30 AI124589-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rastogi</surname><given-names>Suchita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32AI007328-30</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferrel</surname><given-names>Abel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Gilliams Fellowship for Advanced Study</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferrel</surname><given-names>Abel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 AI21423</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boothroyd</surname><given-names>John C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 AI29529</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boothroyd</surname><given-names>John C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Biohub</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Quake</surname><given-names>Stephen R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-cell RNA-sequencing resolves the transcriptional landscape of asexual development in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, revealing concerted genetic programs to <italic>Plasmodiumfalciparum</italic> and a novel transcriptional factor that controls antigen switching.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is an intracellular protozoan parasite that is thought to infect over a quarter of the world’s population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pappas et al., 2009</xref>). Like some of its <italic>Apicomplexan</italic> cousins, <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> undergoes a complex developmental transition inside the host. In intermediate hosts, including humans and virtually all other non-feline, warm-blooded animals, <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> parasites remain haploid and transition from a replicative, virulent tachyzoite to an encysted, quasi-dormant bradyzoite. This asexual developmental transition is tightly coupled to the clinical progression of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection. Although acute infection with tachyzoites produces few if any symptoms in healthy human children and adults, infected individuals, if left untreated, progress to a chronic stage wherein tachyzoites transition to bradyzoites that can persist for life in neurons and muscle cells. When infected individuals become immunocompromised, such as in chemotherapy, HIV infection, or organ transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rabaud et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Robert-Gangneux et al., 2015</xref>), bradyzoites can reactivate to become tachyzoites, causing severe neurological damage and even death. While no causal link has been established, a population-wide study has uncovered significant association of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection with schizophrenia in chronically infected humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sutterland et al., 2015</xref>). Chronic infection in mice has been observed to induce behavioral changes such as loss of aversion to cat urine, which is hypothesized to increase the transmission rate of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> to its definitive feline host where sexual reproduction occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vyas et al., 2007</xref>). As there are no therapeutic interventions to prevent or clear cysts in infected individuals, understanding how <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> transitions through its life stages remains of critical importance.</p><p>The development of in vitro methods to induce <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> differentiation have facilitated investigation of several aspects of chronic infection, including transition of tachyzoites to bradyzoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Soête et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jeffers et al., 2018</xref>). Bulk transcriptomic analyses of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> at distinct asexual stages reveal genetic modules that are expressed in each stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchholz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Manger et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pittman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yip, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cleary et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Radke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fouts and Boothroyd, 2007</xref>), including AP2 transcription factors that are thought to play a role in differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">White et al., 2014</xref>); however, transitioning parasites convert to the bradyzoite stage asynchronously and display a high degree of heterogeneity along the developmental pathway and in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Soete et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Watts et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, parasites within the same tissue cysts have been shown to display heterogeneity in the expression of bradyzoite marker proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferguson et al., 1994</xref>). The transition of tachyzoites to the bradyzoite stage results in an overwhelming majority of mature bradyzoites in the G<sub>1</sub> phase of the cell cycle that divide slowly, if at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Radke et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sinai et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, tachyzoites exhibit slower growth kinetics immediately prior to the bradyzoite transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Radke et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jerome et al., 1998</xref>). This suggests that parasites exit the cell cycle to differentiate into bradyzoites, a pattern consistent with developmental processes in several other eukaryotic organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). Dissecting these cell cycle aspects of stage conversion requires a more detailed analysis than has been possible with bulk measurement of tachyzoite or bradyzoite populations, or with the use of genetically modified parasites coupled with chemical synchronization of cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Radke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Radke and White, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conde de Felipe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behnke et al., 2010</xref>). This is because the latter approaches require large quantities of synchronized parasites and can potentially introduce artificial perturbations. Furthermore, bulk measurement fails to distinguish parasite-to-parasite variation that is independent of cell cycle or known developmental processes, potentially missing the phenotypic diversity intrinsic to a population of cells.</p><p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers a powerful and unbiased approach to reveal the underlying heterogeneity in an asynchronous population of cells. Droplet and FACS-based approaches have already been applied towards multicellular parasites such as <italic>Schistosoma</italic> to reveal developmental changes within different hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Recently, scRNA-seq has revealed a surprising degree of heterogeneity in another apicomplexan parasite, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reid et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ngara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Poran et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Howick et al., 2019</xref>). Analyses derived from these single-parasite measurements uncovered rare and critical transition events in parasite development that were undetectable in bulk measurements. Combined with novel analytical tools and increase in measurement throughput, scRNA-seq can help facilitate the discovery of regulatory factors that mediate these developmental transitions in a system-wide fashion.</p><p>Here, we performed scRNA-seq to reconstruct transcriptional dynamics of asynchronous <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> parasites in the course of cell cycle and asexual development in vitro. Our analysis reveals the existence of hidden cell states and rare parasites that show highly unusual patterns of gene expression associated with specific transcription factors. We also discover that individual parasites vary substantially in the expression of surface antigen genes, suggesting the possibility of a novel form of antigenic variation that may play a crucial role in host immunity evasion. Importantly, we identified a single parasite from our scRNA-seq dataset that displayed an unusual expression pattern of surface antigens, leading us to identify and validate the regulatory role of a previously uncharacterized AP2 transcription factor typically associated with parasites in sexual development. Lastly, we show that despite fundamental differences in their modes of cell division, there are conserved transcriptional programs between the asexual life cycles of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>. Our results combined provide the first comprehensive single-cell atlas of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> in the course of asexual development and help reveal that the antigenic repertoire of this parasite is much more heterogeneous than previously appreciated.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Technical validation of single-parasite sorting and sequencing</title><p>There are more than a dozen approaches available for single-cell isolation and transcriptome amplification. Based on benchmark comparisons, Smart-seq2 generally has higher sensitivity than competing droplet-based approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Svensson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ziegenhain et al., 2017</xref>). We reasoned that sensitive measurement is crucial in our study, given that single <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> parasites are at least 50-fold smaller in volume than a typical mammalian cell, and thus the average parasite gene is likely expressed with much lower copy number per cell than a typical mammalian gene. For our initial studies, we used the common Type I lab strain of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, RH, grown in vitro in human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs). Following such growth, individual tachyzoites were released by passage through a narrow-gauge needle and then purified by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) into 384-well or 96-well plates. We then synthesized, amplified, and barcoded cDNA using Smart-seq2 and Illumina Nextera protocols. We reduced the reagent cost in 384-well plates effectively by ten-fold compared to the 96-well format. The sequenced reads were bioinformatically deconvolved and grouped into individual parasites for analysis using modified bcl2fastq and custom python scripts (Materials and methods).

After Smart-seq2 amplification, we quantified the expression of GFP and mCherry mRNAs using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Across all 301 wells that we measured, we observed the presence of both GFP and mCherry mRNA in only one well, indicating that the rate of doublet events is below 1% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). To address the possibility that the reduced reagent volume in the 384-well format could potentially saturate the reaction chemistry and thus limit quantification range, we sorted varying numbers of RH and quantified with qPCR the mRNA of a gene encoding the abundantly expressed surface protein, SRS29B (SAG1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). The detected amount of SAG1 mRNA present in wells containing single, eight, or fifty RH fell into the expected distributions based on the number of parasites sorted, without signs of saturation, indicating that the assay is capable of quantitative measurement at the single <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> level. We then proceeded to sort parasites into 384-well based on live/dead staining and sequence 729 RH (612 passed quality control) strain single <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> parasites from asynchronous populations grown under tachyzoite conditions. We also sorted and sequenced 287 RH parasites (237 passed quality control) into 96-well plate for comparison, which we will discuss further in another section. For Pru and ME49 strains, we collected parasites at several time points post alkaline treatment which induces differentiation from tachyzoites to bradyzoites to follow changes in their expression profiles during in vitro development (Materials and methods), yielding 2655 Pru (2198 passed quality control) and 1828 ME49 (1552 passed quality control) single parasites. RH reads were aligned to the GT1 strain genome, which is the most complete reference for Type I parasites, while Pru and ME49 were aligned to the ME49 strain Type II genome reference. Because many genes encoding <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> secretion factors and surface proteins are evolutionary products of gene duplication events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reid, 2015</xref>), we expected high sequence similarity amongst a substantial portion of the parasite genes. Thus, we modified our gene counting pipeline to account for duplicated genes by distributing reads across all regions with equal alignment score that passed thresholds (Materials and methods). The reason why we adopted a correction scheme for multiply-mapped reads is because the analysis of co-occurrence, or lack thereof, of pathogenic factors (e.g. surface antigens) hinges on sensitive detection of their expression. We thus faced a choice of increasing the false positive in gene alignment by correcting for multiply mapped reads or increasing its false negative by counting only uniquely aligned reads. We chose to account for multiply mapped genes, which would otherwise be obscured, as we hypothesized that surface antigen expression may vary between individual parasites, which we further discuss in another section. A comparison of counting methods does not reveal significant differences in the observed counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Further analysis reveals that our modified pipeline recovered the detection of more parasite genes than default parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>).</p><p>To ensure that poorly amplified or sequenced parasites did not confound our downstream analysis, we filtered samples based on several quality metrics including percent reads mapping to ERCC spike-in sequences, number of genes detected, and sequencing depth (Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). On average, each sequenced parasite contains 30–50% reads that mapped to <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> genes encoding proteins (top panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Most of the unmapped reads are from <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>’s 28 s ribosomal RNA. The relatively high rate of rRNA contamination was also observed in single-parasite RNA sequencing of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reid et al., 2018</xref>). We suspect this occurred due to non-specific priming as protozoan cells have low RNA input. We normalized for sequencing depth across cells by dividing each read count by the read sum of each corresponding cell and then multiplied by the median of read sum within each dataset to yield ‘count per median’ (CPM). After filtering ERCC spike-in and rRNA genes, we detected on average 862, 1290, and 970 genes per parasite with greater than or equal to two read counts (Materials and methods) in the RH, Pru, and ME49 datasets, respectively (bottom panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Characterization of our measurement sensitivity based on logistic regression modeling of ERCC spike-in standards (Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lönnberg et al., 2017</xref>) reveals a 50% detection rate of 17, 17, and 26 molecules for RH, Pru, and ME49 datasets, respectively (top panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref>). The sensitivity of our 384-well Smart-seq2 measurement is comparable to the previously reported range for the 96-well format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ziegenhain et al., 2017</xref>). As expected from our qPCR titration experiment, scRNA-seq measurement of gene expression is quantitative at single parasite resolution based on ERCC standards. We determined that the linear dynamic range of our scRNA-seq measurement spans over three orders of magnitude (bottom panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref>). Taken together, we demonstrate a scalable and cost-effective approach to measure the transcriptomic changes of individual parasites with high sensitivity and accuracy.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cell cycle landscape of asynchronous <italic>Toxoplasma</italic></title><p>Previous work posited a potential link between bradyzoite development and cell cycle, which poses a significant challenge to the bioinformatic analysis of either process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Radke et al., 2003</xref>). To characterize cell cycling changes without confounding contributions from developmental processes, we first analyzed an asynchronous population of Type I RH strain parasites grown under tachyzoite conditions; this extensively passaged lab strain is known to have little propensity to switch to bradyzoites under such conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Soête et al., 1994</xref>) (Materials and methods). After filtering out genes whose expression levels did not vary significantly between individual parasites, we projected the data with principal component analysis (PCA) (Materials and methods). Interestingly, the first two principal components (PCs) reveal a circular trajectory that coincides with relative DNA content, determined using a cell permeable DNA content stain (top panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Unsupervised neighborhood clustering identified five distinct clusters of parasites based on their transcriptional profiles (middle panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) (Materials and methods).

We assigned cell cycle phase to the clusters based primarily on change in DNA content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>) but also considering previous bulk transcriptomic characterization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behnke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Unsupervised clustering identified two distinct clusters in G<sub>1</sub> state, which we have designated as G<sub>1</sub>a and G<sub>1</sub>b. We found a list of differentially expressed genes between the two G<sub>1</sub> clusters. The G<sub>1</sub>a cluster is highly enriched for the expression of metabolic genes such as phenylalanine hydroxylase (<italic>TGGT1_411100</italic>) and pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (<italic>TGGT1_236070</italic>), as well as invasion-related secreted factors such as MIC2 (<italic>TGGT1_201780</italic>), MIC3 (<italic>TGGT1_319560</italic>), and MIC11 (<italic>TGGT1_204530</italic>). On the other hand, G<sub>1</sub>b cluster is enriched for the expression of 3-ketoacyl reductase (<italic>TGGT1_217740</italic>) and cytidine and deoxycytidylate deaminase (<italic>TGGT1_200430</italic>), as well as numerous uncharacterized proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The relative abundance of G<sub>1</sub>a, G<sub>1</sub>b, S, M, and C states were determined to be 18%, 32%, 28%, 15%, and 7%, respectively. Without chemical synchronization, the correlation between the scRNA-seq data of asynchronous parasites and previously published bulk transcriptomic measurement suggests strong agreement in cluster assignment and cell cycle state identification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>).

The results show a clear oscillatory expression pattern for the variably expressed genes along the pseudotime axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). To further characterize cell cycle expression patterns, we clustered genes based on pseudotime interpolation and hierarchical clustering (Materials and methods). Some of the key organelles in tachyzoites are made at different times in the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behnke et al., 2010</xref>). To confirm and refine this finding, we calculated the mean expression values for each set of organelle-specific genes based on their annotation in ToxoDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gajria et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). This showed the expected, strong oscillation with pseudotime (bottom panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>), which also strongly correlates with the oscillation of DNA and total mRNA content (top panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). On the other hand, we also observed instances where a given gene’s expression was discordant to the dominant trend of its nominal organelle set (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>). For example, 63.5% of genes annotated as rhoptry (ROP) or rhoptry neck (RON) are assigned pseudotime cluster 3, while the remaining 36.5% rhoptry genes are assigned pseudotime clusters 1 or 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1e</xref>). Specifically, genes annotated as ROP33 and ROP34, based on their homology to genes encoding known rhoptry proteins, are assigned to cluster 2 instead of cluster 3 (left panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1f</xref>). Recent reports have experimentally determined these two to be non-rhoptry-localizing proteins. This is consistent with our observation of discordance between their and known ROPs' expression profiles along the pseudotime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beraki et al., 2019</xref>). Through analysis of pseudotime clustering, we also identified genes not annotated as ROPs within the ROP-dominated cluster 3, such as <italic>TGGT1_218270</italic> and <italic>TGGT1_230350</italic>, that have recently been shown to encode <italic>bona fide</italic> rhoptry and rhoptry neck proteins, now designated as ROP48 and RON11, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camejo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beck et al., 2013</xref>) (left panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1f</xref>). As another example, IMC2a peaks in expression level in G<sub>1</sub>, while the majority of inner-membrane complex (IMC) genes are expressed towards the M/C phase of the cell cycle (right panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1f</xref>). A recent report has proposed reannotation of IMC2a as a dense granule (GRA) protein (GRA44) based on subcellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coffey et al., 2018</xref>), which is consistent with our unsupervised group assignment of IMC2a as falling in cluster one where GRA genes dominate. A list of 8590 RH genes with their corresponding pseudotime clustering assignment is provided (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).

We applied scRNA-seq to measure and analyze Pru parasites grown in HFFs as tachyzoites (‘uninduced’) and after inducing the switch to bradyzoites by growth in alkaline media for 3, 5, and 7 days. Projection of the first two PCs of uninduced Pru tachyzoites (Day 0) reveals the expected circular projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>), presumably reflecting cell cycle progression as seen for the RH tachyzoites, described above. To validate this, we developed a random forest classifier model based on our cell cycle assignment in RH (Materials and methods). Comparable to what we observed in RH, cell cycle prediction reveals that the uninduced population of Pru is composed of 28%, 41%, 21%, 7%, and 3% parasites in G<sub>1</sub>a, G<sub>1</sub>b, S, M, and C states, respectively. Consistent with previous observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jerome et al., 1998</xref>), our data show most induced Pru parasites (Day 3–7) are in the G<sub>1</sub> state with a predominance of G<sub>1</sub>b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>).</p><p>To identify transcriptomic changes associated with the tachyzoite-bradyzoite transition, we next projected data from both induced and uninduced Pru parasites onto two dimensions using UMAP, a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method (Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McInnes et al., 2018</xref>). Unsupervised clustering revealed six distinct clusters of parasites, which we label P1-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).

The abundance of SAG1<italic><sup>+</sup></italic> parasites (72%) in the induced population suggests two possible interpretations: (1) the depletion of SAG1 mRNA is relatively slow and we are measuring SAG1 transcripts made when the parasites were still tachyzoites, or (2) the asexual transition induced by alkaline treatment is highly asynchronous.

Thus, scRNA-seq resolves a transcriptomic landscape of asexual development and suggests the existence of an otherwise hidden state.</p><p>To determine the reproducibility of the phenomena we observed in the differentiating Pru strain parasites, we repeated the analysis with another widely used Type II strain, ME49, examining 1828 single ME49 parasites exposed to alkaline conditions to induce switching to bradyzoites. Data from the two experiments were computationally aligned using Scanorama to remove technical batch effects while retaining sample-specific differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hie et al., 2019</xref>). Unsupervised clustering revealed five distinct clusters in ME49 which share significant overlap in expression patterns with Pru (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4a</xref>). Matrix correlation of batch-corrected expression across the two strains demonstrate analogous mapping for most, but not all cluster identities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4b</xref>). To simplify the visualization and comparison across the two datasets, we next applied Partition-Based Graph Abstraction (PAGA) to present clusters of cells as nodes with connectivity based on similarity of the transcriptional profiles between clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wolf et al., 2019</xref>). A side-by-side comparison of expression of tachyzoite, bradyzoite, and sexual stage specific genes reveals some key similarities and dissimilarities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4c</xref>). Clusters P1 and M1 are both enriched for the expression of bradyzoite marker genes, while clusters M4-5 and P4-5 are both predicted to be S/M/C phases of the cell cycle. Curiously, P6-specific genes (green panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4c</xref>) are not enriched in any cluster in ME49, suggesting that P6 state is not conserved across the two type II strains. Such differences may not be surprising, however, as Pru and ME49 have entirely distinct passage histories.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>scRNA-seq characterizes surface antigenic repertoire of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic></title><p>A unique advantage of scRNA-seq over bulk RNA-seq is its ability to measure cell-to-cell variation that is independent of known biological processes.

In the experiments using 384-well plates, we noted that most <italic>SRS</italic> genes were detected in only a few sporadic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>); however, biological variation was difficult to distinguish from measurement dropout (failure to capture a mRNA molecule) given the limited sensitivity of 384-well assay and the relatively low abundance of <italic>SRS</italic> transcripts. To increase our sensitivity, therefore, we performed scRNA-seq of extracellular <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> in 96-well plates which achieved ~40% sensitivity of detection for single molecules of ERCC spike-ins, compared to 14% sensitivity that we obtained in the 384-well experiments, at roughly equivalent sequencing depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). To determine the extent of transcriptional variation in <italic>SRS</italic> genes independent of cell cycle or asexual development, we isolated RH parasites in G1 state using DNA content stain and FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>).

We also measured on average 984 genes with read counts equal to or greater than two in 96-well plates, up from 862 genes in 384-well plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Analysis of the resulting 96-well plates data show that the vast majority of <italic>SRS</italic> genes are detected in only a small fraction of the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), similar to what we observed in 384-well experiments. To control for measurement dropout as a cause of such variation, we first determine the non-zero median for those genes, that is, the median expression level in cells where any transcript for that gene is detected. We then assess how often we fail to detect an ERCC spike-ins that had a similar non-zero median expression level. If the failure to detect a <italic>SRS</italic> was due to measurement dropout, then the fraction of cells without detection for its transcript should be about the same as for the ERCC spike-in with similar non-zero median expression. If, on the other hand, the failure to detect the <italic>SRS</italic> transcript is due to underlying biological variation between cells, then we will find a lower frequency of cells with detectable transcript for that gene than the ERCC spike-in with similar expression. The results show that <italic>SRSs</italic> are indeed detected at a substantially lower rate when compared to ERCC spike-ins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>), indicating that the variation of <italic>SRS</italic> detection cannot be explained by measurement noise. Compared to most other genes, <italic>SRSs</italic> are expressed in a significantly smaller fraction of the population and at a relatively lower abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d-e</xref>). To determine whether variation of <italic>SRS</italic> expression is due to cell cycle or asexual development, we developed a bootstrapping approach to quantify the dependence of expression on a topological network that represents either process (Materials and methods). We show that apart from a few known <italic>SRSs</italic>, most <italic>SRSs</italic> do not co-vary with cell cycle or asexual development, which suggests that the sporadic nature of <italic>SRS</italic> expression may hint at a different biological role for their variation, beyond cell cycle and asexual development, as discussed further below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). These results reveal new insights into the antigenic repertoire of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, which appears far more heterogeneous, on a parasite-to-parasite basis, than previously known.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Majority of SAG1-related sequences (SRS) antigens are variably expressed in individual parasites.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Read depth (top) and detection rate of ERCC spike-ins (bottom) reveal higher measurement sensitvity in 96 well plate over 384 well plate format at roughly equivalent sequencing depth.

We wondered if this cell was damaged or unhealthy but its gene count and read depth were similar to its cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Further analysis of this SAG1<sup>-</sup> cell’s transcriptome revealed that it lacks expression of the most abundant tachyzoite-specific and bradyzoite-specific genes; instead, its gene expression most closely resembles the sexual stages from cat intestinal isolates, including abundant expression of a cat-stage <italic>SRS</italic>, <italic>SRS22C</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Within the set of genes uniquely expressed in the SAG1<sup>-</sup> cell are <italic>AP2IX-1</italic> and <italic>AP2III-4</italic> which suggest a possible role for one or both of these transcription factors in regulating the transcript differences observed in this outlier. To test this hypothesis, we transiently expressed AP2IX-1 under the control of a strong promoter in RH parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis, immunofluorescence assay (IFA) revealed a reduction of SAG1 surface protein expression within ~18–20 hr after transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e–f</xref>), while quantitative RT-PCR showed significantly higher mRNA expression for several of the genes that were upregulated in the SAG1<sup>-</sup> cell: namely, 207965, 222305, 205210, and SRS22C, the latter being over 1000-fold higher in the transfected population than control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>). Note that the SAG1 transcript levels in the transfected population were not substantially lower, as expected because there remains a large number of untransfected cells in the population which still express high levels of this gene. As <italic>SRS22C</italic> is predicted to be a surface antigen like the rest of <italic>SRS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gajria et al., 2008</xref>), this suggests that AP2IX-1 induction can control the switching of surface antigens. We also attempted to express <italic>AP2III-4</italic> that is upregulated in the SAG1<sup>-</sup> cell but were unable to obtain an epitope-tagged version of the gene (which is over nine kbp, including the promoter). Overall, these results demonstrate the ability to infer transcriptional regulation from a single parasite cell that has an unusual co-expression pattern, revealing AP2IX-1 as a novel transcriptional factor that can alter antigen expression in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Analysis of a single SAG1<sup>-</sup> outlier cell reveals regulatory role of AP2IX-1 on cat-stage antigen and genes.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) PCA projection of 384-well RH cells colored by the presence (blue) or absence (red) of the SRS29B (SAG1) gene.

For example, asexual replication of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> involves endodyogeny, which is similar to canonical binary fission, in order to replicate and divide. Asexual division of <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, on the other hand, involves schizogony, a process that entails multiple rounds of DNA replication and nuclear division followed by a mass cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aly et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cowman et al., 2016</xref>). Despite their fundamental differences in cell cycle progression, we wondered if our <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> dataset can be combined with the Malaria Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Howick et al., 2019</xref>) to provide insights into apicomplexan biology. Toward this end, we first identified 1830 one-to-one orthologous genes between <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> and <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> Pru (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>). As expected, the vast majority of orthologous genes are not surface adhesion factors or effector molecules in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b</xref>). After removing non-orthologous genes, we combined the two species’ datasets to produce an integrated UMAP projection with Scanorama (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hie et al., 2018</xref>). In this integrated projection space, mutually similar clusters of cells in the two datasets are brought close together, while organism-specific cell types are not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Transitional dynamics of the parasitic development are preserved in the integrated projection, as separation of the original cluster assignment indicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). We highlight comparative similarity across the two organisms by calculating the fraction of cells that share the same topological neighborhood in the integrated network of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>), revealing striking similarity of expression pattern between the two organisms. We discover the concerted transcriptional expression of several conserved orthologous gene sets in the life cycles of these two parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). For example, the pre-erythrocytic stages of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (sporozoite and merozoites) most closely match the ‘G1 a’ stage of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>. Both parasites at these stages are not actively replicating DNA and express high levels of ribosomal and mitochondrial genes. Meanwhile, the ring stage of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> most closely matches the ‘G1 b’ phase of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> because they both express high levels of ribosomal genes with minimal expression of IMC-related and microtubule-related genes. Exo-erythrocytic form (EEF), microgametes (male), and trophozoite stages of <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> most closely match the ‘S’ phase of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> cell cycle. This is because they express DNA-replication factors and centrosome components, which are required for condensation and segregation of chromosomes. Intriguingly, the schizont stage of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> most closely resembles the ‘M’ and ‘C’ phases due to the expression of microtubule, centrosome, and IMC genes. A more detailed illustration of these gene sets expression is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1c</xref>. Our results indicate that while the cellular morphology and replication strategies may differ drastically between the two parasites, the cellular state, as defined by the transcriptomic profiles, can bear striking analogy and resemblance in the course of asexual replication.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Comparative analysis of scRNA-seq in Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium berghei reveals concerted genetic programs underlying their life-cycles.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Scanorama integration of <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> (red, left) and <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> Pru (blue, right).

The results show that scRNA-seq can reveal intrinsic biological variation within an asynchronous population of parasites. Two types of biological variation could be seen in our asynchronous populations: cell cycle progression and asexual differentiation. We found the existence of two distinct 1N transcriptional states in cycling parasites which we call G<sub>1</sub>a and G<sub>1</sub>b, concurring with what was previously reported in bulk analyses of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behnke et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, bradyzoites are found predominantly in G<sub>1</sub>b but not in G<sub>1</sub>a, suggesting the possibility of a putative checkpoint between these two phases that may also play a role in regulating the developmental transition. Our data further shows a small fraction of bradyzoites to be cycling which supports the hypothesis that bradyzoites can in fact divide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sinai et al., 2016</xref>). Our results showed a very strong correlation between cell cycle and expression of genes encoding proteins in various subcellular organelles, as noted previously using synchronized bulk populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behnke et al., 2010</xref>). The results here, however, show an even more dramatic and extreme dependence on cell cycle, allowing refinement of approaches that use such timing to predict a given protein’s ultimate organellar destination in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camejo et al., 2014</xref>). They also extend such analyses to the Type II strains, Pru and ME49, which have not previously been examined in this way.</p><p>In addition to the above, we observed some striking and unexpected heterogeneity within asexually developing parasites. We discovered a cluster of cells, labeled P6, in the differentiating Pru parasites that is distinct from the rest of the alkaline-induced population of cells. Constituting 21% of the alkaline-induced population, the P6 cluster is marked by a set of genes that were previously detected by bulk transcriptomics in bradyzoites of tissue cysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ramakrishnan et al., 2019</xref>). Remarkably, while most of these genes have unknown functions, we identified an enriched gene with a predicted AP2 domain, which may contribute to the unique expression pattern observed in this group of parasites. We found that the P6 expression profile is intermediate to P2 tachyzoites and P1 bradyzoite clusters. Interestingly, the genes enriched in P6 overlap with a subset of canonical bradyzoite marker genes including <italic>LDH2</italic> and <italic>SRS35A</italic>, albeit expressed at a lower level than in P1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). In addition, we observed a gradual increase in the proportion of P6 cells as induction proceeded from day 3 to day 7. Taken together, one possible explanation for the emergence of P6 cluster is a reverted conversion from bradyzoites to tachyzoites in which alkaline stress fails to maintain the bradyzoite state. Our data and previous reports are consistent with this interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weiss et al., 1998</xref>). On the other hand, we cannot rule out the possibility that this cluster is developmentally ‘confused’ by the presence of a general stressor such as alkaline. RNA velocity analysis in the Pru data does not reveal a strong transcriptional flow between P1 and P6. Rather, P6 appears to transcriptionally transition from P2 tachyzoites. Thus, the P1 bradyzoites and P6 parasites are either distinct and separate developmental trajectories, or the transition from P1 to P6 is a rapid and rare event. Regardless, our results reflect a surprising diversity in an asexually transitioning population of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>. Future measurement of single parasites isolated from in vivo sources coupled with genetic manipulation of the parasite genome, will further clarify the underlying developmental states that we identified here.</p><p>To quantify the variation of <italic>SRSs</italic>, which are generally expressed at low copy number, we performed 96-well Smart-seq2, which greatly improved measurement sensitivity over the 384-well format, likely due to changes in the input mRNA concentration. For scRNA-seq of pathogens, which tend to have smaller size and lower mRNA content than mammalian cells, we think a careful selection of the measurement approach is necessary based on consideration of throughput and measurement sensitivity, between which there is often a tradeoff. Combined with a novel approach that we developed based on random permutation and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) averaging, we were able to quantify the association of gene expression variation to known biological processes, like cell cycle and development. We discovered that <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> exhibits unexplained, sporadic variation in the expression of most <italic>SRSs</italic>, which may have biological implications. For example, it could expand the mode of interactions with the host and be the result of strong selective pressure to maximize invasion efficiency and transmission in a variety of different host species of cell types. Maintaining a large phenotypic diversity can be beneficial in ensuring at least some members will be able to invade the cells it encounters and/or evade adaptive immune response, enabling propagation in whatever the host environment encountered.</p><p>Very surprisingly, our scRNA-seq analysis identified an atypical co-expression pattern in an in vitro RH ‘tachyzoite’ that is indicative of sexual development, which has not been previously observed in these culture conditions. This suggests that at least the beginnings of sexual developmental can spontaneously occur even in the absence of the cat intestinal environment or other chemical cues. Combined with transient expression experiments, the data from this cell enabled us to show that AP2IX-1 is sufficient to drive a switching of surface antigen expression toward that resembling the sexual stages of the parasite. Assuming this change in mRNA abundance translates into a change in protein levels of TGGT1_222305, which is predicted to contain a transmembrane domain, and SRS22C, which is strongly indicated to be a surface antigen like the rest of SRS, our data indicate that AP2IX-1 contributes to remodeling of the surface antigen repertoire during differentiation. Furthermore, this suggests AP2IX-1 may play a causal role in controlling the sexual differentiation of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>. Considering that the family of AP2 transcription factors was originally found to regulate stress response and floral sexual differentiation in plants, our finding suggests the biological role of AP2 family in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> is evolutionarily conserved. Switching of surface antigens in parasites may be particularly favorable to parasites under stressful conditions, perhaps including the stress of an immune response, thereby enabling evasion of host immunity. Regardless, these results show that scRNA-seq can reveal rare parasite variants that are, presumably, a result of spontaneous epigenetic changes similar to what has been described in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Litzenburger et al., 2017</xref>) or transcriptional noise which was previously characterized in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elowitz et al., 2002</xref>). An important difference from the situation with cancer cells, however, is that these individual variants may be non-viable and so impossible to obtain as a stable line; thus scRNA-seq may be uniquely able to provide a detailed understanding of their very interesting and informative gene expression. In this case, a previously uncharacterized AP2 factor was revealed and shown to be responsible for regulating at least some of the genes that were uniquely expressed in this variant, relative to the remainder of the tachyzoites in this population. Expanding the number of AP2 transcription factors (totaling over 68 of them) analyzed in this way could enable the deduction of the sets of ‘regulons’ in this parasite. Thus, even though these rare variants may be non-viable ‘biological freaks’, they can be highly informative and would be completely undetectable in bulk measurement.</p><p>Recently, cross-species analysis of scRNA-seq datasets has attracted considerable interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ding et al., 2019</xref>). Our study provides the first comparative analysis of developmental processes between two apicomplexans, both of which cause prevalent and potentially devastating diseases. While <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> undergo distinct modes of cell replication and asexual development, we identified cross-species clusters that share significant similarity in the expression of orthologous genes. We discovered that the timing of expression in gene sets involved in cell cycle are conserved in the erythrocytic cycle of <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>. Lastly, we have made the datasets of our study available by creating an interactive and easily accessible web-browser. We hope this encourages other individuals interested in single-cell parasitology to actively explore our dataset without having expertise in programming or bioinformatics. Building on the work described here, which lays a foundation for a detailed understanding of the parasite itself, we anticipate future, single-cell co-transcriptomic sequencing of both the host cell and the parasite as a potentially powerful approach to further deconstruct the complexity of parasite-host interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

All reagents are declared RNase free. Lysis plates were prepared by dispensing 0.4 µL of lysis buffer into each well of a 384 well hard-shell low profile PCR plate (Bio-rad) using liquid handler Mantis (Formulatrix). Single parasites were sorted using the Stanford FACS Facility’s SONY SH800s sorter or BD Influx Special Order sorter into the 384-well plates loaded with lysis buffer.

For 384-well Smart-seq2, we performed 19 rounds of cDNA pre-amplification after reverse transcription with oligo-dT primers. Each well is then diluted with 1 to 4 v:v in RNAse free elution buffer (QIAgen) to a total volume of 8 µL. For 96-well Smart-seq2, we performed 30 rounds of cDNA pre-amplification after reverse transcription. PCR is performed with ‘IS_PCR primers’. Each well is then purified with Ampure XP beads at 0.8X volume ratio and resuspended in 20 µL RNAse free elution buffer. We measured the size distribution and concentration of each well in 96-well plate using Fragment Analyzer High-sensitivity NGS kit (Agilent). We normalized the concentration of cDNA of each well to a concentration of 0.4 ng/µL. Finally, for both 384-well and 96-well Smart-seq2 measurements, we conducted library preparation with in-house Tn5 tagmentation using custom cell barcode and submitted for 2 × 150 bp paired-end sequencing on NovaSeq 6000 at the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Genomics core.

RH parasites were transfected with pGRA-AP2I × 1-V5 using the Amaxa 4D Nucleofector (Lonza). Tachyzoites were mechanically released in PBS, pelleted, and resuspended in 20 µL P3 Primary Cell Nucleofector Solution (Lonza) with 7 or 15 µg DNA for transfection. After transfection, parasites were allowed to infect HFFs in DMEM. After 18–20 hr of infection, parasites were prepared for Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA) or qRT-PCR.

SAG1 was detected with rabbit anti-SAG1 polyclonal antibody and V5 was detected with mouse anti-V5 tag monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen). Primary antibodies were detected with goat polyclonal Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Primary and secondary antibodies were both diluted in 3% BSA in PBS. Coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies for 30 min, washed, and incubated with secondary antibodies for 30 min. Vectashield with DAPI stain (Vector Laboratories) was used to mount the coverslips on slides.

Briefly, 0.1 µL of diluted cDNA was added in a total of 2.1 µL reaction volume per well on a 384 well plate with qPCR mastermix and 200 nM PCR primers. The reaction was incubated on a Bio-rad qPCR thermal cycler with the following programs: 5 min of 95°C, 45 cycles of 95°C for 5 s and 56°C for 1 min, and imaging. To quantify the transcriptional effects of AP2IX-1 transient expression in RH parasites, infected cell monolayers were first lysed with Trizol (Invitrogen) and RNA was extracted using standard molecular biology technique. cDNA from each sample was generated with Smart-seq2 protocol using 20 µL total reaction volume and roughly 200 ng RNA input followed by 0.8X AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) purification. For qPCR, 1 ng of cDNA was added in a total of 2.1 µL reaction volume per well on a 384 well plate with qPCR mastermix and 200 nM PCR primers as described above. The reaction was incubated on a Bio-rad qPCR thermal cycler with the following programs: 5 min of 95°C, 60 cycles of 95°C for 5 s and 61°C for 30 s, and imaging.

Principal components analysis (PCA) is then applied to the filtered and normalized RH data, and the nearest neighbor graph (K = 50) is computed using ‘correlation’ as a similarity metric. We identified the putative ‘G1’ clusters with 1N based on DNA content stain. Parasites in ‘G1’ cluster are further sub-clustered with Louvain Clustering, in which we identified ‘G<sub>1</sub>a’ and ‘G<sub>1</sub>b’ clusters with distinct transcriptional profiles. Pearson correlation between single-cell and bulk transcriptomic data is computed between bulk assignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behnke et al., 2010</xref>) and the scRNA-seq cluster assignment through which each cluster is uniquely assigned with a cell cycle state. To quantify genes that are differentially expressed across cell cycle clusters, we applied Kruskal-Wallis test. Genes are considered differentially expressed if their p-values are less than 0.05 and they are at least 2-fold over-expressed in a cluster compared to the average expression level of other clusters. We computed differential expression across all cell cycle clusters as well as between the ‘G<sub>1</sub>a’ and ‘G<sub>1</sub>b’ clusters; the results are uploaded as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary files 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">3</xref>, respectively. To enable cell cycle assignment transfer from RH to Pru and ME49 data, we implemented a random forest classification model trained on RH data. Briefly, this is done by training a model with 1000 estimators on L2-normalized RH expression data containing only cell cycle associated genes in a 60–40 split scheme. Then the model is applied to predict cell cycle labels of L2-normalized Pru or ME49 data containing the homologous cell cycle associated genes. The testing accuracy was over 95%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Pseudotime construction and clustering</title><p>Pseudotime analysis is conducted with Monocle two package in R on preprocessed dataset with highly dispersive genes as described previously. A cell in ‘G<sub>1</sub>a’ is designated as the root cell, and all other cells are placed after this cell in order of their inferred pseudotime. To cluster genes based on their pseudotime expression pattern, high frequency patterns are removed through a double spline smoothing operation. The interpolated expression matrix is then normalized by maximum expression along pseudotime such that the maximum value of gene expression along pseudotime is bound by 1. We then applied agglomerative clustering on this interpolated and normalized expression matrix using ‘correlation affinity’ as similarity metric and ‘average linkage’ method to predict three distinct clusters of genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Projection dependence scoring</title><p>To quantify the dependence of expression variation on a two-dimensional projection, we developed a novel approach based on k-nearest neighbor (KNN) averaging. First, a KNN graph is computed by locating nearest neighborhood in a projection using euclidean distance. We then generated a null expression matrix by shuffling the gene expression matrix along each cell column, such that its correlation with respect to the coordinate on projection is completely lost. Next, we compute an updated gene expression value by taking the average of expression values across the KNN. This is equivalent to:<disp-formula id="equ3"><label>(3)</label><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>X<sub>KNN</sub></italic> is the updated KNN averaged expression, <italic>M</italic> is the nearest-neighbor graph with <italic>k</italic> being the number of nearest neighbor, and <italic>X</italic> is the log-transformed CPM of observed or null expression matrices. We chose a <italic>k</italic> of 5 for all our analysis as varying <italic>k</italic> did not have a large effect on the results (data not shown). In our experiments, we have shown that the first two principal components (PCs) of PCA on RH correspond to the projection of cell cycle progression, and a two-dimensional UMAP projection of Pru corresponds to asexual development and cell cycle progression. We thus computed <italic>X<sub>KNN</sub></italic> for both the original, observed expression matrix and the shuffled, null matrix on either projection to reflect dependence on cell cycle progression and/or asexual development. <italic>X<sub>KNN</sub></italic> is further normalized to have identical sum as the original expression values.

It leverages and confirms earlier cell cycle work of others while also nicely informing on biological differences between individual parasites and strains during asexual growth and differentiation. The work also illustrates how new regulatory pathways can be identified and the extent to which they can be conserved over vast evolutionary timescales.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A single-parasite transcriptional landscape of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> reveals novel control of antigen expression&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Dominique Soldati-Favre as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jessica Kissinger (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors have performed rigorous controls and experimental design and made the data freely available in both its raw form and through a user-friendly interface. The discoveries are significant and it is tantalizing to consider what other insights may be gained with additional and deeper exploration of strains with phenotypic differences. Overall this is an outstanding study and an important resource for the community that deserves publication once suggestions/reservations about some aspects of the analysis and the manuscript will have be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Several points of clarifications</p><p>– As not all individual single-cell experiments were successful, it may make more sense, except when discussing the success rate, to utilize the numbers of parasite datasets (as opposed to parasites) that could actually be compared, e.g. paragraph five of subsection “Hidden heterogeneity in asexually developing Toxoplasma”, since only 1552 datasets could be compared.</p><p>– RH genome/gff files that were used represent only 4 Mb of sequence data including and the gff file only contains annotation for the plastid genome sequence. Paragraph two of subsection “Technical validation of single-parasite sorting and sequencing” states that RH reads were mapped to the GT1 genome sequence but this is not reflected in the Materials and methods where only TgME49 and RH are mentioned as reference sequences. The manuscript should more clearly represent exactly which genome sequences and sources were utilized in the methods. See also subsection “Sequencing alignment”.</p><p>– It is great that the authors consider the &quot;multiple-mapping problem&quot; and devise a work-around. There is however another issue related to genome misassembly and compressed multi-gene families or recent segmental duplications. This is an issue for most genome sequences and cannot be resolved here but it would be good to acknowledge the effect that missing gene family members may have on the analysis of the results.

Have the sequence data been deposited in the SRA read archive?</p><p>– Discussion paragraph three – why is mRNA concentration affected by the size of the well and reaction volume used? there is still only a single cell in the assay, but the reaction volumes are greater. Saturation was proven to not be a problem with the smaller 384-well format but here, sensitivity to low copy number is favored. Please clarify.</p><p>– Figure 1—figure supplement 2, what is panel b really telling us? are differences in genome assembly or annotation skewing the results? Also by ORF do you really mean CDS? how were these obtained? they are not mentioned in the Materials and methods.</p><p>2) The authors have chosen some surprising parameters in the mapping:</p><p>– The star aligner parameters for max intron and mate gap size is set to 1Mbp, this has been found to lead to some incorrect mapping in other systems and can result in low level misattributed reads; whilst this is not likely to sway the presented analysis in a significant way, it should be checked.</p><p>– The choice to include and distribute multiply mapped reads of equivalent quality across different genes is somewhat problematic as it will result in one initial read to be attributed to several genes which is not a true reflection of the underlying signal. The results might be particularly biased in the analysis of the multigene family. Apart from recovering a more important number of genes per cell which is not a valid aim in itself, the authors have not justified why this is needed and not demonstrated that it does not impact their downstream analyses significantly.</p><p>3) In the analysis relating the organelle-specific expression clustering, the authors successfully identify correctly and mis-attributed organellar proteins described in the literature. This approach is promising but the further clustering of pseudotime in 3 clusters seems unnecessary, hierarchical clustering of each organellar set ordered in pseudotime may be more informative. Moreover, it could be interesting to compare gene expression patterns and cluster them finely on the whole dataset so as to potentially identify proteins not yet ascribed to any organelle but who share expression patterns with those already described.</p><p>4) The bradyzoite diversity observed and the strain specific differences is a significant observation. The authors have not attempted to understand the transcriptomic circuitry that underlies decision to bifurcate to a bradyzoite fate and the strain specific differences associated with that decision. The authors hypothesize that P3 might be a state from which parasites can trifurcate into the cell cycle or either of the two separate bradyzoite clusters. This could be tested and described more granularly by further sub clustering, pseudotime ordering and branching analysis to understand the transcriptomic determinants of bifurcation into these fates.</p><p>5) The claim of antigenic switching based on a single cell with a different SRS expression pattern, although an interesting initial observation, seems over-interpreted based on the data presented. It is not clear what the author's hypothesis is with regards to this cell, i.e is it the only cell undergoing switching in the population? Why does it express a sexual stage SRS? Does the SAG1 protein signal disappear completely upon transfection with the AP2? The switching mediated by the AP-2 would need a more single cell measurement of the pattern of antigen expression (e.g. scRNA-seq of sorted parasites with different levels of the AP2), although this would be a big undertaking. The authors should either add more data to complete this observation or alternatively should critically discuss their observations and tone down their conclusions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54129.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Several points of clarifications</p><p>– As not all individual single-cell experiments were successful, it may make more sense, except when discussing the success rate, to utilize the numbers of parasite datasets (as opposed to parasites) that could actually be compared, e.g. paragraph five of subsection “Hidden heterogeneity in asexually developing Toxoplasma”, since only 1552 datasets could be compared.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 1 and Results section, the number presented indeed reflects the number of parasites that we sorted and sequenced, as the reviewers surmised.

Saturation was proven to not be a problem with the smaller 384-well format but here, sensitivity to low copy number is favored. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We are also puzzled by the difference in apparent detection sensitivity between the 96-well and 384-well plate formats. While we do not find evidence that single-parasite mRNA reaches saturation in 384-well plate format, as Figure 1—figure supplement 1B indicates, this observation is not necessarily related to detection sensitivity of the scRNA-seq method. Recent studies and our anecdotal evidence suggest that detection sensitivity of scRNA-seq methods is limited by the efficiency of the reverse transcription (RT) step. Lower efficiency of the RT reaction, as usually occurs in droplet scRNA-seq methods, leads to lower conversion of mRNA transcripts to double-stranded cDNA for downstream amplification. Hughes et al. (bioRxiv, https://doi.org/10.1101/689273, 2019) has suggested that the template switching step, which is the common second-strand cDNA synthesis mechanism in Smart-seq2 and the Seq-well methods (the method of choice in their work), is the rate limiting step of RT. In their work, inclusion of a first-strand cDNA recovery step via random hexamer priming significantly improved the detection sensitivity of low abundant transcripts. We suspect that reduction of the RT reaction volume led to changes in the reagent ratio, in particular that of template switch oligos, to the input mRNA which subsequently reduced efficiency of RT; however, further experimentation is required to definitively address the cause of this. As the original Smart-seq2 protocol was implemented for 96-well plate, it may not be a total surprise that reducing the reaction volume in 384-well plates leads to reduced performance; however, sensitivity of our 384-well Smartseq2 measurement still outperforms other droplet methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 1—figure supplement 2, what is panel b really telling us? are differences in genome assembly or annotation skewing the results? Also by ORF do you really mean CDS? how were these obtained? they are not mentioned in the Materials and methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. Figure 1—figure supplement 2 panel B shows the number of genes detected within the analyzed subset (red colored data points in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 panel A) and the percent of reads that mapped to genes containing open reading frames (ORFs) that are predicted to be bona fide coding sequences (CDSs). We originally quantified the percentage of reads that aligned to any region of the genomic reference as “% mapped to ORF”, as this is a standard meta-output from STAR alignment software. But the reviewers are right that this is misleading and so we have updated the axis label to &quot;% mapped&quot; in order to better reflect the fact that aligned reads may originate from intronic, intergenic, or non-coding regions. The differences between strains in percentage mapping may be due to the differences in genome assembly, as we noticed using BLASTn that the majority of unmapped reads across different datasets aligns to 28S ribosomal RNA of ME49 genome reference. We have included additional information in Materials and Methods to clarify all these details and changed the figure to read &quot;% mapped&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors have chosen some surprising parameters in the mapping:</p><p>– The star aligner parameters for max intron and mate gap size is set to 1Mbp, this has been found to lead to some incorrect mapping in other systems and can result in low level misattributed reads; whilst this is not likely to sway the presented analysis in a significant way, it should be checked.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this should be checked and so we realigned all 125 SRS genes for a random sample of 6 cells in 384-well RH samples (10099007) after removing the max intron and mate gap size parameters in STAR aligner and instead used the default settings. Our results showed that the resulting read counts were identical using our original and this new set parameters in all but 3 of the instances, i.e. of the 750 gene/cell data points, 747 were identical. The 3 instances where alignment results differed, read counts did not vary by more than 2. We are therefore confident that our analysis results are robust to the changes in the STAR alignment parameters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The choice to include and distribute multiply mapped reads of equivalent quality across different genes is somewhat problematic as it will result in one initial read to be attributed to several genes which is not a true reflection of the underlying signal.

Apart from recovering a more important number of genes per cell which is not a valid aim in itself, the authors have not justified why this is needed and not demonstrated that it does not impact their downstream analyses significantly.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point and one we considered and discussed extensively among ourselves while doing the analyses. The reason why, in the end, we adopted a correction scheme for multiply-mapped reads is because, as the reviewers mentioned, Toxoplasma genome is known to harbor a number of multigene families. In particular, our interest in analyzing the co-expression, or lack thereof, of SAG1-related Sequence (SRS) genes hinges on the sensitive and reliable detection of SRS genes. We thus faced a choice of increasing the false positives in gene alignment by assigning reads to all genes that could be their origin or increasing false negatives by counting only reads that were uniquely aligned to genes. As we are specifically interested in understanding the underlying reasons for why some SRS genes are expressed at &quot;low&quot; levels in the population, we were anxious to avoid an approach that yielded false negatives. That is, we wanted to be sure that if we did not detect the expression of a given SRS gene, it was not because it was part of a closely related gene family and as a result its transcript discarded due to ambiguous assignment. Most importantly, however, we reasoned that if such gene sequences did prove to be a major contributor for ambiguous read assignment, we would see SRS genes whose expression appeared to strongly correlate with each other. In fact, the data showed almost no co-expression of SRSs other than the super-abundant class like SAG1 and SAG2 (as shown in Figure 4), and so we believe that the false positives are few, if any. We have included additional text in the manuscript to explain this reasoning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the analysis relating the organelle-specific expression clustering, the authors successfully identify correctly and mis-attributed organellar proteins described in the literature.

Moreover, it could be interesting to compare gene expression patterns and cluster them finely on the whole dataset so as to potentially identify proteins not yet ascribed to any organelle but who share expression patterns with those already described.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that we were not clear with the presentation of supplementary data in our original manuscript. We have provided an additional table (Supplementary file 4) that includes the pseudotime cluster assignment for all genes, which would enable readers to easily identify genes with unknown functions that may share temporal expression patterns of known gene families.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The bradyzoite diversity observed and the strain specific differences is a significant observation.

This could be tested and described more granularly by further sub clustering, pseudotime ordering and branching analysis to understand the transcriptomic determinants of bifurcation into these fates.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. The idea of using scRNA-seq data to infer fate decision from transcriptional signature has been recently attempted in Weinreb et al. (Science, DOI: 10.1126/science.aaw3381, 2020). Combined with the use of lineage-tracing barcode, the authors concluded that intrinsic fate biases could not be determined by scRNA-seq. In the absence of clonal identity marker, we find it challenging to convince ourselves that fate determinants can be extracted from our scRNA-seq datasets without further experimental validation; however, we have made it possible for future studies to infer such determinants by providing a list of cluster-specific gene expression for Pru (Supplementary file 5) and ME49 (Supplementary file 6). Overall, we find that the RNA velocity analysis we present provides very clear indications of the flow within and between some of the subpopulations, as shown in Figure 3B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The claim of antigenic switching based on a single cell with a different SRS expression pattern, although an interesting initial observation, seems over-interpreted based on the data presented. It is not clear what the author's hypothesis is with regards to this cell, i.e is it the only cell undergoing switching in the population? Why does it express a sexual stage SRS? Does the SAG1 protein signal disappear completely upon transfection with the AP2? The switching mediated by the AP-2 would need a more single cell measurement of the pattern of antigen expression (e.g. scRNA-seq of sorted parasites with different levels of the AP2), although this would be a big undertaking. The authors should either add more data to complete this observation or alternatively should critically discuss their observations and tone down their conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for the confusion. We did not mean to imply that the existence of this unique cell is the primary case for &quot;antigenic switching&quot;; that overall conclusion was based on the additional AP2IX-1 transfection experiment. This unique cell, however, does reveal some very important information, even though it is clearly an anomaly. It shows that within a population, rare variants can exist that are in completely different developmental states, in this case a parasite that has partially switched into the sexual stages of development normally seen only in the cat intestine. That is, from a single RH cell that lacks the expression of tachyzoite-specific SAG1, we identified expression of genes associated with sexual stages, including two AP2 transcription factors. We thus hypothesized that one or both of the AP2 transcription factors may play a causal role in regulating the expression of SAG1 and sexual stage genes. We showed experimental support in favor of this hypothesis with Figure 5 panels E-F; transfection of an AP2 IX-1 plasmid led to significant upregulation of sexual stage genes that we identified previously in the lone parasite cell, including SRS22C which was up-regulated by over 1000-fold. While AP2 IX-1 transfection led to roughly 3-fold reduction of SAG1 protein in 20 hours, it did not lead to the complete disappearance of SAG1 protein which may require longer treatment time due to the long half-life of this mRNA (Cleary et al., Nature Biotechnology 23;232-237, 2005). We acknowledge that single-cell RNA-seq measurement of the transfected parasites would provide a more precise measurement; however, we believe our claim on the causal role of AP2 IX-1 mediating the switching of SAG1 to SRS22C is substantiated by the provided data. Importantly, we do not make claims as to the cause that led to the expression of AP2 transcription factors and sexual-stage genes in the lone SAG1- parasite from our single parasite dataset.</p></body></sub-article></article>
