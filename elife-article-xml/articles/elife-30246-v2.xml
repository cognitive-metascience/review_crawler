Dynamin forms helical complexes at the neck of clathrin-coated pits and their structural changes coupled with GTP hydrolysis drive membrane fission. Dynamin and its binding protein amphiphysin cooperatively regulate membrane remodeling during the fission, but its precise mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we analyzed structural changes of dynamin-amphiphysin complexes during the membrane fission using electron microscopy (EM) and high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM). Interestingly, HS-AFM analyses show that the dynamin-amphiphysin helices are rearranged to form clusters upon GTP hydrolysis and membrane constriction occurs at protein-uncoated regions flanking the clusters. We also show a novel function of amphiphysin in size control of the clusters to enhance biogenesis of endocytic vesicles. Our approaches using combination of EM and HS-AFM clearly demonstrate new mechanistic insights into the dynamics of dynamin-amphiphysin complexes during membrane fission.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30246.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The nerve cells that make up a nervous system connect at junctions known as synapses. When a nerve impulse reaches the end of the cell, membrane-bound packages called vesicles fuse with the surface membrane and release their contents to the outside. The contents, namely chemicals called neurotransmitters, then travels across the synapse, relaying the signal to the next cell.</p><p>Nerve cells can fire many times per second. The membrane from fused vesicles must be retrieved from the surface membrane and recycled to make new vesicles, ready to transmit more signals across the synapse. Many proteins at these sites are involved in folding the fused membrane back into the cell, constricting the opening, and eventually pinching off the new vesicles – a process known as endocytosis. Two proteins named dynamin and amphiphysin cooperate in this process, but their precise mechanism remained elusive. Dynamin is a protein that acts like a motor; it breaks down a molecule called GTP to release energy. Previous studies have seen that dynamin-amphiphysin complexes join end to end to form long helical structures.</p><p>Takeda et al. have now looked at how the structure of the helices changes during endocytosis. This revealed that the dynamin-amphiphysin helices rearrange to form clusters when the GTP is broken down. Further analysis showed that the folded membrane becomes constricted at regions that are not coated with the clusters of dynamin-amphiphysin helices. Takeda et al. also discovered that amphiphysin controls the size of the clusters to help make the new vesicles more uniform.</p><p>The gene for dynamin is altered in a number of disorders affecting the nervous system and muscles, including epileptic encephalopathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and congenital myopathy. Moreover, a neurological disorder characterized by muscle stiffness (known as Stiff-person syndrome) occurs when an individual’s immune system mistakenly attacks the amphiphysin protein. As such, these new findings will not only help scientists to better understand the process of endocytosis, but they will also give new insight into a number of human diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dynamin</kwd><kwd>amphiphysin</kwd><kwd>membrane remodeling</kwd><kwd>HS-AFM</kwd><kwd>EM</kwd><kwd>in vitro reconstitution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMJCR13M1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ando</surname><given-names>Toshio</given-names></name><name><surname>Takei</surname><given-names>Kohji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP15H03540</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Uchihashi</surname><given-names>Takayuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP16H00830</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Uchihashi</surname><given-names>Takayuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP16H00758</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Uchihashi</surname><given-names>Takayuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new approach using combination of electron microscopy (EM) and high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) clearly demonstrates dynamics of dynamin-amphiphysin complexes during membrane constriction and fission suggesting a novel 'clusterase' model of the dynamin-mediated membrane fission.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is the best characterized endocytic pathway by which cells incorporate extracellular molecules into cells as cargoes of clathrin-coated vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kirchhausen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McMahon and Boucrot, 2011</xref>). CME is required for various essential processes including neuronal transmission, signal transduction and other cell membrane activities such as cell adhesion and migration. For precise progression of membrane invagination and fission during CME, various proteins need to be assembled in a temporally and spatially coordinated manner at the site of endocytosis.</p><p>One of those endocytic proteins, dynamin, is a GTPase essential for membrane fission in CME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonny et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferguson and De Camilli, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schmid and Frolov, 2011</xref>). There are three dynamin isoforms in mammals: dynamin 1 and dynamin 3, two tissue-specific isoforms which are highly expressed in neurons, and dynamin 2, an ubiquitously expressed isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cao et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cook et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">1994</xref>). Structural studies from several groups demonstrated that dynamin consists of five structurally distinct domains: a GTPase domain, a bundle signaling element (BSE), a stalk, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a proline-rich domain (PRD) from N-terminus to C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Faelber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ford et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reubold et al., 2015</xref>). The GTPase domain is responsible for hydrolysis of GTP (guanosine triphosphate) and the PH domain is required for membrane association by binding to negatively charged phospholipids such as PI (4,5) P<sub>2</sub> (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate). The stalk structure serves as a binding interface for dimerization and oligomerization of dynamin. The BSE, which is located between the stalk and GTPase domain, functions as a flexible hinge required for structural changes of dynamin upon GTP hydrolysis. Dynamin forms helical oligomers which was first observed in presynaptic terminals of <italic>shibire</italic> mutant flies at restrictive temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koenig and Ikeda, 1989</xref>). Dynamin also assembles into helices at the neck of endocytic pits in the isolated presynaptic nerve terminals treated with slowly hydrolyzable GTP analogue GTPγS (guanosine 5'-O-[gamma-thio]triphosphate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Takei et al., 1995</xref>). Similar dynamin helices were reconstituted in vitro either with liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sweitzer and Hinshaw, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Takei et al., 1998</xref>) or without liposomes in a low-salt condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hinshaw and Schmid, 1995</xref>).</p><p>There is a consensus view about the dynamin-mediated membrane constriction and fission which is well supported by previous studies from different groups: membrane constriction is required, but not sufficient, for fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonny et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Faelber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schmid and Frolov, 2011</xref>). However, it is still controversial how constriction is achieved, and what GTP energy is used for. For example, membrane constriction could be achieved by assembly into the highly constricted state when dynamin is bound to GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mattila et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mears et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang and Hinshaw, 2001</xref>). Alternatively, membrane constriction could be achieved by hydrolysis of GTP that induces a conformational change leading to constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cocucci et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marks et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roux et al., 2006</xref>). However, precise mechanisms involved in dynamin-mediated membrane constriction and fission remain unclear.</p><p>Amphiphysin is a BAR domain protein required for membrane invagination in CME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wigge et al., 1997</xref>). Amphiphysin has a lipid interacting BAR (Bin–Amphiphysin–Rvs) domain in its N-terminal, a medial clathrin/AP-2 binding (CLAP) domain and C-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. The BAR domain of amphiphysin forms crescent-shaped dimer and its concave surface serves as a platform for bending membrane or sensing membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peter et al., 2004</xref>). The CLAP domain binds to clathrin and AP-2, major components of clathrin-coated pits, and helps to recruit amphiphysin to the sites of CME. In addition, the C-terminal SH3 domain of amphiphysin binds directly to the PRD of dynamin 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">David et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Takei et al., 1999</xref>) and enhances dynamin’s GTPase activity in the presence of liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Takei et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yoshida et al., 2004</xref>). Amphiphysin copolymerizes with dynamin 1 into helical complexes, which form membrane tubules in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Takei et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yoshida et al., 2004</xref>) similar to those formed from synaptic plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Takei et al., 1995</xref>). Furthermore, injection of specific antibodies against amphiphysin into the giant synapse in lampreys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Evergren et al., 2004</xref>) or amphiphysin KO in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Di Paolo et al., 2002</xref>) causes suppressed endocytosis in synaptic vesicle recycling. These results suggest that dynamin mediates membrane fission in CME in collaboration with amphiphysin in vivo. However, the precise contribution of amphiphysin in the dynamin-mediated membrane fission remains elusive.</p><p>In this study, we analyzed dynamics of dynamin-amphiphysin helical complexes using an approach combining electron microscopy (EM) and high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM). Firstly, we show that the dynamin-amphiphysin helices are rearranged to form clusters upon GTP hydrolysis, and membrane constriction occurs at protein-uncoated regions between the clusters. Secondly, we reveal that GTP hydrolysis is required and sufficient for the cluster formation by dynamin-amphiphysin complexes by EM analyses. Finally, we show a novel function of amphiphysin in controlling cluster size, which in turn regulates biogenesis of endocytic vesicles. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of membrane constriction and fission by dynamin-amphiphysin complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GTP hydrolysis is required and sufficient for membrane constriction by dynamin-amphiphysin complexes</title><p>To elucidate the mechanisms of dynamin-mediated membrane fission, we reconstituted the minimum system in vitro and analyzed the time course of its structural changes using EM.

EM analyses showed that GTP hydrolysis is required for both membrane constriction and fission, but dissociation of hydrolytic products (GDP and/or phosphate) seems necessary for the completion of membrane fission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In the presence of GTP or GDP and vanadate, dynamin-amphiphysin helical complexes are reorganized, resulting in the formation of clusters consisting of a few dynamin-amphiphysin helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). HS-AFM analyses directly demonstrated that GTP hydrolysis induces dynamic longitudinal movement of the dynamin-amphiphysin helices as well as constriction during the cluster formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, HS-AFM analyses also demonstrated that membrane constriction and fission occur at the ‘protein-uncoated’ regions created as a result of cluster formation of dynamin-amphiphysin complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Finally, we found that amphiphysin contributes to effective biogenesis of endocytic vesicles by regulating size of the clusters formed by dynamin-amphiphysin helical complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>There is a consensus view about the requirement of GTP hydrolysis in membrane fission, but the requirement of GTP hydrolysis in membrane constriction is still controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonny et al., 2016</xref>). Membrane tubules are constricted in the presence of non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mears et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang and Hinshaw, 2001</xref>) and more constricted with a GTP-loaded GTPase defective K44A mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sundborger et al., 2014</xref>). In both cases, membrane tubules are evenly constricted and periodical membrane constriction sites which lead to membrane fission is not created. In the present study, we showed that membrane constriction sites are created in the presence of GDP and vanadate, which mimicked a transition state of GTP hydrolysis (GDP⋅Pi), suggesting that complete hydrolysis of GTP is required for the formation of constriction sites leading to membrane fission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Membrane fission has never been observed in the presence of GDP and vanadate, suggesting that release of GTP hydrolytic products (GDP and/or phosphate) is a prerequisite for membrane fission. Further analyses will more precisely reveal which intermediate state in the GTPase reaction is responsible for the membrane fission or how many GTPase cycles are required for it.</p><p>In this study, we revealed that dynamin-amphiphysin helical complexes are rearranged to form their clusters upon GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and membrane fission occurs at the flanking ‘protein-uncoated’ membrane regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In the ‘constrictase’ model, dynamin constricts membrane until the membrane neck reaches to the hemi-fission state, which leads to spontaneous membrane fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hinshaw and Schmid, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mears et al., 2007</xref>). However, several lines of evidences are apparently inconsistent with this simple model. For instance, the super-constricted state of dynamin does not constrict the membrane sufficiently enough to reach the hemi-fission state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sundborger et al., 2014</xref>) and membrane tension and/or torsion is required to overcome the energy barrier to fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bashkirov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morlot et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roux et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, we showed that GTP hydrolysis induces constriction of the dynamin-amphiphysin helices as well as clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These radial and longitudinal remodeling of the dynamin-amphiphysin helices may give local tension and/or torsion to the membrane tube at the edge of the clusters to drive membrane fission. Alternatively, the dynamin-amphiphysin clusters may serve as a lipid diffusion barrier that causes friction leading to membrane scission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Simunovic et al., 2017</xref>). Longitudinal rearrangement upon GTP hydrolysis similar to the cluster formation by the dynamin-amphiphysin complexes was also observed in an EM study on the dynamics of dynamin with lipid nanotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stowell et al., 1999</xref>) and more recently by HS-AFM analyses on dynamics of ΔPRD dynamin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Colom et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that the longitudinal rearrangement is an intrinsic property of dynamin during membrane fission.</p><p>In our previous studies, we showed that amphiphysin enhances dynamin’s GTPase activity in the presence of liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Takei et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yoshida et al., 2004</xref>). In this study, we revealed that amphiphysin may also contributes to effective vesicle biogenesis by controlling the number of constriction sites via cluster formation of dynamin-amphiphysin helices in a long membrane tubule formed in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Although precise mechanisms of the cluster size control by amphiphysin remains unclear, amphiphysin could have roles either in determining the number of dynamin-amphiphysin helices comprising the clusters, or in positioning of breakage points in dynamin-amphiphysin helices to induce clustering. Tubular structures have long been known to be present in various synapses, and they are described as ‘membrane tubules’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heuser and Miledi, 1971</xref>), ‘cisternae’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heuser and Reese, 1973</xref>), ‘synaptic tubules’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Samorajski et al., 1966</xref>) or ‘anastomosing tubules’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ekström von Lubitz, 1981</xref>). The tubules are enriched in endocytic proteins including dynamin, synaptojanin, amphiphysin, and endophilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuchs et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Takei et al., 1998</xref>), and the presence of the tubules becomes more prominent when synapses are stimulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuchs et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Takei et al., 1998</xref>), or when membrane fission is blocked in dynamin 1 K.O. mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferguson et al., 2007</xref>). These findings strongly suggest that the tubular structures represent endocytic intermediate at which dynamin-amphiphysin-dependent synergic vesicle formation takes place in the synapse. Besides amphiphysin, other BAR domain proteins, endophilin and syndapin, are also implicated in synaptic vesicle recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dittman and Ryan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Milosevic et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, recent study showed that endophilin potently inhibits the dynamin-mediated membrane fission by intercalating dynamin rungs and preventing their trans-interactions required for membrane fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hohendahl et al., 2017</xref>). Although the dynamin-mediated membrane fission is also inhibited when an excess of amphiphysin co-assembles with dynamin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>), it is rather stimulatory when the molar ratio of dynamin to amphiphsyin is around 1:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yoshida et al., 2004</xref>). One of the important future goals of dynamin study would be to clarify regulatory mechanisms by which dynamin alters its interactions with various BAR domain proteins in physiological contexts such as synaptic vesicle recycling.</p><p>In conclusion, live imaging analyses using HS-AFM in this study and a study from another group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Colom et al., 2017</xref>) gave new mechanistic insights into the dynamin-mediated membrane fission. Combinatory approaches using high temporal resolution imaging with HS-AFM and high spatial resolution structural analyses with X-ray crystallography or Cryo-EM will be the most powerful approach in resolving various dynamic membrane remodeling processes in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Purification of dynamin1 and amphiphysin</title><p>Human dynamin1 was purified using the method of Warnock et al. with some modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Warnock et al., 1996</xref>). Sf9 cells grown in 600 ml of SF-900II SFM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) to the cell density of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml and the cells were infected with baculoviruses expressing dynamin1. After cultivation of cells at 28°C for 69 hr, the infected Sf9 cells were harvested by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended by 1/20 of the culture volume (30 ml) of HCB (Hepes column buffer)100 (20 mM Hepes, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 1 μg/ml Pepstatin A, 40 μM ALLN, pH 7.2) and cells were sonicated using a sonicator (Advanced-Digital SONIFIER model 250, BRANSON).

Ammonium sulfate was added to the cleared lysate to the 30% saturation and incubated at 4°C for 30 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to recover the dynamin1 containing fraction in the pellet. The dynamin1 pellet was resuspended with 20 ml of HCB50 and dialyzed against 2L of HCB50 for total 4 hr (2 hr, 2 times) using dialysis membrane (Spectra/Por Dialysis Membrane MWCO: 3500). The dialyzed dynamin1 fraction was applied to Mono Q5/50 GL column (GE healthcare) and bound proteins were eluted stepwise using HCB50, HCB100, HCB250 and HCB1000 buffers.

Dynamin-amphiphysin complexes (1:1 in molar ratio) were diluted to 2.3 μM in the cytosolic buffer. Formvar filmed EM grids were carbon-coated, then glow-discharged. Droplets of the diluted lipids (10 μl each) were prepared on Parafilm and adsorbed on EM grids for 5 min at room temperature. Then the EM grids with lipids were transferred to other droplets of the diluted dynamin-amphiphysin complexes and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in a humid chamber. To see the temporal effect of GTP hydrolysis, the EM grids were transferred to 1 mM of GTP and incubated for various time periods (from 1 s to 10 min). The reaction was terminated by quick removal of the GTP solution by filter paper at room temperature. Alternatively, the EM grids were incubated either GTP, GTPγS, GMP-PNP, GDP plus Vanadate and GDP to analyze GTP hydrolysis transition state structures.

For the HS-AFM imaging, a small cantilever with dimensions of 7 μm long, 2 μm wide, and 90 nm thick was used (Olympus). Its nominal spring constant and resonant frequency were ~0.2 N/m and ~800 kHz in an aqueous solution, respectively. To obtain a sharp tip, an amorphous carbon pillar was grown on the original bird-beak tip of the cantilever by electron beam deposition (EBD) and then sharpened by a plasma etching in an argon environment. The typical radius of the EBD tip was approximately 2 nm after sharpening. For the amplitude-modulation imaging, the cantilever was oscillated with amplitude less than 10 nm under free oscillation condition and the set-point was set at ~90% of the free oscillation amplitude. For HS-AFM imaging of liposomes and dynamin-amphiphysin complexes with lipid tubules or nanotubes, we used mica covered with carbon film. After coating a freshly cleaved mica surface with carbon film, hydrophilic treatment was carried out by a grow discharge. The liposomes (0.17 mg/ml) were deposited on the hydrophilic mica surface and incubated for 5 min at room temperature followed by deposition of proteins (0.6 μM of dynamin1 and amphiphysin) for 30 min at room temperature. After the incubation, the sample was thoroughly washed by cytosolic buffer to remove excess liposomes and proteins. After the washing, the cantilever tip was approached and the imaging was performed under the buffer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Quantitative data analyses of EM and HS-AFM images</title><p>The EM and HS-AFM images were randomly captured to avoid data manipulation and representative images were shown in all the figures.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Dynamic clustering of dynamin-amphiphysin rings regulates membrane constriction and fission coupled with GTP hydrolysis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Aurélien Roux (Reviewer #1) and Simon Scheuring (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Overall, your findings are of interest, but the reviewers found some aspects of the mechanisms of amphiphysin/dynamin clustering confusing and the fission model also raised contradictory arguments.</p><p>We invite you to submit a revised manuscript provided you can address the following major points satisfactorily.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) Explain in better terms how amphiphysin participates in the clustering of dynamin rings. In particular, the reviewers were concerned by the distinction between helices and rings: do dynamin and amphiphysin polymerize as ring, that are then clustered, or is the helical pitch of dynamin helix changed by amphiphysin? Another possibility suggested by the reviewers is that the dynamin helix could be &quot;broken&quot; into rings by amphiphysin, which are then further clustered.</p><p>2) Regarding your model of fission: It is unclear how your model differs from previously proposed models. The reviewers agree that both the figure and the text should be changed to explain better the role of amphiphysin in clustering of rings/helices of dynamin.</p><p>3) Some of the authors have shown previously that the stimulatory action of amphiphysin on dynamin is curvature-dependent, and most probably stoichiometry dependent. The reviewers thus ask to clarify what is the stoichiometry of amphiphysin to dynamin (concentration ratios), and to perform similar EM experiment as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (No AFM experiment are requested) with 2-3 different stoichiometries to test how this clustering behavior as well as the fission efficiency is affected by amphiphysin/dynamin ratio.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Takeda et al. focuses on the dynamics of dynamin/amphiphysin copolymer upon GTP hydrolysis. The authors use a combination of beautiful electron microscopy techniques and high-speed AFM to show that upon GTP hydrolysis, adjacent rings of dynamin cluster by pairs or more. They also show at the nanometric scale that fission occurs in between those pairs rings. The AFM images show that the pairing is due to dynamic clustering of rings rather than depolymerization/polymerization of rings in another state. Overall, the paper is very convincing and balanced in its arguments. Moreover, it shows how a large structure such as the dynamin helix can dynamically change conformation under the influence of partners and nucleotides. It is also consistent with a recent publication on dynamin, also using high-speed AFM (Colom et al. PNAS 2017) and showing similar dynamics of the dynamin helix, but with less precision. I thus strongly recommend publication.</p><p>I however have one experiment to suggest. I guess the authors have used a stoichiometry of 1:1 to generate the dynamin:amphiphysin complex (I could not find the information at second read, but remembered it was 1:1). I was wondering how the results would evolved as a function of the stoichiometry: does increasing amphiphysin's ratio increases clustering dynamics? I think EM data on this would suffice, and this experiment is not essential.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors have used a combination of high-resolution microscopy, negative staining electron microscopy and high speed AFM to study the organization of amphiphysin and dynamin on membranes. It was previously shown that amphiphysin amplified the enzymatic activity of dynamin and that dynamin-induced scission during endocytosis was perturbed when amphiphysin was deleted. But, the mechanism behind this &quot;boosting&quot; activity is still unclear. Thus, the question is still open. The most interesting result of the paper is the observation of the non-regular helix formed by amphiphysin + dynamin when GTP is present. However, I globally find that this paper is not rigorous enough, with no clear contribution to the understanding of the boosting effect and unjustified conclusions. I thus do not recommend publication of the paper in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) In their paper, the authors generally describe the arrangement of the proteins on soft or rigid tubes as rings rather than as helices. However, although these proteins form rings in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> on this point is not different from those from Takei et al. (NCB, 1999)…), it is well accepted they form helices on tubules, either independently or together. This point is particularly important for the discussion of the effect of GTP hydrolysis. Indeed, rings refer to independent structures, which might interact laterally, while helices are continuous structures and their change of organization would be completely different.</p><p>2) The authors observe the reorganization of the helices on rigid lipid nanotubes, as well as on soft tubules, in the presence of GTP or GDP + Vanadate. They describe their observation as a &quot;clustering&quot; of the rings, which is quite misleading. Indeed, the regularity of the protein organization is perturbed, with a non-even distribution of the helices; however clustering again would be more adapted to rings than to helices. Moreover, with dynamin alone, a change of the helix pitch is also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and in this case, larger &quot;clusters&quot; than in the presence of amphiphysin are obtained. Unfortunately, the authors do not discuss the structural origin of this &quot;clustering&quot; effect and of the effect of amphiphysin on the organization of the dynamin helices during GTP hydrolysis.</p><p>3) From HS-AFM, the authors observe the dynamics of tubule constriction. The authors did not discuss the very long time required for this constriction, a few minutes after GTP addition. Moreover, they do not observe fission, which they claim is due to the strong attachment of the tubules to the substrate. They conclude that constriction occurs on the bare membrane near the edge of the dynamin/amphiphysin &quot;cluster&quot;, and from that extrapolate that scission would occur at the same place, although not observed here. Moreover, some constriction seems also to occur under the proteins since the height decreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, 227s), but this point is not discussed. The paper from Colom et al. (PNAS, 2017) that uses HS-AFM on dynamin alone has shown that constriction occurs under the dynamin helix; it would be insightful to discuss the results in comparison with this paper. Eventually, the statistics is rather poor (1 or 2 examples) and the quality of the HS-AFM data is not very good.</p><p>4) The authors show that the size of the vesicles generated by fission of the tubules is smaller when amphiphysin is present as compared with dynamin alone. They suggest that the vesicle size is related to the distance between &quot;ring clusters&quot; on tubules. However, in vivo amphiphysin is involved with dynamin in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, at the neck of spherical buds, and not on tubules. It is thus exaggerating to extrapolate from the observation on the size of vesicles generated in vitro from the scission of tubules, conclusions on the control of vesicle size during clathrin-mediated endocytosis.</p><p>5) Overall, it is not clear for me what insight is brought by the &quot;clusterase model&quot; to the fission mechanism. In fact, no real mechanism is proposed that explains how amphiphysin facilitates fission, rather a very vague list of possible effects (Discussion) without solid physical basis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The paper &quot;Dynamic clustering of dynamin-amphiphysin rings regulates membrane constriction and fission coupled with GTP hydrolysis&quot; presents EM and HS-AFM data of dynamin-amphiphysin complexes on lipid tubules and nanorods providing insights into the constriction/fission mechanism of the proteins.</p><p>The topic is timely, the data is of highest quality, and the insights of large interest in fields ranging from biophysics to cell biology.</p><p>There are essentially 4 major findings:</p><p>1) Dynamin-amphiphysin rings cluster upon GTP hydrolysis.</p><p>2) Membrane constriction occurs at protein uncoated regions (between clusters).</p><p>3) GTP hydrolysis is required and sufficient for clustering.</p><p>4) Amphiphysin controls the cluster size.</p><p>Altogether, the authors propose a &quot;clusterase&quot; model as the new functional mechanism of action.

I think this paper should be cited.</p><p>Nevertheless, I still have a serious problem with the last part of the Discussion and the model, which is totally handwaving with no physical consistency. This is only a cartoon that takes up the images of the paper, but without solid mechanism. For instance, on Figure 6C, how is it possible to create torsion in a fluid membrane and why would tension increase? If constriction occurs under the amphiphysin-dynamin ring, why would the tubule radius decrease next to the coat, and not increase, in particular if there is some friction under the coat that tend to perturb lipid diffusion? I don't understand how the friction model from Simunivic et al. (2017) could work here. In the absence of clear physical description that justifies these possible mechanisms, I wonder what is so new in this manuscript and groundbreaking compared to the PNAS paper from Colom et al. that would justify publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The author's responses to the first round of reviewers' comments are careful and additional experiments have been performed.

In particular, the reviewers were concerned by the distinction between helices and rings.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewers for raising this issue and we apologize for misleading terminology. We also think that dynamin or dynamin-amphiphysin complexes form continuous “helices” but not stacks of “rings” on lipid templates. Indeed, we meant with the terms “washer ring” or “ring” for the split washer-like structure that corresponds to one helical turn. To avoid any confusion, we integrated those terms into “helix (helices)” or “helical” for both dynamin- and dynamin/amphiphysin-complexes on lipid templates in the revised manuscript. However, we decided to keep the term “ring” to describe the lipid-free dynamin-amphiphysin complexes in solution, since it sounds more appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do dynamin and amphiphysin polymerize as ring, that are then clustered, or is the helical pitch of dynamin helix changed by amphiphysin? Another possibility suggested by the reviewers is that the dynamin helix could be &quot;broken&quot; into rings by amphiphysin, which are then further clustered.</p></disp-quote><p>We think that amphiphysin and dynamin copolymerize to form helices (not rings) in the absence or presence of GTP. Upon GTP hydrolysis, the dynamin-amphiphysin helices form clusters consisting of a few helical turns, and generate protein-uncoated “gap” regions between the clusters. As the reviewer #3 suggested, the helices may be broken at the gap regions, because the clusters are often formed so far apart that the helices are unlikely to stay connected. We added a sentence about the possible helix break in the Discussion (Discussion, third paragraph) and modified the model (Figure 6) in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Regarding your model of fission: It is unclear how your model differs from previously proposed models. The reviewers agree that both the figure and the text should be changed to explain better the role of amphiphysin in clustering of rings/helices of dynamin.</p></disp-quote><p>Since dynamin-amphiphysin complexes form smaller clusters compared to those formed by dynamin alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), amphiphysin may have roles either in determining the cluster size (i.e. number of helices comprising a cluster), or in positioning of break points in the helices. Since we could not discriminate these two possibilities with the current dataset, we discussed these possible roles of amphiphysin in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Some of the authors have shown previously that the stimulatory action of amphiphysin on dynamin is curvature-dependent, and most probably stoichiometry dependent. The reviewers thus ask to clarify what is the stoichiometry of amphiphysin to dynamin (concentration ratios), and to perform similar EM experiment as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (No AFM experiment are requested) with 2-3 different stoichiometries to test how this clustering behavior as well as the fission efficiency is affected by amphiphysin/dynamin ratio.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Aurélien Roux (Reviewer #1) and Simon Schering (Reviewer #3) for suggesting this experiment. In this study, 1:1 ratio of dynamin and amphiphysin (2.3 𝜇M each in final concentration) was mixed for all the experiments using the dynamin and amphiphysin complexes. Following reviewers’ suggestions, we examined stoichiometry dependency of dynamin and amphiphysin in the ring complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, A), liposome tubulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, B), fission efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, C) and the clustering behavior on lipid nanotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The ring complex formation and liposome tubulation by dynamin and amphiphysin were not stoichiometry dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2, A and B</xref>, 1:0.5, 1:1 and 1:2). In contrast, fission activity by the dynamin-amphiphysin complexes was stoichiometry dependent: it was most efficient at 1:0.5 and 1:1 ratios and less efficient at 1:2. The reduced membrane fission at the 1:2 ratio was probably caused by the less stimulatory activity of amphiphysin on dynamin’s GTPase activity at this ratio (Yoshida et al., EMBO J 2004). Interestingly, clustering behavior of the dynamin-amphiphysin complexes on the lipid nanotubes were not stoichiometry dependent and clusters with a few helical turns were formed in the presence of GDP and vanadate mimicking GDP- Pi state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, 1:0.5, 1:1 and 1:2). Taken all these results together, we conclude that amphiphysin contributes to both clustering behavior and GTPase stimulation of the dynamin-amphiphysn helical complexes, but the GTPase stimulation is more stoichiometry sensitive. We have added sentences in the main text (subsection “GTP hydrolysis is required and sufficient for membrane constriction by dynamin-amphiphysin complexes”, first paragraph; subsection “GTP hydrolysis induces clustering of dynamin-amphiphysin helices”, last paragraph) and figure legends for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The model does not make much sense in physical terms, and has raised questions from the reviewers.
