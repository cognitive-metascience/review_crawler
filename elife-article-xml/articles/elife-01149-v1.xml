functional roles in essentially all organs, so understanding ECM protein organization in health and disease remains an important goal. Here, we used sub-diffraction resolution stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) to resolve the in situ molecular organization of proteins within the kidney glomerular basement membrane (GBM), an essential mediator of glomerular ultrafiltration. Using multichannel STORM and STORM-electron microscopy correlation, we constructed a molecular reference frame that revealed a laminar organization of ECM proteins within the GBM. Separate analyses of domains near the N- and C-termini of agrin, laminin, and collagen IV in mouse and human GBM revealed a highly oriented macromolecular organization. Our analysis also revealed disruptions in this GBM architecture in a mouse model of Alport syndrome. These results provide the first nanoscopic glimpse into the organization of a complex ECM.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01149.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01149.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01149.002</object-id><title>eLife Digest</title><p>The blood that flows through the body must be continually filtered to remove waste products and to ensure that it contains optimal levels of water and salts. Filtration is performed inside the kidneys by tufts of small blood vessels called glomeruli. These glomerular capillaries allow water and waste products to pass from the blood into the urine, while holding back proteins and blood cells. The wall of a glomerular capillary consists of two layers of cells flanking a third layer called the glomerular basement membrane. If any of these layers malfunctions, it becomes possible for proteins to pass into the urine. This is a clear sign of kidney disease.</p><p>The basement membrane is composed of proteins secreted by the two layers of cells, but little was known about how these proteins are organized. Now, Suleiman et al. have adapted a new form of high-resolution optical microscopy called STORM to study the structure of the glomerular basement membrane in both mouse and human kidney tissue. By combining data from STORM and electron microscopy, Suleiman et al. showed that the proteins in the glomerular basement membranes of both species are arranged similarly to form a distinctive layered structure. This suggests that the organization of the basement membrane plays a critical role in its function.</p><p>The technique was used to demonstrate that proteins were not organized in the glomerular basement membrane in tissue samples taken from mice suffering from Alport syndrome, a genetic disorder of the kidneys. In addition to suggesting that the disorganization of basement membranes may play an important role in disease, this work also provides a method for investigating the structure of the basement membrane in diverse types of tissue.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01149.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01149.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>super-resolution microscopy</kwd><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>kidney</kwd><kwd>basement membrane</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Instutute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21DK095419, R01DK078314, RO1DK058366</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miner</surname><given-names>Jeffrey H</given-names></name><name><surname>Shaw</surname><given-names>Andrey S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Alport Syndrome Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miner</surname><given-names>Jeffrey H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shaw</surname><given-names>Andrey S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21MH099798</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dani</surname><given-names>Adish</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>High-resolution optical microscopy is used to reveal the organization of extracellular matrix proteins within the basement membrane of the blood filtration barrier in the kidney at the nanometer scale.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Kidney glomeruli are specialized capillary tufts responsible for filtration. They contain the glomerular filtration barrier (GFB), an intricate structure that constitutes the permselective barrier between the bloodstream and the urine. The GFB is organized into three major layers: (1) endothelial cells with fenestrations that line the glomerular capillaries; (2) unique epithelial cells called podocytes that extend many âfootâ processes that interdigitate with those of adjacent podocytes and are linked to each other via a specialized cell/cell junction called the slit diaphragm; and (3) the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), which is composed of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins secreted by the endothelial cells and podocytes that flank it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miner, 2011</xref>). The GFBâs major physiological role is to allow the unimpeded passage of water and small solutes (including metabolic waste products) from the bloodstream into the urinary space, while restricting the passage of plasma proteins such as albumin and immunoglobulins. Although the exact mechanism whereby the GFB functions in this manner is the subject of much controversy, it is clear that injuries or genetic defects in any one of the three layers can cause GFB malfunction that results in increased levels of protein in the urine, a hallmark of diverse kidney diseases. In this study we focus on the ultrastructure and molecular organization of the GBM and its connections to podocytes and endothelial cells.</p><p>The GBM contains specific isoforms of laminin (laminin Î±5Î²2Î³1, or LM-521), type IV collagen (primarily the collagen Î±3Î±4Î±5(IV) network), heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) (primarily agrin), and nidogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miner, 2012</xref>). Laminin and type IV collagen self-polymerize into networks that are connected to each other and/or to cell surface receptors by HSPGs and nidogen; in addition, some receptors can bind directly to laminin or type IV collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yurchenco et al., 2004</xref>). A great number of biochemical studies of ECM proteins have revealed the molecular basis for their self-assembly and interactions with each other and with cellular receptors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yurchenco, 2011</xref>), and detailed structures are available for specific domains of several ECM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khoshnoodi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carafoli et al., 2012</xref>). However, a systematic analysis of the actual spatial arrangement of ECM components within basement membranes, with respect to each other and to their receptors, has not yet been performed in vivo.</p><p>Studying the molecular architecture of ECM protein arrangement poses particular challenges in the context of the GBM. First, the GFB with the GBM cannot yet be reconstituted in vitro. Second, the â¼200-nm thickness of a typical mouse GBM is close to the diffraction limited resolution of conventional light microscopy, thus preventing its use to analyze GBM ultrastructural and macromolecular organization. Transmission electron microscopy (EM) studies show electron dense and translucent layers (lamina densa and lamina lucida), but it is unclear whether these reflect an organization of proteins in the GBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chan et al., 1993</xref>). The ability to decipher ECM protein organization thus will require methods with nanometer resolution and high efficiency molecular labeling.</p><p>Recently, the invention of âsuper-resolutionâ light microscopic approaches have broken the diffraction limit of light microscopy, combining a nanoscopic image resolution with several advantages of fluorescence microscopy, such as high efficiency and multi-color labeling (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ji et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hell, 2009</xref>). In particular, single molecule localization-based imaging methods such as (fluorescence) photoactivable localization microscopy ((F)PALM) and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Betzig et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hess et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rust et al., 2006</xref>) achieve a molecular scale resolution that can bridge our understanding of supramolecular complexes from the molecular/biochemical to the cellular scales. The strength of various sub-diffraction microscopy methods to dissect the nanoscale architecture of multi-protein complexes has been exemplified recently in the case of neuronal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dani et al., 2010</xref>), adhesion complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kanchanawong et al., 2010</xref>), centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lau et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lawo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mennella et al., 2012</xref>) and the nuclear pore complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Szymborska et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Given the importance of ECM proteins in tissue morphogenesis and in diverse human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miner and Yurchenco, 2004</xref>), in this study we investigated the ECM protein organization within the GBM. Using a panel of antibodies, we performed 3D, multichannel STORM in kidney sections and determined the positions of well-defined protein epitopes with nanometer precision. Our data reveal that the GBM is composed of two layers of laminin and agrin molecules, with their N terminal domains oriented towards the center of the GBM. Using transgenic mice expressing a human laminin chain we observed a striking difference in laminin dynamics within the GBM. Results from our imaging approach provide an in situ model of GBM supramolecular organization and align remarkably well with biochemical interactions gleaned from in vitro studies. Finally, we observed distinct distributions of collagen IV molecules and their disruption in a mouse model of Alport syndrome, a hereditary disease of the GBM caused by collagen IV mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Imaging the glomerular filtration barrier ultrastructure with STORM and STORM/deep-etch electron microscopy correlation</title><p>To reveal supramolecular organization within the GBM, we performed STORM on glomeruli in kidney sections using antibodies conjugated to Alexa 647, a bright fluorescent photoswitchable dye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dani et al., 2010</xref>). The dense protein network within the GBM results in a higher fluorescence background and significant light scattering. This poses a major hurdle in obtaining high resolution STORM data from kidney sections. We therefore optimized the fixation and tissue sectioning methods extensively. These preliminary studies established that a modification of the Tokuyasu method of cryo-embedding and cryosectioning at 200 nanometers (nm) thickness was optimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tokuyasu, 1973</xref>).</p><p>We began with studies of agrin, a â¼200 kDa protein that is the major HSPG component of the GBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Groffen et al., 1998</xref>). Agrinâs N-terminus (agrinN) binds to laminin via the laminin Î³1 chainâs coiled-coil domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kammerer et al., 1999</xref>), whereas agrinâs C-terminus (agrinC) binds to integrins and dystroglycan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Singhal and Martin, 2011</xref>), receptors present on both podocytes and endothelial cells. To investigate agrinâs organization in the GBM, we first labeled kidney sections with an antibody to agrinC. In contrast to conventional immunofluorescence images of agrin, STORM resolved two distinct layers of agrinC within the GBM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). To quantitatively document agrinCâs distribution, we digitally selected multiple regions across glomeruli. AgrinC localizations in each region were fitted with a double Gaussian distribution, and the mid-position between the peaks was identified from each image and used as a reference to align subsequent regions. The cumulative localizations obtained from 80 regions are displayed as a histogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The gap between agrinC layers, measured as the peak-to-peak distance, showed a mean of 137.9 nm Â± 1.9 nm standard error of mean (SEM) for the 80 regions; the distance was 132.7 nm (Â±0.9 nm) across more than 600 GBM regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01149.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>STORM and STORM-EM image correlation of the mouse GBM.</title><p>Conventional fluorescence (<bold>A</bold>) and STORM (<bold>B</bold>) images of a kidney glomerular capillary loop labeled with an antibody to agrin.

Dual channel STORM imaging showed that the two layers of agrinC were indeed localized between two layers of podocalyxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). To further correlate the STORM molecular localizations, we developed a hybrid STORM-electron microscopy (EM) approach (see schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). After performing STORM, tissue sections attached to the cover glass were subjected to quick-freezing followed by platinum deep-etching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heuser, 1981</xref>). The tissue and cover glass underlying the platinum replicas were dissolved, and the replicas were transferred to a grid for examination by EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Superimposition of the podocalyxin-agrinC STORM image with deep-etch EM confirmed that podocalyxin labeled endothelial cells as well as podocytes, while agrin was localized to the GBM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). The STORMâEM correlation also confirmed that ultrastructural features of the GFB such as podocyte foot processes and the GBM were well-preserved.</p><p>Lastly, we confirmed these results using immunogold labeling and electron microscopy (EM). Kidney Tokuyasu sections labeled with anti-podocalyxin and anti-agrinC were initially detected using gold-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by deep-etch EM. Similar to its STORM localizations, anti-podocalyxin labeled both podocyte foot process and endothelial membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), but initial attempts to detect agrinC resulted in very sparse labeling. We postulated that the gold-labeled secondary antibody might not efficiently penetrate the GBM. To circumvent this problem, we used a third antibody (goat anti-rabbit) to bridge the primary antibody (rabbit anti-agrinC) and the gold-conjugated antibody (anti-goat). Images generated using this method confirmed the two agrin layers in the GBM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). These data validate the STORM localizations obtained on kidney sections and also confirm the challenges associated with achieving high efficiency immunogold labeling on a highly cross-linked structure such as the GBM.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Positioning molecules within the GBM</title><p>Having established methods for tissue preparation, STORM imaging, and EM correlation, we decided to analyze the molecular organization of the GBM by comparing the positions of various ECM components to each other. Taking advantage of the robust and bimodal distribution of agrinC, we used a localization scheme in which the center position between the two agrinC layers was set as the origin, and the position of a second protein, imaged along with agrinC by 2-color STORM, was plotted on a reference frame that was marked by the agrinC positions at â68.9 and +68.9 Â± 0.9 nm towards the endothelial and podocyte sides, respectively. By iterating this procedure across multiple regions and glomeruli, we could determine the position of various protein epitopes across the GBM with a high degree of precision. The various ECM proteins and their epitopes mapped in this study are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2-2-1"><title>Agrin</title><p>We tested the validity and the sensitivity of our approach by using two additional antibodies against agrin. First, we found that the localization and distribution of two different antibodies to agrinC were nearly identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). In contrast, co-labeling with antibodies to agrinN and agrinC showed that agrinN was present in two layers that were shifted slightly internally to the two agrinC layers, with center positions at â57.5 Â± 2.8 nm and 50.2 Â± 3.28 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This suggests that agrin is oriented either perpendicular or oblique to the plane of the GBM with the C-terminus nearest the adjacent cells, and the N-terminus, which binds the coiled-coil domain of laminin Î³1, closer to the center of the GBM. The orientation and mapping of agrinC and agrinN to different locations within the GBM is consistent with the distinct molecular interactions of the two agrin domains as well as the â¼95 nm extended conformation of agrin visualized by EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Denzer et al., 1998</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01149.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Positioning molecular domains within the GBM.</title><p>Two channel STORM of agrinC along with antibodies to agrinN (<bold>A</bold>), the integrin Î²1 extracellular domain (<bold>B</bold>), laminin Î²2-LF domain (<bold>C</bold>) and laminin Î±5-LEb/L4b domain (<bold>D</bold>).

To localize and orient LM-521 in the GBM, we first used an antibody that recognizes the LF domain of laminin Î²2 (LMÎ²2-LF), which is near the center of the laminin heterotrimer. Co-labeling with anti-agrinC showed that LMÎ²2-LF localized between the agrinC layers at â3.2 Â± 2.5 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Co-labeling with anti-integrin Î²1 gave a LMÎ²2-LF position that was identical to that determined from the anti-agrinC co-labeling experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>) demonstrating the precision of the methodology. Next, we labeled the short arm of laminin Î±5 using an antibody raised against the LEb/L4b domain tandem (LMÎ±5-LEb/L4b), also near the center of the heterotrimer. Similar to LMÎ²2-LF, the position of LMÎ±5-LEb/L4b also mapped in the middle of the GBM, at â1.8 Â± 3.6 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>The span between the N- and C-termini of laminin Î±5 forms the long âverticalâ axis of the LM-521 cruciform trimer.

Our findings that the short arm epitopes from laminin Î±5 and Î²2 were located in the middle of the GBM prompted us to investigate the position of the C-terminal LG domain, which binds cell surface receptors such as integrins, dystroglycan, and the Lutheran cell adhesion molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miner, 2005</xref>). Because we did not possess an antibody to the mouse LG domain, we made use of transgenic mice with doxycycline-inducible expression of human laminin Î±5, which assembles with mouse laminin Î²2 and Î³1 to generate a functional chimeric human/mouse LM-521 trimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldberg et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Transgenic mice in which human laminin Î±5 was expressed either from podocytes or from endothelial cells were analyzed. As endogenous laminin Î±5 has been shown to be synthesized by both cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">St John and Abrahamson, 2001</xref>), this is a physiologically relevant approach. An antibody to the C-terminal LG domain of human laminin Î±5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Engvall et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tiger et al., 1997</xref>) labeled the aspect of the GBM nearest the cell from which laminin Î±5 was secreted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). The positions of the LMÎ±5-LG domain were calculated at 88.3 Â± 3.07 nm towards the podocyte side and â84.7 Â± 6.7 nm towards the endothelial side. Together with the data for LMÎ±5-LEb/L4b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), this shows that LM-521 trimers are oriented with their C-terminal LG domains near the outer aspects of the GBM and their N-terminal domains towards the center of the GBM. The most straightforward interpretation is that the GBMâs laminin component is divided into two networks, one produced by podocytes and the other by endothelial cells. The single band seen with the N-terminal antibody in the center of the GBM occurred because the two networks either overlap or are so close to each other that they are indistinguishable by STORM. In the vast majority of glomeruli, we observed that neither podocyte- nor endothelium-derived LM-521 crossed/flipped over, demonstrating that there is limited mobility of laminin trimers across the thickness of the GBM. A similar conclusion was also reported for the endogenous laminin trimer using a different method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abrahamson et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-4"><title>Collagen IV</title><p>Collagen IV chains contain a long collagenous domain composed of interrupted Gly-X-Y amino acid triplet repeats situated between non-collagenous N-terminal (7S) and C-terminal (NC1) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hudson et al., 2003</xref>). These chains assemble intracellularly into â¼400 nm long triple helical heterotrimers (also known as protomers) that are secreted into the ECM, where they polymerize via hexameric NC1 and dodecameric 7S interactions to form a chicken wire-like network one to several chains thick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khoshnoodi et al., 2008</xref>).

We therefore attempted to map ECM protein epitopes within the human GBM to better understand its architecture and compare with the mouse GBM. We first labeled the integrin Î²1 ectodomain along with agrinC and observed that, similar to mouse GBM, both protein epitopes localized along the endothelial and podocyte surfaces of the human GBM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). It is notable that significantly more agrinC was detected at the podocyte vs the endothelial aspect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>); this could be due to either epitope masking or differences in expression. The peak-to-peak distance of integrin Î²1 was measured to be 428 Â± 14.4 nm, consistent with the known thickness of the human GBM. Given these data, and since two separate anti-integrin Î²1 antibodies showed similar distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>), we selected integrin Î²1 as a reference and mapped laminin and collagen IV epitopes.

However, unlike the mouse, where LMÎ±5-LG was restricted to the two sides of the GBM, in human we also observed LMÎ±5-LG towards the central aspect of the GBM. STORMâEM correlation confirmed that the human GBM was intact and the GBM central LMÎ±5-LG localizations could not arise due a poorly preserved GBM or sectioning artifact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

Thus, we conclude that an intact collagen Î±3Î±4Î±5(IV) network helps to maintain agrin and collagen Î±1Î±1Î±2(IV) organization in the healthy GBM.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01149.018</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Breakdown of the GBM molecular architecture in a mouse model of Alport syndrome.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) STORM and EM images of a capillary loop from a collagen Î±3(IV) knockout (KO) mouse kidney labeled with agrinC shows a thin GBM with 2-layered agrin (single arrow) as well as a breakdown of the 2-layered agrin labeling pattern (double arrow) and a thick irregular GBM stretch showing disorganized, diffuse agrinC labeling (arrowheads).

Our study describes a novel super resolution fluorescence microscopy approach to reconstruct the molecular architecture of ECM proteins within the GBM. We developed a method to achieve systematic nanoscale molecule mapping in dense tissue sections using STORM and ultrastructural imaging on the same samples using EM. The robust and relatively rapid throughput of this methodology allowed us to reconstruct the molecular architecture of the mouse as well as human GBMs.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Nanoscopic imaging in tissues</title><p>Light microscopic imaging shows the components of the GBM as diffusely distributed, suggesting either an amorphous structure or an organization below the resolution of conventional light microscopy. While transmission EM imaging of the glomerulus with OsO<sub>4</sub> demonstrates an electron dense layer in the GBM, the significance of this finding has been unclear. Immunogold-EM has been deployed to study ECM protein organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miosge et al., 1999</xref>), but constraints of sample preparation, antibody accessibility, and quantitation prevent its extensive application. In our study, we performed STORM as well as EM and immunogold-EM using the same tissue and antibody labeling procedures. This allowed us to validate data using both methods and also illustrated the challenges associated with immunogold EM.</p><p>Super resolution fluorescence microscopic methods have now been widely used to resolve subcellular structures in cultured cells, but the use of these methods to analyze tissue has been challenging. Single molecule probe based methods (F)PALM and STORM were originally developed using photoswitchable fluorescent proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Betzig et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hess et al., 2006</xref>) or photoswitching properties of fluorescent dyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rust et al., 2006</xref>). Exogenous expression of multiple photoswitchable fusion proteins and their functional validation is not yet feasible for studying multi-protein complexes in mammalian tissues. Using a number of well characterized antibodies provides a practical alternative for tissue imaging. Thus, we focused on using photoswitchable dye-conjugated antibody labeling for our experiments. Fluorescence imaging of tissue also presents special challenges, mainly regarding the methods of fixation, labeling, sectioning and the method of electron microscopic correlation. Sub-diffraction microscopy methods typically map the positions of labeled proteins; however, putting these in the context of membranes and other ultrastructures requires EM. Recently, a few studies have described super-resolution imaging of photoswitchable fusion proteins expressed in cultured cells and in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, followed by plastic embedding and EM correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Betzig et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Watanabe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kopek et al., 2012</xref>). Conventional fluorescence microscopy of resin embedded tissue sections labeled with antibodies has also been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Micheva and Smith, 2007</xref>). Here, we tested a variety of fixation methods, sectioning thicknesses and electron microscopic approaches. Our best results were obtained when we collected 200-nm thickness Tokuyasu cryosections directly onto a coverglass. Since the Tokuyasu method was originally developed for the preparation of tissue for EM imaging, we were able to use freeze etch EM after STORM, to produce correlated images. We believe that the method described here is a breakthrough as it should be useful for the imaging of a wide variety of other tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Molecular architecture of the GBM</title><p>The results from our study demonstrated that the ECM within the GBM, far from being amorphous, is a highly structured and laminated amalgam of interacting protein networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We showed that agrin and laminin-521 each form two layers within the mouse GBM. In each layer, both proteins were oriented with their C-terminal LG domains close to the adjacent cell membranes, whereas the more N-terminal laminin short arm epitopes and the agrin N-terminus were localized towards the interior of the GBM. Cell culture and biochemical data support these observations: the LG domains of laminin Î±5 and agrin are known to interact with cell surface receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin and Sanes, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yurchenco et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kikkawa et al., 2007</xref>), and the agrin N-terminal domain interacts with laminin Î³1 near the center of the coiled-coil domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kammerer et al., 1999</xref>). But the â¼140 nm vertical axis of laminin must be reconciled with our definitive demonstration in mouse that there are two separate networks that meet in the middle of the GBM; the â¼200 nm wide mouse GBM cannot contain two fully extended laminin trimers, which would approach a 300 nm span. Models predicting either a bent laminin conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yurchenco et al., 2004</xref>) or an extended laminin situated at an oblique angle relative to the adjacent cells would be consistent with our data.</p><p>One of our most important and unexpected findings was the mapping of the collagen Î±3Î±4Î±5(IV) N- and C-terminal domains to near the center of the GBM, a position that in human GBM is too distant from the positions of the integrin Î²1 extracellular domain (extending from both podocytes and endothelial cells) for a meaningful ligandâreceptor interaction. In contrast, both agrinC and LMÎ±5LG localized near integrin Î²1, implicating them as the likely biologically relevant ligands. At the endothelial aspect of the GBM, collagen Î±1Î±1Î±2(IV) was near enough to the cell to be capable of binding integrin Î²1. In our Alport syndrome mouse model, which lacks the collagen Î±3Î±4Î±5(IV) network, collagen Î±1Î±1Î±2(IV) was found at increased levels throughout the width of the GBM. One implication of this is that podocytes should be exposed to unfamiliar collagen IV ligands, which might then lead to podocyte injury and the glomerulosclerosis that is observed in the disease.</p><p>The GBMâs collagen Î±3Î±4Î±5(IV) is secreted solely by podocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamson et al., 2009</xref>), and our results show that it eventually becomes concentrated near the center of the GBM, away from the podocytes. The secreted collagen Î±3Î±4Î±5(IV) protomers are thus likely able to permeate through the LM-521 and agrin networks adjacent to the podocyte, against the flow of filtrate, to reach the center of the GBM. Given the greater thickness of the human vs the mouse GBM, this process should either be faster or persist for a longer period in human glomeruli. In contrast, the collagen Î±1Î±1Î±2(IV) protomers made by endothelial cells form a network closely juxtaposed to the endothelium. These different collagen IV protomer behaviors may be fundamental to establishing and maintaining the GBM and could be related to its splitting and thickening in the setting of Alport syndrome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Tissue handling and genetically altered mice</title><p>Kidneys were isolated from mice after transcardial perfusion with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 4% (wt/vol) Paraformaldeyde (PFA; EM Sciences, Hatfield, PA).

Illumination lasers, 642 nm (Vortran), 561 nm, 488 nm (Coherent, Sapphire) and 405 nm (Coherent, Cube) were shuttered using an acousto-optical tunable filter (AOTF, Crystal technologies).

Images were captured on an EM-CCD camera (iXon+ DU897, Andor) and analyzed using custom software. Image stacks were fitted with an elliptical Gaussian function to determine the centroid positions of fluorescent pixel intensity peaks. These positions termed âSTORM localizationsâ were rendered as STORM images or analyzed further quantitatively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Quantification of STORM localizations and molecule positions</title><p>To quantify STORM localizations and to estimate molecule positions with high precision, multiple GBM regions, each as a â¼800 nm wide window, were selected towards the most peripheral aspect of circular capillary loops, to avoid the mesangial regions where the mesangial matrix meets the GBM. Selected regions were rotated to uniformly orient the podocyte and endothelial sides. STORM localizations from agrinC and a co-labeled molecule, were projected onto the perpendicular axis for each region and fitted with Gaussian functions to identify the centroid positions of the STORM localizations. The midpoint between the two agrinC centroid positions was set as zero and the position of the second molecule of interest was identified by the distance of its centroid position with respect to the zero. This procedure was iterated over multiple regions to estimate the mean position, standard error of the mean and standard deviation for each molecule. To view the quantitative profile of STORM localizations, a histogram was generated from each region by projecting localization points onto a line perpendicular to the long axis of the capillary loop. Each histogram was shifted to align them by their zero position and an accumulated histogram from several regions was constructed by adding up all localizations. The number of regions used to generate the histograms, the mean position of each molecule, standard error of the mean and standard deviation are reported as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4âsource data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 5âsource data 1</xref>.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers. The Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript provides novel insights into the organization of ECM in kidney glomerular basement membrane using correlative EM/super-resolution imaging. Using probes targeting different proteins (and in some cases different domains of the same protein) the authors investigate their relative distributions and show that the ECM in these cells is much more organized than generally believed. Overall this is a very well executed study with data of very high quality. In particular, it represents one of the few sub-diffraction imaging papers published to date, which utilized robust morphometric measurements. It is of interest to scientists involved in high resolution imaging, investigating the basement membrane, and nephrologists. However there are some issues that should be addressed before publication.</p><p>1) Explain more clearly why 3D-SIM and/or STED are not be suitable for imaging 200 nm sections. The authors should also consider validating some of their key results using another imaging method, like 3D-SIM and STED (and GFP fusion proteins) as it is likely to generate similar data.</p><p>2) Clarify the geometry of analysis in the text. While considerable detail is given in the Methods, the reader needs to understand the geometry of analysis as they read the results. Statements such as âselected multiple regions across glomeruliâ are uninformative and the definition of âlocalizationsâ is lacking.</p><p>The reader should be informed of:</p><p>A) How different regions were chosen (that include both capillary and podocyte epithelia in approximate cross section).</p><p>B) The exact geometry of analysis (were lines joining the capillary-to-capsule lumina and perpendicular to the epithelia analysed?).</p><p>C) The definition of a localization (as plotted in the histograms). How did the authors cope with the large agglomerations of stain as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> (and most others as well)?</p><p>3) Explain how the threshold level was set for the histogram tally of localizations relative to that used for the figures.</p><p>4) A very nice aspect of this study is the use of Tokuyasu protocol for tissue labeling. However, it would be nice to confirm some of the results using different fixation methods, as the measurements obtained are unlikely to be absolute (they are, however, excellent in terms of relative spatial positioning). Therefore, we would encourage the authors to validate some of their measurements using different fixation methods, and in live cells if at all possible.</p><p>5) In the Introduction, the authors describe the glomerular filtration barrier without reference to the podocyte slit diaphragm. As a number of kidney diseases result from the failure of this structure, the slit diaphragm should be included.</p><p>6) The assertion in the Introduction that there is little data regarding how ECM components in the basement membrane bind receptors in vivo disregards a raft of literature. We are sure that this was not the authorsâ intention but more careful wording would be wise here.</p><p>7) Explain why the localization counts are so much higher for periN than NC1.</p><p>8) In the interpretation of the data on Laminin in mouse, the authors claim to show that âGBM's laminin component is divided into two networks, one produced by podocytes and the other by endothelial cellsâ. However their labelling of endogenous Laminin indicates just one central Laminin-rich region and their claim for two networks depends on data derived from the ectopic expression of human Laminin Î±5 from both endothelial cells and podocytes. This interpretation needs to be refined.</p><p>9) The distribution of AgrinC and integrin Î²1 are described as being âlocalized along the endothelial and podocyte surfaces of the human GBMâ. The most striking result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, but not mentioned by the authors, is that AgrinC is much richer on the podocyte face and almost absent from the capillary side. This discrepancy between the results presented and the text needs to be addressed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01149.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Explain more clearly why 3DSIM and/or STED are not be suitable for imaging 200 nm sections. The authors should also consider validating some of their key results using another imaging method, like 3DSIM and STED (and GFP fusion proteins) as it is likely to generate similar data</italic>.</p><p>Relative molecule positioning has been accomplished using SIM, STED and STORM/PALM (references cited in our Introduction). With careful aligning and averaging particles, the precision in estimating molecule positions can be smaller than the actual resolution of the method. Thus, in principle, three dimensional structured illumination (3DSIM) and/or Stimulated Emissions Depletion (STED) microscopy would also be suitable for imaging 200 nm sections, and would have validated some of our key results. There are differences in resolution, however. The resolution of 3DSIM is around 100 nm, and the width of the GBM is around 150,200 nm, which could have obscured some of the positioning. Since we do not have access to a STED microscope, we did not compare the methods in our study.</p><p>We believe that one of our main accomplishments is a method to image endogenous protein architecture in tissue sections with EM correlation using multi-antibody labeling. The ability to image a GFP fusion protein in a mammalian tissue section would require generating a transgenic animal. In cases where good antibodies do not exist, this might be a worthwhile option. The utility of studying endogenous proteins in tissue sections rather than GFP fusion proteins opens the use of STORM to a much broader range of applications.</p><p><italic>2) Clarify the geometry of analysis in the text. While considerable detail is given in the methods, the reader needs to understand the geometry of analysis as they read the results. Statements such as âselected multiple regions across glomeruliâ are uninformative and the definition of âlocalizationsâ is lacking</italic>.</p><p><italic>The reader should be informed of</italic>:</p><p><italic>A) How different regions were chosen (that include both capillary and podocyte epithelia in approximate cross section)</italic>.</p><p>We wanted to avoid the mesangial regions where the mesangial matrix meets the GBM so we selected regions for analysis that were away from the mesangium, towards the most peripheral aspect of the circular capillary loops. We also avoided regions where the GBM was thicker than the known thickness of the GBM, as these areas most likely represented oblique sections. We have modified the Methods section as well as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref> to graphically illustrate this point.</p><p><italic>B) The exact geometry of analysis (were lines joining the capillary to capsule lumina and perpendicular to the epithelia analysed?)</italic>.</p><p>We chose regions as described above using an analytic window that was 800 nm wide. This point is noted in our Methods.</p><p><italic>C) The definition of a localization (as plotted in the histograms). How did the authors cope with the large agglomerations of stain as shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref> <italic>(and most others as well)</italic>?</p><p>A STORM localization is the centroid position obtained after fitting an elliptical Gaussian distribution to the point spread function of isolated individual fluorescence intensity peaks captured in an image. This definition is now added to the Methods section.</p><p>Since each antibody bound fluorophore can blink multiple times, the agglomerations could represent multiple time resolved localizations, but could also represent multiple antibodies bound to a similar spot or multiple fluorophores bound to the same antibody. This is the most likely explanation for the âagglomerationsâ. Since we cannot distinguish between these possibilities and did not want to introduce any bias, we considered each localization event as an independent event. Since we are focused on relative positions, this should not have any effect on our conclusions.</p><p><italic>3) Explain how the threshold level was set for the histogram tally of localizations relative to that used for the figures</italic>.</p><p>We did not set any threshold for any of the histograms. Each histogram is an accumulation of STORM localizations from multiple images, aligned to the mid point between agrin localizations, as described in the Methods.</p><p><italic>4) A very nice aspect of this study is the use of Tokuyasu protocol for tissue labeling. However, it would be nice to confirm some of the results using different fixation methods, as the measurements obtained are unlikely to be absolute (they are, however, excellent in terms of relative spatial positioning). Therefore, we would encourage the authors to validate some of their measurements using different fixation methods, and in live cells if at all possible</italic>.</p><p>We tried different fixation and embedding methods and the Tokuyasu protocol gave us the best results. The traditional Tokuyasu method uses glutaraldehyde fixation and was developed to enhance cryosectioning. When we tried 2% glutaraldehyde, little staining was seen which we attribute to loss of antigenicity. Using 4% PFA/PBS fixation with Tokuyasuâs embedding method (90% sucrose/10% PVP) not only allowed us to cut thin sections, but also appeared to preserve antigenicity, as compared with 4% PFA/PBS fixation using alternate embedding media where we were unable to cut sections thinner than 1 Î¼m. As the Tokuyasu method was developed for EM, it also allowed us to perform EM after STORM imaging.</p><p>Since our imaging was of extracellular matrix, it would not be possible to confirm this in live cells, since in vitro cultured living cells do not organize basement membranes properly.</p><p>Lastly, in our study, the calculated GBM thickness was similar to that observed using other fixation and embedding methods (traditional EM, for example). So, we are confident in our measurements. However, as noted above, we focused here on relative spatial positioning as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. This is scientifically more relevant than their exact molecular positions in the GBM.</p><p><italic>5) In the Introduction, the authors describe the glomerular filtration barrier without reference to the podocyte slit diaphragm. As a number of kidney diseases result from the failure of this structure, the slit diaphragm should be included</italic>.</p><p>We have modified the Introduction to include a short discussion of the podocyte slit diaphragm.</p><p><italic>6) The assertion in the Introduction that there is little data regarding how ECM components in the basement membrane bind receptors in vivo disregards a raft of literature. We are sure that this was not the authorsâ intention but more careful wording would be wise here</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for any confusion here. We have modified the relevant sentences in the Introduction.</p><p><italic>7) Explain why the localization counts are so much higher for periN than NC1</italic>.</p><p>We donât really know. We suspect that this could be due to differences in antibody affinities. But it could also be due to a more accessible epitope recognized by the periN antibody. We tested a variety of antibody dilutions and obtained the same result, so this is not due to differences in antibody concentration.</p><p><italic>8) In the interpretation of the data on Laminin in mouse, the authors claim to show that âGBM's laminin component is divided into two networks, one produced by podocytes and the other by endothelial cellsâ. However their labelling of endogenous Laminin indicates just one central Laminin rich region and their claim for two networks depends on data derived from the ectopic expression of human Laminin Î±5 from both endothelial cells and podocytes. This interpretation needs to be refined</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for not making this clearer. When we used Laminin short arm or N terminal antibodies, we did observe one central Laminin rich region in mouse GBM. When we used the C terminal LG domain (human transgene derived) antibody, we identified a band of localizations on each side of this central region. We interpret both sets of data to mean that there are two Laminin layers, with the N termini either overlapping or so close to each other near the middle of the GBM that they are indistinguishable by STORM, and the C termini facing away from the center, allowing us to distinguish the two layers. The contention that there are two separate networks does rely on cell specific expression of the human Laminin Î±5 transgene, and we are happy to clarify how this conclusion was made. This is consistent with published work showing that both endothelial cells and podocytes synthesize Laminin Î±5-containing trimers (St. John et al., 2001) and that these trimers remain associated with their cellular origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abrahamson et al., 2007</xref>). It is also consistent with our analysis of human GBM in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. The text has been revised to better explain this.</p><p><italic>9) The distribution of AgrinC and integrin Î²1 are described as being âlocalized along the endothelial and podocyte surfaces of the human GBMâ. The most striking result in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5B</italic></xref><italic>, but not mentioned by the authors, is that AgrinC is much richer on the podocyte face and almost absent from the capillary side. This discrepancy between the results presented and the text needs to be addressed</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing up this point. We consistently noted that the AgrinC staining on the podocyte side of the GBM was higher in human vs mouse. We donât know what the explanation is, but it is possible that this is due to masking of the epitope by the collagen Î±1Î±2(IV) in the human GBMâs endothelial aspect or due to higher expression in human podocytes. We are happy to discuss this in the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
