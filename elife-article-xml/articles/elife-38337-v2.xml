Understanding the molecular basis for their desiccation tolerance may provide novel insights into stress biology and critical tools for engineering drought-tolerant crops. Using the anhydrobiote, budding yeast, we show that trehalose and Hsp12, a small intrinsically disordered protein (sIDP) of the hydrophilin family, synergize to mitigate completely the inviability caused by the lethal stresses of desiccation. We show that these two molecules help to stabilize the activity and prevent aggregation of model proteins both in vivo and in vitro. We also identify a novel in vitro role for Hsp12 as a membrane remodeler, a protective feature not shared by another yeast hydrophilin, suggesting that sIDPs have distinct biological functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>desiccation tolerance</kwd><kwd>trehalose</kwd><kwd>sIDP</kwd><kwd>Hsp12</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001229</institution-id><institution>G Harold and Leila Y.

Potential solutions to more frequent drought may come from the study of diverse organisms, collectively named anhydrobiotes, which can survive extreme water loss. Anhydrobiotes include single celled organisms (bacteria and yeast), simple multicellular organisms (plant seeds), as well as complex multicellular plants and animals (resurrection ferns, tardigrades and nematodes). The acquisition of a desiccation tolerant state of all these organisms requires pre-exposure to a stress condition like nutrient starvation or reduced water that induces dramatic changes in the profile of gene expression and cellular constituents. Among all these changes, the identity of the stress effectors that are necessary and sufficient to mitigate all the stresses of desiccation remained unknown. Furthermore, the removal of water from organisms has the potential to induce many potential stresses, given the ubiquitous function of water in so many biological processes. Which of these potential stresses must be mitigated to allow desiccation tolerance also remains incomplete.</p><p>An important clue to the identification of critical stress effectors of desiccation came from the discovery that almost all anhydrobiotes have high levels of the disaccharide trehalose and small, hydrophilic, and intrinsically disordered proteins collectively called hydrophilins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crowe et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Potts, 2001</xref>). Recently, the in vivo requirements for trehalose and hydrophilins in desiccation tolerance have been addressed in nematodes, yeast and tardigrades that lack trehalose or hydrophilins because of either mutations or gene knock-downs using RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boothby et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erkut et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tapia and Koshland, 2014</xref>). The abrogation of these factors caused diverse impacts on desiccation tolerance, as measured by the organism’s survival to drying. Nematodes lacking trehalose are extremely sensitive to short term desiccation, while yeast lacking trehalose are sensitive to only long term-tolerance desiccation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erkut et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tapia and Koshland, 2014</xref>). At least one species of tardigrade is desiccation tolerant although naturally lacking trehalose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boothby et al., 2017</xref>). Loss of individual different hydrophilins only partially reduces tolerance in nematodes, tardigrades, and yeast, and never to the degree as observed when lacking trehalose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boothby et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Calahan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erkut et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, in nematodes, even when a specific hydrophilin is missing, &gt;10% of nematodes survive, demonstrating moderately high levels of desiccation tolerance never observed in sensitive species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erkut et al., 2013</xref>). The fact that loss of trehalose or individual hydrophilins can reduce desiccation tolerance shows they can mitigate one or more stresses of desiccation. However, the variability of their impact suggests that unknown combinations of trehalose, hydrophilins or additional, as yet unidentified, stress effectors must help mitigate the same or different lethal stresses of desiccation.</p><p>To complement these loss of function tests, we developed a system in budding yeast to examine the combinatorial roles of stress effectors in desiccation. Only 0.001% of exponentially dividing yeast cells survive desiccation compared to 20–40% survival of stationary phase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Calahan et al., 2011</xref>). To assess the sufficiency of different stress effectors (e.g. of trehalose or hydrophilins) to confer desiccation tolerance, we engineered exponentially dividing cells to have increased levels of only trehalose or individual tardigrade hydrophilins (independent of all the other cellular factors that differ between exponential and stationary phase cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boothby et al., 2017</xref>). The desiccation tolerance of these cells increased by 1000-fold, but remained one to two orders of magnitude less than the tolerance naturally reached in stationary phase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boothby et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tapia et al., 2015</xref>). These observations further reinforce the notion that robust desiccation tolerance likely requires an unknown combination of trehalose, hydrophilins or other stress effectors working in concert to alleviate one or more stresses imposed by complete water loss.</p><p>What are the stresses imposed by desiccation? Given the ubiquitous molecular functions of water in biological processes, its absence has been proposed to induce a plethora of stresses. After drying, desiccation sensitive nematodes and yeast exhibit membrane blebbing and protein aggregation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erkut et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tapia and Koshland, 2014</xref>). These results suggest that desiccation may induce perturbations to membrane integrity and proteostasis. In nematodes, a partial loss of desiccation tolerance has also been observed with defects in protection against ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erkut et al., 2013</xref>). Different hydrophilins have been reported to localize to different organelles, suggesting that unique organellar stress (i.e. mitochondria) may be an important feature of desiccation stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Candat et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hand et al., 2011</xref>). These results led to the idea that desiccation causes a variety of lethal stresses, impacting multiple cellular constituencies, that require a host of specific stress effectors to mitigate.</p><p>We sought to identify stress effectors sufficient for desiccation tolerance, and to characterize their molecular functions. Here, using genetic assays with stationary and exponential phase cells, we demonstrate that trehalose and a single hydrophilin, Hsp12, unexpectedly synergize to completely alleviate all of the lethal damage that occurs due to severe water loss. We provide evidence that these two small molecules have both independent and synergistic activities to counter the misfolding and aggregation of protein reporters that occurs upon desiccation both in vivo and in vitro. We identify a novel in vitro role for Hsp12 as a membrane remodeler, an activity likely required to provide desiccation tolerance. Finally, our data suggest that despite sharing many of the same properties (high glycine content, small size, high hydrophilicity, disordered secondary structure), yeast hydrophilins clearly have distinct functions. These findings have profound implications for both stress biology and potential translational applications.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Trehalose and Hsp12 are necessary and sufficient for desiccation tolerance</title><p>We reasoned that previous screens of the yeast deletion collection for sensitivity to short-term desiccation sensitivity were unproductive because likely more than one stress effector needed to be inactivated to significantly compromise tolerance. At least one of these factors was likely trehalose, given its role in long-term desiccation tolerance. Therefore, we started with a base strain that was unable to synthesize trehalose (<italic>tps1∆</italic>) and introduced into it deletions for the remaining ~5000 non-essential genes in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tong et al., 2001</xref>). These double mutants were grown to stationary phase and assayed for survival after short-term and long-term desiccation. We identified three groups with distinct phenotypes. The strains in the first group were inviable when dried for six days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2A2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2B</xref>). The strains in the second group were inviable even in the absence of stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2A1</xref>). The strains in the third group suppressed the long-term desiccation sensitivity of a <italic>tps1∆</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2A3</xref>). While the strains in these last two groups identify potentially interesting genes for future study, we focused on the first group; the gene deletions in this group potentially inactivated candidate stress effectors besides trehalose that were needed for short-term desiccation tolerance.</p><p>One candidate gene from this group was <italic>HSP12</italic>. Hsp12 encodes one of 12 previously identified yeast hydrophilins and is the most highly expressed member of the family in stationary phase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garay-Arroyo et al., 2000</xref>). To further investigate the potential synergism between Hsp12 and trehalose we compared quantitatively short- and long-term desiccation tolerance of stationary phase cells that were wild type, <italic>tps1∆, hsp12∆</italic> and <italic>tps1∆hsp12∆</italic>. After a 30 day desiccation period, the viability of stationary phase wild type cells decreased only two-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Although the viability of <italic>tps1∆</italic> cells was similar to that of wild type cells after two days of desiccation, after the 30 day desiccation period, <italic>tps1∆</italic> cell viability dropped more than 100-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This result corroborated our previous evidence demonstrating a requirement of trehalose for long-term but not short-term desiccation tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tapia and Koshland, 2014</xref>). While <italic>hsp12∆</italic> cells exhibited wild type levels of desiccation tolerance after both short- and long-term desiccation, the <italic>tps1∆hsp12∆</italic> cells displayed a 100-fold drop in viability after only 2 days of drying. Furthermore, after 30 days of desiccation, no viable <italic>tps1∆hsp12∆</italic> cells remained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These results revealed that trehalose and Hsp12 act cooperatively to promote tolerance to both short- and long-term desiccation. Furthermore, although <italic>tps1∆</italic> and <italic>hsp12∆</italic> had both been shown to confer elevated sensitivity to heat stress, the <italic>tps1∆hsp12∆</italic> double mutant was no more heat-sensitive than either single mutant alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gibney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Welker et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the protective synergism we observe between trehalose and Hsp12 is specific to desiccation stress.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38337.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Trehalose and Hsp12 are necessary and sufficient for desiccation tolerance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Yeast cells were grown to saturation (5 days), air-dried for 2, 15, or 30 days at 23°C, 60% relative humidity (RH), then rehydrated and assessed for viability by counting colony forming units (CFU).

Hence, we tested whether exponentially dividing cells with engineered high-level expression of Hsp12 would also exhibit increased desiccation tolerance. Normally, Hsp12 is not highly expressed in unstressed dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Praekelt and Meacock, 1990</xref>). Therefore, we swapped its promoter with a strong constitutive promoter to drive Hsp12 expression in dividing cells to a level similar to that observed in stationary phase cells. These dividing cells exhibited a 1000-fold increase in desiccation tolerance, comparable to survival conferred by increased intracellular trehalose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, Hsp12, like trehalose, had a significant ability to mitigate one or more of the lethal stresses imposed by desiccation.</p><p>Next, we tested for potential synergy between trehalose and Hsp12 by examining the desiccation tolerance of exponentially-dividing yeast cells containing high levels of both factors. The desiccation tolerance of these cells was ~60 fold greater than cells that expressed only Hsp12 or trehalose. Furthermore, the absolute amount of tolerance (65–80% survival) was even greater than the tolerance of wild type cells in stationary phase (20–40% survival), the highest tolerance previously reported for yeast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Calahan et al., 2011</xref>). Our findings suggest that the functions of these two stress effectors must synergize to counter all the lethal effects of desiccation and subsequent rehydration on exponentially dividing yeast.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Hsp12 can protect protein activity and aggregation of soluble cytosolic proteins during desiccation</title><p>Different in vitro experiments have suggested that trehalose helps prevent desiccation-induced proteotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaushik and Bhat, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Olsson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Singer and Lindquist, 1998</xref>). With this in mind, we tested the ability of Hsp12 to modulate proteostasis under desiccation conditions. First, we examined the impact of Hsp12 on the in vitro activity of the well-established model proteostasis substrate citrate synthase (CS). We desiccated solutions of CS alone or with varying concentrations of Hsp12. These samples were rehydrated, and CS enzymatic activity was measured. Desiccation of CS caused an approximately 50% reduction in its enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The presence of Hsp12 during drying maintained nearly all CS enzymatic activity in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Percentage of activity was normalized to WT saturated ‘wet’ sample. (<bold>B</bold>) Cells were prepared as in A. Total cellular protein was extracted, and aggregated proteins were sedimented by high-speed centrifugation.

We expressed FFL in exponentially dividing wild type cells either expressing or not expressing Hsp12. Before desiccation, the levels of FFL luminescence were the same for all strains tested. After desiccation, luminescence in wild type cells not expressing Hsp12 was reduced by a factor of 10<sup>5</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The presence of Hsp12 in these cells did not increase the activity of this very sensitive reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, Hsp12 clearly is not competent to stabilize the activity of all proteins against desiccation.</p><p>We next examined the ability of Hsp12 to protect against desiccation-induced aggregation in vitro and in vivo. CS was incubated and desiccated alone or with Hsp12. When dried alone, CS demonstrated high levels of aggregation, a 20-fold increase in its aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Increasing amounts of Hsp12 added before desiccation decreased aggregation of CS in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Significant solubilization of CS occurred at a 2:1 ratio of Hsp12 to CS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, 225:120 µg/ml). This stoichiometry suggests this solubilization function of Hsp12 is not enzymatic, consistent with Hsp12s high expression during stress in vivo. Similarly, we desiccated exponentially dividing cultures of strains that expressed FFL either expressing or not expressing Hsp12. Upon rehydration, we prepared lysates of these cultures and subjected them to centrifugation to separate soluble FFL from insoluble FFL that had aggregated with itself or other insoluble proteins. For all strains tested, equivalent amounts of total FFL were present in cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In the wild type strain not expressing Hsp12, no FFL was detected in the soluble fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Increased Hsp12 expression significantly increased luciferase solubility. Thus, both in vivo and in vitro, Hsp12 helps mitigate desiccation-induced protein aggregation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Hsp12 proteostasis activities can act synergistically with, or independently of trehalose</title><p>Given the synergism between trehalose and Hsp12 to promote survival to desiccation, we used the CS and FFL assays to ask whether their activities in proteostasis also exhibited synergism. In vitro, trehalose, like Hsp12, increased the activity and solubility of CS after desiccation in a concentration dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). We looked for protective synergism of CS between trehalose and Hsp12 at suboptimal concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). While trehalose and Hsp12 synergize to restore CS activity, limited synergistic protection against aggregation was observed. In vivo FFL activity was stabilized four-fold against desiccation in cells with high trehalose alone, but 14-fold in cells with both high Hsp12 and trehalose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, while Hsp12 had no effect on FFL activity on its own, it could synergize with trehalose to increase the activity of this reporter. Trehalose, like Hsp12, also increased the solubility of FFL after desiccation. Cells expressing both Hsp12 and trehalose further elevated FFL solubility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). These results demonstrate that Hsp12 and trehalose can modulate the activity and solubility of proteins independently or cooperatively depending upon the substrates, suggesting that Hsp12 and trehalose have both independent and dependent functions in proteostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Hsp12 and trehalose act synergistically to propagate a membrane prion</title><p>Previously, we have used prion propagation as a sensitive measure of proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tapia and Koshland, 2014</xref>). Prion propagation requires chaperones that promote oligomerization to generate new prions. Prion propagation also requires factors that prevent prion over-oligomerization. If the prion aggregate becomes too large, it fails to transfer into daughter cells during cell division, resulting in curing over time. Previously, we showed that [<italic>PSI<sup>+</sup></italic>], a cytoplasmic prion, or [<italic>GAR<sup>+</sup></italic>], a membrane-associated prion, are propagated efficiently between desiccated stationary phase cells and their daughter cells that form upon rehydration in growth media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tapia and Koshland, 2014</xref>).

This distinction provides another example of independent function of Hsp12 and trehalose in the proteostasis of cytosolic proteins.

For example, proteins known to be involved in endocytic membrane trafficking lead to the vesiculation of liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boucrot et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether addition of Hsp12 to dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) liposomes would generate nanovesicles. DMPG liposomes incubated in the absence of Hsp12 sedimented into the pellet fraction due to their large size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). By contrast, when incubated in the presence of Hsp12, DMPG appeared in the supernatant fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Liposome vesiculation mediated by Hsp12 was incredibly robust and occurred even at low concentrations (Hsp12 - 1.5 μg/ml), with complete vesiculation occurring in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To assess vesiculation directly, we examined these same samples by electron microscopy. Prior to the addition of Hsp12, liposomes exhibited expected spherical shapes and sizes (&lt;200 nm). After the addition of Hsp12, very few intact liposomes were observed, replaced by membrane remnants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Trehalose alone did not have any vesiculation activity nor did it inhibit the effect of Hsp12 on liposomes under the conditions tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Moreover, the biological and biochemical differences between Hsp12 and Stf2 further support the view that the specific membrane remodeling activity of Hsp12 contributes to its desiccation tolerance-promoting function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We exploited the conditional desiccation tolerance of yeast to provide important new insights into the stress effectors of desiccation tolerance. While previous studies in yeast, nematodes and tardigrades have examined the impact of individual hydrophilins or trehalose on desiccation tolerance, no in vivo studies have looked at the combined effect of loss or gain of both trehalose and a hydrophilin. Here, we demonstrate that stationary phase yeast cells lacking both trehalose and Hsp12 (<italic>tps1∆hsp12∆</italic>) exhibit a greater than 100-fold loss in short-term desiccation tolerance and 10,000-fold loss in long-term desiccation. The magnitude of the desiccation sensitivity suggests that these two factors are critical to mitigate most of the lethal stresses associated with desiccation. In addition, we show that supplementing cells with only trehalose and Hsp12 was sufficient to make desiccation-sensitive dividing cells desiccation tolerant, this tolerance is higher than that which is observed naturally in stationary phase cells. This increase in desiccation tolerance was far greater than cells expressing each factor alone, again suggesting a synergistic interaction to suppress desiccation-induced stresses. In summary, while dividing cells have mechanisms to deal with the stresses imposed by subtler changes in available water; the new or increased amplitude of stresses imposed by severe/complete water loss can all be mitigated by trehalose and Hsp12 alone.</p><p>Hsp12 had not previously been implicated in desiccation tolerance. Rather, Hsp12 had been reported to mitigate lethality due to heat stress and osmolarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Welker et al., 2010</xref>). We were unable to reproduce those findings. Furthermore, the heat stress that was used in the previous study was 58°C, a temperature that budding yeast is unlikely to experience in the wild or in fermenting vats. In contrast, desiccation occurs commonly in nature, so the desiccation tolerance conferred by Hsp12 is likely one of its physiological functions. Our results, coupled with the previous demonstration for the importance of individual hydrophilins for desiccation tolerance in tardigrade and nematodes provide compelling evidence for the causal roles of a hydrophilin in desiccation tolerance in all anhydrobiotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boothby et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erkut et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, the important role of Hsp12 in desiccation tolerance appears to reflect a unique function amongst the hydrophilin family based on several considerations. First, if any of the other 11 hydrophilins in yeast had the same activity as Hsp12, then an <italic>hsp12∆</italic> strain would not show synergistic desiccation sensitivity with <italic>tps1∆,</italic> and <italic>hsp12∆</italic> would not have been picked up in our screen for trehalose desiccation synthetic-sensitivity. Second, desiccation sensitivity was not observed in a strain deleted for Hsp12 and all the other seven non-essential hydrophilin genes, again suggesting the absence of functional redundancy between hydrophilins. Third, further analysis of one of these eight hydrophilins, Stf2, showed that it displayed none of the synergism for desiccation tolerance or sensitivity with the presence or absence of trehalose that we observe with Hsp12. A previous report suggested that <italic>stf2∆</italic> demonstrated a subtle 5-fold loss in desiccation tolerance that we do not observe; this previous study rehydrated cells with warmed media introducing a heat shock variable wherein the function of Stf2 might be required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">López-Martínez et al., 2012</xref>). The apparent uniqueness of Hsp12 as a critical factor for desiccation tolerance challenges the notion that all hydrophilins belong to a redundant family of proteins with common biological functions. Indeed, the uniqueness of Hsp12 may be the tip of the iceberg in which studies of the other hydrophilins in yeast will reveal unique functions in different aspects of cell biology.</p><p>What is the molecular function of Hsp12 underlying its distinct role in desiccation tolerance? Several studies have been reported the ability of hydrophilins in vitro to protect against protein aggregation and protein misfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goyal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hincha and Thalhammer, 2012</xref>). However, evidence for the in vivo relevance of these in vitro findings was lacking. Here, we show that Hsp12 demonstrates both of these activities with analyzed substrates both in vitro and in vivo. Specific protein substrates of Hsp12 may be critical for organismal desiccation tolerance. Support for this idea will require identifying such key substrates and testing their protection by Hsp12. However, we show that the in vivo ability of Hsp12 to promote desiccation tolerance correlates with the ability of Hsp12 to acquire secondary structure in the presence of lipids and to cause membrane vesiculation. This membrane remodeling activity is consistent with the requirement of Hsp12 and trehalose to allow propagation of the membrane prion [<italic>GAR<sup>+</sup></italic>]. Given the impact of Hsp12 and trehalose on [<italic>GAR<sup>+</sup></italic>] prion propagation in aqueous conditions, Hsp12’s vesiculation function may play an important role during rehydration.</p><p>The synergistic biological interactions of trehalose and Hsp12 in desiccation tolerance may reflect their ability to modulate common stresses by different yet complementary mechanisms. As suggested by in vitro experiments, the protective effect of trehalose on cytosolic proteins may result from its ability to form an amorphous liquid glass inside cells in the absence of water, while Hsp12’s protective effect may result from aiding in the formation and strength of trehalose in its vitrified state. Additionally, trehalose has also been proposed to protect against severe membrane damage during desiccation. Damage that escapes protection by trehalose may be removed by Hsp12’s vesiculation function. Interestingly, it has recently been noted that intrinsically disordered proteins and protein regions have been shown to contribute to phase transitions leading to a more ordered cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberti and Hyman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mitrea and Kriwacki, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Uversky et al., 2015</xref>). Hsp12 might protect proteins from aggregating via means of phase separating susceptible proteins and hence buffering the cytosol. Additional genetic and biochemical experiments will be needed to test these models.</p><p>Hsp12’s lipid-induced folding, its in vitro membrane remodeling activity and its in vivo role in desiccation tolerance are not shared with Stf2, another yeast hydrophilin. These apparently unique features of Hsp12 provide new insights into hydrophilins and stress biology. Like yeast, most organisms express a large family of hydrophilins genes. However, the reason why hydrophilin families are so large remains a mystery. The distinct causal role of Hsp12 in desiccation tolerance reveals that the generic properties of hydrophilins of charge, glycine composition and disorder are not sufficient to mitigate the stresses of desiccation. Thus, other hydrophilins, like Stf2, must have other distinct functions. One simple idea is that these other functions mitigate yet to be determined cellular processes or different stresses.</p><p>We provide in vivo and in vitro evidence that both trehalose and Hsp12 can modulate proteostasis in response to desiccation. We show that in vivo they prevent desiccation-induced aggregation of firefly luciferase and of citrate synthase in vitro. Trehalose and Hsp12 also synergize, albeit weakly, to protect firefly luciferase activity in vivo, and individually they protect citrate synthase activity in vitro. Whether the stabilization of enzyme activity is different or just another manifestation of their anti-aggregation activity is not clear. Interestingly, the proteostasis functions of trehalose and Hsp12 are not identical as cells lacking only trehalose are compromised for [<italic>PSI<sup>+</sup></italic>] and [<italic>GAR<sup>+</sup></italic>] propagation while lacking cells Hsp12 alone are not. These differences likely indicate that trehalose and Hsp12 may modulate proteostasis by different mechanisms.</p><p>We propose a working model based upon the requirements of Hsp12 and trehalose for desiccation tolerance and observations reported previously. Trehalose prevents abnormal membrane vesicles in desiccated nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erkut et al., 2011</xref>). In vitro experiments suggest that trehalose intercalates into membranes to alter their melting properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crowe et al., 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Leslie et al., 1994</xref>). Based upon these observations we propose that desiccation induces membrane damage that can be prevented by intercalation of trehalose. If damage occurs, it could then be removed by Hsp12’s remodeling activity. These distinct activities provide a possible explanation for the synergistic requirement for trehalose and Hsp12 in both short- and long-term desiccation tolerance.</p><p>The finding that trehalose and Hsp12 together are sufficient to mitigate the major stresses of desiccation has major implications for engineering desiccation/drought tolerance in other organisms. The ability to generate desiccation tolerance with only two factors makes this engineering eminently more feasible and approachable from an evolutionary perspective. Attempts to engineer plants to synthesize more trehalose have met with technical difficulties because of the disaccharide’s additional roles in metabolism. Our results provide new impetus to overcome those hurdles. Furthermore, manipulation of Hsp12 expression has no known metabolic side effects, at least in budding yeast. Given the sufficiency of Hsp12 alone to confer partial desiccation tolerance, it will be very interesting to test whether Hsp12 by itself might confer drought tolerance to plants or other organisms that might benefit from this remarkable trait.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and growth conditions</title><p>Standard yeast propagation and transformation procedures were used.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Although the reviewers felt that the area was of interest, the felt that as it stands, the manuscript lacked sufficient depth to be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The two reviewers are experts in the field of desiccation tolerance and as you can see, they both feel that there is a considerable literature out there, and that moving forward, it would be good to put your experiments in the context of these experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript by Kim et al. investigates the role of trehalose and the hydrophilin Hsp12 in desiccated budding yeast. The authors show that these two molecules prevent the aggregation and stabilize the activity of model proteins. They also propose a role for Hsp12 as a remodeler of membranes. There are several interesting observations in this paper. However, there are also many problems that significantly reduce my enthusiasm for the paper. The biggest problem is that similar findings have already been reported previously in budding yeast but also in other model organisms. I am therefore not sure whether this manuscript generates the level of advance that I would associate with a paper in <italic>eLife</italic> paper. To be truly novel, the paper would have to provide some deeper insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the synergistic protective effect of trehalose and Hsp12.</p><p>1) Figure 2A. The authors conclude from these data that luciferase is denatured. However, the amount of luminescence is generally quite low. Therefore, is it possible that water is needed for enzyme activity? Can the authors exclude this possibility? If they cannot, I suggest that they show directly that luciferase is denatured, for example by using dyes that bind to exposed hydrophobic regions.</p><p>2) I think that yeast prions are not a good model for looking at how desiccation affects protein aggregation. The reason is that, in their yeast strains, the prion proteins are already in an aggregated state. Therefore, the authors can only look at propagation and not at de novo formation of prions. So what is the authors explanation for how trehalose affects [<italic>PSI</italic><sup>+</sup>] prions? They conclude: &quot;These results suggest that trehalose is more effective than Hsp12 in preventing aggregation of this cytoplasmic prion.&quot; How can the authors conclude from these data that trehalose prevents aggregation? There are fewer prions in the absence of trehalose. This suggests that trehalose promotes aggregation and/or prion propagation. One possibility is that trehalose protects the [<italic>PSI</italic><sup>+</sup>] aggregates from damage and that the prion state then gets lost from the cells in the absence of trehalose after recovery from desiccation. I think that this is very unlikely, because these aggregates are highly stable and probably not affected much by water loss. The presented data are also consistent with another scenario. The data in Figure 2C could also be explained by a synthetic lethality effect in which the [<italic>PSI</italic><sup>+</sup>] cells are more sick in the absence of trehalose (did the authors correct for cell numbers or did they only count the number of cells on adenine-deficient plates?). The same reasoning applies to the [<italic>GAR</italic><sup>+</sup>] data.</p><p>3) Why did the authors perform the in vitro assay with citrate synthase and the in vivo assay with luciferase? Luciferase misfolding and aggregation is a well-established in vitro assay for protein misfolding and aggregation. Can the authors perform an in vitro assay with luciferase to make the in vitro and in vivo data more comparable?</p><p>4) Is there a synergistic effect of trehalose and Hsp12 in the in vitro citrate synthase assay as found for luciferase expressed in yeast?</p><p>5) What is the significance of these fragmented liposomes in Figure 3B? To me it looks as if Hsp12 does not protect lipid membranes but destroys them. How do yeast membranes look in the absence/presence of Hsp12 during and after desiccation?</p><p>6) Figure 4C. These data are of poor quality. Can the authors quantify the amount of lipids? Also, can they demonstrate statistical significance? The same is true for Figure 3A.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript is dedicated to investigation of the molecular basis of desiccation tolerance in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Previously, the authors have shown that a disaccharide trehalose is necessary for the long-term desiccation tolerance but is not required for the short one. On the other hand, a previous screen for non-essential genes that are required for the short-term tolerance was not successful. Thus, the authors decided to perform a &quot;synthetically lethal&quot; screen. They used a strain that cannot produce trehalose and introduced into it deletions of about 5000 non-essential genes. These double mutants were investigated for their ability to survive short and long desiccation while being in the stationary phase. The screen has revealed three classes of mutants: 1) Inviable when subjected to short-term desiccation; 2) Inviable without application of stress; 3) Suppressors of trehalose deficient mutant subjected to long-term desiccation. This study describes the role of Hsp12, a gene from class I, in the desiccation tolerance. It is shown that trehalose and Hsp12p, a member of the hydrophilin family of proteins, are acting synergistically. Proteostatic properties of the protein and its possible interaction with membranes are investigated. In addition, the authors provide data that another member of hydrophilins, Stf2, does not play any role in the desiccation tolerance.</p><p>I think that the performed screen is potentially very useful for understanding molecular mechanisms of the desiccation tolerance in the future. I have, however, several serious concerns on validity of some conclusions drawn and on the overall novelty of the findings presented.</p><p>1) In fact, Hsp12p is a homolog of class III LEA (Late embryonic abundant) proteins in plants. There is a vast amount of literature on importance of these proteins in the draught resistance. Also in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, IDPs (Intrinsically disordered proteins) play a role in desiccation tolerance. In particular, RNAi against lea-1 and dur-1 (two members of LEA family) leads to very strong sensitivity to desiccation (Erkut at al., 2013). Moreover, there are several reports on importance of hydrophilins/LEAs for desiccation tolerance in the budding yeast (Lopez-Martinez et al., Yeast, 30, 319; Lopez-Martinez et al., 2012). Thus, the requirement of these proteins for the tolerance is well established. What is not clear, however, is the molecular function of LEAs in the living organism. Involvement in proteostasis, disaggregation of proteins, interaction with membranes and many other functions (including recently the phase separation) are proposed. Again, huge number of papers are dealing with the topic. Unfortunately, this manuscript, does not provide any additional, unambiguous information on the molecular mechanism of Hsp12p action.</p><p>2) The interaction between <italic>tps1Δ</italic> and <italic>hsp12Δ</italic> is described in purely genetic frame. Are trehalose and Hsp12p connected also biochemically? Does amount of trehalose depend on the protein? In fact, the quantitative information on amounts of Hsp12p before and during the desiccation is totally missing. Is it induced during the desiccation? If yes, on which level? Interestingly, LEA-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is the major protein that is elevated during the preconditioning of the worm for severe desiccation (Erkut at al., 2013). The authors say that the expression of Hsp12p is low. This would question the proposed non-enzymatic role of the protein in proteostasis or membrane remodeling.</p><p>3) The authors show that Hsp12p when incubated with liposomes, induces their vesiculation into nanovesicles. Or in other words, their disintegration. Does this phenomenon has anything to do with the desiccation tolerance? Without showing this process in the cell, this property of the protein remains just an interesting observation.</p><p>4) It is shown in the Figure 4 that another hydrophilin, Stf2p, is not required for the desiccation tolerance. This is in a direct contrast with a previously published paper (Lopez-Martinez et al., 2012). The authors should at least comment on this controversy.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Synergy between the small intrinsically disordered protein Hsp12 and trehalose sustain viability after desiccation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The two reviewers feel that the manuscript is significantly improved, and together with the reviewing editor, would like to publish your paper, assuming you can make the necessary revisions below.</p><p>1) It is still unclear whether Hsp12 has a membrane remodeling function in vivo or not. All they provide are in vitro experiments, the functional significance of which is unclear. They have to change the text to make this clear. For example, in the Abstract: &quot;We also identify a novel role for Hsp12 as a membrane remodeler, a protective feature not shared by another yeast hydrophilin, suggesting that sIDPs have distinct biological functions.&quot; They do not identify a function as membrane modeler in cells and they do not show whether this particular in vitro activity of Hsp12 is protective in desiccated cells. For this, they need a mutant that lacks the ability to remodel membranes that they then test in cells. Since they have not done this experiment, they have to tone down their conclusions regarding the membrane remodeling function.</p><p>2) Section headline: &quot;Hsp12 and trehalose can act synergistically in membrane proteostasis.&quot; It is unclear whether the observed effect on prion propagation is because of altered membrane proteostasis. Therefore, they have to remove any claims that the prion assay reports on membrane proteostasis or proteostasis in general.</p><p>3) &quot;Without trehalose, the [<italic>PSI</italic><sup>+</sup>] prion hyper-aggregates in mother cells suggesting that trehalose functions during desiccation as an anti-protein aggregation factor as suggested by other in vitro and in vivo studies.&quot; The authors provide no evidence for prion hyper-aggregation in mother cells. They have to remove this claim. Also, what other in vitro and in vivo studies are they referring to here?</p><p>4) Is the phenotype of <italic>HSP12</italic> based on the vesiculation of membranes? I think the authors either should provide EM images of desiccated yeast (with and without <italic>HSP12</italic>) or take out from the Abstract the claim that they provide a novel role of <italic>HSP12</italic> as a membrane remodeler. Very short hydration and then cryofixation with substitution could be a method. Here is the reference to a similar approach (Giddings et al., 2001, Methods Cell Biol.).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38337.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This manuscript by Kim et al. investigates the role of trehalose and the hydrophilin Hsp12 in desiccated budding yeast.

Moreover, there are several reports on importance of hydrophilins/LEAs for desiccation tolerance in the budding yeast (Lopez-Martinez et al., Yeast, 30, 319; Lopez-Martinez et al., 2012). Thus, the requirement of these proteins for the tolerance is well established. What is not clear, however, what is the molecular function of LEAs in the living organism. Involvement in proteostasis, disaggregation of proteins, interaction with membranes and many other functions (including recently the phase separation) are proposed. Again, huge number of papers are dealing with the topic. Unfortunately, this manuscript, does not provide any additional, unambiguous information on the molecular mechanism of Hsp12p action.</p></disp-quote><p>The Introduction and Discussion have been changed to address the above points as well as to differentiate the novelty of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The interaction between tps1Δ and hsp12Δ is described in purely genetic frame. Are trehalose and Hsp12p connected also biochemically? Does amount of trehalose depend on the protein? In fact, the quantitative information on amounts of Hsp12p before and during the desiccation is totally missing. Is it induced during the desiccation? If yes, on which level? Interestingly, LEA-1 in C. elegans is the major protein that is elevated during the preconditioning of the worm for severe desiccation (Erkut at al., 2013). The authors say that the expression of Hsp12p is low. This would question the proposed non-enzymatic role of the protein in proteostasis or membrane remodeling.</p></disp-quote><p>Both trehalose and Hsp12 are regulated by the same pathway (Environmental Stress Response). We have now added protein blots demonstrating the amounts of hydrophilins (Hsp12, Stf2) in cells prior to desiccation that induce desiccation tolerance (Figure 4B). Neither Hsp12 nor trehalose are induced by the actual act of drying. In the case of wild type desiccation tolerance, yeast cells must first cells must first be in a quiescent state to be tolerant. This is shared by many anhydrobiotes; the nematode must be pre-conditioned ‘dauer’ state and the tardigrade in its pre-conditioned tun state. Expression of Hsp12 is not detected in logarithmically growing cells but induced to extremely high levels during ‘quiescence/starvation’ the preconditioning stage of yeast.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors show that Hsp12p when incubated with liposomes, induces their vesiculation into nanovesicles. Or in other words, their disintegration. Does this phenomenon has anything to do with the desiccation tolerance? Without showing this process in the cell, this property of the protein remains just an interesting observation.</p></disp-quote><p>It has proved difficult to visualize desiccated cells via microscopy (technical limitations). The vesiculation activity observed is so potent that we believe it to be an essential role of Hsp12 function. Given the phenotype of Hsp12 to confer desiccation tolerance and its synergism with trehalose, vesiculation via Hsp12 will likely play a role in desiccation tolerance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is shown in the Figure 4 that another hydrophilin, Stf2p, is not required for the desiccation tolerance. This is in a direct contrast with a previously published paper (Lopez-Martinez et al., 2012). The authors should at least comment on this controversy.</p></disp-quote><p>Desiccation tolerance assays are not quite comparable. Lopez-Martinez et al. rehydrate their dehydrated cells in 37°C media, adding another level of insult (heat shock) to their assay. This information has been added to the manuscript. Maybe Stf2 function is required under desiccated/heat shock conditions but not desiccation alone. Also, Lopez-Martinez et al. desiccate their yeast cells for only approx. 20 hours by air drying, an amount of time insufficient for cells to reach desiccation. We allow our cells a minimum of two days in the dry state via air drying to achieve full desiccation (less than two days of drying only leads to small drops in viability and intracellular content remains higher than 5%). Lopez-Martinez et al. are likely examining dehydrated and not desiccated cells.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The two reviewers feel that the manuscript is significantly improved, and together with the reviewing editor, would like to publish your paper, assuming you can make the necessary revisions below.</p><p>1) It is still unclear whether Hsp12 has a membrane remodeling function in vivo or not. All they provide are in vitro experiments, the functional significance of which is unclear. They have to change the text to make this clear. For example, in the Abstract: &quot;We also identify a novel role for Hsp12 as a membrane remodeler, a protective feature not shared by another yeast hydrophilin, suggesting that sIDPs have distinct biological functions.&quot; They do not identify a function as membrane modeler in cells and they do not show whether this particular in vitro activity of Hsp12 is protective in desiccated cells. For this, they need a mutant that lacks the ability to remodel membranes that they then test in cells. Since they have not done this experiment, they have to tone down their conclusions regarding the membrane remodeling function.</p></disp-quote><p>We have fixed our text in our paper and toned down the results. We rewrite the observation as only an in vitro observation at the time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Section headline: &quot;Hsp12 and trehalose can act synergistically in membrane proteostasis.&quot; It is unclear whether the observed effect on prion propagation is because of altered membrane proteostasis. Therefore, they have to remove any claims that the prion assay reports on membrane proteostasis or proteostasis in general.</p></disp-quote><p>We have fixed the text. Instead of membrane proteostasis, it is rewritten as “Hsp12 and trehalose act synergistically to propagate a membrane prion”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) &quot;Without trehalose, the [PSI<sup>+</sup>] prion hyper-aggregates in mother cells suggesting that trehalose functions during desiccation as an anti-protein aggregation factor as suggested by other in vitro and in vivo studies.&quot; The authors provide no evidence for prion hyper-aggregation in mother cells. They have to remove this claim. Also, what other in vitro and in vivo studies are they referring to here?</p></disp-quote><p>The sentence has been removed from text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Is the phenotype of HSP12 based on the vesiculation of membranes? I think the authors either should provide EM images of desiccated yeast (with and without HSP12) or take out from the Abstract the claim that they provide a novel role of HSP12 as a membrane remodeler. Very short hydration and then cryofixation with substitution could be a method. Here is the reference to a similar approach (Giddings et al., 2001, Methods Cell Biol.).</p></disp-quote><p>We have fixed our text in our paper and toned down the results.
