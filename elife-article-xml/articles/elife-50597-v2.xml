Gap junctions allow free (though gated) movement of ions and small signaling molecules between the cytoplasm of the connected cells, resulting in electrical coupling and the propagation of signals such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves. Like in vertebrates, where gap junctions are formed from unrelated proteins called connexins, each invertebrate gap junction consists of two innexin hemichannels, each of which is a hexamer of constituent subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Phelan and Starich, 2001</xref>). The innexin families can be relatively large; for example, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, where innexins were originally identified, has 25 innexin genes. Different family members have distinct expression patterns, distinct gating properties, and differ in their ability to form homo- or hetero-hexamers and homo- or heterotypic gap junctions with specific partner hemichannels. There is thus enormous potential for variety, as well as asymmetry (rectification) in the relationships between partner cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hall, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Palacios-Prado et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Phelan et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In addition to their roles in gap junctions, the constituent hemichannels can also function independently as gated channels connecting the cell’s cytoplasm with the exterior. Hemichannels have been shown to be gated by a variety of stimuli, including changes in extracellular pH, Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, or mechanical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hervé and Derangeon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sáez et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed, the vertebrate homologues of innexins, the pannexins, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baranova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bruzzone et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yen and Saier, 2007</xref>), are thought to function exclusively as channels (i.e. pannexons), not as gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sosinsky et al., 2011</xref>). Humans have three pannexin genes, and it is becoming increasingly evident that they play an important role in a wide range of medically significant processes, such as apoptosis, inflammation, ischemia and tumour genesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chiu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">MacVicar and Thompson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Penuela et al., 2013</xref>), as well as neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jeon and Youn, 2015</xref>). Given the homology between innexins and pannexins, <italic>C. elegans</italic> represents an amenable system in which to gain a greater understanding of these ‘hemichannel’ functions, as well as the role of gap junctions in the organisation and function of neuronal circuits.</p><p>Perhaps the best characterized innexin genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are <italic>unc-7</italic> and <italic>unc-9</italic>. Mutations in these genes were originally identified based on the uncoordinated locomotion phenotype caused by loss of UNC-7 or UNC-9 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brenner, 1974</xref>). Both genes are expressed in ventral cord motorneurons and the premotor interneurons that promote forward or backward crawling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altun et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Starich et al., 2009</xref>). Heterotypic gap junctions between these premotor interneurons and motorneurons are important for controlling the balance between forward and backward locomotion as well as promoting coordinated sinusoidal locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kawano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Starich et al., 2009</xref>). They also play a central role in the regulation of sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, UNC-7 has been shown to function as a hemichannel in motorneurons to promote neuromuscular activity through regulation of presynaptic excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouhours et al., 2011</xref>). UNC-7 has also been shown to function in the sensory circuit involved in nose touch, most likely through gap junctions in a hub-and-spoke electrical circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chatzigeorgiou and Schafer, 2011</xref>). Both UNC-7 and UNC-9 are expressed in many additional neurons, where their functions have not been investigated.</p><p>Among the cells that express <italic>unc-7</italic> and <italic>unc-9</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Starich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altun et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhattacharya et al., 2019</xref>) are the sensory neurons mediating gentle and harsh body touch. Six neurons (referred to as TRNs or gentle touch neurons) are involved in sensing gentle touch: the ventral AVM and PVM, and lateral pairs of ALMs and PLMs. A mechanosensory complex including the DEG/ENaC channel subunits MEC-4 and MEC-10 is required for gentle touch responses in all these neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bianchi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bounoutas and Chalfie, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schafer, 2015</xref>). The anterior touch neurons form a putative gap junction-coupled electrical network, with ALML and ALMR coupled to AVM, as well as to the locomotion circuit via AVDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hall and Russell, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Varshney et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">White et al., 1986</xref>). In contrast, the posterior TRNs are not gap junction coupled, though they do make gap junctions with other neurons. The PVD neurons, which sense harsh body touch, also express both <italic>unc-7</italic> and <italic>unc-9</italic> but the extent to which they form gap junctions is unclear. While gap junctions were not detected previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Varshney et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">White et al., 1986</xref>), this may be due to their complex, branched morphology; more recent analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cook et al., 2019</xref>) identified a few gap junctions with motorneurons. Since pannexin one has been demonstrated to function as mechanosensitive, ATP releasing channels in multiple cellular contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beckel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Furlow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Richter et al., 2014</xref>), this might suggest a role for innexin hemichannels in mechanotransduction in the PVDs and the TRNs.</p><p>In this study, we characterise the roles of two innexin subunits, UNC-7 and UNC-9, in <italic>C. elegans</italic> touch neurons. Both UNC-7 and UNC-9 are required for gap junction communication between the anterior TRNs, creating an electrically-coupled network that ensures a robust response to stimuli applied to either side of the animal. In addition, UNC-7 hemichannels play an essential role in gentle touch mechanosensation in both the anterior and posterior TRNs as well as harsh touch sensation in the PVD polymodal nociceptors. Heterologous expression of UNC-7a hemichannels in mechanically insensitive amphid neurons ASK or ASJ confers the ability to respond to nose touch, indicating that UNC-7a is sufficient as well as necessary to generate a mechanosensor. Since mouse pannexin one can functionally complement an <italic>unc-7</italic> null mutation, our results may suggest conserved functions of pannexins and innexins in other mechanosensory tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Innexins are required for mechanosensation and electrical coupling of touch neurons</title><p>At least three innexin genes – <italic>inx-7</italic>, <italic>unc-7</italic> and <italic>unc-9 –</italic> have been shown to be expressed in the TRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altun et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Starich et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore used RNAi to investigate the role of these genes in mechanosensory activity. Since global knockdown could potentially have complex consequences, we used RNAi constructs expressed under the <italic>Pmec-7</italic> promoter, which drives strong touch neuron expression, to inactivate each innexin gene and imaged neuronal touch responses using a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kerr et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Suzuki et al., 2003</xref>).

To investigate the importance of these electrical synapses in touch neuron activity, we first examined the consequences of laser ablating AVM, which would disrupt gap junction communication between ALML and ALMR. In wild type unablated animals, ALM responded robustly to ipsilateral (i.e. the left side for ALML) or contralateral (i.e. the right side for ALML) stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). However, when AVM was ablated, ALM responded robustly only to ipsilateral stimuli.

We observed that knockdown of <italic>unc-9</italic> almost entirely abolished responses to contralateral stimuli but had little effect on responses to ipsilateral stimuli, suggesting that UNC-9 is an important constituent of the gap junctions coupling the ALMs through AVM. Consistent with this possibility, the combined effect of <italic>unc-9</italic> RNAi and AVM ablation was not significantly different from either <italic>unc-9</italic> RNAi alone or AVM ablation alone in either ipsilateral or contralateral neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). A loss-of-function mutant in <italic>unc-9</italic> showed a similar phenotype, with normal responses in ipsilateral neurons but reduced responses in contralateral neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, disrupting gap junction communication appears functionally analogous to disrupting <italic>unc-9</italic>, supporting the hypothesis that <italic>unc-9</italic> plays an essential role in gap junction communication between the TRNs, and that this is perhaps its sole function in the TRNs. In contrast, <italic>unc-7</italic> RNAi significantly disrupted the responses in ALM to both ipsilateral and contralateral stimuli, suggesting that UNC-7 is required for mechanosensation per se, rather than simply contributing to gap junctions. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> shows, <italic>unc-7</italic> RNAi also severely disrupts responses in AVM, even when the stimulus was applied close to the AVM dendrite. Together, these results indicate that <italic>unc-7</italic> is required for robust mechanosensory responses in all three anterior TRNs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The mechanosensory function of UNC-7 is gap junction-independent</title><p>In principle, the mechanosensory defects seen in the anterior touch receptor neurons could result from changes in excitability due to a lack of UNC-7-containing gap junctions; alternatively, UNC-7-containing hemichannels could have a distinct, gap-junction-independent role in mechanosensation. To address these possibilities, we first investigated touch responses in the posterior TRNs PLML and PLMR, which are not connected by gap junctions, either directly or indirectly via PVM. In wild type animals, PLM responses to ipsilateral stimuli were extremely robust (nearly 100% responding), while less than half of contralateral stimuli generated responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that the coordinated responses of the anterior TRNs are indeed gap-junction-dependent. When we measured responses in <italic>unc-7</italic> RNAi animals, we observed defective responses to both ipsilateral and contralateral stimuli, as seen previously for the anterior TRNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, <italic>unc-7</italic> appears to be required for the response in the posterior TRNs, despite their lack of gap junction interconnectivity.</p><p>Formation of gap junctions by innexins has been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouhours et al., 2011</xref>) to require four cysteines at the inter-hemichannel interface of UNC-7. When these residues are mutated, the innexin protein's ability to form functional gap junctions is disrupted, but its hemichannel function is intact. We therefore examined whether a ‘cysless’ mutant allele of <italic>unc-7</italic> could rescue the <italic>unc-7</italic> mechanosensory defect in touch neurons. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref> shows, ALM gentle touch responses are severely disrupted in <italic>unc-7(e5)</italic> animals, as we observed previously for <italic>unc-7</italic> RNAi. Expression of a wild type <italic>unc-7</italic> cDNA (isoform a, also known as UNC-7L <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Starich et al., 2009</xref>) under the control of the <italic>mec-4</italic> promoter significantly rescued this defect. In contrast to <italic>Pmec-7</italic>, which we used for RNAi and is expressed in various neurons in addition to the TRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mitani et al., 1993</xref>), <italic>Pmec-4</italic> expression is exclusively TRN-specific.

This suggests that UNC-7 overexpression only partially compensates for loss of MEC-4, leading only to local depolarization of the ALM axon.

When we expressed the cysless <italic>unc-7</italic> transgene in ASJ, we observed small but significant nose touch responses that were absent in the ASJ neurons of wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E,F</xref>). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that UNC-7 hemichannels are sufficient to form a mechanosensor, though we cannot rule out the possibility that heterologous UNC-7 expression enhances an endogenous touch-sensitive response that is undetectable in wild-type neurons. In either case, UNC-7 may require few if any additional specific factors to carry out its mechanosensory function, whereas MEC-4 appears to require additional proteins to generate a mechanotransduction complex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>UNC-7 hemichannels function specifically in mechanosensation</title><p>We have shown here that the innexin UNC-7 plays an essential role in the response to gentle touch, and that this mechanosensory function is likely mediated by hemichannels rather than gap junctions. Several lines of evidence support these conclusions. First, loss of <italic>unc-7</italic> function affects touch responses to ipsilateral stimuli as well as to contralateral stimuli, implying its role is not merely in indirect activation through gap junctions. Second, <italic>unc-7</italic> mutations lead to mechanosensory defects in neurons such as the PLMs, which are not known to be connected by gap junctions, and this may also be the case for the PVDs. Third, an <italic>unc-7</italic> transgene containing mutations that render it incapable of gap junction formation still effectively rescues the <italic>unc-7</italic> touch-insensitive phenotype. Our observation that <italic>unc-7</italic> functions affects mechanosensory, but not thermosensory responses in the PVD polymodal nociceptors, coupled with the fact that <italic>unc-7</italic> does not impair channelrhodopsin-mediated excitation of the TRNs, provide evidence that the UNC-7 hemichannels specifically affect mechanosensory transduction rather than general neuronal excitability. Heterologous expression of UNC-7 hemichannels in two other neuron classes, ASK and ASJ also suggested a specific role in mechanotransduction.</p><p>How might UNC-7 contribute to mechanotransduction in the touch neurons and PVD nociceptors? Perhaps the simplest hypothesis is that UNC-7 hemichannels are themselves mechanically-gated ion channels whose opening contributes to the mechanoreceptor potential. Consistent with this possibility, pannexin 1, a mammalian homologue of UNC-7 that functionally complements its touch phenotype in worms, has been shown to form mechanosensitive channels when expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bao et al., 2004</xref>). However, although heterologously-expressed UNC-7 (in the cysless mutant form) appears to have channel activity, the potential mechanosensitivity of these channels was not reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouhours et al., 2011</xref>). Alternatively, UNC-7 hemichannels might play an accessory role in mechanosensation; for example, they might amplify the mechanoreceptor potential, or modulate the primary mechanotransducer by mediating transient changes in calcium or other messengers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vanden Abeele et al., 2006</xref>). In the future, physiological characterization of UNC-7 hemichannel properties may distinguish between these hypotheses.</p><p>Although these results are the first to implicate UNC-7 as a mechanosensory molecule, other results are consistent with a role for innexins in <italic>C. elegans</italic> touch sensing. For example, it was shown recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sangaletti et al., 2014</xref>) that the TRNs express a mechanically gated current with innexin-like physiological and pharmacological properties. However, the mechanically gated currents that they identified are intact in <italic>unc-7(e5)</italic> animals, indicating that UNC-7 is not an essential component of this particular current (R. Sangaletti and L. Bianchi, personal communication). It is unclear how the pneumatic pressure stimulus used in these studies relates to externally-applied gentle touch, and one possibility is that different mechanically sensitive innexins function over different sensitivity ranges.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>UNC-7 and MEC-4 function independently in touch neurons</title><p>Unexpectedly, we have found that two ion channels, UNC-7 and MEC-4, are both required for normal touch responses in the TRNs; loss-of-function of either UNC-7 or MEC-4 alone leads to significant touch insensitivity. Nonetheless, several lines of evidence suggest that UNC-7 and MEC-4 function independently in the touch neurons, rather than functioning together in a common mechanotansduction complex. First, although both UNC-7 and MEC-4 proteins are distributed in a punctate pattern along the TRN dendrite, UNC-7- and MEC-4-containing puncta do not colocalize, and therefore appear to represent physically-distinct complexes. Second, although <italic>unc-7</italic> and <italic>mec-4</italic> single mutants both are insensitive to gentle touch, overexpression of <italic>mec-4</italic> can suppress the <italic>unc-7</italic> defect, while <italic>unc-7</italic> overexpression can partially suppress the gentle touch defect of <italic>mec-4</italic>. Third, <italic>mec-4</italic> and <italic>unc-7</italic> mutations have distinct phenotypes with respect to harsh touch responses in the TRNs; <italic>unc-7</italic> affects and is required for large, long-lasting <italic>mec-4</italic> independent responses, whereas <italic>mec-4</italic> is required for small, transient responses that resemble responses to gentle touch. Thus, although the activities of both UNC-7 and MEC-4 appear to be essential for sensitivity to weaker stimuli, they function at least somewhat redundantly in the response to stronger stimuli such as harsh touch.</p><p>What does this imply about the function of UNC-7 in mechanosensation? One possibility is that UNC-7 and MEC-4 are each mechanically-sensitive channels that respond to qualitatively distinct types of mechanical stimulation. MEC-4, for example, is believed to be tethered to both the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnadóttir and Chalfie, 2010</xref>), whereas UNC-7, like the bacterial Msc, might directly sense membrane tension via lipid interactions, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kung et al., 2010</xref>). These different force detection mechanisms might in principle confer distinct biomechanical properties, resulting in specificity in the precise mechanical forces to which they respond. If neuronal response to gentle stimuli requires coincident activation of both UNC-7 and MEC-4, due to summing of these distinct inputs, this might also serve to filter out noise and improve the fidelity of response to small but behaviourally significant stimuli. In this context, it is interesting to note the recent demonstration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Servin-Vences et al., 2017</xref>) that both TRPV4 and PIEZO are required for mechanosensation in chondrocytes, and that they appear to function in distinct ways: PIEZO responds to membrane stretch, while TRPV4 appears to rely on tensile forces transmitted via the matrix.</p><p>Alternatively, UNC-7 might not itself be a mechanosensitive channel, but rather might modulate touch neuron responses by amplifying mechanoreceptor potentials or locally enhancing excitability. This accessory function might be essential to enhance MEC-4-dependent gentle touch responses, but partially dispensable, at least in the presence of MEC-4, for responses to stronger harsh touch stimuli. According to this model, UNC-7 overexpression might suppress the <italic>mec-4</italic> gentle touch phenotype by sensitizing or enhancing the <italic>mec-4</italic>-independent harsh touch mechanotransducer in the TRNs. Interestingly, UNC-7 appears to be necessary for the slow and prolonged time course typically observed in harsh touch responses; thus, perhaps this property results from prolonged opening of UNC-7 channels following the stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Coordination of the anterior TRNs via gap junctions</title><p>In addition to its role in mechanosensation, UNC-7, along with UNC-9, also contributes to gap junctions that functionally link the anterior TRNs. In the locomotion circuit, for example in the electrical synapses between the AVB premotor interneurons and the B-class motorneurons, UNC-7 and UNC-9-containing gap junctions appear to be asymmetric, with UNC-7 expressed in AVB and UNC-9 expressed in B motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Starich et al., 2009</xref>). Likewise, UNC-7 and UNC-9 also form heterotypic gap junctions between AVA and A motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kawano et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, in the touch neurons, both innexins have been reported to be expressed in both AVM and ALM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altun et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Starich et al., 2009</xref>), and the <italic>unc-7</italic> mechanosensory phenotypes likewise imply expression in both ALM and AVM. Thus, for the ALM-AVM gap junctions, it seems likely that UNC-7 and UNC-9 contribute in both partner cells. Unlike UNC-7, the role of UNC-9 appears to be confined to gap junctions, since <italic>unc-9</italic> mutations (like AVM ablations) only affect responses to contralateral stimuli. It is interesting that an analogous cooperative organisation (i.e. connection of PLML and PLMR via PVM) does not exist for the posterior TRNs, and our hypothesis that this results in a functionally distinct network is corroborated by our demonstration that PLM responses are significantly less robust when the neurons are far from the stimulation site. The difference in organisation presumably reflects the dominance of forward locomotion, and thus the greater selective pressure on the avoidance of anterior aversive stimuli.</p><p>An important feature of any sensorimotor circuit must be to ensure that a given stimulus elicits an appropriate behavioural response. Encountering an innocuous obstacle requires a distinct response (brushing against it or a steering change) compared to a noxious stimulus (a rapid avoidance movement). We have seen previously in the nose touch circuit that electrical connections between sensory neurons can play an important role; when OLQ and CEP are activated by gentle nose touch, they facilitate gentle touch responses in FLP, which otherwise only responds to harsh touch, whereas if OLQ and CEP are inactive, they inhibit the activity of FLP through shunting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chatzigeorgiou and Schafer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rabinowitch et al., 2013</xref>). Since the FLPs provide the link to the premotor interneurons, the result is that only a harsh stimulus or a broad gentle stimulus generates an escape response, whereas more localised gentle stimuli generate distinct behaviours (head withdrawal; food slowing), depending on which of these neurons are stimulated. The case of the anterior gentle touch neurons is different, in that all three (ALML, ALMR, AVM) synapse directly onto premotor neurons. Nevertheless, an attractive hypothesis is that a similar electrically-coupled circuit amplifies the behavioural response when all anterior touch neurons are coincidently activated.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>UNC-7 plays genetically-distinct roles in gap junctions and mechanosensory hemichannels</title><p>Although UNC-7 appears to function in both gap junctions and mechanosensory hemichannels, these two functions are genetically separable. For example, we have shown that whereas the L isoform of UNC-7 can rescue the mechanosensory defect of <italic>unc-7(e5)</italic>, the shorter SR isoform fails to rescue. Conversely, others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Starich et al., 2009</xref>) have shown that UNC-7SR and S can restore gap junction activity in the locomotion circuit, whereas UNC-7L could not rescue gap junction-dependent behavioural phenotypes and that UNC-7L could not produce gap junction currents in vitro. Since UNC-7L has been shown to form hemichannels when expressed in neuro2A cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouhours et al., 2011</xref>), this suggests a distinction between isoforms, with UNC-7SR and S being required for gap junctions, while UNC-7L is capable of forming hemichannels that participate in mechanosensation. The three isoforms differ only in the length of the N-terminal cytoplasmic region (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Starich et al., 2009</xref> for full details). The N-terminal region that is unique to UNC-7L is rich in proline, indicating a potential role in interaction with WW domain-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kay et al., 2000</xref>), and several other amino acid repeats that are suggestive of protein interaction motifs. Thus, this extended domain might mediate differential localisation or trafficking of UNC-7, or alternatively could interfere, either directly or through inter-protein interactions, with assembly into gap junctions. It is interesting to note that UNC-7L is the only isoform expressed in the ALM, AVM and PVD neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Starich et al., 2009</xref>), while reporters specific for the shorter forms or lacking UNC-7L-specific upstream elements lack some or all mechanosensory neuron expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altun et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhattacharya et al., 2019</xref>). Likewise, recent evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhattacharya et al., 2019</xref>) indicates that UNC-7 is expressed in ASK, and yet this neuron is mechanically insensitive, and can be rendered mechanically sensitive by expression of UNC-7. A logical explanation for this apparent paradox would be that the isoform natively expressed in ASK is the shorter UNC-7SR (or UNC-7S). If UNC-7L is indeed the only isoform that plays a role in mechanosensation, this unique domain could also hold the key to understanding the molecular basis of this function.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Functional conservation of UNC-7 with mammalian pannexins</title><p>Intriguingly, we observed that the mechanosensory function of <italic>unc-7</italic> could be complemented by a mammalian homologue, the <italic>Panx1</italic> pannexin gene. Expression of a mouse <italic>Panx1</italic> transgene fully rescued the touch-insensitive defect of an <italic>unc-7</italic> null mutant, indicating strong functional conservation across a large phylogenetic distance. Although pannexins have not been directly implicated in touch or other somatosensory processes in vertebrates, Panx1 has been shown to be mechanically sensitive, mediating the release of ATP in a variety of cell types in response to membrane stretch. Our finding of a role for UNC-7, and its functional complementation by Panx1, suggests the possibility that pannexins might play undiscovered roles in touch or other mechanical senses in vertebrates.</p><p>Pannexins have been implicated in a huge array of medical conditions, including ischaemia-induced seizure, inflammation, hypertension, tumour formation and metastasis, and neuropathic pain, and are thus an important target for therapeutic intervention. A significant obstacle is their involvement in so many functions, requiring a deep understanding of these roles in order to intervene specifically.

The nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> dedicates a remarkable proportion of its nerve cells (at least ~10%) to perceiving such mechanical stimuli. Worms exhibit conserved molecular machineries for mechanosensation, like channel complexes of the DEG/ENaC and TRP families. Vertebrates also employ hemichannels of the pannexin family for mechanosensation; their invertebrate relatives, the innexins, however, were thought to act primarily as gap junctions. Here, Walker and Schafer show that the major innexins in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, termed UNC-7 and UNC-9, might serve indeed such dual roles. They report evidence suggesting that UNC-9 is involved in electrical coupling in a network of a few touch receptor neurons (TRNs), while UNC-7 also exhibits the role as a mechanosensitive hemichannel in TRNs. Strikingly, the <italic>unc-7</italic> gene can be functionally substituted with the vertebrate pannexin gene <italic>Panx1</italic>, suggesting a common mechanism for mechanosensation shared between innexins and pannexins.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Distinct roles for innexin gap junctions and hemichannels in mechanosensation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Mei Zhen (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript Walker and Shafer study a potential role of the innexin <italic>unc-7</italic> gene in <italic>C. elegans</italic> mechanosensation. Based on their results they propose that <italic>unc-7</italic> might serve as a hemichannel directly involved in primary sensory transduction, either alone or in complex with other yet un-identified components. In their model, innexin genes serve two roles in anterior touch receptive neurons (TRNs). (1) integration of bilaterally received stimuli via a gap junction network of ALMR-AVM-ALML, and (2) direct mechanosensation via <italic>unc-7</italic> hemichannels. They collect support for this model via tissue specific dsRNAi and transgenic rescue experiments. Their model finds the strongest support in their finding that a mutant <italic>unc-7</italic> variant, previously shown incapable of electrical coupling (&quot;cysless <italic>unc-7</italic>&quot;), can rescue some of the mechanosensory defects of <italic>unc-7</italic> null mutants. Moreover, <italic>unc-7</italic> is not required for TRN excitability via ChR2 activation suggesting specificity. Ectopic expression of <italic>unc-7</italic> renders ASK neurons mechanosensitive, suggesting sufficiency in the ASK context. Interestingly, <italic>unc-7</italic> function can be rescued with a mammalian <italic>pannexin1</italic> gene (there is some evidence in the literature that <italic>pannexin1</italic> might function as a stretch sensitive hemichannel). Direct electrophysiological and biophysical evidence that UNC-7 is indeed a hemichannel or mechanosensitive is missing in this study, therefore in the evidence is indirect. However, in total many lines of indirect come together to support the major claims. The results are surprising, considering that <italic>unc-7</italic> expression encompasses a large portion of the worm's nervous system and that it was typically seen as a major gap junction gene. The work has impact on the interpretation of previous studies, assuming a sole role for <italic>unc-7</italic> in electrical coupling. Moreover, it paves way for interesting future work studying how <italic>unc-7</italic> exactly confers mechanosensitivity.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reviewer 1. The authors rely on previous gene expression studies (e.g. Althun, 2009), however, these data have been outdated by a recent state of the art expression study using fosmid reporters (Bhattacharya, 2019). Here, <italic>unc-7</italic> seems not to be expressed in AVM and ALM in adult animals. This is confusing, and the authors ignore this recent study, not even citing it. Since the authors' conclusions strongly depend on endogenous <italic>unc-7</italic> expression in anterior TRNs and since this seems controversial now it is necessary to validate expression of <italic>unc-7</italic> in AVM and ALM in adult animals using proper reporter constructs, showing that they overlap with a well characterized TRN marker.</p><p>2) Reviewer 1. <italic>unc-7</italic> and <italic>unc-9</italic> are expressed in many neurons of the worm and ALM and AVM form gap junctions with other neurons, therefore non-cell autonomous effects of their gene knock-downs need to be controlled for. The authors apply a cell specific dsRNAi technique. dsRNAi, however, potentially could spread from cell-to-cell (e.g. Jose et al., 2009, PNAS). Since the author's interpretations strongly depend on the assumption of TRN-specific knockdown, additional controls are needed. The most straight forward control would be to rescue the RNAi phenotype with a codon altered RNAi insensitive transgene in TRNs.</p><p>2b) Reviewer 2. The key evidence here was that RNAi against UNC-9 in TRN showed modest or no change in the calcium response of ALM and PLM, in contrast to the drastic effect of RNAi against UNC-7. My concern is the lack of information or control experiments that demonstrate the specificity of UNC-7 RNAi, and the robustness of UNC-9 RNAi. Both were driven by the same promoter. There is sequence similarity between the two cDNAs. It was unclear which 600bp sequences were selected for each innexin to address their specificity and efficiency. One useful control would be to compare the effect of both RNAi driven pan-neuronally, on how effective they are to mimic the phenotypes of <italic>unc-7</italic> or <italic>unc-9</italic> mutants.</p><p>3) Reviewer 1. I find the AVM requirement for contralateral ALM responses quite interesting; this important result goes a bit under in the Discussion. However, in the remaining experiments shown in Figure 2, the authors claim a differential effect in <italic>unc-9</italic> and <italic>unc-7</italic> mutants. They argue that <italic>unc-9</italic> mutation has a specific effect on contralateral responses while <italic>unc-7</italic> affects both, ipsilateral as well as contralateral responses. They conclude right away that <italic>unc-9</italic> is mainly involved in gap junction coupling and <italic>unc-7</italic> additionally in primary mechano-transduction. Looking at the traces in 2A and scatter graphs in 2B, these statements are somewhat on weak grounds. All manipulations in 2B seem to follow the same trend, especially when examining the scatter graphs. The authors rely solely in their p-values obtained, but to be more convincing simply more repetitions are needed. In any case, it is possible that <italic>unc-7</italic> and <italic>unc-9</italic> function in a very similar manner, simply dsRNAi could be differentially effective. Without controlling that both are complete knockdowns, the authors should be more careful with concluding differential roles for <italic>unc-7</italic> vs. <italic>unc-9</italic>.</p><p>4) Reviewer 2. I found some results here hard to interpret. In <italic>unc-7</italic> mutants, all touch response was abolished, including the response to harsh touch by all TRNs and PVD. MEC-4 specifically affects gentle touch and is the proposed gentle touch sensor. It is difficult to envision why overexpression of MEC-4 could robustly bypass the requirement of UNC-7, especially in the harsh touch response (and I am not sure if authors addressed this directly). A simpler interpretation of these results is that the expression of cation leak channels (at ER or plasma membranes) changes a neuron's intrinsic property. If authors have attempted to address if MEC-4 can specifically rescue the harsh touch-mediated response in PVD and ALM in the <italic>unc-7</italic> mutants. MEC-4 is not responsible for harsh-touch mediated (behavioral response at least). If MEC-4 overexpression still rescues, then it is more likely that the cation leak non-specifically changed PVD's sensitivity to mechanical stimulation.</p><p>5) Reviewer 2. Authors should address the impact of a recent paper (Bhattacharya et al., 2019), which suggest that both UNC-7 and UNC-9 are endogenously expressed in ASK, on the interpretation of this experiment. Calcium-imaging results from this experiment appeared highly variable (Figure 7A, B). An overexpression of UNC-7 may alter ASK's property, and its network property (e.g. altering the strength of GJ coupling with other neurons in the case of both overexpressing wild-type or Cysless UNC-7). The authors may want to select another neuron that does not have UNC-7 expression to test their hypothesis again.</p><p>6) Reviewer 3. Please discuss a potential for controversy with previously published data: one of the major questions that remained unanswered, and to my surprise aren't even discussed, is the following: If <italic>unc-7</italic> acts independently of <italic>mec-4</italic>, why isn't there any evidence of mechanoreceptor current in the absence of <italic>mec-4</italic> in electrophysciological recordings (e.g. Ohagan et al). Also, no calcium transients were observed in <italic>mec-4</italic> null mutants in other works (Nekimken et al., 2017), even with Ca indicators superior to the one used in this present study. A potential explanation would be that <italic>unc-7</italic> is only able to generate local transients and thus remain undetectable for stimuli far away from the cell body, however, in previous studies neither were current or transients recorded after stimuli close to the cell body.</p><p>7) Reviewer 3. <italic>mec-7p</italic> is not specific to touch receptor neuron but also expressed in head neurons and probably PVD. Thus, the statement of cell-specificity needs to be toned down and concerns arise that the observed effects are due to defect in inx of other neurons. The authors addressed this in parts by using a <italic>mec-4p</italic> construct already.</p><p>8) Reviewer 3. How often has the same animal been tested? Are there still calcium signals in animals lacking <italic>mec-4</italic> under the presented experimental conditions for gentle touch? How do the authors distinguish between these two modalities – any quantitation would help to reconcile their conclusion.</p><p>9) Reviewer 3. In previously published data, deletion of <italic>mec-4</italic> still causes a response to gentle touch (e.g. Vasquez, Cell Reports, 2014 or Nekimken, 2017) but seems to habituate after the first or second touch. This is puzzling as no mechanoreceptor currents could be measured using electrophysiology or visualized in dendrites with calcium reporter. The authors also report behavioral response in the <italic>mec-4</italic> mutation, consistent with a function of another channel in this response – did they try the <italic>mec-4/unc-7</italic> double mutation to see if the animals did not respond at all?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50597.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reviewer 1.

The expression of <italic>unc-7</italic> in anterior touch neurons (specifically the long form) was reported in Starich et al., which used a cosmid-based reporter which (based on physical maps; the 5’ breakpoint of neither construct has been precisely determined) contained even more upstream sequence than the fosmid-based construct used by Bhattacharya. The expression pattern was specifically shown in that paper to mirror the staining pattern of an anti-<italic>unc-7</italic> antibody. Bhattacharya also did not report expression in some other neurons that expressed long form-specific reporters in the Starich manuscript. Thus, we suspect that the Bhattacharya construct lacks some upstream elements necessary for expression of the long form of <italic>unc-7</italic>. Single cell transcriptional profiling (Cao et al., 2017) also provides evidence that <italic>unc-7</italic> is expressed in the TRNs. We note that the fact that touch neuron-specific RNAi experiments (but not off-target controls) phenocopy the <italic>unc-7</italic> loss-of-function mutant, which also implies that <italic>unc-7</italic> is endogenously expressed in touch neurons. It is interesting that according to the Starich paper PVD also expresses only the long-form of <italic>unc-7</italic>, which we show to be the only isoform of <italic>unc-7</italic> rescues mechanosensory phenotypes.</p><p>We have fixed the citations in the Introduction (fourth paragraph) and added a discussion of the expression patterns of various isoforms and reporters (including the results of Bhattacharya) and their relation to mechanosensory activity (subsection “UNC-7 plays genetically-distinct roles in gap junctions and mechanosensory hemichannels”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Reviewer 1. unc-7 and unc-9 are expressed in many neurons of the worm and ALM and AVM form gap junctions with other neurons, therefore non-cell autonomous effects of their gene knock-downs need to be controlled for.

This is consistent with our expectations since the SID complex required for intracellular uptake of small RNAs (Jose et al., 2009) is not expressed in neurons (Winston et al., 2002), and other investigators have found RNAi to act cell-specifically within the nervous system (Esposito et al., 2007 and many papers citing this).</p><p>We note also that the cell-specificity of the mechanosensory phenotypes in ALM (Figure 3) and PVD (Figure 4) were also shown by cell-specific rescue of the <italic>unc-7(e5)</italic> loss-of-function mutant.

We have also edited the description of the initial RNAi results to avoid giving the impression that we are claiming this is evidence of a cell-autonomous role in the TRNs (subsection “The mechanosensory function of UNC-7 is gap junction-independent”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2b) Reviewer 2.

We have included the primer sequences in the Materials and methods (subsection “Plasmid constructs”). Contiguous sequence conservation between <italic>unc-7</italic> and <italic>unc-9</italic> is not substantial; for the <italic>unc-7</italic> construct, the longest contiguous stretch of conserved bases is 9, for <italic>unc-9</italic> it is 17.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Reviewer 1.

As outlined in the response to reviewer 2, comment 2b above, the <italic>unc-9(e101)</italic> mutant (revised Figure 2) shows the same phenotype as <italic>unc-9</italic> RNAi. We confined our statistical comparisons to the proportion responding because we were concerned that disruption of gap junctions could have confounding effects (i.e. a lack of shunting through gap junctions might result in an increase in amplitude) which could mask the low proportion of responders.</p><p>The role of <italic>unc-9</italic> in touch neuron gap junction connectivity has indeed been somewhat ignored in the Discussion! We have inserted an additional section (subsection “Coordination of the anterior TRNs via gap junctions”) and reorganised the section headings to address this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Reviewer 2. I found some results here hard to interpret. In unc-7 mutants, all touch response was abolished, including the response to harsh touch by all TRNs and PVD. MEC-4 specifically affects gentle touch and is the proposed gentle touch sensor.

If MEC-4 overexpression still rescues, then it is more likely that the cation leak non-specifically changed PVD's sensitivity to mechanical stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. We have tried the experiment suggested by the reviewer in the TRNs and found that <italic>mec-4</italic> overexpression does not rescue the harsh touch defect of the <italic>unc-7</italic> mutant. We have not included these data in the figure since the reciprocal experiment (overexpression of UNC-7 in a <italic>mec-4</italic> mutant) would not be meaningful given the robust harsh touch response of <italic>mec-4</italic> single mutants, but in total only 14.3% responded, all with a low amplitude “transient” response, N=14. We have not tried this experiment in PVD because neither MEC-4 nor many of its required cofactors (e.g. MEC-9) are natively expressed there and it would therefore be difficult to interpret the results.</p><p>We agree that the <italic>mec-4</italic> overexpression results do not argue conclusively that UNC-7 itself is a MEC-4-independent mechanotransduction channel. In the revision, we have modified the text in many places to clarify that UNC-7 hemichannels might play other roles in touch sensing, including as a channel that alters local excitability as suggested by the reviewer. We have particularly addressed this with regard to the overexpression experiments in the subsection “Coordination of the anterior TRNs via gap junctions”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Reviewer 2. Authors should address the impact of a recent paper (Bhattacharya et al., 2019), which suggest that both UNC-7 and UNC-9 are endogenously expressed in ASK, on the interpretation of this experiment. Calcium-imaging results from this experiment appeared highly variable (Figure 7A, B). An overexpression of UNC-7 may alter ASK's property, and its network property (e.g. altering the strength of GJ coupling with other neurons in the case of both overexpressing wild-type or Cysless UNC-7). The authors may want to select another neuron that does not have UNC-7 expression to test their hypothesis again.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we expressed UNC-7 in the ASJ neurons, one of the few chemosensory neurons that show no evidence of <italic>unc-7</italic> expression in the Bhattacharya paper. We did observe small but significant nose touch responses in the <italic>unc-7</italic>-expressing lines that were absent in control animals. These results have been added to revised Figure 7. Since these responses were small and therefore not inconsistent with other interpretations, we have added a caveat in the subsection “Heterologous expression of UNC-7 hemichannels in olfactory neurons confers touch sensitivity”. As we have shown that at least one of the shorter <italic>unc-7</italic> isoforms does not confer mechanosensitivity, expression of such an isoform in ASK may explain the native touch-insensitivity of ASK neurons (subsection “Functional conservation of UNC-7 with mammalian pannexins”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Reviewer 3. Please discuss a potential for controversy with previously published data: one of the major questions that remained unanswered, and to my surprise aren't even discussed, is the following: If unc-7 acts independently of mec-4, why isn't there any evidence of mechanoreceptor current in the absence of mec-4 in electrophysciological recordings (e.g. Ohagan et al.). Also, no calcium transients were observed in mec-4 null mutants in other works (Nekimken, 2017), even with Ca indicators superior to the one used in this present study. A potential explanation would be that unc-7 is only able to generate local transients and thus remain undetectable for stimuli far away from the cell body, however, in previous studies neither were current or transients recorded after stimuli close to the cell body.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point, and conforms quite closely to our interpretation of the results in Figure 6. Specifically, while MEC-4 overexpression was able to compensate for the cell body calcium imaging as well as the behavioural phenotype of <italic>unc-7</italic> mutants, UNC-7 overexpression did not restore cell body calcium transients to <italic>mec-4</italic> null mutants and only rescued the behavioural phenotype for stimuli applied near the animal’s neck. As suggested by the reviewer, a simple explanation of this is that UNC-7 overexpression only allows local depolarization of the ALM dendrite and that MEC-4 is necessary for cell-body responses to gentle touch. We have modified the text to make this point more explicitly (subsection “UNC-7 and MEC-4 act independently in touch neuron mechanosensation”f).</p><p>We note that while <italic>mec-4</italic> null mutants appear to lack mechanosensory responses to gentle touch in ALM, both our lab (Suzuki et al., 2003, Chatzigeorgiou et al., 2010, this study Figure 5B) and Hang Lu’s lab (Cho et al., LoC 2017, Cho et al. LoC 2018) have observed robust responses to stronger mechanical stimuli in <italic>mec-4</italic> null animals (using either cameleon or GCaMP6, and with either glued or microfluidic immobilization/stimulation). (The chip used in the Nekimken paper gave a much lower response rate even in wild-type animals than what we observe; thus this is likely to represent a very gentle stimulus; the stimulus in the O’Hagan paper on dissected animals likewise may represent a gentler stimulus.) So if <italic>unc-7</italic> encodes either another mechanosensor or a specific amplifier of mechanotransduction currents, its overexpression could potentially enhance sensitivity of those harsh touch responses. We have added a comment to this effect to the text (subsection “UNC-7 and MEC-4 function independently in touch neurons”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Reviewer 3. mec-7p is not specific to touch receptor neuron but also expressed in head neurons and probably PVD.

We have clarified this in the text (subsections “Innexins are required for mechanosensation and electrical coupling of touch neurons” and “The mechanosensory function of UNC-7 is gap junction-independent”). With regard to the cell autonomy of the <italic>unc-7</italic> mechanosensory phenotypes, as noted in the response to reviewer 1 comment 2 we have confirmed all the key experiments using an <italic>unc-7</italic> loss-of-function mutant rescued using the <italic>mec-4</italic> promoter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Reviewer 3.

In common with these previous reports, we also see a residual behavioural response in the <italic>mec-4</italic> mutant (26% respond, although the length of the reversal is substantially diminished), We carried out the experiment suggested by the reviewer, assaying the gentle touch avoidance response in <italic>mec-4</italic> null mutant animals in which <italic>unc-7</italic> was knocked down by RNAi. We observed that these <italic>mec-4/unc-7</italic> doubly-deficient animals still responded to gentle touch at frequencies similar to the <italic>mec-4</italic>-single mutant, indicating that the MEC-4-independent behavioural response is not mediated by UNC-7; this suggests a role for another neuron class in this behaviour. We have presented behavioural data in Figure 5—figure supplement 5 and discussed this in the Results section (subsection “<italic>unc-7</italic> is specifically required for mechanosensation in touch neurons and nociceptors”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
