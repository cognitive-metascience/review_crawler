computation are not yet established. Recent data indicate that cortical regions that are prominently associated with accumulating evidence, such as the posterior parietal cortex and the frontal orienting fields, may not be directly involved in this computation. Which, then, are the regions involved? Regions that are directly involved in evidence accumulation should directly influence the accumulation-based decision-making behavior, have a graded neural encoding of accumulated evidence and contribute throughout the accumulation process. Here, we investigated the role of the anterior dorsal striatum (ADS) in a rodent auditory evidence accumulation task using a combination of behavioral, pharmacological, optogenetic, electrophysiological and computational approaches. We find that the ADS is the first brain region known to satisfy the three criteria. Thus, the ADS may be the first identified node in the network responsible for evidence accumulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>decision making</kwd><kwd>striatum</kwd><kwd>rat</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH108358</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brody</surname><given-names>Carlos D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009784</institution-id><institution>Starr Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Starr Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yartsev</surname><given-names>Michael M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32MH098572</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hanks</surname><given-names>Timothy D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Behavioral, pharmacological, optogenetic, electrophysiological and computational analyses suggest that the anterior dorsal striatum is a causal node in the network responsible for evidence accumulation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>All behaving animals must interpret sensory information arriving from the environment and use that information to select future actions. How the nervous system solves this problem has been a longstanding question in neuroscience. Multiple studies across a wide range of behavioral tasks and model systems, including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hunt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krajbich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ratcliff et al., 2015</xref>), non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huk and Shadlen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shadlen and Newsome, 1996</xref>) and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carandini and Churchland, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erlich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Raposo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sanders and Kepecs, 2012</xref>) have proposed a framework through which neural circuits gradually accumulate sensory evidence to guide decisions. Yet, despite the observation of neural correlates of evidence accumulation in several brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding and Gold, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ratcliff et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shadlen and Newsome, 1996</xref>), a major challenge in this line of research has been that the neural circuits that are causally responsible for evidence accumulation have not yet been determined. Two of the cortical regions that are most prominently associated with evidence accumulation, namely the posterior parietal cortex (LIP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huk and Shadlen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kira et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roitman and Shadlen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shadlen and Newsome, 1996</xref>) and the frontal eye fields in primates (FEF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ding and Gold, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gold and Shadlen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mante et al., 2013</xref>), together with its probable rodent analogue, the frontal orienting fields (FOF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erlich et al., 2011</xref>), have been the focus of studies recently. Surprisingly, these studies have indicated that neither region is central to the computation of gradually accumulating evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erlich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katz et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The anterior dorsal striatum (ADS) serves as an intriguing alternative candidate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding and Gold, 2013</xref>), due in part to its unique anatomical positioning as a convergence hub for multiple brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheatwood et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McGeorge and Faull, 1989</xref>) where neural signatures of evidence accumulation have been observed (such as the PPC and FEF/FOF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheatwood et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding and Gold, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McGeorge and Faull, 1989</xref>). The ADS is thus ideally positioned to participate in evidence accumulation as part of its established role in action selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bogacz and Gurney, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graybiel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hikosaka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jin and Costa, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nelson and Kreitzer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Redgrave et al., 2010</xref>). Modeling work has also suggested that the ADS may participate in post-accumulation decision commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lo and Wang, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The auditory input to a different striatal subregion, the posterior ‘auditory’ striatum, has been shown to be critical for auditory discriminations, leading to the suggestion that cortical projections into the striatum may provide a general mechanism for the control of motor decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xiong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Znamenskiy and Zador, 2013</xref>). Specifically with regard to evidence accumulation, work in primates found neural correlates of evidence accumulation in the ADS (Ding 2015; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding and Gold, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ding and Gold, 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding and Gold, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lo and Wang, 2006</xref>), and revealed that electrical microstimulation of the ADS impacts behavior that is based on accumulation of evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ding and Gold, 2012a</xref>). These data led to the proposal that the ADS may contribute to the computations specifically involved in evidence accumulation. Yet three critical questions to test this proposal have been left unanswered.</p><p>First, is the ADS required for unimpaired accumulation-based decision making? To date, there have been no recorded inactivations of the dorsal striatum during the accumulation of evidence. Inactivations are important probes of whether a region plays a central causal role for a cognitive variable of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Newsome and Paré, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erlich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katz et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Second, do neurons in the dorsal striatum encode sensory information in a way that is sufficient to be involved directly in the graded accumulation process? The correlates of evidence accumulation reported to date in striatum have been of two types: either firing rates that, when averaged over trials, ramp upwards with a slope of the ramp that increases as the evidence strengthens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding and Gold, 2010</xref>), or estimates of the temporal dynamics of firing rate variance across trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding, 2015</xref>). However, the trial averages do not distinguish between graded evidence encodings and other encodings that on a single-trial basis do not represent gradually accumulating evidence, such as sharp coordinated steps in firing for which the timing of the step varies across trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Latimer et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the variance estimates have not yet produced clearly definitive conclusions, suggesting that the ADS is only partly involved in graded accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding, 2015</xref>).</p><p>We recently developed a complementary approach, distinct from the two earlier methods, to assess evidence accumulation encoding. This most recent approach estimates ‘tuning curves,’ that is, direct descriptions of the relationship between recorded neural firing rates and the graded value of the evidence accumulator, and can discriminate between different encodings that otherwise appear indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we apply this approach to electrophysiological recordings from the ADS.</p><p>Third, does the dorsal striatum play a causal role throughout the period of accumulation? One of the key aspects of interest in gradual evidence accumulation is its relatively long timescale, as it occurs over a period of hundreds of milliseconds or more (thought to be a potential model of mental deliberation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>]). If the striatum is part of the gradual accumulation process that drives behavior, perturbing it at any timepoint during that accumulation process should affect behavior. This feature is thus an essential prerequisite for a component of the accumulator. However, no temporally specific perturbations of the ADS during the accumulation of evidence have yet been carried out to probe for this feature. Indeed, no brain region studied during an accumulation of evidence behavior has yet been reported to possess this feature.</p><p>Here, using a combination of behavioral, pharmacological, optogenetic, electrophysiological and computational approaches, we address these three fundamental questions. The results provide evidence supporting a central causal role for the anterior dorsal striatum in evidence accumulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We trained rats on a previously developed decision-making task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunton et al., 2013</xref>) in which subjects accumulate auditory evidence over many hundreds of milliseconds to inform a binary left/right choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In each trial, rats kept their nose in a central port during the presentation of two simultaneous trains of randomly timed auditory clicks, one played from a speaker to their left and the other from a speaker to their right. At the end of the auditory stimulus, the rat’s task was to decide which side had played the greater total number of clicks. Consistent with previous studies using this task, analysis of our rats’ behavior indicated that they gradually accumulated auditory evidence over the entire trial, and used that accumulated evidence to drive a categorical choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34929.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dorsal anterior striatum is required for unimpaired performance on the Poisson-clicks evidence accumulation task.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Sequence of events in each trial of the rat auditory Poisson-clicks task.

The anterior striatial region targeted in this study receives convergent inputs from the PPC and the FOF, brain regions previously reported to contain neural correlates of evidence accumulation but later shown to not be central to the accumulation process itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erlich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katz et al., 2016</xref>). Unilateral inactivation of the ADS biased rats to make more ipsilateral choices relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>; bias for right side inactivation = 19.2 ± 4.4%, p&lt;0.01; bias for left side inactivation = 18.6 ± 3.3%, p&lt;0.01). This effect was not a gross motor bias, but was instead specific for accumulation trials, because no significant bias was caused on interleaved motor control trials in which the rats had to make a similar left/right motor response, but were cued by a simple visual stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; p&gt;0.4 for both left- and right-side trials). Bilateral pharmacological inactivation caused a substantial impairment in performance for accumulation trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>; impairment = 12.6 ± 3.2%, p&lt;0.01). This impairment was again specific for accumulation trials, with no significant impairment in motor control trials where the decision was not based on the accumulation of evidence over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; p&gt;0.6 for both left- and right-side trials).</p><p>Psychometric curves such as those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref> group together trials based on the click difference accrued by the end of the stimulus stream and treat all trials within each group as if they were the same. But in our clicks task, we have far more information available because the precise temporal pattern of each individual trial’s click trains is known. We have previously used this information, together with a model that takes into account those known individual click times, to quantify our subjects’ behavior in terms of multiple parameters governing the dynamics of a drift-diffusion decision process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</xref>). We use an enhanced model of the drift-diffusion process so that we can obtain trial-by-trial, moment-by-moment estimates of accumulating evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunton et al., 2013</xref>). This model converts the incoming stream of each trial’s discrete left and right click stimuli into a scalar quantity <italic>a</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) that represents the gradually accumulating difference between the two click streams; each right click increases the value of <italic>a(t)</italic>, whereas each left click decreases <italic>a(t).</italic> Eight parameters, quantifing sensory and accumulator noise, the leakiness or instability of the accumulation process, a sticky accumulation bound, sensory depression or facilitation, side bias (þ), and lapse rate, govern the dynamics of how <italic>a(t)</italic> evolves in response to the sensory evidence pulses, and how they are then turned into a binary decision. At the end of each trial’s stimulus, the accumulator <italic>a(t<sub>end</sub>)</italic>, together with the parameter þ, drives choices: if <italic>a(t<sub>end</sub>)</italic> &gt; þ, the model prescribes ‘choose right’, whereas if <italic>a(t<sub>end</sub>)</italic> &lt; þ, the model prescribes ‘choose left’. All of the parameters are estimated by fitting the model to the rat’s behavior (Materials and methods).</p><p>The original model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunton et al. (2013)</xref> was not constructed to explain different types of side biases, so it had only a single parameter (þ) that could account for such lateralized effects. By adding three more parameters that could cause different types of side biases, fitting the extended model to behavioral data following unilateral inactivations, and asking which parameters are most affected relative to control trials, we can better estimate which particular aspect of the behavior was impacted by unilateral inactivations. The three side bias parameters that we consider, in addition to þ, are: asymmetric sensory input gain, asymmetric sensory input noise, and asymmetric lapse rates (Materials and methods). Considering all four of these side bias parameters in the case of unilateral inactivations of the FOF, we previously concluded that FOF inactivations were consistent with perturbing a process that was not part of evidence accumulation directly, but was instead downstream of the accumulation process and therefore followed it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erlich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Piet et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we improve upon this analysis and apply it to our striatum inactivation data. At the time of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erlich et al. (2015)</xref> study, the complexity of determining the derivative of the model with respect to all 11 of its parameters precluded us from fitting all 11 parameters simultaneously. We instead performed exhaustive scans in the space of two parameters at a time while the other nine parameters were fixed to their control (no inactivation) values (e.g., Figure 4 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erlich et al. (2015)</xref>). Since that time, however, algorithmic differentiation packages, which greatly facilitate computing the derivative of arbitrary differentiable models embodied in computer code, have become widely available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abadi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baydin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Revels et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Rfou et al., 2016</xref>). Using the ForwardDiff package of the language Julia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Revels et al., 2016</xref>) to obtain automatically the derivative with respect to all 11 parameters in the model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erlich et al. (2015)</xref>, we constructed a package that can efficiently and simultaneously fit all 11 parameters in the model. We are publishing this package in open source form, as part of the contribution of the current manuscript (code available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/misun6312/PBupsModel.jl">https://github.com/misun6312/PBupsModel.jl</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoon and Brody, 2018</xref>]; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences/PBupsModel.jl">https://github.com/elifesciences/PBupsModel.jl</ext-link>). We validated this approach and our previous FOF analysis by fitting all 11 parameters simultaneously to our previous FOF unilateral inactivation data. This new analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) confirmed the conclusions about the FOF found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erlich et al. (2015)</xref>. Following this conclusion, we next turned to performing the same analysis on the inactivation data collected in the current study for the anterior striatum.</p><p>For simplicity of presentation, below, we illustrate some of the results of the model fits in terms of psychometric plots (i.e., graphing the probability of a decision to one side as a function of total #R – #L clicks, averaged over trials), but we note again that our model and its fits are sensitive to the detailed timing of the click stimuli in each individual trial, which is information that is obscured in the trial-averaged psychometric plot. As a result, the model and its fits can resolve the effects of different parameters that are indistinguishable in a psychometric plot (see also illustrations of this point in Supplementary Figure S4 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunton et al. (2013)</xref>). For example, a leaky (i.e., forgetful) accumulator and an increased overall lapse rate both predict an overall performance impairment. But the leaky accumulator impairment will be greater for trials that by chance had their clicks earlier rather than later, whereas the lapse impairment will be independent of the timing of each trial’s clicks. A model that is sensitive to the timing of each trial’s clicks can thus distinguish the two. Similarly, an asymmetric sensory input gain and an asymmetric lapse rate both predict a side bias. But the magnitude of the bias due to an asymmetric input gain will scale with the number of clicks presented on each trial. This contrasts with the bias that would be induced by an asymmetric lapse rate, which would be independent of the number of clicks presented. This again allows the effects of the two parameters to be distinguished. In sum, trial-by-trial and detailed click-timing effects, although not visible in the trial-averaged psychometric plot, impact the likelihood of the data under the model, and thus impact the model fits and the likelihood landscapes (such as those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b and d</xref> below). When two parameters trade off in a manner that impairs our ability to distinguish them, this is revealed in the likelihood landscape as a ridge of high likelihood. The shape of the ridge quantifies the extent and scaling of the parameter trade-off (Materials and methods and for example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunton et al.

First, the side bias in the lapse rates (the contralateral lapse rate parameter κ<sub>C</sub> and the ipsilateral lapse rate parameter κ<sub>I</sub>, which are unitless parameters in terms of fraction of trials; Materials and methods) significantly increased in favor of ipsilateral choices (κ<sub>I</sub>: from 0.29, 95% C.I. = [0.18 0.43] in control sessions to 0.00, 95% C.I. = [0.00 0.14] for inactivation sessions, κ<sub>C</sub>: from 0.20, 95% C.I. = [0.04 0.58] in control sessions to 0.60, 95% C.I. = [0.14 0.93] for inactivation sessions). An effect on lapse rates was also seen after unilateral FOF inactivations, where it was interpreted as an effect on processes subsequent to the accumulator, and not part of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erlich et al., 2015</xref>). Second, the magnitude of the accumulator and sensory noise parameters, which respectively describe diffusion noise intrinsic to the accumulator and noise associated with the addition of each sensory click, also increased significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The trade-off between these parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunton et al., 2013</xref>) was large enough that it was impossible to distinguish which of the accumulator noise σ<sup>2</sup><sub>a</sub> or the ipsilateral and contraletral sensory noise parameters σ<sup>2</sup><sub>s,I</sub> and σ<sup>2</sup><sub>s,C</sub> was responsible for the increase. We note that we do not mean to imply that the combination of sensory and accumulator noise is a single, biologically interpretable quantity, but simply that our data cannot distinguish between the different trade-offs between these parameters that fit the data equally well. There was a suggestion that the intrinsic accumulator noise σ<sup>2</sup><sub>a</sub> specifically increased, with this parameter being significantly greater than zero during inactivation trials whereas it was not distinguishable from zero in control trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), but the difference between control and inactivation σ<sup>2</sup><sub>a</sub> values was not significant (p&lt;0.15). Lapse rate and noise parameters described distinct effects, and did not trade off with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>, third row, middle column).</p><p>For data from bilateral inactivation sessions, the combination of sensory and accumulator noise parameters was again significantly greater than for control sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>; w<sub>1</sub>σ<sup>2</sup><sub>a</sub> + w<sub>2</sub>σ<sup>2</sup><sub>s</sub>: from 31.64 clicks<sup>2</sup>/sec [95% C.I. = [17.40 55.84]] in control sessions to 117.00 clicks<sup>2</sup>/sec [95% C.I. = [71.12 156.53]] , where w<sub>1</sub> = 0.92, w<sub>2</sub> = 0.39 during inactivations. We note that noise magnitudes cannot be less than zero, implying that confidence intervals for both σ<sup>2</sup><sub>a</sub> and σ<sup>2</sup><sub>s</sub> are bounded by zero).</p><p>These fits contrast with those following FOF inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erlich et al., 2015</xref>). In particular, we note that the sensory and accumulator noise parameters were minimally altered after FOF inactivation, whereas ADS inactivation significantly impacted them.</p><p>This pharmacological demonstration that the striatum is required for unimpaired decisions that are based on the accumulation of evidence, and the model-based suggestion that the striatum affects properties of the accumulator, led us to explore the detailed neural dynamics that may support its potential causal contribution. To do so, we conducted single-unit recordings from freely behaving subjects engaged in the evidence accumulation task. Consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graybiel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jin and Costa, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kravitz and Kreitzer, 2012</xref>), we found that the neural activity of many striatal neurons was modulated by movement initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>). However, we also found that over a third of the recorded neurons significantly modulate their activity in a side-selective manner (p&lt;0.05) during the fixation period many hundreds of milliseconds before the movement initiation reporting the decision (64/173 [37%] of the neurons active during the fixation period [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d–f</xref>]). This timing suggests that they may have a role in forming the upcoming decision (go-left or go-right). These neurons were termed as ‘side-selective’ and for each we further defined the neuron’s prefered side as that yielding the largest activation, as done previously by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanks et al. (2015)</xref>. Consistent with previous work in primate dorsal striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding and Gold, 2010</xref>), we found that the average responses of these rat striatum neurons ramped upwards for stimuli in the preferred direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and moreover, that after an initial onset latency, the slope of the ramp was proportional to the stimulus strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Importantly, however, a gradual ramping profile is not conclusive evidence for the encoding of gradually accumulating evidence, because such a response profile can also be consistent with other encoding schemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ditterich, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Latimer et al., 2015</xref>) such as step changes in firing rate that occur at different times in different trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Latimer et al., 2015</xref>).

No region to date has been reported to be required at points of time that fully coincide with the evidence accumulation period.</p><p>To delineate the precise timing of the anterior dorsal striatum’s contribution, we used optogenetic inactivation, mediated by halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0), to unilaterally and transiently inactivate this region during the Poisson Clicks task. We expressed eNpHR3.0 using viral delivery methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>; Materials and methods). Acute neural recordings in our experimental rats verified that we could indeed transiently silence neural activity in the striatum with fine temporal precision using the delivery of green light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). We began with full-trial unilateral optogenetic inactivation and found, in agreement with the pharmacological inactivation described above, that optogenetic manipulation resulted in more ipsilateral choice biases relative to control trials, which in this case were randomly interleaved with the inactivation trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>; bias = 9.0 ± 2.3%, p&lt;0.01). These effects were consistent across rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Control rats whose striatum was injected with the same virus expressing YFP alone did not show a behavioral bias (bias = 0.1 ± 1.8%, p=0.89). Next, to resolve directly <italic>when</italic> the striatum contributes to the auditory accumulation of evidence task, we transiently inactivated it unilaterally during one of four different 500 ms time periods during the task: (i) the delay period immediately preceding stimulus onset (‘pre-accumulation’), (ii) the first half of a 1 s sensory stimulus (‘first half’), (iii) the second half of a 1 s sensory stimulus (‘second half’), or (iv) the movement period (‘post-choice’). In contrast to similar inactivation assays of the cortical FOF, which have no effect during the early parts of the accumulation period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>), we found that transient optogenetic inactivation of the anterior dorsal striatum during both the first half and second half of the accumulation caused a significant bias for the ipsilateral choices, with a similar magnitude of effect in these two periods (first half bias = 10.4 ± 4.0, p&lt;0.01; second half bias = 12.9 ± 3.7%, p&lt;0.01; difference = 2.5 ± 2.8, p=0.2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>; the first-half effect in the striatum is significantly greater than that in the FOF, p&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Remarkably, the effect in striatum was limited to the stimulus presentation period and we found no significant effect of optogenetic inactivation during the pre-accumulation or post-choice periods (pre-accumulation bias = 0.4 ± 5.4%, p=0.42; post-choice bias = 0.9 ± 5.2%, p=0.38; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). These results are consistent with the idea that the anterior dorsal striatum plays a direct causal role throughout the entire evidence accumulation process.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34929.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Optogenetic inactivation reveals that dorsal striatal activity causally contributes to decision formation throughout the accumulation process but not before nor after.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Coronal section of the left hemisphere showing the expression of eYFP-eNpHR3.0 in the left dorsal striatum.

Despite these many years of studies, no brain region has previously been identified as: first, being required for unimpaired accumulation-based decision-making behavior; second, having the graded neural encoding required for direct involvement in computing the graded, gradually evolving, value of the accumulating evidence; and third, making a causal contribution throughout times that fully coincide with the accumulation process. By demonstrating that the anterior dorsal striatum satisfies all three of these criteria, our work suggests that the anterior dorsal striatum is the first identifiable node in the neural circuit causally responsible for computing evidence accumulation. The anterior dorsal striatum is well positioned anatomically to participate in evidence accumulation as it receives diverse convergent anatomical input from multiple cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheatwood et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McGeorge and Faull, 1989</xref>) and it is connected via recurrent loops with cortical and subcortical areas that are widely believed to play a role in action selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding and Gold, 2013</xref>). Whether the anterior dorsal striatum possesses a unique role in evidence accumulation, or whether it is an important node of a more extended network of brain regions that operate in coordination to mediate evidence accumulation, remains to be resolved. Corticostriatal loops are organized as distinct parallel circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim and Hikosaka, 2015</xref>); future studies dissecting the contribution of different loops will be important for resolving this major question.</p><p>Our results, together with those of Ding and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding and Gold, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ding and Gold, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding, 2015</xref>), suggest that the striatum may be directly involved in a more expansive set of computations, traditionally considered to be more cognitive in nature, than the already well-established functions of the dorsal striatum in action selection, response initiation, evaluation of reward uncertainty, and habit formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding and Gold, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graybiel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hikosaka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jin and Costa, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kravitz and Kreitzer, 2012</xref>). It will be important to better understand how the striatal involvement in computing accumulation of evidence, as identified in this study, may contribute to those previously established functions. Extensions to our paradigm (for example, free response protocols or more extended trial durations) are likely to be useful for reconciling the functions indciated by results with the other functions of the striatum. The computations involved in evidence accumulation may perhaps provide an efficient mechanism for extracting important pieces of information from the environment in the service of other roles of the striatum.</p><p>By identifying model parameters affected by the inactivations, our model fits suggest specific aspects of the evidence accumulation computation that could be prioritized as potentially particularly strongly related to the ADS’s role in the computation. The model fits to unilateral pharmacological inactivation data found that, similar to unilateral inactivations of the FOF, the side bias in lapse rates was increased by the inactivations. But in contrast to what occurs in the FOF, noise parameters, including the accumulator’s intrinsic noise, were also substantially increased after striatal inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>). Model fits to bilateral anterior dorsal striatum inactivation data found that the sum of sensory and accumulator noise magnitude parameters was significantly increased by striatal inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>). A parsimonious account suggests that the main noise parameter that is affected may perhaps be the magnitude of the noise in the evidence accumulator. This would be consistent with the idea, supported by our electrophysiological and optogenetic data, that the striatum plays a role in the accumulation process. The lack of a significant effect on other parameters should be treated with caution: it remains possible that future studies with greater statistical power could discern an effect of striatal inactivation on some of these other parameters. Nevertheless, even while we emphasize that we do not take the modeling results on their own as conclusive, they do suggest that accumulator noise is a principal parameter of interest. It is conceivable that bilateral striatal inactivation increases accumulator noise by destabilizing the accumulator’s representation without biasing it, but a circuit model hypothesis to explain precisely how the striatum might affect the accumulator noise level remains to be developed. Another important direction for future studies will be the development of models with temporally specific parameters that could be used to model the effects of temporally specific optogenetic inactivation appropriately.</p><p>Independently of whether the anterior dorsal striatum operates alone or as part of a broader circuit for computing gradual evidence accumulation, and independently of the precise nature of its contribution to the evidence accumulation computation, the data reported here provide a critical foothold towards delineating the relevant causal circuit: for example, the anterior dorsal striatum’s major inputs and outputs become important candidate regions to be examined for a potential role in the process. The possibility that the causal circuit for computing evidence accumulation may be delineated in the near future suggests that we will soon be able to elucidate the circuit and cellular mechanisms that support evidence accumulation, a computation that is crucial for decision-making behavior in a wide range of species, including humans.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects and housing</title><p>All animal procedures described in this study were approved by the Princeton University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were carried out in accordance with National Institutes of Health standards.

All training and testing procedures were conducted during the dark cycle. Rats had free access to food but had restricted water access.

The training took place in custom-made training boxes (Island Motion, NY) placed inside sound- and light-attenuated chambers (H10-25A, Coulbourn Instruments, PA). Each box consisted of three straight walls and one curved wall in which three nose ports were embedded (one in the center and one on each side, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Each nose port also contained one light-emitting diode (LED) that was used to deliver visual stimuli, and the front of the nose port was equipped with an infrared (IR) beam to detect the entrance of the rat’s nose into the port. A speaker was mounted above each of the side ports and was used to present auditory stimuli. Each of the side ports also contained a sipper tube that was used for water reward delivery, with the amount of water controlled by valve opening time.</p><p>All rats were trained using a semi-automated training protocol on a previously developed accumulation of evidence task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunton et al., 2013</xref>).

In brief, at the start of each trial, rats were instructed to place their nose in the central port and to maintain nose fixation in response to LED illumination of that port. Subsequently, after a delay of at least 200 ms, rats were presented with a two trains of auditory clicks presented simultaneously, one from the left and one from the right speaker. For neurophysioloigcal recordings and pharmacological (muscimol) inactivation experiments, the click train duration varied between 0.1 to 1.2 s. For optogenetic experiments, the stimulus duration was fixed at 1 s for all trials. The train of clicks from each speaker was generated by an underlying Poisson process, with different mean rates for each side. The combined mean click rate was fixed at 40 Hz, and trial difficulty was manipulated by varying the click rate ratio between the two sides. The mean click rate ratio varied from 39:1 clicks/s (easiest) to 26:14 (most difficult). Upon completion of stimulus presentation, the central LED was turned off and rats had to orient towards the side that played more clicks and nose poke into the corresponding port to obtain water reward of 24 µL.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Behavioral model</title><p>To quantify the animals’ behavior and the effect of infusions, we used the behavioral model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunton et al.

(2013)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erlich et al. (2015)</xref>, except that in this work we used an algorithmic differentiation package, the ForwardDiff package in the language Julia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Revels et al., 2016</xref>), to obtain the derivative with respect to all model parameters automatically. We have published the model-fitting code in open source form (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/misun6312/PBupsModel.jl">https://github.com/misun6312/PBupsModel.jl</ext-link>).</p><p>In brief, the model equations described above also determine how a probability distribution of values of <italic>a</italic> evolves over time. We do not use Monte Carlo simulations to approximate the probability distribution, but instead, for each trial given its individual click times, we simulate the time-evolution of this probability distribution directly. The probability distribution of <italic>a</italic> at the end of the trial <italic>t<sub>end</sub></italic> then defines the probability of going Right: <italic>P(a,t<sub>end</sub>)</italic> ≥ þ , and the probability of going Left: <italic>P(a,t<sub>end</sub>)</italic> &lt; þ . Thus, given the model parameters, we can obtain the probability in each trial of observing the choice that the subject made. As described above, assuming that different trials are independent of each other, the probability of seeing the subject’s full data set is the product of all the trial probabilities. This net probability is what we refer to as the likelihood, and we optimize parameter values to find the highest likelihood. Under a ‘flat prior’ assumption, that is, when we make no prior assumptions about parameter values, the likelihood can then be normalized to correspond to the probability of seeing certain parameter values given the data, and is used to determine confidence regions for the parameters.</p><p>Each model fit was run 10 times, starting from different parameter value seeds. Consistent with previous similar fits (see Supplementary Fig. S6 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunton et al. (2013)</xref>), all fits ended within the final confidence region. Of the ten fits, the one with the highest log likelihood (and a positive semidefinite Hessian) was chosen as the one that defined the best-fit parameter values and the confidence region around them.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Trade-offs between different model parameters</title><p>Trade-offs between parameters are quantified by ridges of high likelihood in the likelihood landscapes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunton et al. (2013)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> in the main text). The orientation of the ridge quantifies the parameter-to-parameter scaling that best trades parameters off against each other; and the extent of the ridge quantifies the range of the trade-off for which model fits are almost as good as the maximum likelihood fit. Such ridges can be examined by plotting the likelihood of the data as a function of pairs of model parameters (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). But a full description of the trade-offs across all <italic>N</italic> parameters involves describing the shape of the <italic>N</italic>-dimensional maximum likelihood peak. Given sufficient numbers of trials, this peak is well-approximated by an <italic>N</italic>-dimensional Gaussian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">MacKay, 2003</xref>); the covariance matrix <italic>C</italic> of this Gaussian (corresponding to the inverse of the Hessian of the log likelihood, which we compute not numerically but with algorithmic differentiation, which is much more precise) is then the second-order approximation that describes the shape of the maximum likelihood peak (MacKay 2003). We focus on the eigenvector of <italic>C</italic> with the largest eigenvalue; this eigenvector describes the orientation of the major ridge. Its corresponding eigenvalue quantifies the variance along this ridge, and thus describes the extent of the trade-off region.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-5"><title>Unbounded parameter optimization</title><p>Some of the model parameters have natural range constraints on their ranges; for example, noise magnitudes are bounded by zero since the variance cannot be less than zero. However, optimization procedures, as well as the Gaussian approximation that describes the shape of the likelihood landscape around its optimum, are simpler in unbounded spaces. Consequently, for each bounded parameter α, we defined a bounded monotonic nonlinear function f such that θ = f(α’) remained within the desired bounds even when α’ was unbounded. We carried out the optimization using the unbounded α’ parameter (which we refer to as ‘infinite space’ since α’ has infinite range), and computed confidence intervals in the infinite space. We then used the f function to compute the corresponding optimal value of α and confidence intervals for α. (See, for example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). When the optimal value of a parameter sits at the boundary of the range, the true optimal point can exist outside the boundary. This could have an impact on other parameters that are interacting with the parameter. Also, it may cause the Hessian matrix at the optimal point to be not positive semidefinite. To resolve this issue, we used the tanh function to convert the parameters to the unbounded domain and then we run optimization in unbounded space. After we find the optimal point, the parameters were transformed to the original coordinates. With this unbounded minimization method, we could obtain the positive semidefinite Hessian matrix, which has all nonnegative eigenvalues.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-6"><title>Four model parameters to quantify sources of a lateralized bias</title><p>The original model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunton et al., 2013</xref>) had only a single parameter that could describe a right versus left choice bias, the decision borderline Þ.

And ipsilateral lapse rate is the fraction of the trials categorized as choices ipsilateral to the inactivated side of the brain, and converts them into contralateral choices.

Each rat received one of three surgical procedures that have all been described in detail elsewhere for different brain areas but were identical in all other respects. These were: (i) implantation of a tetrode-based microdrive consisting of eight tetrodes (three rats, left striatum) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erlich et al., 2011</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>), (ii) cannulas for pharmacological inactivation (four rats, bilateral) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erlich et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>) and (iii) chemically etched optical fibers coupled with viral injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>) (13 rats; six left striatum and seven right striatum). The injected virus consisted of 2–3 µL of AAV virus (either AAV5-CaMKIIα-eYFP-eNpHR3.0 or AAV5-hSyn-eYFP-eNpHR3.0 or a mixture of both at a ratio of 1:2, respectively). Two of the three rats that were used for electrophysiological recordings and received a tetrode implant targeting the anterior dorsal striatum were further injected with AAV5-CaMKIIα-eYFP-ChR2 and were implanted with two optical fibers and an additional tetrode-based microdrive targeting the rat SNr, GPe and superior colliculus, respectively. These data are not discussed in the present manuscript. The infusion cannulas were implanted at an angle of 15<sup>o</sup> lateral to minimize any potential backflow of muscimol to the frontal orienting fields (FOF), which have recently been demonstrated to be necessary for maximal performance on this task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erlich et al., 2015</xref>). Accurate placement of all implants and viral injection targeting was verified histologically.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Infusions</title><p>Infusion procedures follow methods described in detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erlich et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, infusions were generally performed during normal training sessions, were usually at least one week apart, and were never on consecutive days. Control sessions took place on the day prior to the infusion session. On the day of infusion, rats were lightly anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and anesthesia was sustained via continuous delivery of isoflurane using a nose cone. Using a Hamilton syringe that was attached via tubing to the injector, we delivered 0.5 µL of muscimol at a concentration of 0.125 mg/mL to either the left or right side of the anteriodorsal part of the rat striatum during unilateral infusion sessions and to both sides during bilateral infusion sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>, respectively). After delivery, the injector was left inside the brain for a minimum period of 5 min to allow adequate diffusion before removal and also to minimize backflow along the cannula tract. Subsequently, the injector was removed, the cannula was closed, and the rat was removed from isoflurane anesthesia and placed back into its home cage. We allowed 30 min of recovery from anesthesia before placing the rat into the behavioral box. The task performed by the rats during infusion and control sessions was identical to that described above with the exception that on ~10% of trials, rats were presented with an LED above the right or left port and had to orient towards that port. Thus, the animals had to perform the same motor action but success was not dependent on evidence accumulation, hence this procedure controlled for any potential motor deficits that could have arisen due to the inactivation procedure that could impair the animal's ability to orient effectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Optogenetic perturbation</title><p>The methods used in this study for optogenetic perturbation are identical to those described in detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>). Prior to each experimental session, a 532 nm green laser (OEM Laser Systems) was connected via a 1 m patch cable with a rotary joint (Princetel) and an FC connector to the rat’s optical implant. The rotary joint was mounted on the ceiling of the behavioral chamber. The laser operated at 25 mW and was triggered by a 5V transistor-transistor logic (TTL) pulse, delivered in response to behavioral events and triggered by the automated traiwhayning software (BControl). On all experimental days, laser illumination occurred during a random subset (25%) of trials and was applied unilaterally. Laser illumination trials could be divided into two main types. In the first type, we delivered light for a continuous period of 2 s, starting 500 ms prior to the initiation of the auditory clicks stimulus and ending 500 ms after the termination of the click train. This trial type is defined as ‘full-trial’ inactivation. For this we used a cohort of eight rats. In the second trial type, which we refer to as ‘time-resolved’ inactivation, light illumination was delivered in one of four different 500 ms time periods: the delay before stimulus onset, the first half of the 1 s auditory stimulus, the second half of the 1 s auditory stimulus, or during the movement period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). All time-resolved inactivation periods were randomly interleaved within single behavioral sessions. For ‘time-resolved’ inactivation experiments, we used a cohort of seven rats, two of which also belonged to the full-trial inactivation cohort.</p><p>The physiological effect of eNpHR3.0 on local neuronal activity was tested using acute recordings in experimental rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>). Rats were anesthetized using isoflurane and a sharp etched optical fiber was inserted into the center of the field of viral infection. The optical fiber was coupled with a 532 nm green laser with ~25 mW light intensity at the tip. In parallel, a sharp tungsten electrode (1 MΩ) was positioned adjacent to the optical fiber tip. The effect of laser activation on spontaneous activity was tested by delivering a series of pulses, of 500 ms duration each, at 25 mW every 5 s. The signals from the electrode were amplified, filtered (300–6000 Hz), thresholded on the basis of voltage (30 μV) and sampled at 30.3 kHz (0.25 ms before the threshold triggering and 0.75 ms after; Neuralynx Cheetah). The spikes and TTL pulses were time-stamped with the same 1-MHz clock (Digital I/O, Neurlaynx).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Histology</title><p>The rat was fully anesthetized with 0.4 mL ketamine (100 mg/ml) and 0.2 mL xylazine (100 mg/ml) IP, followed by transcardial perfusion of 100 mL saline (0.9% NaCl, 0.3x PBS, pH 7.0, 0.05 mL heparin 10,000 USP units/mL), and finally transcardial perfusion of 250 mL 10% formalin neutral buffered solution (Sigma HT501128). The brain was removed and post fixed in 10% formalin solution for a minimum period of 7 days. 100 micrometer sections were prepared on a Leica VT1200S vibratome, and mounted on Superfrost Pus glass slides (Fisher) with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech) mounting solution and glass cover slips.

Briefly, over the course of ~2–4 weeks following surgery, the tetrodes were slowly lowered towards the dorsal part of the rat anterior striatum. On most recording days, an electrically quiet electrode was used as a reference channel, and in the cases where such an electrode was not available, we used the ground of our neurophysiology recording system (Nerualynx) for reference. During recording, a unity-gain preamplifier (HS-32, Neuralynx) was attached to a connector on top of the microdrive via a light-weight tether. Signals from each of the channels were amplified (1,400–5,000×) and band-pass filtered (300–6,000 Hz; Digital-Lynx, Neuralynx). A voltage threshold (20–50 μV) was used for collecting 1 ms spike waveforms, which were sampled at 30.3 kHz (0.25 ms before the triggered event and 0.75 ms after; Neuralynx Cheetah). Neural activity was recorded daily during behavioral sessions that lasted 2–4 hr on average. Regardless of the quality of the recordings, tetrodes were never kept in the same position on different days, and were always moved at the end of each recording day (40–200 μm daily), in order to obtain recordings from new ensembles of neurons daily.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Analysis of causal perturbation data – optogenetics and pharmacological inactivation</title><p>Detailed methods for generating psychometric curves and estimating biases resulting from inactivation in rats performing this exact behavioral task were described recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erlich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In brief, for muscimol inactivation experiments, psychometric curves were generated by concatenating data across either infusion or control sessions for individual rats and by fitting a four-parameter sigmoid described using the following formula:<disp-formula id="equ4"><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>In that equation, the ‘x’ variable is the click difference on each trial (# Right Clicks – # Left Clicks), ‘y’ is the proportion of trials on which the animal went ‘Right’, and the four parameters of the fitting procedure are: ‘x<sub>0</sub>’, the inflection point of the sigmoid; ‘b’, the slope of the sigmoid; ‘x<sub>0</sub>’ and ‘a + y<sub>0</sub>’, the minimum and maximum of the proportion of trials in which the rat went ‘Right’, respectively.</p><p>For optogenetic inactivation experiments, we measured behavioral bias resulting from transient inactivation of neural activity in a subset of trials (25%) by first binning the trials on the basis of stimulus strength. We then computed the mean difference between the fraction of trials during which the rats went to the side ipsilateral to side of its optical implant for inactivation and control trials for each of 10 binned stimulus strengths. Thus, a positive value resulting from this measurement represents an increase in ipsilateral responses in laser illumination trials over control trials in which the optical stimulation was absent. Confidence intervals and statistical comparisons for this bias parameter were calculated using nonparametric bootstrap procedures. The bias resulting from unilateral pharmacological inactivation was calculated in a similar way, but the control behavior was derived from non-inactivation control sessions obtained the day before inactivation. The performance impairment resulting from bilateral pharmacological inactivation sessions was also calculated using the non-inactivation control sessions obtained the day before inactivation. Performance was defined as percent correct trials for each binned stimulus strength.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Analysis of neural recording</title><p>Spike waveforms were sorted on the basis of their relative energies and amplitudes on different channels of each tetrode. Clustering software (SpikeSort3D, Neuralynx) was used to isolate single units manually. Each spike was graphically positioned in a two- or three-dimensional space representing the energy or amplitude of the spike on two or three of the four tetrode channels. Convex hull boundaries and template-matching of waveforms were used to identify well-separated clusters of spikes, which were individually color coded. Data from the entire session were spike-sorted together. To compute the peri-event time histogram (PETH) for the population activity in response to the presentation of auditory clicks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), we followed the following procedure. For all well-isolated single units, individual trial rate functions were first generated by smoothing the spike trains with a causal half-Gaussian filter with 0.1 s standard deviation. The response functions of individual neurons were then normalized on the basis of the mean firing of each individual neuron at the time of stimulus onset. Trials were subsequently sorted by a quantity that we defined as the ‘mean stimulus strength’ following the same procedure that has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>). Mean stimulus strength was defined by dividing trials for each neuron into quantiles that are based on a difference in the preferred and non-preferred click rates.</p><p>The influence of single auditory clicks on neural responses, the ‘click-triggered average’, was calculated as follows. The trials of individual neurons were first grouped on the basis of the underlying Poisson rates that were used to generate the auditory stimuli. For each group, the mean PETH was computed. This quantity corresponds to the expected neural response at each point in time for each Poisson rate group. This mean response was then subtracted from each trial to generate the residual response from the expected one given the Poisson rate. Aligning this residual response to a click describes the change in the neural response that is associated with a single auditory click relative to the average expected response to clicks at other times. These click-aligned residual responses were averaged across all click times to obtain the click-triggered average response for each Poisson rate group. The click-triggered average for each neuron was calculated by averaging across the different Poisson rate groups. To compute the response across clicks arriving from both the preferred and the non-preferred sides, we inverted the residual response for non-preferred direction clicks prior to averaging. The click-triggered average response profiles generated using this procedure were compared to a model-based prediction that was based on a graded, linear encoding of accumulated evidence. To do this, we simulated evidence accumulation trajectories for 5000 trials using the same range of stimulus difficulties and durations that existed for the neural data. We then encoded these simulated trajectories with a graded, linear function of accumulated evidence (firing rate <italic>r = k<sub>1</sub> x a(t)+k<sub>2</sub></italic> in which k<sub>1</sub> and k<sub>2</sub> are constants). Finally, we applied the same analysis described for the neural data to estimate the predicted click-triggered average under this encoding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Behavioral model-based analysis of neural data</title><p>We applied recently developed methods in our lab to generate tuning curves that specify the relationship between neural firing rates and mentally accumulated evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>). These techniques take advantage of a behavioral model that provides a moment-by-moment and trial-by-trial estimation of the mentally accumulated evidence for this task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-11-1"><title>Neural tuning curves</title><p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanks et al. (2015)</xref>, the behavior model’s estimate <italic>a(t)</italic> was related directly to neural firing rates on individual trials to estimate neural tuning curves for accumulating evidence. The estimates of the neural response and accumulating evidence in individual trials were used to calculate the joint probability distribution between those two variables as a function of time for each neuron. The correspondence between time in the model and neural time was determined on the basis of the latency of the stimulus-dependent response modulation. This latency was calculated as the first time bin in the PETH to have a significant modulation of neural response based on stimulus strength, which corresponded to 150 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Thus, t = 0 in the model was taken as 150 ms after stimulus onset. From the joint probability, we extracted each neuron’s response conditional on the value of the accumulator. We then combined across neurons by weighting the contribution of each by the inverse of the variance of this conditional distribution, which gives more weight to representations that are less noisy.</p><p>To quantify the relationship between neural response and accumulator value across time, we averaged across the time period from 0.15 to 0.5 s into the decision process. To characterize the encoding across individual neurons, we fit this relationship of the response to the accumulator value with a four-parameter sigmoid using the following equation:<disp-formula id="equ5"><mml:math id="m5"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>In this equation, k<sub>2</sub>k<sub>3</sub>/4 determines the slope at zero-crossing, which characterizes whether the neural response changes smoothly between negative and positive accumulator values or whether it changes sharply in this region.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s6" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing—original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing—review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: All animal procedures described in this study were approved by the Princeton University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC; Protocols #1853) and carried out in accordance with National Institutes of Health standards.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s5" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34929.017</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Best-fit parameters.</title><p>This table shows the values of the parameters that maximize the likelihood of the eight-parameter accumulator model for all no-perturbation sessions of each rat (four rats for pharmacological inactivation study, three rats for electrophysiology, and 13 rats for optogenetics).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Causal contribution and dynamical encoding in the striatum during evidence accumulation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Joshua Gold as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Mark D Humphries (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper combines multiple strands of evidence to support the hypothesis that the anterior dorsal striatum (ADS) plays an important and causal in evidence accumulation in the brain. Pharmacological inactivation results in a strong impairment of decision-making. Catch trials for lesioned animals show decision impairment is independent of a motor deficit. Fits to evidence-accumulation models suggest three independent effects of ADS inactivation: 1) a shortening of the evidence integration window; 2) a dramatic increase in sensory and/or integrator noise; and 3) increased random choices on the contra-lateral side (lapse rate). Individual unit activity showed ramp-like increases on average over trials that matched key model predictions describing a continuous accumulation of evidence. Finally, acute optogenetic inactivation using eNpHR3 reproduced the lesion results, but only during the evidence integration epoch of the task, strongly suggesting a causative role for the ADS in evidence integration.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that this is a strong paper that addresses an interesting and timely topic and presents several compelling lines of evidence. However, the reviewers also agreed that there were a number of serious concerns that should be addressed, listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript, especially the Introduction, should do a much better and more accurate job of crediting prior studies, and clarifying the specific, new contributions from this study. For example, the first work using the clicks task should be cited (Sanders and Kepecs). Likewise, Ding and Gold, 2012 used a perturbation of neural activity in the striatum to test for a causal role in evidence accumulation but is mentioned only and incorrectly as showing &quot;correlates of evidence accumulation&quot; in terms of &quot;firing rates.&quot; In addition, the claim that the evidence for evidence accumulation in striatum comes only from trial averages of spike rates is false: Ding (2015, &quot;Distinct dynamics of ramping activity in the frontal cortex and caudate nucleus in monkeys&quot;) used analyses that go beyond simple spike rates to identify correlates of evidence accumulation.</p><p>2) There were a number of questions about the behavioral model fits and their interpretation. Several of these questions centered on the estimation and interpretation of lapse rates. The group data in Figure 1B,C seem to show relatively high (~20%) lapses, but the values tended to be much lower in Table 1. This discrepancy would seem to imply that other parameters of the behavioral model can account for errors for the strongest stimuli. Is that the case? Which parameters? Are such effects justified; that is, is it reasonable to think that errors for those stimuli result from inefficiencies in the decision process? If so, can lapses be effectively estimated using the given range of stimulus values?</p><p>More generally, the reviewers appreciated the descriptions of the model-fitting procedures but were not fully convinced that the use and interpretation of such a complex model (in terms of number of parameters) is justified. Could reduced and/or alternative models provide more parsimonious accounts of the data, given penalties for model complexity? Are all of the parameters needed? Do confidence intervals on their best-fitting values lend insights into the reliability of their estimates and therefore interpretation? How do the parameters trade-off? For example, an input-gain bias for one side could be plausibly offset by a post-categorization bias to the other, leading to no net effect. There are hints of this in Table 1, where the &quot;control&quot; fits show wide variation in some parameters between animals. A lack of consistent fits between animals would then lead to potentially spurious divisions into &quot;significant&quot; and &quot;non significant&quot; differences between two groups of animals, simply depending on how the parameter values tended to cluster or not cluster by chance. Furthermore, what evidence supports the claim that the &quot;combination of sensory plus accumulator noise&quot; represents a single, interpretable quantity, and that it has explanatory power beyond the effects of muscimol on lapse rates?</p><p>Given these sources of uncertainty about the model fits, how justified is the conclusion that ADS inactivation affects the accumulation process, as opposed to, say, a choice bias in the presence of uncertainty and/or lapse rates? It might be useful to use fits and/or simulations of models that include only biases and/or lapses to determine if and how well they can reproduce the experimental effects. These issues apply to both the pharmacological and optogenetic manipulations.</p><p>3) Please comment on apparent discrepancies between Figure 1B, C and 2A,C. Why the larger range of stimulus values on the abscissa in Figure 2? Why are the effects on ipsilateral choices in Figure 1B not apparent in Figure 2A?</p><p>4) Why do the analyses in Figure 4 only cover up to 0.5 s after stimulus onset? Ding and Gold, 2010 reported correlates of evidence accumulation early, but not late, in the stimulus presentation period. What happens to the late spiking activity here?</p><p>5) The evidence presented here for the role of ADS in evidence accumulation does not satisfy the criterion of &quot;necessary&quot;: decision-making was impaired, not prevented. The claims in the paper should be adjusted accordingly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34929.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript, especially the Introduction, should do a much better and more accurate job of crediting prior studies, and clarifying the specific, new contributions from this study.

We have organized our responses immediately below in a slightly different order to how the questions were posed, but we have made sure to cover all of the questions raised in point 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.1 […] Generally, the reviewers appreciated the descriptions of the model-fitting procedures but were not fully convinced that the use and interpretation of such a complex model (in terms of number of parameters) is justified. […] Could reduced and/or alternative models provide more parsimonious accounts of the data, given penalties for model complexity? Are all of the parameters needed?</p></disp-quote><p>Following the request from reviewers to take into account penalties for model complexity, and to further quantify how each parameter is needed, we have added Supplementary file 6 and 7, which shows, for each parameter, the difference in Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) between a reduced model with that parameter deleted, minus the full model. Negative numbers indicate that the BIC favors the reduced model with the parameter deleted, while positive numbers indicate favoring keeping the full model. We found that except for the accumulator bounds parameter B, each parameter has one or more conditions that indicates we should keep the parameter.</p><p>We also point out that each of the parameters describes a distinct effect, and each of the parameters is significantly different from zero, i.e., it has a statistically significant effect on the log likelihood (Brunton et al., 2013). With one exception, they are thus all needed to fully describe the data. The exception is once again, consistent with the BIC measures, the sticky commitment bound “B”, which across every individual rat in this manuscript (but not in other papers) had a confidence interval that included infinity (see parameter fit tables in supplementary files; B = infinity corresponds to not having the B parameter at all). We have nevertheless chosen, for consistency across papers, to keep that parameter. It is possible that future perturbation studies, in other brain regions, might reveal an effect on B, in which case it will be important to have it documented here that B was not affected by perturbations of the ADS; for that reason, we have kept B.</p><p>In sum, except for the accumulator bounds parameter B, which we keep for consistency with other papers, both BIC and confidence intervals indicate we should keep all parameters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.2 How do the parameters trade-off? For example, an input-gain bias for one side could be plausibly offset by a post-categorization bias to the other, leading to no net effect.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this question, this is a point that we had touched on in previous work, but had done so only buried in a Supplementary Figure (see Supplementary Figure S4 in Brunton, 2013), so it is very helpful to clarify it here. The short answer is that parameter trade-offs are made explicit, and quantified, by the shape of the region in parameter space that fits the data well, i.e., the region of high likelihood, as shown in Figure 2.</p><p>A succinct description of the shape of the peak of the log likelihood is given by the covariance matrix of a Gaussian that is fit around the optimum (an approach known as the Laplace approximation (MacKay, 2003)). We have added a section to the Materials and methods titled “Trade-offs between different model parameters” that goes through this procedure.</p><p>One such parameter trade-off that we found in our pharmacological inactivation data, referred to explicitly in the paper, is between sensory and accumulator noise parameters (Figure 2D and related text).</p><p>In addition, the reviewers’ question regarding how input-gain bias to one side might be offset by post-categorization bias to the other side led us to realize that we should clarify that many (but not all) potential parameter trade-offs are in fact dispelled by use of a model that utilizes knowledge of the individual click times. We have therefore added the following to the main text before Figure 2:</p><p>“We note that although below, for simplicity of presentation, we visualize some of the results of the model fits in terms of psychometric plots (i.e., graphing the probability of a decision to one side as a function of total #R – #L clicks, averaged over trials), the model and its fits are sensitive to the detailed timing of the click stimuli in each individual trial, information that is obscured in the trial-averaged psychometric plot. […] The shape of the ridge quantifies the extent and scaling of the trade-off (Materials and methods and e.g. Figure 2D in Brunton et al., 2013).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.3. There are hints of [parameter trade-offs] in Table 1, where the &quot;control&quot; fits show wide variation in some parameters between animals. A lack of consistent fits between animals would then lead to potentially spurious divisions into &quot;significant&quot; and &quot;non significant&quot; differences between two groups of animals, simply depending on how the parameter values tended to cluster or not cluster by chance.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion, we should have clarified that our statistical significance on perturbations is assessed on data combined across rats. We have added the following to the first paragraph of the “Behavioral Model” section of the Materials and methods:</p><p>“As in previous work (Erlich et al., 2015), to obtain sufficient number of perturbation trials for the model-based analysis, we combined data across rats and assessed effects and statistical significance on this “meta-rat” data. For completeness, in Supplementary file 1 we also present the result of fits to each individual rat, which are in general consistent with the meta-rat conclusions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.4. Do confidence intervals on their best-fitting values lend insights into the reliability of their estimates and therefore interpretation?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, absolutely, we should have clarified that confidence intervals are examined throughout. We now clarify in the caption for Figure 2 that the likelihood landscape panels shown there are intended specifically to show confidence intervals, or more precisely, confidence <italic>regions</italic> (“region” rather than “interval” since the model has multiple parameters). The likelihood landscapes indicate both the parameter trade-offs and the confidence regions: the shape of the confidence region describes the trade-offs because it defines the region in parameter space within which the likelihood is high and within which the parameters can trade off with each other.</p><p>To make sure that this point does not go unnoticed, we have added an arrow to the color scale in Figures 2B,D to explicitly indicate that the 95% confidence region limits are defined in the panels shown.</p><p>In sum, the confidence regions in Figure 2 and (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) are there precisely to quantify the reliability of the parameter estimates, and therefore their interpretation, which includes how parameters trade off with each other.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.5. Several of [the] questions [about the behavioral model fits and their interpretation] centered on the estimation and interpretation of lapse rates. The group data in Figure 1B,C seem to show relatively high (~20%) lapses, but the values tended to be much lower in Table 1. This discrepancy would seem to imply that other parameters of the behavioral model can account for errors for the strongest stimuli. Is that the case? Which parameters?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, that is the case, and the noise parameters largely account for the errors at strongest stimuli.</p><p>We have added Figure 2—figure supplement 3, showing the same models, with the same parameters, but now run on simulations with the noise parameters set to zero (which would produce high total signal-to-noise ratios). In these cases, the model-predicted asymptotic performance now matches the lapse rate parameter.</p><p>In other words, as the reviewers indicated, this means that performance in the trials of Figure 1 has not reached the asymptotic best level allowed by the lapse rate in the model parameters. Consequently, other parameters must be limiting performance for the easiest trials shown in Figure 1, and these are the noise parameters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.6. Are such effects justified; that is, is it reasonable to think that errors for those stimuli result from inefficiencies in the decision process? If so, can lapses be effectively estimated using the given range of stimulus values?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe these effects are indeed justified and that lapses can be effectively estimated, for the following reason: Lapse rates are defined as probabilities of error independent of any stimulus characteristics (number of clicks, difference in number clicks, inter-click intervals, etc.). Defined as such, they can be distinguished from other parameters, even when using only a limited range of stimulus values, because other parameters, including the noise parameters, do affect behavior in a way that depends, and therefore varies with, stimulus characteristics. Performance limits that remain after accounting for stimulus-characteristic dependent limits are the lapse rate.</p><p>As above, multidimensional confidence regions quantify parameter trade-offs, thus showing which parameters can be distinguished from each other given our data, and indicate the reliability of parameter estimates. See response <italic>2.7</italic> immediately below for distinguishing lapse rates from noise parameters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.7. [What evidence supports the claim that the &quot;combination of sensory plus accumulator noise&quot;] has explanatory power beyond the effects of muscimol on lapse rates?</p></disp-quote><p>In the new Figure 2—figure supplement 1 we show a number of panels examining parameter trade-offs in our data, including a panel in ED Figure 5A (third row, middle column) that shows that in fact the lapse rate κ<sub>C</sub> does not trade off with the summed sensory plus accumulator noise. This lack of a trade-off with lapse rates is also true for individual noise parameters, although we did not add a panel for each one. The two types of parameters (lapse versus noise) have different explanatory power, and are distinguished (using our behavioral model that takes into account each individual click time) because, as described above, lapse rates and the different noise parameters have different dependencies on stimulus characteristics. We now allude to this in the text, where we added:</p><p>“Lapse rate and noise parameters described distinct effects, and did not trade off with each other (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, third row, middle column)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.8. Furthermore, what evidence supports the claim that the &quot;combination of sensory plus accumulator noise&quot; represents a single, interpretable quantity?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion, we did not mean to imply that the combination of sensory plus accumulator noise is a single biologically-interpretable quantity. Instead, we simply mean that those parameters trade off in such a way that our data does cannot distinguish between multiple different combinations of them. To make this clear, we have added the following to the text:</p><p>“We note that we do not mean to imply that the combination of sensory and accumulator noise is a single, biologically-interpretable quantity, but simply that our data cannot distinguish between the different trade-offs between these that fit the data equally well.”</p><p>For example, in Figure 2D a whole range of trade-offs can be seen. E.g., all three of (σ<sup>2</sup><sub>a</sub> = 130, σ<sup>2</sup><sub>s</sub> = 25) and (σ<sup>2</sup><sub>a</sub> = 90, σ<sup>2</sup><sub>s</sub> = 100) and (σ<sup>2</sup><sub>a</sub> = 70, σ<sup>2</sup><sub>s</sub> = 150) fit the data well (see also Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.9. Given these sources of uncertainty about the model fits, how justified is the conclusion that ADS inactivation affects the accumulation process, as opposed to, say, a choice bias in the presence of uncertainty and/or lapse rates? It might be useful to use fits and/or simulations of models that include only biases and/or lapses to determine if and how well they can reproduce the experimental effects. These issues apply to both the pharmacological and optogenetic manipulations.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion, we did not mean to imply that the modeling results conclusively show that the ADS is involved in the accumulation process. The modeling results do suggest that, are consistent with that idea, and furthermore suggest the more specifically intriguing possibility that the ADS may be, in some as-yet-to-be-determined way, particularly important for controlling accumulator noise levels. But we think of the modeling results, by themselves, as suggestive, not conclusive. To clarify our view of the modeling results, we have added the following at the top of the paragraph in the discussion related to modeling:</p><p>“By identifying model parameters affected by the inactivations, our model fits suggest specific aspects of the evidence accumulation computation that could be prioritized as potentially particularly strongly related to the ADS’s role in the computation.”</p><p>And we have modified the following sentence in that discussion paragraph:</p><p>“Nevertheless, even while we emphasize that we do not take the modeling results on their own as conclusive, they do suggest accumulator noise as a principal parameter of interest.”</p><p>The evidence that we <italic>do</italic> think strongly points to the ADS being involved in the accumulation process come from the three main questions: (1) is this region necessary for unimpaired accumulation of evidence? (2) Does this region encode graded accumulating evidence? (3) Is this region causally involved through the accumulation time period? These are the three main questions that are study answers affirmatively, and that we raise in the Abstract and in the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please comment on apparent discrepancies between Figure 1B, C and 2A,C. Why the larger range of stimulus values on the abscissa in Figure 2? Why are the effects on ipsilateral choices in Figure 1B not apparent in Figure 2A?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the apparent discrepancy. This was due largely to different methods of binning the data. Figure 1 used bins with matched numbers of trials per bin, while Figure 2 used bins with equal spacing along the abscissa. Due to the higher density of trials with low click differences, that entailed a wider range along the abscissa for the latter method. We have adopted the former method for both plots for consistency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Why do the analyses in Figure 4 cover only up to 0.5 s after stimulus onset? Ding and Gold, 2010 reported correlates of evidence accumulation early, but not late, in the stimulus presentation period. What happens to the late spiking activity here?</p></disp-quote><p>The analyses cover this time period due to our experimental design of using an exponential distribution for determining the stimulus duration. This leads to a larger percentage of short duration trials, and fewer trials of longer duration. This contrasts with the reaction time design of Ding and Gold, 2010, where monkeys typically responded with RTs greater than 0.5 s for even the fastest conditions and for over 1 s for more difficult, slower conditions. We agree this is an important consideration, but we do not have a clear idea of what would happen at longer durations. It is entirely conceivable that our results would align with Ding and Gold’s for these longer durations. We have revised the discussion to raise this important consideration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The evidence presented here for the role of ADS in evidence accumulation does not satisfy the criterion of &quot;necessary&quot;: decision-making was impaired, not prevented. The claims in the paper should be adjusted accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the statement of necessity should be adjusted. Throughout the paper we have replaces “necessary” to now more precisely say that the ADS “is required for unimpaired performance.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
