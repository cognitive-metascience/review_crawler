replication and are prone to replication stress and telomere fragility. The shelterin component TRF1 facilitates telomere replication but the molecular mechanism remains uncertain. By interrogating the proteomic composition of telomeres, we show that mouse telomeres lacking TRF1 undergo protein composition reorganisation associated with the recruitment of DNA damage response and chromatin remodellers. Surprisingly, mTRF1 suppresses the accumulation of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein, BRCA1 and the SMC5/6 complex at telomeres, which is associated with increased Homologous Recombination (HR) and TERRA transcription. We uncovered a previously unappreciated role for mTRF1 in the suppression of telomere recombination, dependent on SMC5 and also POLD3 dependent Break Induced Replication at telomeres. We propose that TRF1 facilitates S-phase telomeric DNA synthesis to prevent illegitimate mitotic DNA recombination and chromatin rearrangement.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>telomere</kwd><kwd>DNA damage response</kwd><kwd>replication</kwd><kwd>DNA recombination</kwd><kwd>TERRA</kwd><kwd>ALT</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>637798 MetDNASecStr</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Porreca</surname><given-names>Rosa Maria</given-names></name><name><surname>Herrera-Moyano</surname><given-names>Emilia</given-names></name><name><surname>Skourti</surname><given-names>Eleni</given-names></name><name><surname>Law</surname><given-names>Pui Pik</given-names></name><name><surname>Vannier</surname><given-names>Jean-Baptiste</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Telomere Replication and Stability</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gonzalez Franco</surname><given-names>Roser</given-names></name><name><surname>Montoya</surname><given-names>Alex</given-names></name><name><surname>Faull</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name><name><surname>Kramer</surname><given-names>Holger</given-names></name><name><surname>Vannier</surname><given-names>Jean-Baptiste</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>TRF1 suppresses replication fork stalling, which triggers break induced replication at telomeres associated with DNA damage response, alteration in the telomere chromatin environment, and re-localisation of telomeres to PML bodies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Telomeres are specialised nucleoprotein structures at the ends of chromosomes, composed of repetitive sequences (TTAGGG repeats in mammals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moyzis et al., 1988</xref>), long non-coding RNA called TERRA and six associated proteins, TRF1, TRF2, POT1a/b, RAP1 and TIN2, that form the shelterin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Lange, 2005</xref>). These capping structures have the crucial function of maintaining genome stability by protecting the chromosome end from being recognised as DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Palm and de Lange, 2008</xref>). They also represent challenging structures for the replication machinery, which is associated to telomere fragile sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martínez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McNees et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sfeir et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vannier et al., 2012</xref>). Telomere fragility is identified by the formation of multitelomeric signals (MTS), where telomeres appear as broken or decondensed, resembling the common fragile sites (CFS) observed at non telomeric loci after treatment with aphidicolin (APH). TRF1 facilitates the progression of the replication fork at telomeres, by recruiting a specialised DNA helicase BLM, which in turn resolve secondary structures, similar to fission yeast ortholog Taz1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martínez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sfeir et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>During tumorigenesis, cancer cells can achieve replicative immortality by activation of telomere maintenance mechanisms. The majority of cancer cells reactivate telomerase, while a minority (10–15%) uses an alternative mechanism named ALT for alternative lengthening of telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bryan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 1994</xref>). Intriguingly, ALT is characterised by the appearance of ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs), specialised sites where a subset of telomeres co-localises with PML protein and several DNA repair and homologous recombination (HR) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Draskovic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yeager et al., 1999</xref>). ALT telomeres can be maintained by more than one mechanism of recombination. Indeed, in yeast, two different ALT-like pathways have been described: type I and type II, both dependent on Rad52. While Type I requires Rad51 to mediate the invasion of a homologous sequence, Type II is Rad51 independent but Rad50 (of the MRX/N complex) dependent. Both Type I and II mechanisms require the DNA polymerase Pol32, which initiates DNA synthesis for several kilobases, in a process known as Break Induced Replication (BIR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ira and Haber, 2002</xref>). Recently, multiple groups have revisited this Rad51 independent DNA synthesis repair pathway at mammalian ALT telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dilley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Garcia-Exposito et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roumelioti et al., 2016</xref>). Mammalian BIR is dependent on POLD3 and POLD4, subunits of DNA polymerase delta and orthologs of yeast Pol32. ALT cells present increased DNA damage response (DDR) and several studies have underlined the contribution of replication stress to ALT-mediated telomere extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arora et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cox et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pan et al., 2017</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms initiating recombination in ALT cells are still unclear.</p><p>In order to gain insight into the chromatin composition of telomeres undergoing replication stress, we performed Proteomics of Isolated Chromatin segments (PICh), using <italic>TRF1</italic> conditional knock-out Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs, telomerase positive). Surprisingly, we found that telomeres lacking TRF1 are enriched in SMC5/6, DNA polymerase δ (POLD3), and chromatin remodelling factors known to be associated with ALT telomeres. These cells also present additional DNA damage and recombination hallmarks such as formation of APBs, mitotic DNA synthesis at telomeres, a feature of BIR and increased TERRA levels. Further investigation using specific shRNAs against the SMC5/6 complex or POLD3 revealed how these two complexes are key regulators of the recombination signature identified in <italic>TRF1</italic> deleted cells. Taken together, these results strongly identify TRF1 as a central player in preserving telomeric chromatin against HR, induced by DNA replication stress, and particularly POLD3 dependent-mitotic DNA synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Capture of TRF1 depleted telomeres by PICh reveals drastic changes in the chromatin composition</title><p>To isolate and identify the chromatin composition of TRF1 depleted telomeres, we employed Proteomics of Isolated Chromatin segments (PICh), a powerful and unbiased technique that uses a desthiobiotinylated oligonucleotide complementary to telomeric repeat sequences to specifically pull down telomeric chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Déjardin and Kingston, 2009</xref>). We performed PICh in MEFs harboring a <italic>TRF1</italic> conditional allele. MEFs lacking <italic>TRF1</italic> are well known to undergo replicative stress; however, they can grow for up to 8 days before entering senescence, making them optimal for investigating replication stress at telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martínez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sfeir et al., 2009</xref>). Cells were transduced twice (day 0 and 3) with a CRE or GFP control adenovirus and collected 7 days after the first transduction, as indicated in the timeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Excision of exon 1 of <italic>TRF1</italic> by CRE recombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sfeir et al., 2009</xref>) resulted in the expected loss of TRF1 protein as determined by immunoblotting and deficient cells do not show drastic change in the cell cycle distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Cells were fixed and isolation of telomeres was performed using a probe complementary to TTAGGG repeats or a scrambled probe as a negative control. Finally, telomeric chromatin was isolated from both control cells (wt) and <italic>TRF1</italic> deleted cells before mass spectrometry identification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We identified a list of 1306 proteins that was subjected to refinement in order to remove unspecific bound proteins or contaminants found with the scrambled probe (see experimental procedure for detailed description). Based on the analysis of label free quantification (LFQ intensities), we found 119 proteins presenting a gain of abundance at TRF1 depleted telomeres (Log2&lt;-2) and 206 factors were displaced from these telomeres (Log2&gt;-2), considering that a cut-off for differential expression is set to log2 fold change (TRF1deletion/wt)&gt; |2| and -Log (p-value) &gt; 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Amongst these 206 proteins, we found TRF1, as expected due to the knock-out of its gene, but also one component of the CST complex (CTC1), important player in the efficient restart of stalled replication forks at telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gu et al., 2012</xref>) and recruited through POT1b interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, POT1b is also less abundant at TRF1 depleted telomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). On the other end, the group of 119 proteins enriched in <italic>TRF1</italic> deleted cells includes several factors involved in structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC), HR and DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E–F</xref>), such as the MRN complex (MRE11, RAD50 and NBS1). The identification of 53BP1 recruited to TRF1 depleted telomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>) acts as a positive marker for the specificity of this proteomic analysis, as reported before in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martínez et al.

To validate the specific association of some of these factors with TRF1 depleted telomeres in telomerase positive MEFs, we carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments using ChIP-grade specific antibodies followed by telomeric dot-blot. TRF1 antibody was used as a negative control for our experiment, while the recruitment of BAZ1b, BRCA1 and some subunits of the nucleosome remodelling and deacetylase (NurD) complex (p66a, MTA1, ZNF827 and CHD4) was assessed. For all these factors, with the exception of p66a for which no statistical significance was achieved, we observed a specific enrichment at telomeres upon <italic>TRF1</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1, A</xref>). In addition, to confirm the presence of PML at telomeres lacking TRF1, as suggested by our PICh data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), we performed immuno-FISH and scored for the formation of APBs. We observed a two-fold increase in the number of co-localisations between PML and telomeres in <italic>TRF1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To test if the recruitment of some of these factors is a consequence of chronic replication stress or if TRF1 directly inhibit these events, we treated wt MEFs with low doses of APH (0.4 µM) for 3 days. Using ChIP-dot blot, we did not detect the recruitment of any of the chromatin remodellers and DNA repair factors BRCA1, MTA1, CHD4, ZNF827 and BAZ1b, present at TRF1 depleted telomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1, B</xref>). Furthermore, we show that wt MEFs treated with APH do not form APBs despite a general increase in PML foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1, C</xref>). Overall these data demonstrate that telomeres depleted of TRF1 engage chromatin remodelling associated with the formation of APBs, platform of recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cesare and Reddel, 2010</xref>). Hence, to test if TRF1 is a suppressor of recombination, we revisited the incidence of telomeric sister chromatid exchanges (T-SCE) using chromosome orientation FISH (CO-FISH) in <italic>TRF1</italic> deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We identified an increase in T-SCE in <italic>TRF1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs (2.8%) compared to control cells (0.4%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This result is at odds with previous publications where T-SCE events detected at TRF1 depleted telomeres were not significantly enriched, with only 1% of T-SCEs detected compared to 0.1% in wt cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martínez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sfeir et al., 2009</xref>). In fact, this discrepancy might be explained by the difference in timing for the analysis of T-SCEs in <italic>TRF1</italic> deficient cells. Both publications report the lack of recombination effect by T-SCEs at 3 or 4 days after <italic>TRF1</italic> loss, while we generally carry our investigations at day 7. Therefore, we repeated the experiments in <italic>TRF1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells at different time points post infection: day 4 and day 7, finding respectively 1.6% and 2.8% of T-SCEs per chromosome end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2, A</xref>-left graph), indicating a lower % of T-SCE events happening at earlier time point. A second distinct difference with previous reports is the type of telomere signal exchanges that we analysed. As in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sfeir et al. (2009)</xref>, all types of telomere signal exchanges (e.g. the exchanges appearing at single chromatids and the reciprocal exchanges at both chromatids) were considered. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martínez et al. (2009)</xref> only refers to reciprocal exchanges at both chromatids. Thus, we next classified T-SCEs detected in <italic>TRF1</italic> deficient MEFs into these two different types (single and double) and found that 4 days post infection only T-SCEs at single chromatids were significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2, A</xref>-right graph), while the reciprocal exchanges were not enhanced at TRF1 depleted telomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2, A</xref>-middle graph). Therefore, our detailed analysis of the nature and timing of T-SCEs in <italic>TRF1</italic> deficient MEFs not only demonstrates an unappreciated role of TRF1 in suppressing HR, but also suggests that single chromatid exchanges, characteristic of conservative DNA synthesis – Break Induced Replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roumelioti et al., 2016</xref>), are the initial events arising in <italic>TRF1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs. To further discriminate between suppression of recombination by TRF1 and replication-dependent recombination, we quantified T-SCEs in mouse cells treated with APH. Like for TRF1-depleted telomeres, we also detected an increase in single exchanges in APH-treated MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, B-right panel). The absence of reciprocal exchanges between telomere chromatids indicates that APH-dependent replication stress does not trigger an HR repair but only BIR, albeit we cannot completely exclude that longer replication stress could lead to HR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, B-left panel). Overall our data highlights the specific function of TRF1 in suppressing chromatin remodeling, APBs and HR.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Recombination factors are recruited at TRF1 depleted telomeres.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Table listing chromatin remodellers identified.

However, the role of TRF1 regulating telomere transcription appears complex since contrasting results have been reported by different groups in both human and mouse cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schoeftner and Blasco, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sfeir et al., 2009</xref>). We performed both RNA dot-blot and Northern-blot analyses showing a significant increase in TERRA molecules upon loss of <italic>TRF1</italic> in immortalised MEFs, 7 days after transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>) but also at earlier time point (day 4) and in primary MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1, A–B–C</xref>). Collectively, we identify an increase in TERRA molecules upon TRF1 removal from telomeres, which suggests a TRF1 function in suppressing mouse TERRAs. Particularly, we noticed that these TERRAs have high molecular weight and can only be detected when an alkaline treatment is performed during Northern-blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1, D</xref>). In addition, we carried out TERRA-FISH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) in MEFs deficient for <italic>TRF1</italic>, confirming a significant increase in numbers and intensity of TERRA foci per nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To determine whether this phenotype is a direct consequence of replication stress, MEFs were treated with low doses of APH and TERRA analysis was carried out by RNA dot-blot and Northern blot. Similar to TRF1 depleted cells, APH-treated MEFs exhibited a significant increase in TERRAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1, E–F</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that TRF1-dependent replication stress enhances telomere transcription or TERRAs stability.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>TRF1 depletion causes TERRAs upregulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RNA dot blot analysis in wt and <italic>TRF1</italic> deleted MEFs.

We performed a pulse with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) for 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) before carrying out BrdU immunofluorescence at telomeres in interphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>). Only non S-phase cells were counted in this experiment, based on the formation of clear BrdU foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dilley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nakamura et al., 1986</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). <italic>TRF1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs display elevated BrdU incorporation at telomeres, showing two-times more telomere synthesis compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). To investigate DNA synthesis happening exclusively in mitosis, so-called MiDAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Minocherhomji et al., 2015</xref>), we performed a similar experiment in metaphases. After incubating wt and <italic>TRF1</italic> deficient MEFs with 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) and colcemid for 1 hr, mitotic cells were collected to analyse EdU incorporation on metaphase chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We scored for telomeric and non-telomeric EdU foci (mitotic DNA synthesis) and found that CRE induced cells had a significant increase in telomeric mitotic DNA synthesis compared to the GFP control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This result confirms that TRF1 depleted telomeres present an increased level of non-S-phase DNA synthesis, similar to what is observed in ALT cells. In addition, analysis of EdU incorporation in metaphase spreads allowed us to distinguish between conservative BIR associated DNA synthesis and HR semi-conservative DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Min et al., 2017</xref>). In the first case, EdU would be labelled on a single chromatid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> upper panel), while in the latter, EdU would localise to both chromatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> bottom panel). Thus, to assess the mechanism of DNA synthesis in <italic>TRF1</italic> deleted cells, the pattern of EdU incorporation on metaphase chromosomes was further investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Non-telomeric (upper panel) and telomeric (middle panel) EdU foci formed mainly on a single chromatid. In fact, 72% of the mitotic DNA synthesis at non-telomeric sites localised to a single chromatid, while the remaining 28% of the signal was present at both chromatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, upper panel). This result is even more striking when EdU signal was restricted to telomeres, with almost all the co-localisation being present at single chromatids (95%). These observations suggest that TRF1 is crucial for the suppression of mitotic DNA synthesis mediated by BIR at telomeres.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Deletion of <italic>TRF1</italic> induces mitotic DNA synthesis at telomeres.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic overview of the experimental timeline. <italic>TRF1<sup>F/F</sup></italic> MEFs cells were infected twice (day 0 and 3) with adenovirus containing either GFP control or CRE to mediate <italic>TRF1</italic> deletion.

As previously reported, TRF1 depleted telomeres present approximately 20% of fragile telomeres per chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2, C</xref>).

This suggests that POLD3 and SMC5 have separate roles or act at different stages of the recombination events happening at TRF1 depleted telomeres, advocating also an intriguing connection between TERRA and BIR.

Specific genomic loci, including fragile sites and telomeres, represent major obstacles to DNA replication progression and/or completion. Fragile sites have the propensity to form visible gaps or breaks on chromosome in metaphase spreads of cell lines from patients having fragile X-syndrome or Huntington’s disease (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minocherhomji and Hickson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Minocherhomji et al., 2015</xref>). It is well documented that CFS expression is exacerbated in cells grown under low to mild replication stress, for example upon inhibition of DNA polymerase with APH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minocherhomji and Hickson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Minocherhomji et al., 2015</xref>). Fragile sites are hotspots for deletions, chromosome rearrangements and are associated with an increased frequency of homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Glover and Stein, 1987</xref>). Over the last decade, telomeres have been identified as APH induced fragile sites displaying the standard phenotype of multiple spatially distinct telomere foci (MTS or telomere fragility) on metaphase spreads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martínez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sfeir et al., 2009</xref>). Various factors suppress MTS and thereby facilitate DNA replication at telomeres; including (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zaaijer et al., 2016</xref>) the shelterin protein TRF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martínez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sfeir et al., 2009</xref>), the DNA helicases RTEL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vannier et al., 2012</xref>), BLM and WRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barefield and Karlseder, 2012</xref>), Topoisomerase TopoIIa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">d'Alcontres et al., 2014</xref>) and Rif1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zaaijer et al., 2016</xref>). High levels of DNA damage and telomere fragility are characteristics of ALT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cesare et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Min et al., 2017</xref>), presenting several DNA repair and damage factors in APBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Draskovic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yeager et al., 1999</xref>), indication of elevated telomeric stress in these cells. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that ALT mechanism arises from persistent replication stress, which can be resolved by the initial collapse of the replication fork, subsequently offering substrates for HR repair mechanisms dependent on homology search and telomere synthesis as reported with BIR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dilley et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we report that replication stress generated at TRF1 depleted telomeres in telomerase positive MEFs is associated with the recruitment of ALT signature factors including PML, subunits of the NuRD complex, BRCA1 and SMC5/6 complex. We suggest that the formation of permissive telomeric chromatin enables transcription of telomeric sequences into TERRAs and increases recombination as measured by T-SCEs, in a POLD3 and SMC5/POLD3 dependent manner, respectively. Moreover, we detect mitotic DNA synthesis at TRF1 depleted telomeres, which is dependent on POLD3 but not SMC5. Comparison analysis with APH-treated MEFs highlighted the unappreciated role of mouse TRF1 in suppressing telomere chromatin re-organisation, which we propose to contribute to HR-dependent telomere-sister chromatid exchanges. Herein, we showed that telomere replication stress induced by TRF1 deletion generates additional telomere responses (APBs, Chromatin remodeling, HR) compared to APH treated MEFs. We propose this is imputed to the function of TRF1 in stabilising telomere chromatin. Both mouse and human TRF1 suppresses telomere fragility and therefore is essential to facilitate DNA replication through telomeric repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sfeir et al., 2009</xref>). We now show that like for mouse TRF1, its human homolog is essential to suppress APBs formation and BIR, that is POLD3 dependent in mouse and likely to contribute to the repair of stalled/collapsed telomeric forks.</p><p>Mouse TRF1 is essential for cell proliferation and to counteract TERRAs expression/stability and activation of HR, while it seems dispensable in HT1080-ST and HeLa cells. This could be explained by the difference in chromatin composition between the two species, indeed human telomeres display less abundant repressive marks compared to mouse chromosome ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">García-Cao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">O'Sullivan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rosenfeld et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, mouse and human TERRAs have different origins. The main source of human TERRA molecules is from Human 20q subtelomere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Montero et al., 2016</xref>) however, other subtelomeres might contribute to local regulation and therefore control both <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> regulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tutton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Feretzaki et al., 2019</xref>). On the other hand, mouse TERRAs primary origin is more controversial with reports proposing Chr18 subtelomere as the principal source in MEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Silanes et al., 2014</xref>), while recent literature hints to the subtelomeric regions of ChrX and ChrY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2017</xref>). These PAR-TERRA would be more abundant and involved in trans regulation on the other chromosome ends.</p><p>Telomere transcription appears to be differently regulated in human and mouse cells and it is tempting to speculate that the difference in chromatin composition between the two species is essential for different transcription regulations. Therefore, it is plausible that human and mouse telomeres bear different accessibility to HR factors due to the distinct heterochromatin properties, that will undoubtedly be an interesting question to address in the future.</p><p>We suggest that chromatin remodelling factors such as NuRD-ZNF827 are recruited to mouse TRF1 deficient telomeres to counteract the shelterin instability. This may be explained by analogy with ALT telomeres where telomeric DNA sequence is interspersed with variant repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conomos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marzec et al., 2015</xref>), which are suggested to cause displacement of shelterin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conomos et al., 2013</xref>), thus increasing replication stress and DDR. In this scenario, nuclear receptors bind the interspersed variant repeats and recruit several chromatin remodelling factors including the NuRD complex, which can further alter the telomere architecture by increasing telomere compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conomos et al., 2014</xref>); perhaps a transient state before stimulating telomere associations and generating more ‘open’ recombination permissive conditions at telomeres. In line with our findings, repressive chromatin at DSBs has been proposed to facilitate homology search and promote recruitment of HR proteins like BRCA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khurana et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to BRCA1, we have identified through PICh analysis the SMC5/6 complex specifically recruited at <italic>TRF1</italic> deficient telomeres. We demonstrate that this complex plays the same role at replication induced telomeres as in ALT cells, targeting telomeres to PML bodies (APBs) and facilitating telomeric HR at these sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Potts et al., 2006</xref>), since double mutant <italic>SMC5-TRF1</italic> disrupts formation of APBs and reduces T-SCEs events. However, we were unable to fully induce ALT in <italic>TRF1</italic> deficient MEFs, as they display neither C-circles nor heterogeneity in telomere length and telomerase is still active. The latter could act as a stabiliser of telomeric DNA ends generated during fork restart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tong et al., 2015</xref>), similarly to what happens in <italic>RTEL1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Margalef et al., 2018</xref>) and in human <italic>RTEL1</italic> deficient cells with long telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Porreca et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Persistent DNA damage in ALT cells is suggested to originate from telomeric replication stress, which is proposed to be resolved by BIR in a POLD3 dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dilley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Min et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roumelioti et al., 2016</xref>). Our results show that TRF1 is a major suppressor of telomeric replication stress and consequently of POLD3 dependent BIR. <italic>TRF1</italic> deficient telomeres present slower movement of S-phase replication forks, measured by molecular combing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sfeir et al., 2009</xref>). The slower replication rates at telomeres is proposed to be a consequence of the hindrance of the replication forks by DNA secondary structures, including formation of G-quadruplexes on the lagging strand template or RNA-DNA hybrids. In the absence of TRF1, BLM is unable to be recruited to replicated telomeres and to open DNA secondary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zimmermann et al., 2014</xref>). Based on our results, we propose that in the absence of TRF1, POLD3 dependent BIR bypasses the stalled replication fork during G2/M phase.</p><p>Recent studies identified BIR as a mechanism to bypass RNA-DNA hybrids in a Rad52 and Pol32 dependent manner in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amon and Koshland, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Neil et al., 2018</xref>). This mechanism is also conserved in human cells where POLD3 is necessary for the restart of stalled replication forks at RNA-DNA hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tumini et al., 2016</xref>). Altogether, we propose that increased TERRAs levels at TRF1 depleted telomeres could form RNA-DNA hybrids that are bypassed by POLD3 dependent BIR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This is in agreement with recent findings showing that TRF1 suppresses R-loop formation mediated by TRF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast to Pold3, SMC5 acts as inhibitor of TERRA accumulation, as its absence is causing a significant increase in TERRA levels. This result is reminiscent of the role of yeast Smc5 in facilitating the resolution of toxic recombination intermediates at RNA-DNA hybrids generated by the helicase Mph1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lafuente-Barquero et al., 2017</xref>). We also describe a role of SMC5 in promoting T-SCEs, but not MiDAS formation (in contrast to PolD3), in the absence of TRF1. These results are indicating an exclusive function of SMC5 in HR at replicative-stressed telomeres, perhaps ensuring the right balance between accumulation and removal of HR-dependent intermediates formed during DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aragón, 2018</xref>). On the other hand, the lack of Smc5 in promoting MiDAS seems in apparent contradiction with a recent observation in ALT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Min et al., 2017</xref>), where telomeric MiDAS is decreased in SMC5/6-depleted Saos2 cells. We speculate, this difference is due to an imbalance of factors used for ALT maintenance, compared to the early events observed in our conditional system after only few population doublings. Therefore, we cannot rule out a possible role of SMC5/6 in promoting MiDAS at a later stage, similar to the one observed in ALT maintenance.</p><p>Along with MUS81 structure specific nuclease, POLD3 and POLD4 subunits of the DNA polymerase delta are essential for CFS expression observed in human cells under replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Minocherhomji et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tumini et al., 2016</xref>). To our surprise, <italic>TRF1-POLD3</italic> double mutant did not show any suppression of telomere fragility, indicating key differences in the mechanism generating these phenotypes.</p><p>In conclusion, our analysis of TRF1 function provides an unappreciated molecular understanding of the level of protection that this shelterin protein offers at telomeres. Surprisingly, we establish that TRF1 ensures telomeric chromatin stability and suppresses the recruitment of chromatin remodellers including NuRD and the formation of APBs, which together promote a HR prone environment. At the same time, TRF1-dependent replication stress is associated with increased TERRAs expression/stability and activation of POLD3-dependent BIR to restart stalled/collapsed telomeric replication forks.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

The molecular mechanisms coming into play upon TRF1 loss were not clearly defined though. This study combines an inducible TRF1 loss with telomere-targeted proteomics to analyze the incurring changes. The results show that loss of TRF1 causes important alterations in telomere associated proteins and the new profile resembles in a number of ways that of cells in which telomeres are maintained by telomerase-independent mechanisms, named ALT. The presence of DNA repair proteins (MRN complex, the SMC5/6 complex), some increases in telomere colocalization with PML bodies, sister chromatid exchanges and clear signs of increased TERRA transcription and mitotic break-induced replication are part of these phenotypes. The data also show that these early ALT phenotypes can be differentiated from drug induced replication stress, and part of this ALT response is conserved in human cells. These studies therefore point to a critical role for TRF1 in preventing the emergence of ALT and hence immortalization of cells. Given that the details for how ALT actually is initiated remained unclear, these findings are an important step forward and will spur new research into that question.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;TRF1 prevents permissive DNA damage response, recombination and Break Induced Replication at telomeres&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Thanks for your submission and support of <italic>eLife</italic>. As mentioned above, your study has been evaluated by three referees and after discussion, they unanimously thought that your manuscript is a nicely crafted proteomics study that does directly support a much speculated, but not evidence based, theory on replication stress causing initial events of the ALT mechanism. The inducible loss of TRF1 is a very efficient way to study these events and the results are viewed as robust and clear. This is an important finding that has the potential to lead to new investigations on how ALT arises and bring our understanding of that to a new level.

We treated wild-type MEFs with aphidicolin (APH) in order to induce replication stress, as it is well described to induce telomere fragility or multi-telomeric signal (Sfeir et al., 2009; Martinez et al., 2009). We have now included new paragraphs in the manuscript describing these new experiments.</p><p>We treated wt MEFs for 3 days (0.4µM APH) as it was the longest treatment that cells could support. Under these conditions, we could not detect the recruitment of any of the chromatin remodellers and DNA repair factors BRCA1, MTA1, CHD4, ZNF827 and BAZ1b that we characterised at TRF1 depleted telomeres by ChIP-dot blot (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). We could not test for the recruitment of mouse SMC5/6 to telomeres due to the lack of efficient ChIP grade antibodies. However, we looked for all ALT-associated telomere phenotypes present in <italic>TRF1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>MEFs: APBs formation (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C), TERRAs (Figure 3—figure supplement 1F) and T-SCEs (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B).</p><p>1) We observe a general increase of PML foci in wt MEFs treated with APH, however the total number of APBs is not increased in treated cells compared to untreated. On the contrary, the number of PML-telomere co-localisations <italic>vs</italic> total number of PML significantly decreases in treated cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C).</p><p>2) wt MEFs treated with APH present an increase of TERRA molecules (Figure 3—figure supplement 1, E-F). This is similar to the increase in HMW TERRAs observed in <italic>TRF1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs and could be a consequence of the replication stress.</p><p>3) Finally, we also quantified T-SCEs in mouse cells treated with APH and identified an increase in single exchanges, which are characteristic of conservative DNA synthesis – Break Induced Replication. However, the absence of reciprocal exchanges between telomere chromatids indicates that APH-dependent replication stress does not trigger an HR activation/response (up to 3 days) and this is specific to the function of TRF1 (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B).</p><p>This comparison analysis is essential for the understanding of the direct and indirect molecular events of repair and recombination that are arising at TRF1 depleted telomeres. We propose that in the absence of TRF1, telomeric chromatin re-arrange to a more HR prone environment and this is mediated by Chromatin remodellers including NuRD. Telomeres associated to PML to form APBs, which is essential for HR. At the same time, TRF1-dependent replication stress activates POLD3-dependent BIR to restart stalled/collapsed telomeric replication forks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Are these events also occurring in human cells suffering replication stress and or loss of TRF1? Reviewers suggest to use a long telomere HeLa variant (1.2.11; or 1.3) and repress TRF1 and/or apply replication stress compounds as above. Readouts again would be characteristic molecular events for ALT.</p></disp-quote><p>Considering the important information gained by looking at the differences and similarities between APH- and TRF1-dependent replication stress in mouse cells, we then decided to focus our efforts on validating the function of TRF1 in suppressing characteristic molecular ALT events in human cells. We use small RNA interference against TRF1 in HT1080-ST cells (long telomeres) and looked at characteristic molecular events of ALT, as APBs, TERRAs, BIR and HR. We have now included a new paragraph and supplemental figures describing this part (Figure 2—figure supplement 4 and Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><p>Briefly, we show that:</p><p>1) TRF1-depleted HT1080-ST cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 4A) present increased APBs (Figure 2—figure supplement 4B) similar to the mouse cells.</p><p>2) We looked for the accumulation of TERRA molecules in HT1080ST (siRNA-day 6) and HeLa (Crispr/Cas9-day 15) cells depleted for TRF1. After 6 days, we could not detect a significant increase in TERRAs (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A) and neither after 15 days culturing HeLa stable TRF1 KO (Figure 3—figure supplement 2B).</p><p>3) We measured sister chromatid exchanges at telomeres in HT1080-ST depleted for TRF1 with siRNA. We observed an increase in single exchanges (Figure 2—figure supplement 4C) that we reported to be a mark of BIR in TRF1-deficient murine cells. However, we could not detect any differences for double exchanges between ctl and TRF1 siRNA treated cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 4C).</p><p>In conclusion, some of the TRF1 functions are conserved between mouse and human. For both species, TRF1 suppresses telomere fragility and therefore is essential to facilitate DNA replication through telomeric repeats. We now show that like for mouse TRF1, its human homolog is essential to suppress APBs formation and BIR, which is likely to be the activated mechanism to rescue stalled/collapsed telomeric forks.</p><p>We have now included a new paragraph in the Discussion section describing the differences between mouse and human TERRAs.</p></body></sub-article></article>
