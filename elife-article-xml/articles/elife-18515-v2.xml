consequent changes in size and composition. However, the mechanism by which illumination is coupled to rhabdomere turnover remains unclear. We find that photoreceptors contain a light-dependent phospholipase D (PLD) activity. During illumination, loss of PLD resulted in an enhanced reduction in rhabdomere size, accumulation of Rab7 positive, rhodopsin1-containing vesicles (RLVs) in the cell body and reduced rhodopsin protein. These phenotypes were associated with reduced levels of phosphatidic acid, the product of PLD activity and were rescued by reconstitution with catalytically active PLD. In wild-type photoreceptors, during illumination, enhanced PLD activity was sufficient to clear RLVs from the cell body by a process dependent on Arf1-GTP levels and retromer complex function. Thus, during illumination, PLD activity couples endocytosis of RLVs with their recycling to the plasma membrane thus maintaining plasma membrane size and composition.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18515.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18515.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18515.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Certain cells in the eye contain a receptor protein known as rhodopsin that enables them to detect light. Rhodopsin is found in distinct patches on the membrane surrounding each of these “photoreceptor” cells and the number of rhodopsin molecules present controls how sensitive the cell is to light. In humans, vitamin A deficiency or genetic defects can decrease the number of rhodopsin molecules on the membrane, leading to difficulty in seeing in dim light.</p><p>Fruit fly eyes also contain rhodopsin. Exposure to normal levels of light triggers parts of the membranes of fly photoreceptor cells to detach and move into the interior of the cell. These internalized pieces of membrane have two possible fates: they can either be destroyed or recycled back to the cell surface. This membrane turnover adjusts the size of the membrane surrounding the cell and the number of rhodopsin molecules in it to regulate the cell’s sensitivity to light. It is crucial that turnover is tightly regulated in order to maintain the integrity of the cell membrane. However, it is not clear how the process is regulated during light exposure.</p><p>Thakur et al. set out to address this question in fruit flies. The experiments show that an enzyme called phospholipase D is activated when photoreceptors are exposed to light. Active phospholipase D – which generates a molecule called phosphatidic acid – coordinates the internalization of pieces of membrane with the recycling of rhodopsin back to the cell surface. Thakur et al. generated fly mutants that lacked phospholipase D and in these animals the internalized rhodopsin was not transported back to the cell membrane. This caused the membrane to shrink in size and decreased the number of rhodopsin molecules in it. As a result, the photoreceptor cells became less sensitive to light.</p><p>The findings of Thakur et al. show that in response to normal levels of light, phospholipase D balances membrane internalization and recycling to maintain the size and rhodopsin composition of the membrane. Future challenges will be to work out exactly how phospholipase D is activated and how phosphatidic acid tunes membrane internalization and recycling.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18515.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18515.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>retromer</kwd><kwd>Arf1</kwd><kwd>lipid signalling</kwd><kwd>phospholipase D</kwd><kwd>rhodopsin</kwd><kwd>phosphatidic acid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Trust DBT India Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IA/S/14/2/501540</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thakur</surname><given-names>Rajan</given-names></name><name><surname>Raj</surname><given-names>Nikita</given-names></name><name><surname>Yadav</surname><given-names>Shweta</given-names></name><name><surname>Balakrishnan</surname><given-names>Sruthi</given-names></name><name><surname>Basak</surname><given-names>Bishal</given-names></name><name><surname>Padinjat</surname><given-names>Raghu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005879</institution-id><institution>National Centre for Biological Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>core</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thakur</surname><given-names>Rajan</given-names></name><name><surname>Panda</surname><given-names>Aniruddha</given-names></name><name><surname>Raj</surname><given-names>Nikita</given-names></name><name><surname>Yadav</surname><given-names>Shweta</given-names></name><name><surname>Balakrishnan</surname><given-names>Sruthi</given-names></name><name><surname>Basak</surname><given-names>Bishal</given-names></name><name><surname>Pasricha</surname><given-names>Renu</given-names></name><name><surname>Padinjat</surname><given-names>Raghu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/PR4833/MED/30/744/2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thakur</surname><given-names>Rajan</given-names></name><name><surname>Panda</surname><given-names>Aniruddha</given-names></name><name><surname>Raj</surname><given-names>Nikita</given-names></name><name><surname>Yadav</surname><given-names>Shweta</given-names></name><name><surname>Balakrishnan</surname><given-names>Sruthi</given-names></name><name><surname>Basak</surname><given-names>Bishal</given-names></name><name><surname>Pasricha</surname><given-names>Renu</given-names></name><name><surname>Padinjat</surname><given-names>Raghu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>core</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coessens</surname><given-names>Elise</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Qifeng</given-names></name><name><surname>Georgiev</surname><given-names>Plamen</given-names></name><name><surname>Wakelam</surname><given-names>Michael JO</given-names></name><name><surname>Ktistakis</surname><given-names>Nicholas T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Phosphatidic acid regulates recycling of endocytosed plasma membrane vesicles in polarized cells through a retromer and Arf1 dependent process.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability to detect photons is a fundamental property of animal photoreceptors. In order to achieve this, ocular photoreceptors of animals generate an expanded region of plasma membrane that is packed with the receptor for light, rhodopsin. This strategy is used regardless of the architecture of the photoreceptor. For example, in ciliary photoreceptors (e.g vertebrate rods), light passes along the outer segment that is stacked with membranous discs, whereas in insect photoreceptors, the plasma membrane is expanded to form actin-based microvilli; both these structures are packed with rhodopsin, and incident light is absorbed as it passes along them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arendt, 2003</xref>). The light-sensitive membranes of photoreceptors undergo stimulus-dependent turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">LaVail, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">White and Lord, 1975</xref>); such turnover will alter both membrane area and composition, thus regulating sensitivity to light [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blest, 1988</xref>)]. The importance of this process is underscored by the human disease Best’s macular dystrophy, in which rod outer segment length and electroretinograms are altered during changes in ambient illumination, ultimately leading to macular degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abràmoff et al., 2013</xref>). Despite the importance of this process, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate photosensitivemembrane turnover remains poorly understood.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic> photoreceptors, the apical domain is expanded to form ca. 40,000 projections of light-sensitive plasma membrane (microvilli) that form the rhabdomere. Photons that are absorbed trigger G-protein-coupled phospholipase C (PLC) activity that culminates in the activation of the plasma membrane channels TRP and TRPL; the resulting Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx triggers an electrical response to light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hardie and Raghu, 2001</xref>). Additionally, photon absorption by rhodopsin1 (Rh1) also triggers the rhodopsin cycle [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Raghu et al., 2012</xref>)]. Following photon absorption, Rh1 undergoes photoisomerization to meta-rhodopsin (M). M is phosphorylated at its C-terminus, binds β-arrestin and this complex is removed from the microvillar membrane via clathrin-dependent endocytosis to be either recycled back to the microvillar plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) or trafficked to the lysosomes for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chinchore et al., 2009</xref>) [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Xiong and Bellen, 2013</xref>)]. Tight regulation of this process is critical for rhabdomere integrity during illumination as mutants defective in any of the several steps of the rhodopsin cycle undergo light-dependent collapse of the rhabdomere [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Raghu et al., 2012</xref>)]. However, the process that couples endocytosis of rhabdomere membrane to plasma membrane recycling remains poorly understood.</p><p>Phospholipase D (PLD) is an enzyme that hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine (PC) to generate phosphatidic acid (PA). In yeast, loss of PLD (<italic>spo14</italic>) results in a sporulation defect, failure to synthesize PA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rudge et al., 2001</xref>) and accumulation of undocked membrane vesicles on the spindle pole body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nakanishi et al., 2006</xref>). The v-SNARE Spo20p binds PA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nakanishi et al., 2004</xref>) and is required to dock Spo20p to target membranes; in this setting, PA generated by PLD appears to regulate a vesicular transport process. The potential role of PA in controlling vesicular transport also arose from observations <italic>in vitro</italic> that Arf proteins, key regulators of vesicular transport, stimulate mammalian PLD activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cockcroft et al., 1994</xref>). Overexpression of PLD1 in a range of neuronal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vitale et al., 2001</xref>) and non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cockcroft et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2005</xref>) suggests that PLD can regulate vesicular transport. A previous study showed that elevated PA levels during development of <italic>Drosophila</italic> photoreceptors disrupts rhabdomere biogenesis with associated endomembrane defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Raghu et al., 2009</xref>) that were Arf1-dependent. However, the mechanism underlying the role of PLD in regulating membrane transport has remained unclear, and to date, no study in metazoans has demonstrated a role, if any, for endogenous PLD in regulating vesicular transport <italic>in vivo</italic>. In this study, we show that during illumination in <italic>Drosophila</italic> photoreceptors, rhabdomere size is regulated through the turnover of apical plasma membrane via RLVs. We find that photoreceptors have a light-regulated PLD activity that is required to maintain PA levels during illumination and support apical membrane size. PLD works in coordination with retromer function and Arf1 activity to regulate apical membrane size during illumination. Thus, PLD is a key regulator of plasma membrane turnover during receptor activation and signaling in photoreceptors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rhabdomere size and Rh1 levels are modulated by illumination in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title><p>We quantified rhabdomere size of <italic>Drosophila</italic> photoreceptors during illumination by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) followed by volume fraction analysis. When wild-type flies are grown in white light for 48 hr (hrs) post-eclosion, the volume fraction (V<sub>f</sub>) of the cell occupied by the rhabdomere in peripheral photoreceptors R1-R6 was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

This reduction in rhabdomere size was accompanied by changes in the localization of Rh1, the rhodopsin isoform expressed in R1-R6.

In photoreceptors, change in size of photosensitive membranes during illumination represents a special example of the broad principle of plasma membrane turnover following receptor-ligand interaction. In <italic>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></italic> photoreceptors, the process of light-induced membrane turnover is exaggerated; these photoreceptors show larger reductions in rhabdomere volume and greater reductions in Rh1 levels than is seen in wild-type flies. The physiological consequence of this is that <italic>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></italic> photoreceptors are less sensitive to light than controls when reared in light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>).</p><p>During illumination, RLVs are generated and mature through Rab5 and Rab7 endocytic compartments. We found that (i) photoreceptors contain a light-stimulated PLD activity, (ii) Loss of dPLD activity results in enhanced numbers of Rab7-positive RLVs in the cell body during illumination, (iii) overexpression of catalytically active dPLD was able to clear light-induced Rab7-positive RLVs in wild-type cells and (iv) dPLD overexpression was able to reduce the enhanced RLV number and partially suppress retinal degeneration in <italic>norpA<sup>P24</sup></italic>, a mutant that shows enhanced Rab7 positive RLVs during illumination. Thus ,dPLD represents an enzyme activity that couples the generation of RLVs by light-induced endocytosis to their removal from the cell body. It has previously been reported that the Rh1 that accumulates in Rab7 compartment is targeted for degradation, thus leading to retinal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chinchore et al., 2009</xref>). Accumulation of Rh1 in Rab7-positive endosomes may explain the progressive microvillar collapse and reduced Rh1 protein levels in the cell body of <italic>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></italic>. Both, the microvillar degeneration and reduced PA levels of <italic>dPLD<sup>3.1 </sup></italic>retinae were rescued by a <italic>dPLD</italic> transgene with intact lipase activity and elevation of PA levels was sufficient to rescue this phenotype. Collectively, our observations strongly suggest that photoreceptors depend on a light-activated <italic>dPLD</italic> to generate PA to maintain apical membrane turnover during illumination. They also suggest that protein-protein interactions of PLD, independent of its catalytic activity, may not be a primary mechanism underlying the function of this enzyme in cells.</p><p>In principle, the number of RLVs seen in a photoreceptor following illumination is a balance between ongoing endocytosis and processes that remove endocytosed RLVs either by recycling to the microvillar membrane or targeting to the late endosome-lysosome system for degradation. Using the temperature-sensitive allele of dynamin <italic>shi<sup>ts1</sup></italic>, we were able to uncouple RLV endocytosis from their removal from the cell body and found that the generation of RLVs during illumination was not dependent on <italic>dPLD</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>) and the number of Rab5-positive RLVs was not increased in <italic>dPLD<sup>3.1 </sup></italic>photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Collectively, these observations suggest no primary defect in clathrin dependent endocytosis in <italic>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></italic>. However, we found that in <italic>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></italic>, the clearance of endocytosed RLVs was dramatically slower than in controls implying that dPLD supports a process that clears RLVs from the cell body. These RLVs were Rab7-positive suggesting that they accumulate in late endosomes. Conversely, in <italic>Rh1&gt;dPLD</italic>, the number of Rab7-positive RLVs was fewer than in wild-type cells. Together, these observations strongly suggest that <italic>dPLD</italic> activity supports a process that clears RLVs post endocytosis.</p><p>Following endocytosis, endosomes containing trans-membrane proteins (such as Rh1) can be targeted for lysosomal degradation or be retrieved for recycling to other membranes through retromer-dependent processes. The enhanced RLV numbers as well as retinal degeneration in <italic>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></italic> could be rescued by enhancing retromer activity and the ability of <italic>dPLD</italic> overexpression to reduce RLV number during illumination required intact retromer activity. Together, these observations suggest that during illumination <italic>dPLD</italic> stimulates RLV clearance through a retromer-dependent mechanism. We found enhanced number of Rab7-positive RLVs in <italic>dPLD</italic><sup><italic>3.1</italic></sup> and <italic>Rh1&gt;dPLD</italic> had reduced number of Rab7-positive RLVs. A previous study has reported that retromer activity can clear RLVs from a Rab7-positive compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Together, our findings suggest that in the absence of dPLD the sorting of RLVs away from Rab7 endosomes into retromer-dependent recycling is inefficient.</p><p>Why might cargo sorting in <italic>dPLD<sup>3.1 </sup></italic>be abnormal ? Sorting reactions in vesicular transport often involve a small GTPase working in conjunction with a lipid-metabolizing enzyme. Altering <italic>garz</italic> function, presumably altering Arf1-GTP levels, has three consequences: (i) in wild-type cells, enhancing <italic>garz</italic> levels results in fewer RLVs and blocks the rise in RLVs seen during light exposure. (ii) enhancing <italic>garz</italic> levels reduces RLV accumulation in <italic>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></italic> (iii) enhancing <italic>garz</italic> levels suppresses degeneration in <italic>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></italic> while depleting <italic>garz</italic> in wild-type flies results in light-dependent retinal degeneration with a time course similar to that seen in <italic>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></italic>. Thus, an Arf1-GTP dependent step is required for both RLV turnover and maintaining apical domain size in photoreceptors. Our finding that the ability of <italic>Rh1&gt;dPLD</italic> to modulate RLV number requires intact <italic>garz</italic> function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) is consistent with this model. These findings imply that Arf1-GTP levels positively regulate a step that enhances RLV recycling to the microvillar plasma membrane in the face of ongoing light-induced endocytosis, presumably through retromer complex activity. In support of this idea, we found that the ability of <italic>Rh1&gt;garz</italic> to reduce RLV numbers during illumination depends on intact retromer function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). We propose, that during illumination, rhabdomere size is maintained by the balance between clathrin-dependent endocytosis generating RLVs and an Arf1-GTP dependent sorting event that recycles RLVs to the plasma membrane via retromer activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). <italic>dPLD</italic>, specifically its product PA is likely able to balance these two reactions by coupling light-induced endocytosis to Arf1-dependent sorting of RLVs into the recycling pathway. Previous studies have identified proteins from brain cytosol that bind PA <italic>in vitro</italic> and are known to regulate membrane transport events; prominent among these was Arf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Manifava et al., 2001</xref>) although the <italic>in vivo</italic> significance of this binding is unknown. Our findings that the biological activity of Arf1<sup>CA</sup> in photoreceptors requires intact <italic>dPLD</italic> activity and that the ability of increased <italic>garz</italic> (Arf1-GEF) levels to clear RLVs requires intact <italic>dPLD</italic> function suggests that Arf1 is a key target of PA generated by dPLD in mediating sorting and recycling of RLVs in photoreceptors. It has been reported that EHD1 an ATPase required to generate tubular recycling endosomes is recruited by MICAL-L1 and the BAR domain protein syndapin2 both of which bind PA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Giridharan et al., 2013</xref>). It is possible that these proteins are also targets of PA generated by dPLD. In the absence of PA, RLV sorting into the recycling pathway is impaired in <italic>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></italic>, some fraction of the endocytosed RLVs accumulates in Rab7 endosomes and is targeted for degradation leading to the reduction in Rh1 levels. These reduced Rh1 levels likely account for the reduced light sensitivity of dPLD mutants reported both in this study as well as in a previous analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">LaLonde et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>What is the transduction pathway between photon absorption and dPLD activation? <italic>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></italic> photoreceptors show normal electrical responses to light and the microvillar degeneration of <italic>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></italic> could not be suppressed by a strong hypmorph of <italic>dGq</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Scott et al., 1995</xref>) that is required for PLCβ dependent phototransduction. We also found that light-activated elevation of PA levels was dependent on dPLD activity but did not require Gq-PLCβ signalling. Collectively, these findings imply that <italic>dPLD</italic> activity is dispensable for Gq-PLCβ mediated activation of TRP channels and that the light-dependent degeneration of <italic>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></italic> is not a consequence of abnormal TRP channel activation.</p><p>Our findings suggest that M activates dPLD without the requirement of Gq function, although the molecular mechanism remains to be determined. dPLD has been reported to be localized in the submicrovillar cisternae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">LaLonde et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Raghu et al., 2009</xref>), a specialization of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum that is positioned ca. 10 nm from the plasma membrane at the base of the microvilli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yadav et al., 2016</xref>). At this location, dPLD might bind to the C-terminal tail of M either before or after it is endocytosed into RLV; binding of mammalian PLD1 has been reported to the C-terminal tail of several rhodopsin superfamily GPCRs including the 5-HT2<sub>a</sub>, muscarinic and opioid receptors [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barclay et al., 2011</xref>) and references therein]. It is possible that PA produced by dPLD bound to the C-terminus of Rh1 may then stimulate recycling to the apical membrane. Thus, the control of apical membrane turn over by dPLD during illumination may represent an example by which ligand bound GPCRs signal without a direct involvement for heterotrimeric G-protein activity. More generally in the brain,neurons and glial cells express GPCRs (5-HT2a, mGluR and opioid receptors) of key functional importance. Controlling these GPCR numbers on the plasma membrane during receptor stimulation (of which rhodopsin turnover during illumination is a prototypical example) is of critical importance to brain function and mechanisms that regulate this process will likely be crucial for the understanding and treatment of neuropsychiatric syndromes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly cultures and stocks</title><p>Flies were reared on medium containing corn flour, sugar, yeast powder and agar along with antibacterial and antifungal agents.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Randy Schekman as the Reviewing and Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Vytas Bankaitis (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper Thakur et al. describe a role for phospholipase D (PLD) in regulating membrane turnover in <italic>Drosophila</italic> photoreceptor neurons. The paper makes a solid argument that re-cycling of rhodopsin relies upon a retromer-dependent, PLD-dependent mechanism. Here phosphatidic acid generated by light-activated PLD (via a pathway independent of trimeric G protein activation) is proposed to activate Arf1 and this in turn regulates recycling of the rhodopsin back to the rhabdomere membrane. The significance of this work is that it provides the first confident description of a PLD phenotype in a multicellular eukaryote and in a quantifiable and powerful system of intense lipid signaling. The work is generally thorough, well-controlled and brings new perspective to a field of lipid signaling that badly needs it.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The genetics would clearly be strengthened by an additional allele or two of PLD and, most importantly, the authors must show that PLD is a null, a significant concern given the molecular nature of the mutation. Minimally this can be done by comparing the effects of homozygotes to one in which <italic>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></italic> mutation is placed in trans to a deletion removing the gene.</p><p>2) The approaches taken are powerful and the conclusions are generally well-supported. What is missing, however, is a demonstration of what component is PA-activated. This is an important issue as roles for PLD in regulating endosomal trafficking and membrane biogenesis have been demonstrated in yeast. Although the authors devote considerable discussion to the issue, they should address it experimentally. garz seems a likely candidate. It should not be necessary to conduct a full characterization of target but it would be worthwhile for the authors to at least assess whether garz, any fly retromer components, or fly ARF itself bind PA. there are already clues that mammalian ARF binds PA so a likely candidate is already known.</p><p>3) The genetic epistasis data argue PLD activates Arf and not the other way around (as dogma has long held). This point should be emphasized and it reinforces the importance of defining the target of regulation by PA as outlined in (a).</p><p>4) Have the authors conducted a stimulation train where they compare response run-down in wt vs. pld retina? They report a single burst ERG, but the run-down would be a more informative experiment.</p><p>5) The fact that several independent means for elevating PA result in suppression of pld defects argues that PLD protein::protein interactions are not functionally important. The authors should emphasize this point more forcefully as there is a large literature on the PLD interactome with much speculation on what it might mean.</p><p>6. In the subsection “dPLD activity supports RLV removal from the cell body during illumination”, last paragraph, first sentence – please provide the reference.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below. There is no accompanying Author response.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Phospholipase D activity couples plasma membrane endocytosis with retromer dependent recycling&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman as the Senior and Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>Your manuscript has been improved but the reviewers feel that a bit more work is needed to justify your conclusions. The Spo20 control experiment shows that the liposome binding of this protein is specific to PA (as is expected) and that it is concentration-dependent. However, you should examine dARF binding over the same range of concentration of PtdOH rather than showing one concentration in one Figure panel (8D) and another in the supplemental data. In addition, you should include a PtdSer control as well. Although one reviewer felt that the PtdOH binding data being omitted, the consensus was that you should perform the additional experiment as suggested above. This should be straightforward and it would lend biochemical support to your strong genetic/biological data.</p><p>Full comments of the reviewers:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The response to my concerns about the genetics and additional alleles is satisfactory. I am skeptical about the biochemistry showing binding of Arf1 to PA. Several issues concern me: 1) The binding is weak, as they indicate; 2) the experiments are not well described; and 3) the discrepancy between the behavior of Spo2 (positive control) binding at different ratios of POPC/PA and Arf1 vs POPC/PA are problematic. The binding of at 70:30 is optimal for Spo2 and at 90:10 the binding is weak. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref> shows binding at 90:10. What was the binding at different concentrations? I will leave it to the lipid biochemists to give it their expert evaluation but I am skeptical of the data. It looks too different from the positive control to be compelling. I would prefer the authors leave the issue of the protein binding to PA unresolved than presenting data of this quality.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors have done a reasonable job in positively addressing the comments raised in the initial review. They have revised the text of the manuscript to better highlight what this reviewer considers to be outstanding points made by the data. While it would have been ideal to pin-point a clear target for PLD-generated PtdOH in regulating Arf or the retromer complex, the likelihood of multiple targets does make this potentially an unattainable result in the time frame allotted. The fact that Arf does bind PtdOH provides biochemistry that is at least consistent with the pathway laid out by the genetics. In summary, this is an important paper and I am satisfied with the revisions made.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18515.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The genetics would clearly be strengthened by an additional allele or two of PLD and, most importantly, the authors must show that PLD is a null, a significant concern given the molecular nature of the mutation.

The slightly slower rate of degeneration in <italic>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></italic>/Df (2R)ED1612 is likely due to the reason that Df (2R)ED1612, removes, in addition to dPLD, 115 other genes one or more of which may have a modifier effect on the dPLD phenotype.</p><p><italic>2) The approaches taken are powerful and the conclusions are generally well-supported.

This is an important issue as roles for PLD in regulating endosomal trafficking and membrane biogenesis have been demonstrated in yeast.

It should not be necessary to conduct a full characterization of target but it would be worthwhile for the authors to at least assess whether garz, any fly retromer components, or fly ARF itself bind PA. there are already clues that mammalian ARF binds PA so a likely candidate is already known.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the molecular mechanism by which PA exerts its effects is an important issue. However, it is also a challenging one given that there are dozens of proteins that have been shown to bind PA in vitro. In the context of the present study, Arf1, garz and retromer components are plausible protein targets to which PA might bind and exert its effects. Given the large number of proteins in the retromer complex it was difficult to decide on which ones to study. However we performed in vitro liposome based binding assays to test PA binding to endogenous <italic>Drosophila</italic> Arf1 and GARZ. We could not demonstrate binding of garz to PA containing liposomes (Figure 8—figure supplement 1C). However, we were able to demonstrate weak binding of endogenous <italic>Drosophila</italic> Arf1 to PA containing liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). The ability of Arf1 to bind to PA containing liposomes was weak in comparison to that of the well-known PA binding protein Spo20. Up to 30% PA was required to show good binding of Arf1 to PA containing liposomes. Together with our finding that the biological effects of expressing Arf1CA on photoreceptors required intact dPLD function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), the in vitro binding assay suggests that Arf1 is a likely protein target of PA produced by PLD.</p><p><italic>3) The genetic epistasis data argue PLD activates Arf and not the other way around (as dogma has long held).

They report a single burst ERG, but the run-down would be a more informative experiment.</italic> </p><p>We have now included two additional physiological protocols (i) Photoreceptors were exposed to a continuous 10 s flash of light to check for any run down/loss of response. This was not seen; the raw traces and quantified data is now included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>. (ii) We also stimulated photoreceptors with a train of rapid flashes at the high light intensity. Once again there was no difference between the response of <italic>dPLD<sup>3.1</sup></italic> and controls; both continued to respond in an equivalent way with no loss of electrical response.
