Here, we describe a rare example of a naturally occurring transdifferentiation event in zebrafish in which kidney distal tubule epithelial cells are converted into an endocrine gland known as the Corpuscles of Stannius (CS). We find that this process requires Notch signalling and is associated with the cytoplasmic sequestration of the Hnf1b transcription factor, a master-regulator of renal tubule fate. A deficiency in the Irx3b transcription factor results in ectopic transdifferentiation of distal tubule cells to a CS identity but in a Notch-dependent fashion. Using live-cell imaging we show that CS cells undergo apical constriction <italic>en masse</italic> and are then extruded from the tubule to form a distinct organ. This system provides a valuable new model to understand the molecular and morphological basis of transdifferentiation and will advance efforts to exploit this rare phenomenon therapeutically.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transdifferentiation</kwd><kwd>kidney</kwd><kwd>endocrine gland</kwd><kwd>Hnf1b</kwd><kwd>Irx3b</kwd><kwd>Notch</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001509</institution-id><institution>Royal Society of New Zealand</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RSNZ/JSP-UOA1401-JR</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davidson</surname><given-names>Alan J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001505</institution-id><institution>Health Research Council of New Zealand</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HRC 15/057</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davidson</surname><given-names>Alan J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001505</institution-id><institution>Health Research Council of New Zealand</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13/332</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davidson</surname><given-names>Alan J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A rare example of direct transdifferentiation is discovered in zebrafish in which kidney epithelial cells change into an endocrine gland and undergo live-cell extrusion from the renal tubule.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transdifferentiation is the poorly understood process by which a mature cell is converted to a completely different cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tosh and Slack, 2002</xref>). Under normal biological settings, transdifferentiation is a rare phenomenon, although it can be readily induced experimentally by forcing the expression of genes that direct cell fate changes, such as the classic example of the MyoD transcription factor being able to convert fibroblasts into muscle lineage cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tapscott et al., 1988</xref>). The process of transdifferentiation can be either direct, whereby a mature cell converts seamlessly into another mature cell type, or indirect, whereby there is a requirement for dedifferentiation to a more immature intermediary cell type, followed by differentiation into the new fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thowfeequ et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Merrell and Stanger, 2016</xref>). Examples of transdifferentiation occurring in a developmental setting are uncommon, the best studied cases are in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos with the indirect transdifferentiation of rectal epithelial Y cells into cholinergic motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jarriault et al., 2008</xref>) and the formation of MCM interneurons from AMso glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sammut et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In vertebrates, direct transdifferentiation is largely limited to the adult setting where it is associated with response to injury. For example, ablation of pancreatic β-cells induces the transdifferentiation of resident α-cells to β-cells in both mice and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thorel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ye et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, in the liver, chronic injury promotes the conversion of hepatocytes to biliary epithelial cells through the combined action of the Notch and Hippo signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yanger et al., 2013</xref>). Cases of indirect transdifferentiation in vertebrates include the well-known example of lens regeneration in amphibians following lentectomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stone, 1967</xref>), in which retinal pigmented epithelial cells initiate expression of pluripotency genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maki et al., 2009</xref>), dedifferentiate and then mature into lens cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sánchez Alvarado and Tsonis, 2006</xref>). Indirect transdifferentiation is considered to occur in some cancers, via the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and dedifferentiation that often accompanies tumourigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shekhani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maddodi and Setaluri, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maniotis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fang et al., 2005</xref>). In summary, while transdifferentiation in vivo is possible under normal and pathogenic settings, it remains a rare and poorly understood phenomenon.</p><p>The zebrafish offers a visually accessible vertebrate model with which to study cell fate changes in the context of organogenesis. The embryonic kidney (pronephros) is particularly well-suited for these studies because of its readily visualised location within the embryo and a high degree of understanding of how cell division, differentiation and morphogenesis are co-ordinated during organ formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Drummond et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Majumdar et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wingert and Davidson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wingert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wingert and Davidson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Naylor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Naylor et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Naylor et al., 2017</xref>). The zebrafish pronephros is analogous to the filtering units in the mammalian kidney (nephrons) and consists of a midline-fused blood filter (glomerulus), attached to bilateral renal tubules that extend to the cloaca (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Drummond et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wingert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wingert and Davidson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Drummond and Davidson, 2010</xref>). The tubules are subdivided into functionally distinct segments consisting of the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), the proximal straight tubule (PST), the distal early tubule (DE), and the distal late segment (DL; Figure 1 and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wingert et al., 2007</xref>]). Each tubule segment expresses a specific set of genes that defines its functional differentiation. The PCT and PST are associated with bulk re-absorption of solutes from the filtrate and express a wide variety of solute transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wingert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Blaine et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ullrich and Murer, 1982</xref>). In contrast, the DE and DL segments express fewer transporters, suggesting that they function more to fine-tune the composition of the filtrate. For example, functionality of the DE segment is conferred by the expression of <italic>slc12a1</italic>, encoding a Na-K-Cl co-transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wingert et al., 2007</xref>). The transcription factor Hnf1b is a major regulator of renal tubule identity in both zebrafish and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Naylor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heliot et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Massa et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>hnf1b</italic>-deficient zebrafish embryos, solute transporter expression fails to initiate in the tubule segments and the kidney tubules remain as a simple, non-transporting, tubular epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Naylor et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Above the pronephric tubules, and initially forming at the junction between the DE and DL segments, is positioned an endocrine gland called the Corpuscles of Stannius (CS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The CS gland in teleost fish is responsible for secreting Stanniocalcin-1 (Stc1), a hormone involved in the homeostatic regulation of calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheng and Wingert, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tseng et al., 2009</xref>). The CS glands consist of lobes of epithelial cells that are separated by strands of connective tissue containing blood vessels and nerve tracts, which is quite distinct from the cuboidal polarised epithelium that constitutes the pronephric tubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Menke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cohen et al., 1975</xref>). As such, the CS gland is a functionally and structurally distinct organ that shares little homology, other than an epithelial state, to the kidney. Despite this, early observations have led to the suggestion that the CS gland originates from the pronephric tubules, although its formation has not been extensively characterised.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38911.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CS extrusion is achieved by apical extrusion of multiple renal epithelial cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Lateral views of a stage series analysis of CS extrusion in a single live <italic>Tg(cdh17:egfp)</italic> embryo (top panels) and embryos fixed at the stages shown and stained for <italic>cdh17</italic>(purple)/<italic>stc1</italic>(red).

We find that the molecular pathways that control this transdifferentiation event involve Notch signalling, cytoplasmic sequestration of the renal identity factor Hnf1b, and inhibitory signals conferred by the Iroquois transcription factor Irx3b. Together, these results demonstrate a rare example of direct transdifferentiation under normal physiological conditions in a vertebrate.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CS cells originate in the renal tubule and are extruded to form a gland</title><p>To better understand CS gland formation, we first examined expression of <italic>stanniocalcin-1</italic> (<italic>stc1</italic>), a marker of CS fate, and <italic>cdh17</italic>, a pan-renal tubule marker that encodes a cadherin involved in cell-to-cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horsfield et al., 2002</xref>). We found that at 24 hr post-fertilisation (hpf), transcripts for <italic>cdh17</italic> are down-regulated in the posterior most portion of the DE segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Concomitant with this, the first <italic>stc1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells appear in this region and increase in number. By 32 hpf the <italic>stc1<sup>+</sup></italic> + appear as a prominent bulge on the dorsal side of the tubule and at 50 hpf, they are found as discrete, and separate, structures on top of each pronephric tubule in ~70% of animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These observations suggest that CS cells arise from renal epithelial cells via transdifferentiation and are then physically extruded from the tubule.</p><p>To visualise the process of CS gland formation, live time-lapse imaging was performed on <italic>Tg(cdh17:egfp)</italic> embryos from 24 to 50 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Presumptive CS cells were observed to bulge out of the dorsal wall of the tubule concomitant with the constriction of their apical membranes. Immunostaining of sagittal cross-sections through the CS region at this stage showed that the cells adopt a wedge shape with narrowed apical membranes (marked by Phalloidin<sup>+</sup> F-actin, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As apical constriction increased, we observed that the adjacent non-CS epithelial cells moved closer together and the CS cells protruded dorsally as an arch two cell layers wide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The epithelial cells on either side of the CS cells eventually met at 42 hpf in most animals, followed by extrusion of the CS gland from the tubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The timing of extrusion was variable but was complete in the majority of embryos by 60 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We found that during extrusion from the tubule, the <italic>epithelial cell adhesion molecule</italic> gene (<italic>epcam</italic>) remains continuously expressed in CS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and the major epithelial cell adhesion protein Cadherin-1 (Cdh1) is retained on the basolateral membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that the epithelial status of CS cells is not changed during extrusion. After CS cell extrusion, Cdh1 is detectable at the interface between CS and tubular cells and is prominent on the lateral membranes of CS cells, similar to renal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, once extruded Cdh1 immunostaining is largely lost from the interface between CS cells and tubular cells but remains on the basal surface of some CS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, dotted box region). In addition, F-actin staining, which demarcates the apical surface of tubular cells, is lost in the extruded CS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results suggest a model in which renal epithelial cells transdifferentiate directly into CS cells, without a loss of epithelial character, extrude from the tubule following apical constriction, and form a distinct ball of unpolarised glandular epithelium.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-38911-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38911.003</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Time-lapse imaging showing extrusion of the CS endocrine gland from the pronephric tubule Movie shows a lateral view of the posterior trunk region of a Tg(cdh17:egfp) embryo between 32 hpf and 48 hpf.</title><p>Green fluorescent cells label the pronephric tubule and the CS cells, with the latter observed as a bulge of cells that undergo extrusion during the time-lapse.</p></caption></media><p>One possibility is that the renal epithelial cells in the tubular region that gives rise to the CS have retained some progenitor-like state and direct transdifferentiation is not occurring in the strictest sense. To explore this, we closely examined the expression of the renal progenitor marker <italic>lhx1a</italic> from 14 to 50 hpf. At 14 hpf, transcripts for <italic>lhx1a</italic> are found throughout the intermediate mesoderm in mesenchymal cells but are rapidly downregulated in all tubule precursors by 16 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), when the transition to an epithelial tube occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerlach and Wingert, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Naylor et al., 2016a</xref>). This transition corresponds with the restriction of other markers of renal progenitor state, such as pax2a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Majumdar et al., 2000</xref>) and pax8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tosh and Slack, 2002</xref>), although expression of these genes are retained in the DL segment where they likely play later roles in growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bouchard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Torres et al., 1995</xref>). To demonstrate that the tubule has achieved an advanced state of epithelial differentiation prior to <italic>stc1</italic> transcripts appearing, we confirmed at 22 hpf that the DE segment contains apically localised F-actin and basally deposited Laminin and Collagen type IV, indicative of apical tight junctions and a basolateral basement membrane, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In addition, the DE segment at this time point uniformly expresses <italic>slc12a1</italic>, <italic>atp1a1a.4</italic> and the <italic>krt18</italic> (but not <italic>stc1</italic>), consistent with having the identity of a differentiated transporting epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). At 50 hpf, the DE segment continues to be marked by the expression of <italic>slc12a1</italic>, <italic>atp1a1a.4</italic> and <italic>krt18</italic> whereas the extruded CS cells do not express these genes. Instead, staining with Phalloidin and antibodies to Laminin and Collagen type IV shows that the CS gland has lost apically localised F-actin and is enveloped by a separate basement membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Taken together, these results support the notion that by 22 hpf, the DE segment has differentiated into a renal tubular epithelium, and that a subset of these cells then transdifferentiate into CS cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38911.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>CS extrusion is mediated by apical constriction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Panels show lateral views of the markers indicated in the region of the trunk where the CS will be derived (at 22 hpf) and is extruded (at 50 hpf).

Together, these results establish a new model system to understand the molecular and cellular processes governing cellular plasticity in vivo.</p><p>Our data indicate that the transdifferentiation of DE to CS fate occurs in sequential steps and the finding that CS cell numbers are reduced by pharmacological inhibition of Notch signalling from 18 hpf onwards, just prior to the appearance of <italic>stc1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells, suggests that the Notch pathway plays an early instructive role. In support of this, we found evidence of Notch-Rbpj signalling in CS cells using the <italic>TP1:Venus-PEST</italic> reporter, although the earliest we could detect fluorescence was 36 hpf, perhaps reflecting the delay needed to accumulate enough VenusPEST protein to be detectable. Interestingly, we also failed to see Venus-PEST fluorescence in developing multi-ciliated cells that are induced by Notch around 16 hpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma and Jiang, 2007</xref>), therefore the reporter may not be sensitive enough to detect all Notch signalling.</p><p>In conflict to the notion that Notch induces CS fate, global overexpression of <italic>nicd1</italic>, encoding the constitutively active signalling moiety of the Notch one receptor, has been reported to decrease CS cell number, whereas treatment with the Notch inhibitors DAPT or cpdE (our study) starting at the end of gastrulation increases CS cell number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Drummond et al., 2017</xref>). The molecular basis for these contradictory outcomes is not clear and needs more investigation. It is possible that Notch signalling is serving multiple functions at different times of development, as found in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guruharsha et al., 2012</xref>). For instance, early perturbation of Notch signalling may lead to the renal cells being more competent to transdifferentiate at later stages, either by overcoming a requirement for Notch later, or by lowering their threshold to respond so that they are exquisitely sensitive at later stages, despite the Notch pathway being dampened in the presence of an inhibitor.</p><p>Notch has well-described roles in determining binary cell fate decisions during progenitor cell decisions including in the zebrafish pronephros where it acts by a classical lateral-inhibition mechanism to inhibit a multi-ciliated phenotype in renal progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma and Jiang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marra and Wingert, 2016</xref>). A similar lateral-inhibition pathway may be required for the DE-to-CS transdifferentiation but with the timing of this occurring after the multi-ciliated cell fate decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wingert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma and Jiang, 2007</xref>). We, and others have found that a number of Notch signalling components are expressed in the pronephric tubules during the period that the CS gland arises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wingert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma and Jiang, 2007</xref>). A comprehensive loss-of-function analysis of these genes is needed in order to determine which of these is involved in CS formation. In the context of transdifferentiation, work in <italic>C. elegans</italic> has implicated Notch in the conversion of rectal epithelial Y cells into motor neurons, although in this case the Y cell transitions to an intermediary cell state rather than directly transdifferentiating as seen in our study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jarriault et al., 2008</xref>). In a mammalian example, bronchial cells known as ‘club’ cells, which depend on active Notch for their maintenance, switch to a ciliated phenotype following disruption of Notch signalling in adult mice, without an apparent dedifferentiation stage or need for cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lafkas et al., 2015</xref>). In this example, ‘club’ cells and ciliated cells share a common progenitor during lung development whereas in our study the renal and glandular lineages have, until now, been considered to be developmentally distinct fates. Indeed, the conversion we see of a renal epithelial cell becoming an endocine gland can be considered more of a trans-organogenesis event.</p><p>Mechanistically, how Notch signalling induces the DE to CS fate switch requires more study. Our observation that the Hnf1b transcription factor, a master regulator of renal epithelial fate, becomes sequestered in the cytoplasm of cells undergoing transdifferentiation suggests that Notch regulates the levels of Hnf1b in the nucleus either by inducing Hnf1b nuclear export or alternatively, if the nuclear turnover of Hnf1b is high, by preventing newly translated Hnf1b from entering the nucleus. We favour the former notion as Hnf1b is considered a relatively stable ‘bookmarking’ factor that remains associated with chromatin during cell division where it reinstates transcriptional programs following mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Verdeguer et al., 2010</xref>). As Hnf1b is critical for renal tubule differentiation in zebrafish and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Naylor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heliot et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Massa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Naylor and Davidson, 2014</xref>), we hypothesise that there is an on-going requirement for Hnf1b in the tubule to maintain renal epithelial identity and that sequestration of this factor is sufficient to induce the transdifferentiation of DE cells into CS cells. In support of this, we found that <italic>hnf1b</italic>-deficient embryos show ectopic <italic>stc1</italic> expression along a broad stretch of the pronephric tubule, consistent with a CS program being activated in these cells. Whether CS identity is a default state in the tubule is unclear, but we have observed that the Notch ligand <italic>jagged-2a</italic> is abnormally maintained in the pronephric tubule of <italic>hnf1b</italic>-deficient embryos (data not shown) consistent with aberrant Notch signalling also being involved in the induction of ectopic <italic>stc1</italic>. The notion that sequestration of a master transcription factor can induce transdifferentiation provides a new paradigm for the field, as most studies of cell fate plasticity have reported a need for regulatory factors to be up-regulated in order to drive the process, particularly those involving non-physiological ‘reprogramming’ (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Daniel et al., 2016</xref>]).</p><p>Our data point to the Irx3b transcription factor as playing an important role in the DE-to-CS fate switch. We have previously linked Hnf1b and Irx3b together by demonstrating that <italic>hnf1b</italic>-deficient embryos fail to express <italic>irx3b</italic> in the renal tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Naylor et al., 2013</xref>), placing <italic>hnf1b</italic> upstream of <italic>irx3b</italic> in a genetic hierarchy. In this study we show that <italic>irx3b</italic> deficiency does not influence the initial specification of the DE segment as previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wingert and Davidson, 2011</xref>) but instead leads to the dramatic transdifferentiation of this segment into CS cells. Consistent with our notion that Hnf1b sequestration drives this transdifferentiation, we found that the ectopic CS cells display cytoplasmic Hnf1b. Furthermore, inhibiting Notch signalling rescued the CS expansion phenotype in <italic>irx3b</italic>-deficient animals, including Hnf1b nuclear localisation, placing Irx3b upstream or in parallel to the Notch pathway. Irx/Iroquois family transcription factors have been reported to modulate Notch signalling in other cellular contexts. Most notably during <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye development, where the Iroquois genes establish where Notch activation occurs by controlling the levels of Fringe, a glycosyltransferase that alters the sensitivity of the Notch receptors to transactivation from the different classes of Notch ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Panin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moloney et al., 2000</xref>). In vertebrates, including zebrafish, there are three Fringe homologues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Qiu et al., 2004</xref>) but their expression patterns during CS formation have not been closely examined. One speculative idea is that Irx3b modulates Notch signalling in the DE segment via the regulation of <italic>fringe</italic> or other Notch pathway genes, to ensure that the CS-inducing effects of Notch signalling are suppressed. This may occur by promoting one Notch-Ligand pairing over another or by altering the strength of the Notch signal. It is also interesting to note that cross-regulatory interactions between Notch and Irx3 have been shown in human microvascular endothelial cells where <italic>Irx3</italic> induces expression of <italic>Delta-like ligand four</italic> but is in turn repressed by the Notch mediator Hey1 via direct binding to the <italic>Irx3</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Scarlett et al., 2015</xref>). How the proposed repressive effects of Irx3b on Notch signalling are overcome so that the DE-to-CS transdifferentiation event can be initiated at the appropriate time during development remain to be determined in future studies. Similarly, how the Notch, Irx3b and Hnf1b factors interact with other transcriptional regulators that have been reported to control CS cell number, such as Sim1a and Tbx2a/b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheng and Wingert, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Drummond et al., 2017</xref>), also need investigating.</p><p>The second key step in the transdifferentiation of DE cells to a CS gland is the expulsion of the fate-changed cells from the basal side of the tubule. This process presents a challenge to the embryo as any loss of cells from the epithelium has the potential to compromise the barrier function of the tubule and cause lumenal fluid to leak out into the interstitium. Our live-cell imaging revealed that the first step in achieving this feat is the constriction of the apical membranes of the CS cells. Apical constriction is a well-known feature of polarised epithelia that drives bending, folding and tube formation during the formation of different tissues and organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sawyer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martin et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mason et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sadler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martin and Goldstein, 2014</xref>). Apical constriction is driven by contraction of an apical meshwork of F-actin by the molecular motor myosin IIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martin et al., 2009b</xref>) and consistent with this, we found that blebbistatin treatment inhibited CS cell extrusion. Interestingly, in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye-antennal disc, Notch activation has been found to trigger actomyosin-mediated cell apical constriction, raising the possibility that the Notch pathway may both induce DE-to-CS transdifferentiation and initiate apical constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ku and Sun, 2017</xref>).</p><p>In the developing avian lung, where the tubular epithelium of the primary bronchus undergoes apical constriction in localised areas, the result is the formation of lung buds that then grow out as new airways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Locy WA, 1916</xref>). Unlike this system, the ‘bud’ of CS cells we observe is made up of far fewer cells, does not transition to a tubular outgrowth and proliferation is not required for its extrusion, although we do observe CS cells proliferating once they are free from the tubule. Instead, the budding CS cells are ‘shed’ basally, <italic>en masse</italic>, as an intact ball of cells. Thus, we conclude that while apical constriction initiates the process, additional cellular behaviours must then be required to extrude the cells. One possible mechanism for CS cell extrusion is that the CS cells undergo EMT in order to disassemble their tight junctions with their neighbours. This is an attractive hypothesis, particularly given that this process operates in other related tissues such as the pancreas, where the primitive duct epithelium responds to low Notch signalling to down-regulate Cdh1 in single cells that then undergo EMT and delaminate as endocrine precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shih et al., 2012</xref>). However, we do not observe a loss of Cdh1, which is a widely used definition of EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kalluri and Weinberg, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, from our histological analysis we have not been able to capture an intermediary mesenchyme-like state and observe no migration of individual CS cells. Instead, we find that CS cells rapidly and seamlessly change from a cuboidal epithelium in the renal tubule to a simple lobular epithelium of the CS gland. Based on this, we favour a model in which CS cells are extruded by a non-EMT-based pathway that may be more comparable to the epithelial remodelling that occurs during primary spinal cord formation in the embryo. Here, the neural plate undergoes apical constriction and invaginates before pinching off as the neural tube while the surrounding non-neural ectoderm fuses together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nikolopoulou et al., 2017</xref>). The exact molecular mechanism for how barrier function is maintained during neural tube closure is not fully understood but epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transitions appear suppressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ray and Niswander, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Prior work has shown that overcrowding of epithelial sheets results in live cell extrusion of single cells by a mechanism that involves the formation of an actomyosin contractile ring in cells surrounding the extruded cell. This ring then contracts and the innermost cell is pushed out of the epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eisenhoffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gu et al., 2011</xref>). We performed laser ablations immediately anterior and posterior to the CS gland to disrupt such a ring in neighbouring cells but this failed to prevent CS extrusion. In addition, we have found that treating embryos with the S1P<sub>2</sub> receptor inhibitor JTE-013 has no effect on CS extrusion (data not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that this mechanism of live cell extrusion is playing a role in CS gland shedding.</p><p>Taken together, our data show that the conversion of DE cells to a CS gland fate in the zebrafish renal tubule represents a novel example of a developmentally programmed direct transdifferentiation event coupled to an unusual live cell extrusion behaviour. This model provides new ways to interrogate the plasticity of differentiated cellular states, will advance efforts to harness transdifferentiation for therapeutic applications, and furthers our understanding of epithelial cell behaviours.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish husbandry</title><p>Zebrafish embryos were maintained and staged according to established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kimmel et al., 1995</xref>) and in accordance with the University of Auckland’s Animal Ethics Committee (protocol 001343).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A novel mechanism of gland formation in zebrafish involving transdifferentiation of kidney cells and live cell extrusion&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Benjamin M Hogan (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Naylor and Davidson show an intriguing process whereby a subset of developing kidney epithelial cells transdifferentiate, extrude from the epithelial tubules and form the Corpuscles of Stannius (CS) – an endocrine gland. They suggest that the process is regulated by apical constriction within the epithelial tube and by a molecular pathway involving Hnf1, Irx3b and Notch signalling. The study combines some very nice live imaging approaches with careful genetic analyses using zebrafish knockdown, mutant and chemical inhibition. It is very well written, presents logically and is generally supported by high quality data.</p><p>The finding overall is of interest as it identifies a new trans-differentiation process in developing epithelia and opens up a new model to study this process.</p><p>However, there are several points where the depth of analysis does leave some room for doubt (such as the Notch signalling data, the issue of transdifferentiation - see below) and at many places there seemed to be a lack of quantitative data to support the observations being made. I outline below major and minor issues that should be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The claim that Notch signalling regulates CS trans-differentiation is supported by analysis of the mindbomb mutant (which has a constitutive loss of Notch signalling) and treatment with the gamma secretase inhibitor cpdE, treated at one timepoint. This is very limited to support the conclusions, especially considering that there are conflicting data previously published (Drummond et al., 2016).</p><p>a) The Discussion section suggests that DAPT treatment timing (from late gastrulation instead of 18 hpf used here) may have led to the wrong conclusions in the earlier Drummond et al., study. Can the authors show if DAPT from 18 hpf but not late gastrulation reproduces their data? Likewise, does early gastrulation treatment with cpdE expand the CS domain? Having both inhibitors and multiple stages analysed would improve confidence in the Notch claims.</p><p>b) Can the authors show that restricted Notch signalling precedes CS morphogenesis (e.g. using a Notch reporter transgenic line)? Can timing of Notch be correlated with Hnf1b exclusion from tubule nuclei?</p><p>c) The findings that mindbomb mutants do not generate CS is also opposite to the general findings of Drummond et al. One issue is that by 50hpf, the mindbomb mutant does not form a proper kidney and thus no CS cells can form in the absence of the DE tubules. It appears that the Cadh17 staining is thinner in mindbomb than in WT embryos (Figure 6A). Thus, the statement that Notch is involved in CS formation is misleading and maybe secondary to proper kidney development.</p><p>- Please provide further validation and experimental evidence to support conclusions made relating to the role of Notch signalling.</p><p>2) To claim &quot;transdifferentiation&quot; is somewhat premature. The main concern is that in the strictest sense, transdifferentation occurs when a fully differentiated, mature cell type changes to new cell type and lose all characteristics of the original cell. The main issue here is that the pronephric tubule cells may still be poised in a progenitor state. This study focuses on a process that occurs from 24hpf to 50hpf. This is within larval developmental stages and that many cells are likely to be still poised in a progenitor fate and have not completed differentiation. To sufficiently argue that this is transdifferentiation, one would have to perform a detailed analysis of progenitor markers versus differentiation markers of the kidney tubule.</p><p>- Please provide further evidence that this is indeed a transdifferentiation event by using further marker analysis.</p><p>3) At many points there is limited quantitative information for each experiment. For example;</p><p>a) Figure 1 and Figure 2 show individual representative images of IF and ISH stains to show how CS morphogenesis occurs. No n values, measurements or quantitative approaches are used to assign these behaviours and so it is difficult to know how robust these observations are. The authors should provide some form of quantitative analysis of the process.</p><p>b) Cdh1 staining in Figure 2A is stated to be largely lost at 50hpf. This is not clear in the image shown. Some quantification or at least demarcate the region where this loss of expression is seen should be included. Also, the authors state that F-actin is lost in CS cells at 50 hpf, but there is only one image at 50hpf and not earlier stages to compare with.</p><p>c) Throughout the manuscript n-values are only given for treatments and not for controls. Control numbers should also be provided and statistical analysis provided for all the main findings.</p><p>d) How many mindbomb embryos were counted and were stc1+ cells counted or is the analysis purely qualitative based on the size of the stc1 stained region?</p><p>e) The Irx3b mutants – no n-values are provided and only cdh17 expression is analysed.

They suggest that the process is regulated by apical constriction within the epithelial tube and by a molecular pathway involving Hnf1, Irx3b and Notch signalling. The study combines some very nice live imaging approaches with careful genetic analyses using zebrafish knockdown, mutant and chemical inhibition. It is very well written, presents logically and is generally supported by high quality data.</p><p>The finding overall is of interest as it identifies a new trans-differentiation process in developing epithelia and opens up a new model to study this process.</p><p>However, there are several points where the depth of analysis does leave some room for doubt (such as the Notch signalling data, the issue of transdifferentiation -see below) and at many places there seemed to be a lack of quantitative data to support the observations being made. I outline below major and minor issues that should be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The claim that Notch signalling regulates CS trans-differentiation is supported by analysis of the mindbomb mutant (which has a constitutive loss of Notch signalling) and treatment with the gamma secretase inhibitor cpdE, treated at one timepoint. This is very limited to support the conclusions, especially considering that there are conflicting data previously published (Drummond et al., 2016).</p><p>a) The Discussion section suggests that DAPT treatment timing (from late gastrulation instead of 18 hpf used here) may have led to the wrong conclusions in the earlier Drummond et al., study. Can the authors show if DAPT from 18 hpf but not late gastrulation reproduces their data? Likewise, does early gastrulation treatment with cpdE expand the CS domain? Having both inhibitors and multiple stages analysed would improve confidence in the Notch claims.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we have performed DAPT and cpdE treatments from 10 hpf to 50 hpf and 18 hpf to 50 hpf. We find that the earlier treatment (10-50 hpf) does indeed expand the <italic>stc1</italic> expression domain with both DAPT (as previously reported by Drummond et al.,) and cpdE (shown here), but later treatment (18-50 hpf) with either γ-secretase inhibitor reproduced our previous finding of reduced <italic>stc1</italic> expression. These results are shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 3 of the resubmission. We conclude from this additional data that the timing of Notch signals is imperative for appropriate transdifferentiation of DE tubule cells to CS cells and have the following statement in the revised text:</p><p>“To assess the functional consequences of loss of Notch signalling, we treated wild-type zebrafish embryos with the γ-secretase inhibitor compound E (cpdE, Figure 6B) or DAPT (Figure 6—figure supplement 3A) from 18 hpf onwards and found reduced numbers of <italic>stc1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells. However, as reported previously <sup>48</sup> treatment with cpdE or DAPT from 10 hpf onwards paradoxically increased the size of the CS gland (Figure 6—figure supplement 3B), indicating that Notch signalling is associated with complex temporal effects on CS formation.”</p><p>and</p><p>“In conflict to the notion that Notch induces CS fate, global overexpression of <italic>nicd1</italic>, encoding the constitutively active signaling moiety of the Notch 1 receptor, has been reported to decrease CS cell number, whereas treatment with the Notch inhibitors DAPT or cpdE (our study) starting at the end of gastrulation increases CS cell number <sup>48</sup>. The molecular basis for these contradictory outcomes is not clear and needs more investigation. It is possible that Notch signaling is serving multiple functions at different times of development, as found in other contexts <sup>55</sup>. For instance, early perturbation of Notch signaling may lead to the renal cells being more competent to transdifferentiate at later stages, either by overcoming a requirement for Notch later, or by lowering their threshold to respond so that they are exquisitely sensitive at later stages, despite the Notch pathway being dampened in the presence of an inhibitor.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Can the authors show that restricted Notch signalling precedes CS morphogenesis (eg using a Notch reporter transgenic line)? Can timing of Notch be correlated with Hnf1b exclusion from tubule nuclei?</p></disp-quote><p>We first tried to use antibodies to NICD but these did not work on zebrafish tissues (at least in our hands). We then examined the Notch reporter (TP1:Venus-PEST) to detect Notch activity in the DE tubule from 18 hpf (Figure 6A and Figure 6—figure supplement 2 in the revised manuscript). We were unable to see any fluorescence in the presumptive CS cells prior to 36 hpf, but did see strong Notch reporter activity in the CS cells from 36 hpf onwards.</p><p>In the pronephros, multi-ciliated cells (MCCs) form within the PST and DE tubule segments from a Notch lateral inhibition mechanism between 16 hpf and 24 hpf (as described by Liu et al., 2007; Ma et al., 2007), but we were unable to observe Notch reporter activity in the MCCs prior to 36 hpf. Given this, we speculate that the Notch reporter may not be able to resolve all levels/instances of Notch activity in the pronephros. Later in development (from 36 hpf) the CS cells show very strong Notch activity in the reporter line (we include this new data in Figure 6A of the revised manuscript). To demonstrate the effectiveness of our Notch inhibitor compounds and also the effect of irx3b knockdown on Notch signalling, we have also included the Notch reporter activity in irx3b<sup>gRNA</sup> and cpdE treated embryos in parallel with our Hnf1b stains in Figure 6B of the revised manuscript. Quantitation of the level of fluorescence in the <italic>TP1:Venus-PEST</italic> embryos has been added as Figure 6D. We discuss the reporter in the revised text as follows:</p><p>Results section:</p><p>“We then went on to examine a link between Irx3b and Notch, as the Irx factors have been implicated as both positive and negative regulators of Notch signalling <sup>46,47</sup>. In addition, Notch has recently been connected to CS gland development <sup>48</sup> and Notch components are expressed in CS cells (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). We first analysed the <italic>TP1:VenusPEST</italic> Notch reporter line, which contains multiple RBP-Jk-binding sites in front of a minimal promoter <sup>49</sup>, and found Notch activity in CS cells from 36 hpf onwards (Figure 6A). This result is consistent with the Notch pathway playing a role in CS gland formation. We did not observe fluorescence in presumptive CS cells or tubule multi-ciliated cells (which have previously been shown to form in a Notch-dependent manner <sup>50,51</sup>) prior to 36 hpf (Figure 6—figure supplement 2), but this may reflect low sensitivity of the reporter.”</p><p>and</p><p>“Treatment with cpdE also reduced the <italic>TP1:VenusPEST</italic> fluorescence in control (n=28/28) and <italic>irx3b</italic> crispants (n=32/45) consistent with the inhibitory effects of cpdE on CS cell formation being mediated by a block in Notch-Rbpj signal transduction (Figure 6B). Together, these results support a model in which Notch signalling and the cytoplasmic sequestration of Hnf1b in a subset of DE epithelial cells leads to the transdifferentiation of renal epithelial cells into CS cells.</p><p>And Discussion section:</p><p>“Our data indicate that the transdifferentiation of DE to CS fate occurs in sequential steps and the finding that CS cell numbers are reduced by pharmacological inhibition of Notch signaling from 18 hpf onwards, just prior to the appearance of <italic>stc1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells, suggests that the Notch pathway plays an early instructive role. In support of this, we found evidence of Notch-Rbpj signaling in CS cells using the <italic>TP1:Venus-PEST</italic> reporter, although the earliest we could detect fluorescence was 36 hpf, perhaps reflecting the delay needed to accumulate enough VenusPEST protein to be detectable. Interestingly, we also failed to see Venus-PEST fluorescence in developing multi-ciliated cells that are induced by Notch around 16 hpf <sup>50,51</sup>, therefore the reporter may not be sensitive enough to detect all Notch signaling.“</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The findings that mindbomb mutants do not generate CS is also opposite to the general findings of Drummond et al. One issue is that by 50hpf, the mindbomb mutant does not form a proper kidney and thus no CS cells can form in the absence of the DE tubules. It appears that the Cadh17 staining is thinner in mindbomb than in WT embryos (Figure 6A). Thus, the statement that Notch is involved in CS formation is misleading and maybe secondary to proper kidney development.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the mindbomb mutant may have more global effects from the earliest stages of development that may mean any pronephric phenotype at 50 hpf is a secondary effect. Unfortunately, we were unable to characterise Mib mutants in time for resubmission due to the age of our existing fish stocks and failure to identify breeding pairs. Therefore, we have removed this data from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Please provide further validation and experimental evidence to support conclusions made relating to the role of Notch signalling.</p><p>2) To claim &quot;transdifferentiation&quot; is somewhat premature. The main concern is that in the strictest sense, transdifferentation occurs when a fully differentiated, mature cell type changes to new cell type and lose all characteristics of the original cell. The main issue here is that the pronephric tubule cells may still be poised in a progenitor state. This study focuses on a process that occurs from 24hpf to 50hpf. This is within larval developmental stages and that many cells are likely to be still poised in a progenitor fate and have not completed differentiation. To sufficiently argue that this is transdifferentiation, one would have to perform a detailed analysis of progenitor markers versus differentiation markers of the kidney tubule.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed further marker analysis in the revised manuscript as additional evidence of the DE-to-CS fate change being an example of transdifferentiation. Specifically, we have examined the expression of the renal progenitor marker <italic>lhx1a</italic> and shown that it downregulates around the time that the intermediate mesoderm transitions to an epithelial tubule (between 14-16 hpf). As this spatiotemporal pattern has already been reported for <italic>lhx1a</italic> (as well as other progenitor genes like Pax2a and Pax8), we have included these data in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. As evidence that the tubule at 22 hpf (just prior to the appearance of CS cells) is in a mature epithelial state rather than being progenitor-like, we have added stains for F-actin (apical tight junction), Collagen IV and Laminin (basement membrane), <italic>slc12a1</italic> (the solute transporter that characterises the functionality of the DE segment), <italic>atp1a1a.4</italic> (a subunit of the Na/K ATPase that is a characteristic of transporting epithelia) and <italic>krt18</italic> (a tough structural protein of epithelia). Together, we believe these markers demonstrate that the tubule at 22-24 hpf does not represent a progenitor population. In the Results section of the revised manuscript we describe these results as follows:</p><p>“One possibility is that the renal epithelial cells in the tubular region that gives rise to the CS have retained some progenitor-like state and direct transdifferentiation is not occurring in the strictest sense. To explore this, we closely examined the expression of the renal progenitor marker <italic>lhx1a</italic> from 14-50 hpf. At 14 hpf, transcripts for <italic>lhx1a</italic> are found throughout the intermediate mesoderm in mesenchymal cells but are rapidly downregulated in all tubule precursors by 16 hpf (Figure 2—figure supplement 1), when the transition to an epithelial tube occurs <sup>35,36</sup>. This transition corresponds with the restriction of other markers of renal progenitor state, such as pax2a<sup>18</sup> and pax8<sup>37</sup>, although expression of these genes are retained in the DL segment where they likely play later roles in growth <sup>38,39</sup>. To demonstrate that the tubule has achieved an advanced state of epithelial differentiation prior to <italic>stc1</italic> transcripts appearing, we confirmed at 22 hpf that the DE segment contains apically localised F-actin and basally deposited Laminin and Collagen type IV, indicative of apical tight junctions and a basolateral basement membrane, respectively (added as Figure 2A). In addition, the DE segment at this time point uniformly expresses <italic>slc12a1, atp1a1a.4</italic> and the <italic>krt18</italic> (but not <italic>stc1</italic>), consistent with having the identity of a differentiated transporting epithelium (Figure 2A). At 50 hpf, the DE segment continues to be marked by the expression of <italic>slc12a1, atp1a1a.4</italic> and <italic>krt18</italic> whereas the extruded CS cells do not express these genes. Instead, staining with Phalloidin and antibodies to Laminin and Collagen type IV shows that the CS gland has lost apically localised F-actin and is enveloped by a separate basement membrane (Figure 2A). Taken together, these results support the notion that by 22 hpf, the DE segment has differentiated into a renal tubular epithelium, and that a subset of these cells then transdifferentiate into CS cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Please provide further evidence that this is indeed a transdifferentiation event by using further marker analysis.</p><p>3) At many points there is limited quantitative information for each experiment. For example;</p><p>a) Figure 1 and Figure 2 show individual representative images of IF and ISH stains to show how CS morphogenesis occurs. No n values, measurements or quantitative approaches are used to assign these behaviours and so it is difficult to know how robust these observations are. The authors should provide some form of quantitative analysis of the process.</p></disp-quote><p>To quantify CS extrusion, we have used the <italic>cdh17:egfp</italic> line to describe the initial bulging and extrusion of the gland from the tubule at 24 hpf, 32 hpf, 40 hpf, 50 hpf, 60 hpf and 72 hpf. These results are included in Figure 1C of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Cdh1 staining in Figure 2A is stated to be largely lost at 50hpf. This is not clear in the image shown. Some quantification or at least demarcate the region where this loss of expression is seen should be included. Also, the authors state that F-actin is lost in CS cells at 50 hpf, but there is only one image at 50hpf and not earlier stages to compare with.</p></disp-quote><p>We have highlighted the region where there is loss of Cdh1 and described this in the legend, this change can be seen in Figure 1C of the revised manuscript (boxed region at the interface between the CS gland and the tubule). In response to point 2 we have added wholemount lateral views of apically localised F-actin in the DE tubule at 22 hpf and the loss of this F-actin at 50 hpf (Figure 2A). Of note, we also observed Laminin and collagen IV around the CS gland at 50 hpf, which is further evidence of a loss of cell-cell adhesions and replacement for cell-matrix adhesions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Throughout the manuscript n-values are only given for treatments and not for controls. Control numbers should also be provided and statistical analysis provided for all the main findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now quantitated many aspects of the phenotypes with statistical analysis and p values. For instance, we have added the proportions of embryos that have undergone CS extrusion in Figure 1, quantitated the level of Hnf1b in the nucleus in Figure 3 and Figure 6, measured tubule width and length in Figure 5, and fluorescence intensity in Figure 6. For the more qualitative in situs, we have added in the control numbers (although in all cases these do not show a phenotype, thus have a ‘zero’ proportion). <italic>eLife</italic> also requires a Dryad spreadsheet of all our empirical data and this contains all the empirical results for the experiments shown in the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) How many mindbomb embryos were counted and were stc1+ cells counted or is the analysis purely qualitative based on the size of the stc1 stained region?</p></disp-quote><p>No longer applicable as we have removed the Mib data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) The Irx3b mutants – no n-values are provided and only cdh17 expression is analysed.
