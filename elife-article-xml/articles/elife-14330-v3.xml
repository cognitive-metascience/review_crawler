are poorly understood. Here we identified a novel feedback mechanism in controlling intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Sox21a, a group B Sox protein, is preferentially expressed in the committed progenitor named enteroblast (EB) to promote enterocyte differentiation. In <italic>Sox21a</italic> mutants, EBs do not divide, but cannot differentiate properly and have increased expression of mitogens, which then act as paracrine signals to promote intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation. This leads to a feedback amplification loop for rapid production of differentiation-defective EBs and tumorigenesis. Notably, in normal intestine following damage, Sox21a is temporally downregulated in EBs to allow the activation of the ISC-EB amplification loop for epithelial repair. We propose that executing a feedback amplification loop between stem cells and their progeny could be a common mechanism underlying tissue regeneration and tumorigenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14330.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14330.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14330.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Within our bodies we have stem cells that are responsible for maintaining many of our tissues in a healthy state and healing wounds after an injury. When these adult stem cells divide, they can produce daughter cells. Through a process called differentiation, these daughter cells can become mature cells that replace old or damaged cells. However, the stem cells also produce copies of themselves – in a process known as self-renewal – to ensure that an organ does not run out of stem cells. The rates of differentiation and self-renewal must be carefully balanced: too much differentiation can eventually lead to the degeneration of the tissue, whereas too much self-renewal can cause tumors to develop.</p><p>One of the main questions in the stem cell field is how tissues and organs balance these opposing processes. The fruit fly mid-gut is a model system for investigating this question, and is similar to the intestine of mammals. The mid-gut is composed of three main cell types: intestinal stem cells, enteroblasts (immediate daughter cells of the stem cells) and enterocytes (fully differentiated, mature cells).</p><p>Previously published data showed that a protein called Sox21a is present in the intestinal stem cells and enteroblasts, but not in the mature enterocytes. To investigate the role of Sox21a in more detail, Chen et al. deleted the gene that produces Sox21a in fruit flies. These mutant flies developed tumors in their guts, indicating that Sox21a is a tumor suppressor. Further experiments revealed that Sox21a normally drives enteroblasts to differentiate into enterocytes, and also prevents the enteroblasts from communicating with the stem cells to indicate that more enteroblasts are needed.</p><p>In further experiments, Chen et al. gave otherwise healthy fruit flies a drug that injured their guts. This caused Sox21a activity to decrease temporarily, allowing more enteroblasts to be produced from intestinal stem cells to repair the damage. The mid-gut therefore has an intricate “feedback amplification” system that maintains an appropriate number of each type of cell.</p><p>In future, other experiments will be needed to determine whether similar feedback amplification systems are found in other tissues, and to investigate the extent to which these systems are found in mammals. Furthermore, understanding this process in more depth could increase our knowledge about how cancerous tumors grow.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14330.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14330.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>intestinal stem cell</kwd><kwd>tumorigenesis</kwd><kwd>enteroblast</kwd><kwd>Spitz</kwd><kwd>Sox21a</kwd><kwd>damage-induced regeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31501105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Na</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>973 projects 2014CB850002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xi</surname><given-names>Rongwen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>973 projects 2011CB812700</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xi</surname><given-names>Rongwen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A newly discovered feedback amplification loop between stem cells and their immediate daughter progenitor cells drives epithelial regeneration and tumor development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adult stem cells have important roles in maintaining tissue and organ homeostasis by their prolonged ability to produce progenitor cells that differentiate into multiple types of mature cells. Production of the progenitor cells from stem cells must be coordinated with cell differentiation and the overall tissue demand, as disruption of this coordination could lead to tissue degeneration, if cell production is not sufficient, or hyperplasia/ tumorigenesis, if the cell production is unrestricted and exceeds the pace of cell differentiation. However, the molecular mechanism that coordinates progenitor cell proliferation with cell differentiation is largely unknown.</p><p>The adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut has been established as a simple and useful system for the study of the stem cell behavior during homeostatic tissue renewal and in response to environmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biteau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang and Edgar, 2012</xref>). Like mammalian intestine, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut epithelium is constantly replenished by adult intestinal stem cells (ISCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>), although at a relatively slower pace. In addition, signaling pathways that regulate mammalian ISC activity, such as Wnt, JAK/STAT, EGFR/Ras, Hippo, BMP and Notch, also play important roles in regulating <italic>Drosophila</italic> ISC activity during normal homeostasis and/or stress conditions (reviewed by) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biteau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pasco et al., 2015</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> ISC, which generates a relatively simple stem cell lineage, can be specifically marked by Delta (Dl), the Notch ligand. After each asymmetric division, an ISC will produce a new ISC and a committed progenitor cell named enteroblast (EB), which will further differentiate into either an enterocyte or an enteroendocrine cell, depending on the levels of Notch activation it received from ISCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007</xref>). Enterocyte differentiation from EB requires high levels of Notch activation, and JAK/STAT signaling activity is required for both enterocyte and enteroendocrine cell differentiation from EB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beebe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2010</xref>). Aside from the signaling pathways, many transcription factors have been identified as important regulators of cell differentiation. Enterocyte differentiation from EB requires downregulation of Escargot (Esg) and activation of Pdm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Korzelius et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Loza-Coll et al., 2014</xref>), whereas enteroendocrine cell differentiation from EB requires release of the inhibition by the transcriptional repressor Tramtrack and activation of acheate-scute complex (AS-C) genes and Prospero (Pros), the enteroendocrine cell determination factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bardin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zeng and Hou, 2015</xref>). It is largely unclear how these signaling pathways and transcription factors are coordinately regulated for balanced self-renewal of ISCs and differentiation of EBs to maintain intestinal homeostasis.</p><p>Sox family transcription factors, which share a DNA binding high-mobility-group domain, are known as important regulators of cell fate decisions during development and in adult tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kamachi and Kondoh, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sarkar and Hochedlinger, 2013</xref>). In mouse small intestine, Sox2 is expressed in ISCs and progenitor cells and is critical for ISC maintenance and differentiation of Paneth cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Furuyama et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sato et al., 2011</xref>). Several Sox family proteins have been identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McKimmie et al., 2005</xref>), but their potential roles in the ISC lineage are unclear. Here we characterized the function of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> Sox gene, <italic>Sox21a</italic>, in the ISC lineage. We find that Sox21a is expressed in EBs and acts as a tumor suppressor in the midgut epithelium. One important function of Sox21a is to promote enterocyte differentiation by inducing Pdm1 expression. By studying its tumor suppressing function, we identified a novel feedback amplification loop between ISC and EB, which is normally suppressed by Sox21a. Temporal activation of this loop is essential for damage-induced intestinal regeneration, whereas sustained activation of this loop leads to tumorigenesis. Therefore, we revealed a novel mechanism that coordinates stem cell activity with progenitor cell differentiation, and connects regeneration with tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sox21a is preferentially expressed in differentiating EBs</title><p>From cell-type specific gene expression analysis of <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dutta et al., 2015</xref> and unpublished data), we noticed a Sox family gene, <italic>Sox21a</italic>, whose RNA expression was detected only in ISCs and EBs. Interestingly, <italic>Sox21a</italic> seems to be mainly expressed in midgut, but not other organs in larva and adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chintapalli et al., 2007</xref>). To characterize its expression pattern in vivo, we first generated polyclonal antibodies against Sox21a, and demonstrated that this antisera could specifically mark Sox21a antigen in the midgut epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Immunostaining of the wild type midgut with this antisera revealed that Sox21a was largely undetectable in the midgut of newly eclosed and young flies of two to three days old (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Its expression began to appear with age and at 4–5 days old, weak Sox21a expression appeared specifically in Dl<sup>+</sup> ISCs and Notch-activated EBs that can be marked by a Notch activation reporter, Su(H)Gbe&gt;GFP (NRE&gt;GFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). At 7 days old, its expression could also be detected in early ECs, which display increased cell ploidy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). The Dl<sup>+</sup> ISC and its immediate daughter EB (marked by NRE&gt;GFP) are usually adjacent to each other, forming an ISC-EB pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007</xref>). In each ISC-EB pair, the level of Sox21a expression was usually higher in EB than in ISC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,F</xref>). In each progenitor cell nest where the early EC still retained NRE&gt;GFP expression, the early EC usually displayed a higher Sox21a expression level than the EB or the ISC in the same ISC-EB-early-EC cell nest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,F</xref>), suggesting that Sox21a is up-regulated in differentiating EBs. Consistent with this notion, A GFP reporter driven by an enhancer Gal4 line for <italic>Sox21a</italic> (GMR43E09-Gal4) showed specific expression of GFP in ISCs and EBs. Again, the intensity of GFP was much higher in EBs than in ISCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Previous studies suggest that EB differentiation requires mesenchymal-epithelial transition through downregulation of Esg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Korzelius et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, in fixed midgut where Sox21a was not expressed, EBs commonly displayed triangle-shaped morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We propose that these EBs are probably the dormant EBs that remain in the undifferentiated state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). By contrast, in EBs where Sox21a began to be expressed, EBs instead displayed oval-shaped morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). These EBs are likely the activated EBs that are undergoing mesenchymal-epithelial transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that Sox21a is preferentially expressed in differentiating EBs in the intestinal epithelium. This unique expression pattern indicates that Sox21a might have a role during the process of EB differentiation into enterocyte.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14330.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sox21a is preferentially expressed in differentiating EBs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>D</bold>) Sox21a (red) expression in midguts of 2 to 7 days old females co-stained with Dl (white) and NRE&gt;GFP (green).

Sox21a expression is elevated in EBs when EBs begin to differentiate and display oval-shaped morphology. We refer to this state of EBs as 'active'. Sox21a expression reaches its highest level in differentiating EC, and then gradually disappears as EC matures.

Because the coding region of <italic>Sox21a</italic> is almost entirely deleted in both alleles, they can be regarded as null alleles for <italic>Sox21a</italic>. Consistent with the midgut-restricted expression during development, <italic>Sox21a</italic> homozygous mutant flies are viable and fertile. Staining midgut of newly eclosed mutants showed that the general gut morphology and the cellular makeup of the monolayer midgut epithelium was largely normal, although the epithelial cells appeared to be more sparsely distributed in the epithelium compared to the wild type intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This indicates that Sox21a could have a role in regulating the proliferation of midgut progenitor cells during development. Strikingly, when the mutant flies got older, multilayered cell clusters composed of 50 or more cells (termed tumors hereafter) were frequently observed in both anterior and posterior midgut, and tumor incidence steadily increased with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>).

Tumor size also grew with time, and in aged mutants, the tumor masses often filled up the entire lumen space, suggesting that tumors grow rapidly once it is initiated.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14330.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title><italic>Sox21a</italic> mutation causes the development of intestinal tumors composed of differentiation-defective cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A diagram describing the molecular lesions of two <italic>Sox21a</italic> mutant alleles.

Like all other cells, the Su(H)Gbe-lacZ (NRE-lacZ)<sup>+</sup> EBs are more sparsely distributed in the epithelium of the mutant intestine than of the wild type intestine at day 2 after eclosion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). However, the NRE-lacZ<sup>+</sup> cells rapidly accumulated in the epithelium of the mutant intestine at day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,G’</xref>). Thus, <italic>Sox21a</italic> mutants postnatally develop intestinal tumors. Co-staining Dl with NRE-lacZ revealed that ISCs and EBs were intermingled with each other in EB-accumulated regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,G’</xref>). Those observations suggest that the tumors in <italic>Sox21a</italic> mutant intestine are mainly composed of ISCs and EBs, and indicate that Sox21a might be required for EB differentiation. To test the differentiation capability of <italic>Sox21a</italic> mutant cells, we generated <italic>Sox21a</italic> homozygous mutant clones by mitotic recombination using the MARCM system. As expected, the mutant clones cell-autonomously gave rise to intestinal tumors which was mainly composed of NRE-lacZ<sup>+</sup> cells intermingled with Dl<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,H’</xref>). We also observed clusters of NRE-lacZ<sup>+</sup> cells outside of the clones (data not shown), which could be due to a non-cell autonomous effect by the mutant clones. There was also mild increase of Dl<sup>+</sup> cells that were scatteredly distributed within the mutant clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I,I’</xref>). Rarely but occasionally Pros<sup>+</sup> cells could be found in the mutant clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> and data not shown), indicating that Sox21a is not absolutely required for enteroendocrine cell differentiation. Polyploid cells were also found in the clones but their size was relatively smaller than ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–J</xref>). Interestingly, Pdm1, an enterocyte marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2009</xref>), failed to be expressed in <italic>Sox21a</italic> mutant cells in a cell-autonomous manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I,I’</xref>). These observations suggest that Sox21a is cell-autonomously required for EB differentiation into enterocyte.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Sox21a functions to promote EB differentiation into enterocyte</title><p>The above results demonstrate that Sox21a is required for the expression of Pdm1. Because Pdm1 expression is sufficient to induce differentiation of progenitor cell into enterocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Korzelius et al., 2014</xref>), Sox21a may function to promote enterocyte differentiation by inducing Pdm1 expression. To test this hypothesis, we generated a <italic>UAS-Sox21a</italic> transgene and forcibly expressed it in progenitor cells using esgGal4, an ISC- and EB-specific Gal4 driver, and examined the consequences. Tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup> transgene was also added to the system to allow temporal control of transgene expression. Under normal conditions, virtually all Esg&gt;GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were negative for Pdm1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,A’</xref>). However, when Sox21a was forcibly expressed for 5 days, approximately 34.2 ± 1.6% of Esg&gt;GFP<sup>+</sup> cells became positive for Pdm1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,B’,E</xref>). The Pdm1<sup>+</sup> cells were always one of the GFP<sup>+</sup> ISC-EB pairs, indicating that expression of <italic>Sox21a</italic> could not induce Pdm1 expression in ISCs, but EBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,B’</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we forcibly expressed <italic>Sox21a</italic> specifically in EBs using the Su(H)Gbe-Gal4 (NRE-Gal4) driver. Indeed, transient induction of Sox21 expression for 5 days induced approximately 72.3 ± 3.8% of NRE&gt;GFP<sup>+</sup> cells to turn on Pdm1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,D’,E</xref>), and these cells began to show polyploidy, indicating that they are in the process of enterocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,D’</xref>). Next, we generated MARCM clones in which all GFP+ cells had constitutive Sox21a overexpression. The ISC-containing clones grew normally in size and were able to produce both polyploidy enterocytes and Pros<sup>+</sup> enteroendocrine cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), suggesting that forced Sox21a expression does not inhibit ISC activity and does not block enteroendocrine cell differentiation.

BrdU incorporation assay revealed that the tumor cells had strikingly high ability to incorporate BrdU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>).

These observations indicate that the increased mitotic activity drives tumor growth. To determine the identity of mitotic cells in Sox21 mutant tumors, we co-stained the mitotic marker phospho-histone 3 (PH3) with various cell fate markers.

However, Specifically knocking down <italic>Sox21a</italic> by RNAi (HMJ21395 or JF02191) in EBs using Su(H)Gbe-Gal4,UAS-GFP; Tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup> (referred to as NRE-Gal4<sup>ts</sup>) was sufficient to induce rapid accumulation of EB-like cells in the intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>), a phenotype largely similar to that observed in <italic>Sox21a</italic> mutant intestine. Therefore, loss of Sox21a in EB is sufficient to induce tumor development, indicating that <italic>Sox21a</italic> mutant EBs are tumor-initiating cells, although they are non-mitotic cells.</p><p>If the non-mitotic EBs are indeed tumor-initiating cells in <italic>Sox21a</italic> mutants, we would expect to see that EB-specific transgene expression of Sox21a should be able to prevent tumor development in <italic>Sox21a</italic> mutant intestine. We therefore generated <italic>Sox21a</italic> mutant flies carrying NRE-GAL4<sup>ts</sup> and <italic>UAS-Sox21a</italic> transgenes, in which the expression and therefore the function of Sox21a will be restricted in EBs in the intestinal epithelium.

By contrast, ISC-specific expression of Sox21a failed to suppress intestinal tumor formation in <italic>Sox21a</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).

To understand the underlying mechanisms, we compared the transcriptome of Esg<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells with and without Sox21a depletion. Multiple secreted growth factors were found to be up-regulated by two fold or more in Sox21a-depleted cells, including Spitz (Spi), a ligand for EGFR/Ras/MAPK signaling, Upd3, a ligand for JAK/STAT signaling, and Pvf2 and Pvf1, which also induces Ras/MAPK signaling via PVR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Interestingly, these factors all function as positive regulators of ISC proliferation during normal homeostasis and/ or in response to injury or infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beebe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biteau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bond and Foley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buchon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, increased Spi signaling promotes tumor development from Notch mutant ISCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Patel et al., 2015</xref>), and increased Upd3 signaling in EBs following the disruption of the Misshapen-Warts-Yorkie pathway also induce ISC proliferation and intestinal hyperplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2014</xref>). This raises an interesting hypothesis that <italic>Sox21a</italic> mutant EBs may induce ISC proliferation via paracrine Ras/MAPK and/or JAK/STAT signaling. In vivo validation of gene expression was subsequently conducted with available enhancer trap lines. Spi-lacZ is an enhancer trap line for Spi, and its lacZ expression was barely detectable in the wild type midgut epithelium, including ISCs and EBs, probably due to low levels of baseline expression in healthy midgut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,B’</xref>). However, lacZ expression became readily detectable in EBs following Sox21a depletion by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,C’</xref>). By contrast, we did not observe significant upregulation of Upd3-lacZ, a reporter for Upd3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, staining with phospho-ERK (pERK), a direct readout of MAPK signaling activity, revealed that the pERK signal was strongly enhanced in the diploid cells adjacent to the EB cells with Sox21a depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). Importantly, the increase of pERK activity in <italic>Sox21a</italic> mutant epithelium was completely suppressed when Sox21a was re-expressed in EBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,F’</xref>), suggesting that Sox21a depletion in EB is both sufficient and necessary for enhanced pERK signaling in <italic>Sox21a</italic> mutant intestine. We found that conditional overexpression of Spi in EBs also produced a similar EB-like tumor phenotype, indicating that Spi upregulation could be one of the reasons responsible for the enhanced pERK signaling in ISCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,G’</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, EB-specific knockdown of <italic>spi</italic> significantly reduced, although not completely eliminated, the ISC overproliferation phenotype in <italic>Sox21a</italic> mutant intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). As a comparison, EB-specific expression of <italic>Sox21a</italic> transgene produced a much stronger inhibitory effect on ISC proliferation in <italic>Sox21a</italic> mutant intestine, and the mitotic index was reduced to wildtype levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that in <italic>Sox21a</italic> mutant intestine, loss of Sox21a in EBs causes derepression of multiple mitogens, including Spi, and others, such as Pvf2 and Pvf1, that all act as paracrine signals to induce Ras/MAPK signaling activity in ISCs and promote ISC proliferation. As a result, more mutant EBs are produced, which further propel ISC proliferation. This leads to the establishment of a positive amplification loop between ISCs and their progeny, which eventually leads to uncontrolled production of differentiation defective EBs from ISCs and consequently tumorigenesis.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14330.008</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Spi/MAPK signaling is required for tumorigenesis driven by <italic>Sox21a</italic> mutant EBs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A scatter plot shows the comparison of gene expression profiles of Esg-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in wild type and <italic>Sox21a</italic><sup>-/- </sup> midgut.

We therefore tested whether the expression of Sox21a could be regulated upon tissue damage. Feeding flies with Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) has been established as an effective mean to induce intestinal damage and inflammation, which then triggers ISC activation for accelerated epithelial repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amcheslavsky et al., 2009</xref>). A relatively rapid damage and repair process was set for this experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Interestingly, following DSS treatment, Sox21a expression was rapidly downregulated in EBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,B’,C,C’,I</xref>). This downregulation was accompanied by massive EB accumulation in the epithelium resulted from increased ISC proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,C’</xref>).

We also examined the expression of the Sox21a expression reporter GMR43E09&gt;GFP during the damage and repair process.

To functionally test this hypothesis, we asked whether reversing the expression of Sox21a or Spi in EBs could affect intestinal regeneration following damage. Specific depletion of Spi in EBs significantly reduced the proliferative response of ISCs following DSS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). On the other hand, overexpression of Sox21a in EBs almost completely eliminated the proliferative response of ISCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). These results suggest that dynamic regulation of the Sox21-Spi pathway is critical for effective intestinal regeneration after damage. Compared to the effect by <italic>EB&gt;Sox21a</italic>, incomplete suppression of ISC proliferation by <italic>EB&gt;Spi-RNAi</italic> may indicate that Spi is merely one of the factors downstream of Sox21a that mediate damage-induced ISC proliferation.</p><p>Taken together, our data suggest a model in which an ISC-EB feedback amplification loop controlled by dynamic expression of Sox21a regulates intestinal homeostasis, regeneration and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Normally, Sox21a is expressed in differentiating EBs to promote enterocyte differentiation. Following tissue damage, Sox21a is temporally downregulated in EBs to allow the production of mitogens, which then act back on ISCs to promote ISC proliferation. This leads transient activation of ISC-EB amplification loop for accelerated production of progenitor cells prepared for epithelial differentiation. At the recovery phase, Sox21a is upregulated to shut down the ISC-EB amplification loop and promote cell differentiation and homeostasis re-establishment. In <italic>Sox21a</italic> mutant intestine, the ISC-EB feedback amplification loop is continuously active, which drives massive production of differentiation-defective cells and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14330.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic models of the ISC-EB feedback loop during normal homeostasis, regeneration and tumorigenesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) During normal homeostasis (left panel), ISC and EB typically exist as a progenitor pair.

(<bold>B</bold>) Sox21a-mediated amplification loop is employed in damage-induced intestinal regeneration. Tissue damage causes temporal downregulation of Sox21a in EB and consequently derepression of mitogenic factors, which act in a paracrine manner to promote ISC proliferation. This leads to a temporal activation of the ISC-EB amplification loop for rapid production of progenitor cells prepared for epithelial differentiation. During the recovery after the damage is withdrawn, Sox21a is temporally upregulated in EBs to promote epithelial differentiation and homeostasis reestablishment.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14330.013">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14330.013</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-14330-fig7-v3"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Sox family proteins in metazoan are divided into different groups based on their similarity in biochemical properties, and Sox21a belongs to the SoxB2 subgroup whose function is relatively less studied compared to the most related SoxB1 subgroup proteins, such as the pluripotency factor Sox2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McKimmie et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sarkar and Hochedlinger, 2013</xref>). By cellular and genetic analysis, here we have characterized the functions of Sox21a, a member of the SoxB2 group in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and revealed two major roles. First, Sox21a is essential for EC differentiation from EB. Sox21a protein is mainly expressed in differentiating EBs, a pattern that is consistent with its role in EB differentiation. Loss of Sox21a causes accumulation of undifferentiated cells that fail to express Pdm1, the EC marker. The majority of these mutant cells remain as diploid EBs and some begin to show polyploidy, indicating that mechanisms controlling EC differentiation and cell ploidy can be uncoupled. On the other hand, forced transgene expression of Sox21a in EBs accelerates their differentiation into ECs as evidenced by precocious expression of Pdm1. However, forced expression of Sox21a in ISCs does not induce their differentiation, suggesting that Sox21a is necessary but not sufficient for inducing EC differentiation from ISCs. One possible explanation for this is that EC differentiation requires both Sox21a and Notch activity. Indeed, although Notch activity is known to be both necessary and sufficient for inducing EC differentiation from ISCs, Notch activated EBs that have already been presented along the length of midgut in young flies remain dormant for several days until there is a need for cell replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hochmuth et al., 2011</xref>). These observations indicate that activation of Notch alone is not sufficient to induce EB differentiation, but only primes EB for EC differentiation. Notch-activated EBs will stay in undifferentiated state until Sox21a is activated, which then promotes differentiation of the primed EBs into ECs.</p><p>Another surprising role for Sox21a revealed in this study is that it provides a feedback regulation of ISC activity by suppressing mitogenic signals from differentiating EBs. This function is important for controlling the strength of the ISC-EB amplification loop for balanced self-renewal of ISCs and differentiation of EBs. Because Sox21a is also required for EB differentiation, disruption of this function will cause sustained activation of the ISC-EB amplification loop as well as blocked EB differentiation, leading to the formation of EB-like tumors. Importantly, following epithelial damage, Sox21a is quickly downregulated in EBs. This allows temporal activation of the ISC-EB loop for rapid production of progenitor cells prepared for epithelial repair. During recovery, Sox21a is then temporally upregulated in EBs. This not only stops the ISC-EB amplification loop to avoid excessive EB production, but also accelerates cell differentiation for epithelial repair. Therefore, Sox21a does not simply act as a tumor suppressor in intestine. It is dynamically regulated to control the process of epithelial regeneration in response to various environmental changes via regulating the strength of the ISC-EB amplification loop. Because Sox21a expression in intestine is dynamic during normal adult development, it is conceivable that its expression could possibly be influenced by physiological changes, such as food intake and activity of symbiotic bacteria, and fine-turning Sox21a activity could be important for maintaining regular epithelial turnover. How Sox21a expression is regulated is unclear, but signaling pathways that are implicated in regulating intestinal regeneration, such as JAK/STAT or EGFR/Ras pathways are potential candidate regulators, especially JAK/STAT, which is known to be essential for EB differentiation. During the preparation of this manuscript, two groups have reported the function of Sox21a in <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meng and Biteau, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhai et al., 2015</xref>). Meng and Biteau did not observe the tumor suppressive function of Sox21a, possibly because they used a weak mutant allele of <italic>Sox21a</italic> in their study. Notably, Zhai et al., observed a similar tumor suppressive role for Sox21a as reported here. Interestingly, they suggest that Sox21a is regulated by JAK/STAT signaling, as Sox21a transgene expression is able to rescue the differentiation defects caused by disrupted JAK/STAT signaling. However, we found that Sox21a was still expressed in JAK/STAT compromised EBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, how Sox21a is regulated during normal homeostasis and regeneration remains to be further explored, and it is possible that Sox21a could be controlled by a combination of regulators in a cell type-specific manner, with different mechanisms in ISCs and EBs. Because Sox proteins commonly function together with other cell type-specific co-factors in regulating gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kamachi and Kondoh, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sarkar and Hochedlinger, 2013</xref>), Sox21a could function with different co-factors in ISCs and EBs. These are interesting questions worthy of further investigation.</p><p>Cells in a given tumor are usually heterogeneous and based on the ability to initiate tumors, tumor cells can be divided into tumor-initiating cells and non-tumor-initiating cells. Here in this case, Sox21 mutant EBs can be regarded as the tumor-initiating cells in vivo. Depleting Sox21a specifically in EBs is sufficient to initiate EB-like tumors. Conversely, restoring Sox21a function specifically in EBs is sufficient to prevent tumor development in <italic>Sox21a</italic> mutant intestine. However, unlike typical tumor-initiating cells, <italic>Sox21a</italic> mutant EBs are post-mitotic cells. In addition, their ability to initiate tumors depends on the activity of local ISCs. Therefore, this study also reveals a novel example of tumor-initiating cells in vivo that do not divide themselves, but can “propagate” themselves by utilizing local stem cells.</p><p>In short, by studying the function of Sox21a in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ISC lineages, we identified a novel feedback amplification loop between stem cells and their progeny that mediates epithelial regeneration and tumorigenesis. It has long been suggested that tissue regeneration and tumorigenesis are intimately associated, although the mechanistic connection is still obscure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oviedo and Beane, 2009</xref>). The Sox21a-Spi mediated- ISC-EB amplification loop revealed here may provide a simple example of potential mechanisms that could connect tissue regeneration with tumorigenesis: transient activation of the stem cell- progeny amplification loop promotes regeneration, whereas sustained or irreversible activation of the amplification loop promotes tumorigenesis. We propose that this could be a general mechanism underlying tissue regeneration and tumorigenesis in other tissues, including that in mammals and humans.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>The following stocks were used in this study: UAS-Sox21a-RNAi (BDSC, #53991, #31902) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ni et al., 2011</xref>); esg-Gal4,UAS-GFP (gift from Shigeo Hayashi); Su(H)-Gbe-lacZ (gift from Sarah Bray); Su(H)-Gbe-Gal4 and Dl-Gal4 (gift from Xiankun Zeng and Steven Hou) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zeng et al., 2010</xref>); GMR43E09-Gal4 (BDSC, #46247); dome<sup>G0468</sup> FRT19A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2010</xref>); UAS-sSpi (gift from Talila Volk); UAS-Spi-RNAi (VDRC, #v3922); Spi-lacZ (gift from Henry Sun).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;A feedback amplification loop between stem cells and their progeny promotes tissue regeneration and tumorigenesis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison as the Senior editor and three reviewers, including Bruce Edgar and Allan Spradling, who is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors describe a function for the <italic>Sox21a</italic> gene in EB differentiation and in tissue stress response in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut. When Sox21a is disrupted, EB differentiation is blocked and EBs accumulate and produce factors including Spitz that stimulate the proliferation of nearby ISCs and lead to intestinal tumors. Interestingly, the authors propose that this sequence of events is homeostatic when the gut is stressed. Following dextran sulfate feeding, Sox21a expression drops and EBs accumulate, presumably via the same mechanism, and stimulate ISC division in a manner that can be diminished by reducing Spi.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Recently, Zhai et al. (2015) Nature Comm. 10219 published a similar description of sox21-induced tumors and Meng and Biteau (2015) Cell Rep. 13, 906 characterized the role of Sox21a in response to midgut damage. Many of the experiments and observations reported here were previously described in these papers. Furthermore, Chen et al.'s proposal that transient tumor production might be functional is not fully consistent with these studies. In particular, Meng and Biteau reported that Sox21a is upregulated within 24hr following midgut stress, and consistent with this, Zhai et al. showed that JAK-STAT signaling, which is typically induced by midgut stress, induces Sox21a expression. Furthermore, Upd2 was shown to be the primary paracrine stimulator of ISC proliferation, with Spi (and Upd3) having only a relatively small functional effect.</p><p>Consequently, it is critically important in a revised version to resolve whether the &quot;ISC-EB feedback amplification loop&quot; is &quot;dynamically regulated during normal tissue homeostasis&quot; and &quot;critical for damage-induced intestinal regeneration&quot; as the authors propose. Two experiments would make this possible:</p><p>1) A critical step toward proving that Sox21a participates in a regenerative response is resolving whether Sox21a expression declines (as proposed here) or increases during normal development and after stress/injury (as suggested by the above papers). This can be done be expanding the quantification experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. To first assess Sox21a expression during normal adult differentiation, show images as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, but of cell nests of 3 or 4 cells (instead of just doublets as currently) with 1 Delta + cell, to see if the staining of Sox21a protein is not detectable in the nearest neighbor EB but appears in the older, bigger differentiating EBs on the way to become ECs. The data on the relative levels of Sox21a staining in the successive EBs should be quantitated in a graph with a reasonable N value.</p><p>The Sox21a stainings in the current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> are too faint. In this new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, provide better images, and show separate tracks of Sox21a alone, where the staining can be clearly seen and the specificity of staining evaluated (i.e. show adjacent cells and include a <italic>Sox21a</italic> mutant control).</p><p>The same experiment should then be performed, but after labeling has started and 2-3 EBs generated and Sox21a expression has turned on, DSS treatment should be initiated. The pattern of Sox21a expression 1-2 days later should then be determined and quantitated as above.

The importance of Spi in the ISC-EB feedback loop should be measured quantitatively.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14330.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>Recently, Zhai et al.

Furthermore, Upd2 was shown to be the primary paracrine stimulator of ISC proliferation, with Spi (and Upd3) having only a relatively small functional effect.</italic> </p><p>By studying the suppressive function of Sox21a, we have revealed a novel feedback amplification loop mediated by Sox21a-Spi, a novel pathway that is dynamically regulated to control intestinal homeostasis and damage repair, whose dysregulation leads to tumorigenesis. Zhai et al. observed a similar tumor suppressive function of Sox21a, and described how tumor cells communicate with ISCs to propel tumor growth. However, they did not identify the ISC-EB feedback amplification loop that is dynamically regulated to promote intestinal regeneration. Zhai et al. suggested Upd2 as the primary paracrine signal for ISC division. However, we did not observe upregulation of Upd2 in Sox21a mutant EBs and neither did they. Therefore, the effect by Upd2 RNAi observed by Zhai et al. could be due to Sox21a-independent mechanisms (this will be further discussed later). Meng and Biteau did not observe the tumor suppressive function of Sox21a, possibly because they used a weak mutant allele of Sox21a in their study. They did analyze the Sox21a expression pattern, but not in explicit detail, which is rather vital in order to reveal its dynamic nature and its participation in homeostatic control. We analyzed Sox21a at various ages and revealed its dynamic expression during adult development. We examined its expression at different time points during the process of damage-induced regeneration, and discovered its downregulation in the damage phase and upregulation in the recovery phase. As described later, we used a new DSS-treatment protocol, and similar to Meng and Biteau’s observation, we found that Sox21a was upregulated as early as 1.5 days following damage. Taken together, although there are some similar results described before, we believe that the major mechanisms reported here are still novel and significant, and may have a significant impact on our understanding of stem cells in tissue regeneration and tumorigenesis.</p><p><italic>Consequently, it is critically important in a revised version to resolve whether the &quot;ISC-EB feedback amplification loop&quot; is &quot;dynamically regulated during normal tissue homeostasis&quot; and &quot;critical for damage-induced intestinal regeneration&quot; as the authors propose.

The data on the relative levels of Sox21a staining in the successive EBs should be quantitated in a graph with a reasonable N value.</italic></p><p>We have expanded the quantification experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Sox21a expression in the midgut was highly dynamic during adult development. As shown previously, its expression was largely undetectable in the midgut of newly eclosed flies and young flies of two to three days old. Its expression began to appear with age and at 4-5 days old, weak Sox21a expression appeared specifically in Dl+ ISCs and Notch-activated EBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and with age, the EB began show a higher expression level than the ISC in the same ISC-EB pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). At 7 days or older, cell nests of 3 or 4 cells, in which the early still retained NRE&gt;GFP expression, began to appear. In these cell nests, the early EC usually displayed the highest Sox21a expression level than the EB or the ISC in the same ISC-EB-early-EC cell nests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The relative florescence intensity measurements for ISC, EB and early ECs in the ISC-EB pair or 3-cell nests were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, and differences are statistically significant.</p><p><italic>The Sox21a stainings in the current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> are too faint. In this new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, provide better images, and show separate tracks of Sox21a alone, where the staining can be clearly seen and the specificity of staining evaluated (i.e. show adjacent cells and include a Sox21a mutant control).</italic> </p><p>Sox21a expression was very weak in young flies, and its expression gradually increased with age. Better images were provided and separate color channels for anti-Sox21a staining and NRE&gt;GFP were shown for the enlarged insets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-D</xref>). A <italic>Sox21a</italic> mutant control was included, in which anti-Sox21a staining did not detect any obvious signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Additional specificity test was also provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>The same experiment should then be performed, but after labeling has started and 2-3 EBs generated and Sox21a expression has turned on, DSS treatment should be initiated. The pattern of Sox21a expression 1-2 days later should then be determined and quantitated as above. The authors' model predicts that damage induction will cause a transient decline in Sox21a staining not seen in the control, as the proposed ISC-EB loop is set up and starts to function.</italic></p><p>We have taken these suggestions and have redone the regeneration experiment. This time we performed DSS treatment in 7 days old females, when Sox21a has already turned on. In addition, we have modified the damage-induced regeneration protocol. Previously, in order to optimize the damage response and the survival rate of flies, we fed flies with standard food soaked with DSS for 4 consecutive days. To get a more synchronous process of damage or repair, this time we directly fed flies with DSS in sucrose soaked in kimwipe paper for one and half days and dissected the intestine right after the treatment to examine changes at the damage stage, or dissected the intestine 1-2 days later to examine changes at the recovery stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In agreement with our previous observations, DSS treatment caused a transient decline in Sox21a expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), and the decline of Sox21a expression was accompanied by massive accumulation of progenitor cells, as a result of ISB-EB amplification loop activation. During recovery, Sox21a was dramatically upregulated, which was companied by massive EC differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C-D</xref>), as Sox21a activation drives EC differentiation. The quantitative measure of Sox21a during the processes is included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>. We also examined the expression of the Sox21a expression reporter GMR43E09&gt;GFP during the damage and repair process. Consistent with the changes in Sox21a expression, GMR43E09&gt;GFP was transiently downregulated right after the damage and then upregulated 1.5-2 days after the damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) The second experiment would be to more clearly document a role for Spi in Sox21a-mediated ISC division. In Zhai's paper, they found that knockdown of Upd2 in the Sox21a mutant background significantly repressed the ISC proliferation, whereas Spi knockdown had only a small effect. The importance of Spi in the ISC-EB feedback loop should be measured quantitatively.</italic></p><p>By quantitatively measuring the mitotic index, we found that co-depletion of Spi significantly reduced, although not completely eliminated, the ISC overproliferation phenotype in NRE&gt;Sox21a-RNAi intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). We believe that this partial effect is likely due to the redundancy of mitogens that participate in the process, such as Pvf2 and Pvf1, both also activate RAS/ MAPK signaling and both are upregulated in <italic>Sox21a</italic> mutant EBs. In our studies, we did not observe upregulation of Upd2 in <italic>Sox21a</italic> mutant EBs, therefore the effect by Upd2 RNAi observed by Zhai et al. could be due to Sox21a-independent mechanisms. As shown in this study, specific depletion of Spi in EBs also significantly reduced the proliferative response of ISCs following DSS treatment. On the other hand, overexpression of Sox21a in EBs eliminated the proliferative response of ISCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). These observations strongly suggest that Spi should be one of the major stimulators of ISC division downstream of Sox21a during homeostatic control of intestinal epithelium.</p></body></sub-article></article>
