distribute the minus ends of microtubules (MTs) to dendrites but the plus ends to axons. However, a requirement of MT minus-end-binding proteins in dendrite-specific pruning remains completely unknown.

Moreover, we show that both <italic>patronin</italic> knockdown and overexpression resulted in a drastic decrease of MT minus ends and a concomitant increase of plus-end-out MTs in ddaC dendrites, suggesting that Patronin stabilizes dendritic minus-end-out MTs. Consistently, attenuation of Klp10A MT depolymerase in <italic>patronin</italic> mutant neurons significantly restored minus-end-out MTs in dendrites and thereby rescued dendrite-pruning defects.

Pruning is a developmental process referred to as selective removal of unwanted neurites, for example axons, dendrites, or synapses, without causing neuronal death. After pruning, neurons often continue to extend their axons or dendrites to form the mature and functional connections. In vertebrates, various cortical, hippocampal and motor neurons prune their excessive neurites and re-wire into mature circuits. Defects in neuronal pruning result in larger dendritic spine density in layer V pyramidal neurons of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tang et al., 2014</xref>). In invertebrates, such as <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the nervous systems undergo large-scale remodeling during metamorphosis, a transition from larval to adult stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yu and Schuldiner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kanamori et al., 2015</xref>). In the central nervous system (CNS), mushroom body (MB) γ neurons prune their dorsal and medial axon branches as well as entire dendrites, and subsequently re-extend the medial branches to be part of the adult-specific circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 1999</xref>). In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), some dendritic arborization (da) neurons, including class I da (ddaD/ddaE) and class IV da (C4da or ddaC) neurons, prune away all their larval dendrites but leave their axons intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Williams and Truman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuo et al., 2005</xref>), whereas class III da neurons (ddaA/ddaF) are eliminated via apoptosis during the first day of metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Williams and Truman, 2005</xref>). Pruning morphologically resembles axonal or dendritic degeneration following neurological diseases or injury. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of developmental pruning might provide some important insights into neurodegeneration in pathological conditions.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> C4da or ddaC neurons have been recognized as an appealing model system to unravel the mechanisms underlying dendrite-specific pruning during early metamorphosis. Upon induction of the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (ecdysone) at late larval stage, ddaC dendrites are initially severed at their proximal regions as early as 4 hr after puparium formation (APF), followed by rapid fragmentation and debris clearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Williams and Truman, 2005</xref>). Ecdysone binds to a heterodimeric receptor complex, which consists of the Ecdysone receptor and its co-receptor Ultraspiracle, to induce several downstream effectors, including a key transcription factor Sox14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kirilly et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kirilly et al., 2011</xref>), a cytoskeletal regulator Mical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kirilly et al., 2009</xref>), Headcase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Loncle and Williams, 2012</xref>), a Cullin1 E3 ligase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wong et al., 2013</xref>), and calcium signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kanamori et al., 2013</xref>). Cytoskeletal disassembly, especially microtubule (MT) disassembly, is a key step of pruning occurring before the detachment of neurites in both MB γ and ddaC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Watts et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Williams and Truman, 2005</xref>). In ddaC neurons, MTs in the proximal dendrites break down prior to the dendritic membrane fission. Katanin p60-like 1 (Kat-60L1), a putative MT severing factor, is required for dendrite pruning of ddaC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2009</xref>), whereas other MT severing factors, including Katanin 60 (Kat-60), Spastin and Fidgetin, appear to be dispensable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tao et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, mammalian Spastin mediates branch-specific disassembly of MTs and facilitates synapse elimination in the developing mouse neuromuscular junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brill et al., 2016</xref>). A recent study indicated that Par-1, whose mammalian ortholog is a Tau kinase, is required for increased MT dynamics and dendrite pruning in ddaC neurons. Par-1 promotes MT breakdown mainly via Tau inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herzmann et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39964.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Patronin is required for dendrite pruning in ddaC neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic representation of dendrite pruning in ddaC neurons.

Fast-growing plus ends, which are associated by plus-end-tracking proteins (+TIPs), are highly dynamic, whereas slow-growing minus ends are more stable with the decoration of minus-end-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Howard and Hyman, 2003</xref>). In differentiated mammalian neurons, axons and dendrites differ in MT orientation: axonal MTs are mainly aligned in a plus-end-out pattern, whereas MTs are mixed at the proximal dendritic region with both minus-end-out and plus-end-out arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2015</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons, axons, like mammalian ones, contain nearly uniform plus-end-out MTs, however, MTs are oriented almost exclusively minus-end-out in major dendrites but mainly plus-end-out in shorter terminal dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stone et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rolls et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ori-McKenney et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goodwin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yalgin et al., 2015</xref>). Growing studies have begun to unravel how the minus-end-out MTs are organized and maintained in the dendrites. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, kinesin-1 was proposed to regulate predominant minus-end-out orientation of dendritic MTs through gliding plus-end-out MTs out of the dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yan et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, minus-end-out orientation of dendritic MTs depends on +TIPs, plus-end-directed motor protein kinesin-1/2 as well as MT regulators γ-Tubulin/Centrosomin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mattie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ori-McKenney et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herzmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yalgin et al., 2015</xref>). However, whether and how minus-end-binding proteins regulate MT orientation in the dendrites remain elusive.</p><p>The Patronin family of proteins have been identified as conserved MT minus-end-binding proteins, which contain Patronin in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein 1/2/3 (CAMSAP1/2/3) in mammals, and PTRN-1 in worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baines et al., 2009</xref>). Patronin/CAMSAP/PTRN-1 contains a calponin homology (CH) domain at its amino-terminus, three predicted coiled-coil (CC) domains at its central region, and a CAMSAP/KIAA1078/KIA1543 (CKK) domain at its carboxyl-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baines et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>patronin</italic> (also known as <italic>ssp4</italic>) was first identified to regulate the length of mitotic spindle in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goshima et al., 2007</xref>). The Patronin proteins recognize and stabilize free minus ends by protecting them from kinesin-13-mediated depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goodwin and Vale, 2010</xref>). Mammalian CAMSAP3/Nezha anchors MT minus ends to adherence junctions and controls the apical-basal MT orientation in cultured epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meng et al., 2008</xref>). Both Patronin and CAMSAP3 can polarize MT arrays via actin-crosslinking proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ning et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nashchekin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khanal et al., 2016</xref>). In hippocampal neurons, CAMSAP2 localizes to the MT minus ends and plays an important role in axon specification and dendrite formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yau et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons, PTRN-1 is required for synaptic vesicle localization, neurite morphology and axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chuang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marcette et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Richardson et al., 2014</xref>). However, to our knowledge, it is completely unknown about a potential role of Patronin in regulating neuronal development including pruning in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Moreover, whether the minus-end-out MT orientation is critical for dendrite pruning remains poorly understood.</p><p>Here, we report that MT minus-end-binding protein Patronin plays a crucial role in dendrite pruning in class IV ddaC neurons. Overexpression of Patronin resembles <italic>patronin</italic> mutants in terms of dendrite pruning phenotypes. The CKK domain is important for Patronin’s function in governing dendrite pruning. Moreover, both <italic>patronin</italic> knockdown and overexpression resulted in a drastic decrease of the MT minus-end marker Nod-β-gal and a significant increase of anterograde EB1-GFP comets in proximal ddaC dendrites, indicating that Patronin may stabilize uniform minus-end-out MTs in the dendrites. Interestingly, attenuation of Klp10A, a kinesin-13 MT depolymerase, in <italic>patronin</italic> ddaC neurons significantly restored uniform minus-end-out MTs in dendrites and thereby rescued dendrite pruning defects. Thus, our study demonstrates, for the first time, that the MT minus-end-binding protein Patronin orients uniform minus-end-out MT arrays in dendrites to govern dendrite-specific pruning mainly through antagonizing Klp10A activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> sensory neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Patronin is required for Dendrite pruning and arborization in ddaC neurons</title><p>Severing, the first step of dendrite-specific pruning, takes place in the proximal dendrites of C4da or ddaC neurons where MT minus ends predominantly localize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rolls et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zheng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Satoh et al., 2008</xref>).

Dendritic MT breakdown precedes membrane scission, which leads to physical severing of proximal dendrites from the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Williams and Truman, 2005</xref>). In ddaC neurons, dendrites are enriched with MT minus ends and organized with predominant minus-end-out MT arrays, whereas the axons differ in MT orientation and acquire a plus-end-out pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rolls et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zheng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Satoh et al., 2008</xref>). However, the involvement of MT minus-end-binding proteins in governing dendritic MT orientation and thereby dendrite pruning is completely unknown. In this study, we identified a MT minus-end-binding protein Patronin for its key role in dendrite-specific pruning of ddaC neurons. Patronin/CAMSAP/PTRN-1 were previously reported to track and stabilize MT minus ends, and regulate axon specification and dendrite morphology in mammals and worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Richardson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marcette et al., 2014</xref>), but their roles in neuronal MT orientation remained unknown. In this study, we provide the evidence indicating that Patronin plays an important role in governing minus-end-out orientation of dendritic MTs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ddaC sensory neurons. Mechanistically, we show that Patronin regulates dendritic MT orientation to facilitate dendrite pruning by suppressing the Klp10A activity. Thus, we demonstrate, for the first time, that a MT minus-end-binding protein facilitates neuronal pruning by orienting proper MT arrays in neurites.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Patronin is a novel player of dendrite pruning in ddaC neurons</title><p>Patronin was first identified as a regulator of mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goshima et al., 2007</xref>). Patronin recognizes and stabilizes free MT minus ends against kinesin 13-mediated MT depolymerization in cultured S2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goodwin and Vale, 2010</xref>). Recent studies have started to unravel the important roles of Patronin in neuronal development and differentiation. Mammalian CAMSAP2 stabilizes neuronal MTs in axons and dendrites by its association with noncentrosomal MT minus ends; it is required for axon specification and dendrite arborization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yau et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, PTRN-1 is required for several developmental processes, such as synapse stabilization and neurite formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marcette et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Richardson et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we provide multiple lines of in vivo evidence to demonstrate that Patronin is a novel regulator of dendrite pruning in ddaC neurons, and Patronin regulates dendrite pruning by suppressing the activity of Klp10A. First, genetic analyses with multiple RNAi lines, two <italic>patronin</italic> mutants as well as the rescue experiment unambiguously reveal that Patronin is required for dendrite pruning in a cell-autonomous manner. Second, we conducted gain-of-function studies using two independent transgenes and further demonstrated that Patronin acts in a dose-sensitive manner to govern dendrite pruning. Third, we also show Patronin’s role in initial dendrite arborization, which, however, is separable from its function in dendrite pruning. Fourth, attenuation of Klp10A function significantly rescued the <italic>patronin</italic> mutant phenotype in terms of dendrite pruning. Finally, overexpression of Klp10A inhibited dendrite pruning and resembled the <italic>patronin</italic> loss-of-function mutants. Thus, Patronin promotes dendrite pruning primarily via antagonizing the Klp10A activity.</p><p>Patronin/CAMSAPs/PTRN-1 contains a N-terminal CH domain, three CC domains, and a MT-binding CKK domain at the C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baines et al., 2009</xref>). Mammalian CAMSAPs recognize MT minus-ends via their CKK domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> Patronin was reported to target MT minus ends via its CC domains, whereas its CKK domain localizes along MTs and is essential for supressing MT minus-end dynamics in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goodwin and Vale, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hendershott and Vale, 2014</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons, the CKK domain of PTRN-1 is necessary and sufficient for its function in MT dynamics and axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chuang et al., 2014</xref>). Our functional domain analyses reveal that the MT-binding CKK domain is important for Patronin’s function in dendrite pruning of ddaC neurons, whereas CH and CC domains appear to be less important. Thus, our study further highlights a functional importance of the CKK domain in neuronal pruning. It is conceivable that Patronin acts via this domain to stabilize dendritic MT minus ends and thereby orient normal dendritic MTs to facilitate dendrite-specific pruning of ddaC neurons. Consistent with this idea, a recent structural analysis revealed that the CKK domain preferentially binds to a curved region of MT minus ends on the outer surface to prevent the association of kinesin-13 depolymerase with the same site via steric inhibition, thereby protecting MT minus ends from kinesin-13-mediated MT depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atherton et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Patronin regulates the minus-end-out orientation of dendritic MTs in ddaC dendrites</title><p>Mammalian CAMSAP3/Nezha interacts with the spectraplakin ACF7, a cytoskeletal crosslinking protein, anchors non-centrosomal MT minus ends to actin filaments and thereby polarizes MT networks in cultured epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ning et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Noordstra et al., 2016</xref>). However, it remains unknown about a role of Patronin/CAMSAPs/PTRN-1 in regulating MT polarity in differentiated neurons. Here, we demonstrate that Patronin governs uniform MT orientation in the major dendrites of ddaC sensory neurons. We first show that the MT minus-end marker Nod-β-gal was greatly reduced in the dendrites of <italic>patronin</italic> mutant neurons, concomitantly with its robust accumulation in the soma. This finding suggests a strong reduction in non-centrosomal minus ends in the dendrites. Moreover, the axon-specific marker Kin-β-gal, which marks MT plus ends, mis-localized to the dendrites in <italic>patronin</italic> mutant neurons, indicative of increased plus-end-out MT arrays in the dendrites. Consistent with these observations, we further show a significant increase in anterior EB1-GFP comets in the major dendrites of <italic>patronin</italic> neurons, suggesting impaired MT orientation. Moreover, the number of EB1-GFP comets, which reflects overall MT density and MT nucleation levels in the dendrites, was not significantly different between wild-type and <italic>patronin</italic> neurons. Finally, we demonstrate that Patronin controls MT minus-end-out orientation by suppressing the kinesin-13/Klp10A activity.</p><p>How might Patronin regulate MT minus-end-out orientation in ddaC dendrites? Similar to its mammalian counterpart in cultured hippocampal neurons, Patronin likely associates in vivo with non-centrosomal MT minus-ends and stabilizes them against kinesin-13-mediated MT depolymerization in the ddaC dendrites. Via MT guidance or sliding by plus-end motors kinesins, growing MTs might be oriented in a minus-end-out manner in the dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mattie et al., 2010</xref>). In the absence of Patronin, dendritic MTs might be depolymerized into short filaments from their minus ends mediated by excessive depolymerization activity of Klp10A and/or other MT severing factors. Microtubule depolymerising or severing factors have been observed to depolymerize MTs into short filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McNally and Vale, 1993</xref>). Short MT filaments, which was proposed to be re-oriented in either plus-end-out or minus-end-out direction with equal probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">del Castillo et al., 2015</xref>), can serve as seeds for MT growth, resulting in a mixed MT polarity in the dendrites of <italic>patronin</italic> mutant neurons. Consistent with this speculation, we show that the MT minus-end marker Nod-β-gal robustly accumulated in the soma of <italic>patronin</italic> mutant neurons. Moreover, depletion of Klp10A in <italic>patronin</italic> mutant neurons fully restored dendritic distribution of the minus-end-marker Nod-β-gal as well as the minus-end-out MT orientation in the dendrites, supporting the idea that kinesin-13-dependent MT depolymerization at the minus ends is attributed to the impaired MT orientation in the dendrites. We further show that the number of EB1-GFP comets was not significantly different between wild-type and <italic>patronin</italic> neurons, suggesting that MT nucleation levels or plus-end growth activity appears to be unaffected by the absence of Patronin. <italic>patronin</italic> depletion might result in excessive MT depolymerization primarily at the MT minus ends. Consistent with this notion, it was reported that in Patronin-deficient <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, minus end depolymerization often halted when it reached the EB1-enriched MT plus end tips, indicating that +TIP proteins might resist continued minus-end depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goodwin and Vale, 2010</xref>). Second, given that a small proportion of CAMSAP3 is able to bind to MT plus ends in cultured epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ning et al., 2016</xref>), one might envisage that Patronin might bind to dendritic MT plus ends in ddaC neurons and regulate MT orientation together with the MT plus-end-binding proteins such as kinesin-1/2, EB-1 and APC2. These proteins were previously reported to regulate dendritic MT orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mattie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herzmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yan et al., 2013</xref>); kinesin-1/2 and EB-1 have recently shown to be involved in dendrite pruning although the mechanism remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herzmann et al., 2018</xref>) (Wang and Yu, unpublished data). The potential relevance between Patronin and plus-end regulators awaits further investigation in future. Finally, Patronin is recruited to the actin-rich anterior cortex by Shot, a cytoskeletal crosslinking protein, and controls the anterior-posterior MT polarity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nashchekin et al., 2016</xref>). Patronin might also anchor MT minus ends to actin through Shot in ddaC sensory neurons. Given that the distal dendrites of ddaC neurons are actin-rich (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Medina et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nagel et al., 2012</xref>), Patronin might tether free minus ends of MT filaments to the distal branches to elongate dendritic MTs with minus-end-out orientation. This possibility could be interrogated by removal of Shot or actin regulators in ddaC neurons in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A high correlation between MT orientation and dendrite-specific pruning in ddaC sensory neurons</title><p>Neuron highly relies on its MT cytoskeleton to support neuronal architecture as well as facilitate intracellular transport of proteins and organelles. In mammalian neurons, axonal MTs are oriented plus-end-out, whereas dendritic MTs have mixed orientations with both plus-end-out and minus-end-out patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baas and Lin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yau et al., 2016</xref>). MTs are arranged in a predominant minus-end-out orientation in major dendrites of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stone et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goodwin et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> developing da neurons, including ddaC neurons, initially exhibit a mixed orientation of MTs in dendrites and gradually mature to have a uniform minus-end-out pattern over several days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hill et al., 2012</xref>). Mature ddaC neurons maintain the minus-end-out orientation of MTs in their dendrites before the onset of pruning (Wang and Yu, unpublished data). Emerging evidence suggests that uniform dendritic MT orientation might be a prerequisite for dendrite pruning. First, in axon-injured da neurons, dendritic MT orientation becomes mixed instead of minus-end-out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Song et al., 2012</xref>); concurrently, dendrite pruning is also inhibited in ddaC neurons following axon transection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Second, <italic>kinesin-1/2</italic> mutant ddaC neurons show both mixed dendritic MT orientation and dendrite pruning defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herzmann et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we further identified the MT minus-end-binding protein Patronin that is required for dendrite pruning of ddaC neurons, and loss of <italic>patronin</italic> function led to decreased Nod-β-gal levels and increased anterograde EB1-GFP comets in the dendrites. More importantly, co-depletion of the kinesin-13 MT depolymerase Klp10A restored normal Nod-β-gal levels and uniform minus-end-out MT orientation in <italic>patronin</italic> mutant dendrites and thereby rescued the dendrite pruning defects. In addition, CNN and APC1/2, two known regulators of dendritic MT polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yalgin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mattie et al., 2010</xref>), also appear to be required for dendrite pruning. We observed dendrite severing defects in <italic>cnn<sup>hk1</sup></italic> mutant ddaC neurons (52%, n = 23; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3A</xref>) as well as <italic>APC1<sup>Q8</sup></italic>, <italic>APC2<sup>N175K</sup></italic> double mutant ddaC clones (60%, n = 10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3B</xref>). As controls, MT-associated proteins, Futsch and Tau, which regulate MT stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hummel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herzmann et al., 2017</xref>), appear to be dispensable for dendrite pruning, as no dendrite pruning defect was observed in <italic>fustch<sup>N94</sup></italic> or <italic>tau</italic> RNAi ddaC neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3C–D</xref>). Thus, multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that dendritic MT orientation is important for dendrite pruning. Our study favors a model that Patronin stabilizes MT minus ends and maintains MT minus-end-out orientation in dendrites to facilitate the MT breakdown and thereby dendrite pruning. It is possible that uniform minus-end-out MTs may provide the tracks for localizing MT severing factors at the proximal dendrites to disassemble local MT filaments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

For wild-type or mutant ddaC neurons, the percentages of severing defect were quantified in a 275 μm x 275 μm region of the dorsal dendritic field, originating from the abdominal segments 2–5. The severing defect was defined by the presence of dendrites that remain attached to the soma at 16 hr APF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kirilly et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Williams and Truman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuo et al., 2005</xref>). Total length of unpruned dendrites was measured in a 275 μm x 275 μm region of the dorsal dendritic field using ImageJ. The number of samples (n) in each group is shown on the bars. Statistical significance was determined using either two-tailed Student’s t-test (two samples) or one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni test (multiple samples) (*p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001, N.S., not significant).

Embryos were reared on standard cornmeal food without yeast supplement until 96 hr AEL, followed by EB1-GFP imaging. EB1-GFP comet imaging was performed with Olympus FV3000 using 60X Oil lens and Zoom factor 3. ddaC neurons of 96 hr AEL larva were imaged for 3 min. 82 frames were acquired for each neuron at 2.25 s interval and analyzed using and ImageJ software.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank M Gonzalez-Gaitan, TJ Harris, YN Jan, D St Johnston, AL Kolodkin, MM Rolls, T Uemura, the Bloomington Stock Center (BSC), VDRC (Austria), <italic>Drosophila</italic> Genetic Resource Center (Japan), National Institute of Genetics (Japan) for generously providing antibodies and fly stocks.

Please comment on this.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In their manuscript, Wang, Rui and Yu investigate the role of the microtubule (MT) minus-end binding protein, Patronin, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> dendritic arborization neurons. The open questions the authors sought to address were: 1) the role of Patronin in neuronal development and pruning, and 2) the contribution of the minus-end out MT orientation to dendrite pruning. Both knockdown and overexpression of Patronin inhibits the normal timecourse of dendritic pruning in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal dendritic arborization neurons. They find that Patronin is necessary for the maintenance of MT polarity in dendrites. Instead of microtubules being predominantly minus-end out, in Patronin knockdown or mutant neurons, there is a mixture of minus- and plus-end out MTs. Inhibiting the MT depolymerizing kinesein, <italic>klp10A</italic> (kinesin-13), in this background restores the polarity of the MTs, indicating that in the absence of <italic>patronin, klp10A</italic> somehow contributes to this mixed MT polarity. Inhibiting <italic>klp10a</italic> also rescues the dendritic pruning defects observed in the absence of Patronin. The overall message of the paper is that Patronin antagonizes <italic>klp10a</italic> activity normally to maintain uniform MT minus-end out polarity during dendritic maintenance and pruning. In the absence of <italic>patronin</italic>, klp10A somehow functions in disrupting the uniform polarity of microtubules in the dendrites, which in turn disrupts dendritic pruning. The data are very nice and the results are clear; however, the model is incomplete. The effect of Patronin and <italic>klp10a</italic> on MTs are correlative with the pruning defects, not causative, and there can be a wide variety of other MAPs (stabilizers, severing proteins, etc.) whose functions are directly or indirectly disrupted upon Patronin or <italic>klp10a</italic> knockdown. These other possibilities are completely ignored, making the model disjointed and speculative.</p><p>The authors do not mention the direct interaction between Patronin and the MT severing enzyme, katanin (Jiang et al., 2014 and Jiang et al., 2018, the latter of which was not even cited). The authors do mention that katanin itself does not have a role in pruning, but katanin p60-like does based on prior work. It seems important to look at the genetic interaction between Patronin and Kat60L1 as well, before constructing an entire model around Patronin and <italic>klp10a</italic>.</p><p>The authors state many times that Patronin may stabilize uniform minus-end out MTs in the dendrites, but do not explain why and are unable to get at a mechanism in their paper. If the authors think that Patronin anchors MT minus ends in some way in the dendrites, then the CKK results do not make sense. The CKK domain of Patronin is necessary and sufficient for pruning. There is no elaboration as to the functional significance of this domain. Presumably, the CKK domain is not able to anchor the MTs in any way, since it is the minimal domain necessary to bind the MT. So, how does this fit into their model?</p><p>The authors claim that the defects observed in <italic>patronin</italic> knockdown are due to excessive depolymerization by <italic>klp10a</italic>. However, the number of EB1 comets is the same. It is just comet directionality that is perturbed. This does not make sense with their hypothesis. If it is excessive depolymerization by <italic>klp10a</italic>, then there should be far fewer comets. It would make sense if <italic>klp10a</italic> were a cross-linking or sliding kinesin, but a depolymerising kinesin only having an effect on orientation and not number of EB1 comets seems bizarre. Why would misorientation be a result of excessive depolymerization activity?</p><p>The authors state: &quot;As a result, dendritic MTs may collapses into short and unstable filaments, which no longer anchor within the dendrites, instead fall into the soma.&quot; How does a filament fall into the soma? Likely, the MT would just depolymerize entirely, or depolymerize to a point where another stabilizing MAP is located and regrow. The concentration of tubulin in most cells favors new MT growth, and perhaps this new growth could be oriented incorrectly and this is why there is mixed MT polarity. Maybe the absence of Patronin affects another MAP that is necessary for the orientation of the MTs. As the authors note, many proteins result in a mixed MT polarity upon knockdown. There are many different MAPs that could be perturbed upon Patronin knockdown, and therefore this may not be a direct effect of Patronin function, but an indirect effect via other MAP functions.</p><p>Finally, why would uniform MT orientation facilitate MT breakdown? This also seem correlative, and the papers they cite provide nothing but speculation as to why the relationship between MT orientation and the progress of pruning. In order to say uniform MT orientation is necessary for MT breakdown and subsequent pruning, the authors would need to test a number of MAPs that have varying effects on MT orientation and assess their effects on the pruning timecourse.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript by Wang et al., the authors report a role for the microtubule minus end protein Patronin/CAMSAP/PTRN-1 in dendrite pruning in the dda dendrites in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In addition, they find a role for Patronin in maintaining minus end out microtubule polarity in these dendrites as well. The CKK domain of Patronin is necessary and sufficient for its role in pruning. Both of these functions appear to operate through the antagonism of the depolymerizing kinesin Klp10A as the phenotypes can be suppressed upon removal of Klp10A function. Overall the data are well presented and the conclusions well supported by the data.</p><p>Two big questions I am left with from this work are:</p><p>1) Why does the maintenance of minus end out microtubules in the dendrite allow for productive pruning? The authors speculate a bit about this in the Discussion, but a clearer connection would elevate the paper. In particular all of the phenotypic observations are made in steady state dendrites. The authors assume the two phenotype- maintenance of minus end out MTs and efficient dendritic pruning -but this is speculation. Would it be possible to better characterize MT polarity in both control and <italic>patronin</italic> mutants during the pruning process, i.e. between WP and 16h APF?</p><p>2) I am confused by the Patronin gain of function phenotype. If the model is &quot;that Patronin promotes dendritic pruning via antagonizing KLP10A function&quot;, then my expectation would be that Patronin overexpression would not lead to pruning defects. This model is at least supported by the MT polarity phenotype upon Patronin overexpression (i.e. that minus end out MT polarity is perturbed), but again this does not fit so neatly into the model presented.</p><p>In some cases, the data presented suggest precocious pruning in some mutant conditions. For example, Figure 7G and H: In the Klp10A OE, there appears to be fewer branches at the WP stage as compared to controls. Is this the case?</p><p>Where does Patronin localize in the neurons at 1) steady state, and 2) during pruning?</p><p>Minor Points:</p><p>Figure 4 legend is out of order in its description of the panels, making it hard to follow</p><p>Figure 4F-H: where are the dendrites here? Aren't they supposed to be labelled with curly brackets as is indicated in the legend? Also, the Kin-B-gal is very hard to see. What are the arrowheads pointing to?</p><p>In many places problems with the writing make it difficult to interpret what the authors are saying. For example, the description of Figure 5 in subsection “Patronin is required for the minus-end-out orientation of dendritic MTs in ddaC neurons” is particularly confusing. The data presented in the figure are clear, but the wording muddies the authors' intent.</p><p>In the same section: &quot;over 80% of anterograde branches moved away from the soma&quot;-isn't this the definition of anterograde?</p><p>Minor corrections:</p><p>Results section, first paragraph: mutant clones.</p><p>Various points throughout the Results section: On average.</p><p>Subsection “Overexpression of Patronin causes dendrite pruning defects in ddaC neurons”, first paragraph, final sentence: as a.</p><p>Subsection “Attenuation of Klp10A, a kinesin-13 MT depolymerase, suppresses the <italic>patronin</italic> phenotype in MT orientation in ddaC dendrites”: Previous studies or A previous study.</p><p>Discussion section, first paragraph: PTRN-1.</p><p>Figure 4D and H axis label &quot;moving&quot;</p><p>Figure 4: What is GFP labeling here?

My overall impression is still that the manuscript describes a very interesting observation, although the underlying mechanism is still unclear.</p><p>– The connection between MT polarity (rather than stability) and pruning is now stronger. However, how polarity actually affects pruning is not explored.</p><p>– I couldn't find the phenotype of the Katanin single knock down, which makes interpreting the double knock down with Patronin impossible. I think that this is a technical point that has to be addressed or this experiment should be removed.</p><p>– The conclusion that Patronin loss and gain of function lead to pruning defects in the same way has been strengthened by the revisions. It is still unclear to me how this actually fits into the proposed mechanism (see below).</p><p>– The revisions haven't clarified the mechanism through which Patronin affects polarity and not stability. There is some disagreement between the reduced Futch staining and the normal number of plus-end comets. The authors' model about Klp10A affecting only minus ends does not explain why it would stop depolymerizing before overtaking the entire polymer, or how it distinguishes the minus ends of minus-end-out vs those of plus-end-out MTs. As a minor point, it is possible that short MTs would turn around in the axon or dendrite as they suggest, but the reference cited (del Castillo et al) describes MT sliding by dynein and kinesin-1 and it is not clear why the authors chose it to support their model.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39964.041</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) Reviewers found that the causality between MT polarity defects and pruning is lacking.

Two co-authors of this manuscript have repeated the experiment and found the same result (revised Figure 5D). Moreover, Klp10A overexpression did not cause a signification reduction in the number of EB1-GFP comets in the dendrites (Figure 8I) but caused the MT polarity defect in the dendrites (Figure 8G-H) (subsection “Klp10A overexpression phenocopies <italic>patronin</italic> knockdown in dendrite pruning and dendritic MT orientation”), resembling the <italic>patronin</italic> RNAi knockdown (Figure 5D). These data imply that <italic>patronin</italic> RNAi or Klp10A overexpression might result in excessive MT depolymerization primarily at the MT minus ends, rather than affect the number of EB1-GFP comets that mark MT growth at the MT plus ends. Consistent with this notion, it was reported that in Patronin-deficient <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, minus end depolymerization often halted when it reached the EB1-enriched MT plus end tips, indicating that +TIP proteins including EB1 might resist continued minus-end depolymerization (Goodwin and Vale, 2010). On the other hand, in worm touch neurons, depletion of the <italic>patronin</italic> homolog leads to an increase in the number of EB1 comets (Chuang et al., 2014).

Microtubule depolymerising or severing factors have been observed to depolymerize MTs into short filaments (McNally F. et al., Cell 1993). Short MT filaments, which was proposed to be re-oriented in either plus-end-out or minus-end-out direction with equal probability (del Castillo et al., 2015), can serve as seeds for MT growth, resulting in a mixed MT polarity in the dendrites of <italic>patronin</italic> mutant neurons.

Knockdown of <italic>klp10A</italic>, via two independent RNAi lines, significantly suppressed the dendrite pruning defects in Patronin-overexpressing ddaC neurons (Figure 7F-J). Moreover, knockdown of <italic>klp10A</italic> also significantly suppressed the MT orientation defect in the dendrites of Patronin-overexpressing ddaC neurons (Figure 7K-N). Therefore, these results suggest that both gain of <italic>patronin</italic> function and loss of <italic>patronin</italic> function affects dendrite pruning at least partially by upregulation of Klp10A function. We have now included the new data in the revised Figure 7F-N and text (subsection “Patronin promotes dendrite pruning by orienting uniform minus-end-out MT arrays in dendrites”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The CKK domain of Patronin is necessary and sufficient for pruning, which seems to be a surprising result considering that it is the minimal domain necessary to bind the MT. How can one explain this result?</p></disp-quote><p>In the original manuscript, we show that CKK-deleted Patronin variant (PatroninΔCKK) failed to rescue the dendrite pruning defects in <italic>patronin</italic><sup>c9-c5</sup> ddaC neurons, whereas the expression of the CKK domain significantly rescued <italic>patronin</italic><sup>c9-c5</sup>-associated dendrite pruning defects, suggesting that the CKK domain is necessary and sufficient for Patronin’s function during dendrite pruning. We have now conducted additional experiments to elaborate the functional significance of the CKK domain. First, we confirmed that the expression of the CKK domain alone significantly rescued the dendrite pruning defects in the <italic>patronin</italic> RNAi background (Figure 8—figure supplement 2A). Second, the expression of the CKK domain almost fully rescued Nod-lacZ distribution as well as retrograde EB1-GFP comets in the dendrites of <italic>patronin</italic> RNAi ddaC neurons (Figure 8—figure supplement 2B-C). Third, the expression of the CKK domain significantly suppressed the dendrite pruning defects in Klp10A-overexpressing ddaC neurons (Figure 8—figure supplement 2D), suggesting that the CKK domain is able to antagonize Klp10A’s function during dendrite pruning. Thus, multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that the CKK domain is important for Patronin to govern minus-end-out MT orientation in dendrites as well as dendrite pruning. Thus, we propose the model in which via its CKK domain, Patronin is essential for the establishment of minus-end-out MTs in the dendrites of ddaC neurons.

We have now included the new data in the revised Figure 7—figure supplement 1C-D and text (subsection “Patronin promotes dendrite pruning by orienting uniform minus-end-out MT arrays in dendrites”).</p><p>We propose that in wild-type ddaC neurons, Patronin likely associates with non-centrosomal MT minus-ends and stabilizes them against kinesin-13-mediated MT depolymerization in the dendrites. Via MT guidance or sliding by plus-end motors kinesins, growing MTs might be oriented in a minus-end-out manner in the dendrites (Yan et al., 2013; Mattie et al., 2010). In the absence of Patronin, dendritic MTs might be depolymerized into short filaments from their minus ends mediated by excessive depolymerization activity of Klp10A and/or other MT severing factors. Microtubule depolymerising or severing factors have been observed to depolymerize MTs into short filaments (McNally et al., Cell 1993).

We previously reared the larva in the grape-juice food to obtain brighter EB1-GFP signals. Due to the poor nutrition, those larvae appeared less healthy with reduced eclosion rate, likely due to cellular stress. To improve the growth condition, we have now reared the larvae on normal cornmeal food without yeast supplement (live yeast often generates auto-fluorescent signals). In the new condition, the larvae were much healthier and survived to the adulthood. Their ddaC neurons also showed detectable EB1-GFP comets, however, with fewer comet number than those reared in the grape-juice food. Importantly, two co-authors of this manuscript independently obtained similar results on EB1 comet movement and MT orientation from both <italic>patronin</italic> RNAi and Patronin-overexpressing neurons in larvae on the new growth condition.

This is similar to the final pruning of EcRDN-overexpressing ddaC/D/E neurons at 30 h APF (Williams and Truman, 2005; Kirilly et al., 2009; Kirilly et al., 2011).

In addition, EB1-GFP was expressed at a low level under the control of the weaker Gal4 driver Gal44-77 in order to visualize its comets, whereas Nod-lacZ was driven by the strong driver ppk-Gal4.

The open questions the authors sought to address were: 1) the role of Patronin in neuronal development and pruning, and 2) the contribution of the minus-end out MT orientation to dendrite pruning. Both knockdown and overexpression of Patronin inhibits the normal timecourse of dendritic pruning in the Drosophila pupal dendritic arborization neurons. They find that Patronin is necessary for the maintenance of MT polarity in dendrites. Instead of microtubules being predominantly minus-end out, in Patronin knockdown or mutant neurons, there is a mixture of minus- and plus-end out MTs. Inhibiting the MT depolymerizing kinesein, klp10A (kinesin-13), in this background restores the polarity of the MTs, indicating that in the absence of patronin, klp10A somehow contributes to this mixed MT polarity. Inhibiting klp10a also rescues the dendritic pruning defects observed in the absence of Patronin. The overall message of the paper is that Patronin antagonizes klp10a activity normally to maintain uniform MT minus-end out polarity during dendritic maintenance and pruning. In the absence of patronin, klp10A somehow functions in disrupting the uniform polarity of microtubules in the dendrites, which in turn disrupts dendritic pruning. The data are very nice and the results are clear; however, the model is incomplete. The effect of Patronin and klp10a on MTs are correlative with the pruning defects, not causative, and there can be a wide variety of other MAPs (stabilizers, severing proteins, etc.) whose functions are directly or indirectly disrupted upon Patronin or klp10a knockdown. These other possibilities are completely ignored, making the model disjointed and speculative.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now examined the possible role of cnn and APC1/2 (regulators of dendritic MT polarity) as well as futsch and tau (MT stabilizers) in dendrite pruning.

Likewise, APC1Q8, APC2N175K double mutant ddaC neurons also exhibited dendrite severing defects (60%, Figure 8—figure supplement 3B). In contrast, no dendrite pruning defect was observed in fustchN94 or tau RNAi ddaC neurons (Figure 8—figure supplement 3C-D). These new data, together with our <italic>patronin</italic> results, further indicate that proper dendritic MT polarity is important for dendrite pruning.

There is no elaboration as to the functional significance of this domain. Presumably, the CKK domain is not able to anchor the MTs in any way, since it is the minimal domain necessary to bind the MT. So, how does this fit into their model?</p></disp-quote><p>In the original manuscript, we show that CKK-deleted Patronin variant (PatroninΔCKK) failed to rescue the dendrite pruning defects in <italic>patronin</italic><sup>c9-c5</sup> ddaC neurons, whereas the expression of the CKK domain significantly rescued <italic>patronin</italic><sup>c9-c5</sup>-associated dendrite pruning defects, suggesting that the CKK domain is necessary and sufficient for Patronin’s function during dendrite pruning. We have now conducted additional experiments to elaborate the functional significance of the CKK domain. First, we confirmed that the expression of the CKK domain alone significantly rescued the dendrite pruning defects in the <italic>patronin</italic> RNAi background (Figure 8—figure supplement 2A). Second, the expression of the CKK domain almost fully rescued Nod-lacZ distribution as well as retrograde EB1-GFP comets in the dendrites of <italic>patronin</italic> RNAi ddaC neurons (Figure 8—figure supplement 2B-C). Third, the expression of the CKK domain significantly suppressed the dendrite pruning defects in Klp10A-overexpressing ddaC neurons (Figure 8—figure supplement 2D), suggesting that the CKK domain is able to antagonize Klp10A’s function during dendrite pruning. Thus, multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that the CKK domain is important for Patronin to govern minus-end-out MT orientation in dendrites as well as dendrite pruning.

Two co-authors of this manuscript have repeated the experiment and found the same result (revised Figure 5D).

These data imply that <italic>patronin</italic> RNAi or Klp10A overexpression might result in excessive MT depolymerization primarily at the MT minus ends, rather than affect the number of EB1-GFP comets that mark MT growth at the MT plus ends.
