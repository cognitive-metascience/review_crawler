We now report expression of full-length CD95L mRNA itself is highly toxic to cells and induces a similar form of cell death. We demonstrate that small (s)RNAs derived from CD95L are loaded into the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) which is required for the toxicity and processing of CD95L mRNA into sRNAs is independent of both Dicer and Drosha. We provide evidence that in addition to the CD95L transgene a number of endogenous protein coding genes involved in regulating protein translation, particularly under low miRNA conditions, can be processed to sRNAs and loaded into the RISC suggesting a new level of cell fate regulation involving RNAi.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Fas</kwd><kwd>DISE</kwd><kwd>RNAi</kwd><kwd>RISC</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35CA197450</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peter</surname><given-names>Marcus E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32CA009560</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Putzbach</surname><given-names>Will</given-names></name><name><surname>Haluck-Kangas</surname><given-names>Ashley</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R50CA221848</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bartom</surname><given-names>Elizabeth T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The mRNA of the apoptosis inducing death ligand CD95L/FasL kills cancer cells through RNAi after conversion into small RNAs that are loaded into the RNA-induced Silencing Complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Activation of CD95/Fas through interaction with its cognate ligand CD95L or receptor-activating antibodies induces apoptosis in sensitive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Suda et al., 1993</xref>). Virtually all research on CD95 and CD95L has focused on the physical interaction between the two proteins and the subsequent protein-based signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Algeciras-Schimnich et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nisihara et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schneider et al., 1997</xref>). However, we have recently shown that the mRNA of CD95 and CD95L harbor sequences that when converted into small interfering (si) or short hairpin (sh)RNAs, cause massive and robust toxicity in all tested cancer cells. These CD95/CD95L-derived si/shRNAs target a network of survival genes, resulting in the simultaneous activation of multiple cell death pathways through RNA interference (RNAi) in a process we called DISE (Death Induced by Survival gene Elimination) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Putzbach et al., 2017</xref>). We determined that for a si/shRNA to elicit this form of toxicity, only positions 2–7 of the guide strand, the 6mer seed sequence, are required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Putzbach et al., 2017</xref>). More recently, a screen of all 4096 6mer seeds revealed that optimal 6mer seed toxicity requires G-rich seeds targeting C-rich regions in the 3'UTRs of survival genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gao et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In this report, we show that expression of the CD95L mRNA itself is toxic to cells even without prior conversion to small (s)RNAs. This toxicity is independent of the full-length CD95L protein or expression of the CD95 receptor and resembles DISE. The toxicity also involves RNAi. We found that multiple sRNAs are generated from the mRNA of CD95L within cells and are loaded into the RNA-induced Silencing Complex (RISC), the key mediator of RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, we provide evidence that endogenous mRNAs can be processed into sRNAs and loaded into the RISC, especially in cells with low expression of miRNAs. The subset of genes found in the RISC are regulators of protein translation and cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CD95L mRNA is toxic to cells</title><p>By testing every possible shRNA derived from the CD95L open reading frame (ORF) or its 3'UTR, we recently found a high enrichment of toxic si/shRNAs derived from the CD95L ORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Putzbach et al., 2017</xref>). More recently we determined that the 6mer seed toxicity observed in many si/shRNAs is largely due to their nucleotide composition, with G-rich seeds being the most toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gao et al., 2018</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://6merdb.org">https://6merdb.org</ext-link>). When reanalyzing the CD95L ORF-derived shRNAs, we found a significant correlation between the toxicity of the most toxic CD95L-derived shRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Putzbach et al., 2017</xref>) and the toxicity of the corresponding 6mer seed we recently determined in a screen of all 4096 6mer seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gao et al., 2018</xref>). This suggests that CD95L-derived si/shRNAs kill cancer cells, in large part through 6mer seed toxicity.</p><p>We therefore wondered whether expression of the CD95L ORF mRNA—without pre-processing into artificial siRNAs—would be toxic to cells. Expression of CD95L protein in most cells kills through the induction of apoptosis. Consequently, expressing CD95L in HeyA8 cells, which are highly sensitive to CD95 mediated apoptosis, killed cells within a few hours after infection with a lentivirus encoding CD95L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left panel). Interestingly, severe growth reduction was seen without any signs of apoptosis (not shown) when a CD95L mutant, unable to bind CD95, was expressed (CD95L<sup>MUT</sup> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left panel). This mutant carries an Y218R point mutation, that prevents the CD95L protein from binding to CD95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schneider et al., 1997</xref>), and is expressed at a similar level to wild type (wt) CD95L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To prevent the CD95L mRNA from producing full-length CD95L protein, we also introduced a premature stop codon right after the start codon in the CD95L<sup>MUT</sup> vector (CD95L<sup>MUT</sup>NP). This construct (containing four point mutations and confirmed to produce mRNA with no detectable full-length CD95L protein, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) was similarly active in reducing the growth of HeyA8 cells compared to the CD95L<sup>MUT</sup> vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left panel). CD95L<sup>MUT</sup>NP still produced truncated and likely soluble CD95L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), likely due to use of an alternative start codon. However, the supernatant of 293T cells infected with this virus did not induce apoptosis when added to HeyA8 cells (data not shown) confirming that it had no apoptosis inducing activity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38621.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The CD95L mRNA is toxic to cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Left</italic>: Schematic of the different CD95L mutants used. <italic>Right:</italic> Percent cell confluence over time of HeyA8 parental cells in the absence (<italic>left panel</italic>) or in the presence of 20 μM zVAD-fmk (<italic>center panel</italic>), or CD95 k.o. cells (<italic>right panel</italic>) after expression of CD95L constructs.

This was confirmed by expressing the three CD95L constructs in the presence of the oligo-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, center panel). With suppressed apoptosis, all three constructs were now equally toxic to HeyA8 cells. Finally, we tested a HeyA8 CD95 k.o. clone confirmed to express no CD95 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Putzbach et al., 2017</xref>). In these cells, without the addition of zVAD-fmk, wt CD95L and CD95L<sup>MUT</sup>NP were again equally active in reducing the growth of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right panel). Together, these data suggested it is the CD95L mRNA that killed the cells. Cell death was confirmed by quantifying nuclear fragmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We also detected a significant increase of ROS in cells expressing CD95L<sup>MUT</sup>NP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), which is a characteristic feature of DISE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hadji et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Patel and Peter, 2018</xref>). To exclude the possibility that truncated CD95 protein or any part of the CD95 mRNA would play a role in this toxicity, we deleted the CD95 gene in MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Overexpression of wild-type CD95L killed clone FA4 cells, which harbor a complete homozygous deletion of the entire CD95 gene (exon 1–9), as well as CD95 protein k.o. clone #21 cells that retain some truncated mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>Finally, to exclude that the truncated protein produced by the CD95L<sup>MUT</sup>NP construct had any unintended activity, we mutated the ATG start codon that most likely gave rise to the truncated CD95L to ATA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This CD95L<sup>MUT</sup>NP (G258A) mutant construct did not produce any detectable protein anymore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>) but was as toxic to the CD95 k.o. HeyA8 cells as CD95L<sup>MUT</sup>NP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>Our experiments demonstrated that a small number of point mutations introduced into various CD95L mutants did not significantly affect the toxicity of CD95L mRNA. To determine whether a large number of mutations would reduce its toxicity, we generated a CD95L<sup>MUT</sup>NP mutant with 308 codon optimized silent point mutations (CD95L<sup>SIL</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). The activity of this mutant construct to negatively affect cell growth of CD95 k.o. HeyA8 cells was compared to two independently cloned wt CD95L constructs (WT1 and WT2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). The mutant SIL construct was equally effective in suppressing cell growth and produced about the same amount of CD95L mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). However, the SIL construct only produced about 12% of WT CD95L protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>), again supporting the observation that it is the CD95L mRNA and not the protein that elicits toxicity.</p><p>We recently determined that a general toxicity of si/shRNAs is largely based on the composition of the 6mer seed sequence of the guide strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gao et al., 2018</xref>). We now plotted the toxicity of all sRNAs that can be derived from either the WT or the SIL mutant CD95L and found that the overall predicted toxicity based on our toxicity screen performed in HeyA8 cells was not statistically different between the two CD95L constructs, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>) suggesting that toxic sequences are embedded in the CD95L<sup>SIL</sup> ORF. Taken together, our data indicate that even mutating more than 300 positions in CD95L mRNA still allows it to form toxic sRNAs suggesting that the toxicity of CD95L mRNA is a highly robust phenomenon.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CD95L mRNA kills cells through DISE</title><p>After infection with CD95L, CD95 k.o. HeyA8 cells exhibited morphological changes strikingly similar to the changes seen in wt HeyA8 cells after introduction of a CD95L-derived shRNA (shL3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video4">4</xref>) suggesting the cells died through a similar mechanism. To determine the cause of cell death induced by CD95L mRNA in HeyA8 CD95 k.o. cells molecularly, we performed a RNA-Seq analysis. We found that expression of CD95L caused preferential downregulation of critical survival genes and not of nonsurvival genes in a control set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, cell death induced by CD95L mRNA resulted in a substantial loss of 11 of the 12 histones detected to be downregulated in cells treated with CD95 and CD95L-derived sh/siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Loss of histones is an early event during DISE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Putzbach et al., 2017</xref>). A Metascape analysis demonstrated that nucleosome assembly, regulation of mitosis, and genes consistent with the involvement of histones were among the most significantly downregulated RNAs across all cells in which DISE was induced by any of the four sh/siRNAs or by the expression of CD95L mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This suggests that CD95L mRNA kills cells in the same way as CD95/L-derived si/shRNAs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38621.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Toxicity induced by CD95L overexpression is reminiscent of DISE.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phase-contrast images of HeyA8 and HeyA8 CD95 k.o. cells (cl. #11) after infection with pLKO-shScr/shL3 or pLenti (vec)/pLenti-CD95L, respectively, at the indicated time point.

Drosha k.o. cells lacking the majority of endogenous miRNAs, but retaining expression of Ago proteins, were shown to be hypersensitive to DISE induced by si- and shRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Putzbach et al., 2017</xref>). We interpreted this effect as being caused by an increased pool of unoccupied RNAi machinery due to the absence of most miRNAs. Drosha k.o. cells were also hypersensitive to the expression of CD95L<sup>MUT</sup>NP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, p=0.014, according to a polynomial fitting model); Virtually all cells died (insert in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To directly determine whether the RISC is involved in the toxicity, we introduced CD95L into CD95 k.o. HeyA8 cells after knocking down AGO2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Toxicity elicited by CD95L was blocked following AGO2 knockdown, suggesting that AGO2 was required for CD95L mRNA to be toxic. This was also the case when CD95 k.o. HeyA8 cells were infected with either the CD95<sup>MUT</sup>NP or the CD95<sup>SIL</sup> construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), confirming that all three CD95L versions killed cells with the help of the RISC.

As expected in these cells that died of canonical apoptosis, knockdown of AGO2 did not have any effect on cell viability.

For the pull-down, we used a peptide derived from the Ago-binding protein GW182/TNRC6B recently described to bind to all four Ago proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hauptmann et al., 2015</xref>). As expected in wt HCT116 cells, large amounts of sRNAs (19-23nt in length) were detected bound to the Ago proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Both AGO1 and AGO2 were efficiently pulled down. In contrast, in the Drosha k.o. cells, which cannot generate canonical miRNAs, only a low amount of sRNAs was detected, confirming the absence of miRNAs in the RISC. Surprisingly, the amount of pulled down Ago proteins was severely reduced despite the fact these Drosha k.o. cells express comparable levels of AGO2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Putzbach et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests the peptide did not have access to the Ago proteins in Drosha k.o. cells, presumably because it only efficiently binds to Ago proteins complexed with RNA as recently shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Elkayam et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The analysis of all Ago-bound RNAs showed that in the wt cells, &gt;98.4% of bound RNAs were miRNAs. In contrast, only 34% of bound RNAs were miRNAs in Drosha k.o. cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and data not shown). These include miRNAs that are processed independently of Drosha such as miR-320a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). Consequently, this miRNA became a major RNA species bound to Ago proteins in Drosha k.o. cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In both wt and Drosha k.o. cells, a significant increase in CD95L-derived sRNAs bound to the Ago proteins was detected in cells infected with the CD95L virus compared to cells infected with pLenti empty vector, as expected. They corresponded to 0.0006% and 0.043% of all the Ago-bound RNAs in the wt cells and Drosha k.o. cells, respectively. Toxicity of CD95L mRNA was, therefore, not due to overloading the RISC. In the absence of most miRNAs, the total amount of RNAs bound to Ago proteins in the Drosha k.o. cells was roughly 10% of the amount bound to Ago in wt cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The reduction of Ago-bound miRNAs in Drosha k.o. cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, top row) was paralleled by a substantial increase in binding of other sRNAs to the Ago proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, bottom row). Interestingly, the amount of Ago-bound CD95L-derived sRNAs was &gt;100 times higher in the Drosha k.o. cells compared to the wt cells (red columns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These data support our hypothesis that Drosha k.o. cells are more sensitive to CD95L mRNA-mediated toxicity due to their ability to take up more toxic small CD95L-derived RNAs into the RISC in the absence of most miRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>CD95L ORF is degraded into sRNA fragments that are then loaded into the RISC</title><p>Interestingly, not only did Ago proteins in Drosha k.o. cells bind much more CD95L-derived sRNAs than in the wt cells, but also the peak length of the most abundant Ago-bound RNA species increased from 20 to 23 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, top panel). To determine the sites within the CD95L mRNA that gave rise to small Ago-bound RNAs, we aligned all small Ago-bound RNAs detected in all conditions to the CD95L ORF sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). We identified 22 regions in the CD95L ORF that gave rise to sRNAs that were bound by Ago proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To determine whether these sRNAs were formed in the cytosol and then loaded into the RISC, we also aligned all sRNAs in the total RNA fraction isolated from CD95L<sup>MUT</sup>NP expressing HCT116 Drosha k.o. cells with CD95L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Interestingly, very similar regions of small RNAs were found. Moreover, the mean as well as the peak of the distribution of the read lengths of sRNAs bound to Ago proteins was smaller than in the total small RNAs fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, center panel), suggesting these fragments were trimmed to the appropriate length either right before they were loaded into the RISC or by the RISC itself. This was most obvious for the sRNAs in cluster 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). We also noticed that certain sRNAs were more abundant in the Ago-bound fraction when compared to total RNA relative to all other RNAs. To determine whether this type of processing was specific for HCT116 Drosha k.o. cells, we analyzed the Ago-bound CD95L-derived sRNAs in HeyA8 CD95 k.o. cells after expression of wt CD95L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and compared them with the total RNA fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). While we found fewer CD95L-derived reads in these cells, the general location of some of the read clusters overlapped with the ones found in the Drosha k.o. cells and again both the mean and peak of the distribution of RNA lengths was smaller in the Ago-bound fraction versus the total RNA fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, bottom panel). Together, these data suggest that CD95L mRNA can be processed into smaller RNA fragments, which are then trimmed to a length appropriate for incorporation into the RISC.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38621.013</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The entire CD95L mRNA gives rise to sRNAs that bind to the RISC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Length distribution of CD95L derived reads in various analyses.

This process is independent of Drosha. To determine whether Dicer is required for either processing of CD95L mRNA or loading the sRNAs into the RISC, we expressed CD95L<sup>MUT</sup>NP in wt and Dicer k.o. HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Dicer k.o. cells were still sensitive to toxicity induced by CD95L mRNA expression, suggesting the toxicity of the CD95L mRNA does not require the processing by either Drosha or Dicer. Using custom real-time qPCR primers designed to specifically detect the sRNAs from clusters 8 and 21, we detected, in both wt and Dicer k.o. cells over-expressing CD95L<sup>MUT</sup>NP, fragments from these clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), demonstrating that Dicer is not involved in processing CD95L mRNA.</p><p>All the reported small RNAs derived from CD95L corresponded to the sense strand of the expressed mRNA, raising the question of how they could be processed into double-stranded sRNAs in the absence of an antisense strand. To get a preliminary answer to this question, we subjected the CD95L ORF mRNA sequence to a secondary structure prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). According to this analysis, the CD95L ORF mRNA forms a tightly folded structure with many of the sRNAs of the 22 clusters juxtaposing each other in stem-like structures creating regions of significant complementarity. These may provide the duplexes needed to be processed and loaded into the RISC. Interestingly, some of the juxtaposing reads were found in duplex structures with 3' overhangs. Three of these oligonucleotides (derived from clusters 7, 15 and 22) when expressed as siRNAs were toxic to HeyA8, H460, M565 and 3LL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>To address the question of whether the complete CD95L ORF sequence was required to produce toxic sRNAs, we generated two CD95L fragments, one 5' fragment (280 nt) and one 3' fragment (559 nt) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). When expressed in CD95 k.o. HeyA8 cells, no protein was detected with the anti-CD95L antibody used but they were both significantly expressed at the RNA level albeit at lower levels than wt CD95L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Only the 5' fragment caused a small reduction in cell growth when compared to full length CD95L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). While neither of the two fragments were toxic to wt HCT116 cells, in the hypersensitive Drosha k.o. HCT116 cells both fragments showed weak toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D and E</xref>). These data suggest that fragments of CD95L show reduced toxicity which could be due to their lower expression levels and/or their inability to properly fold and form sRNAs.</p><p>To address the question of whether in addition to exogenously expressed CD95L, mRNAs of endogenous genes would also be processed and loaded into the RISC, we interrogated the RNA-Seq data sets we had from Ago pull-down and total small RNA-Seq analyses in HCT116 wt and HCT116 Drosha k.o. cells. Genes processed in a similar way to CD95L mRNA would have to be significantly expressed at the mRNA level, and would give rise to multiple sRNAs that bound to the RISC more effectively in Drosha k.o. cells when compared to wt cells. We interrogated all data sets using the following parameters: We counted any gene that had at least one unique read that aligned only within its mRNA with a read count of 10 or more. We started by analyzing the Ago bound reads and then compared the location and size of the reads in these identified genes with the analysis of total small RNA of Drosha k.o. cells expressing CD95L. We found Ago bound reads of 10 or more reads/location that aligned with 5629 genes in the human genome. Of these genes ~ 10% were noncoding, 558 (~10%) were protein coding genes that met our criteria for processing, and 4498 genes (~80%) were protein coding genes that did not. The top ten most abundant processed coding genes with multiple unique reads in the RISC are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>. The ones most evenly processed are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>. In almost all cases, similar to processed CD95L, the average length of the reads bound to the Ago proteins was smaller than the ones found in total RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). While these genes were abundantly expressed, they were not the most abundant mRNAs in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Of the protein coding genes with reads bound to Ago proteins many of them were highly expressed, yet they were not processed in this form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). When all small reads derived from these five genes were aligned with the human genome, we observed that: 1) The reads were between 5–10 times more abundant in the RISC of cells devoid of Drosha expression and 2) they were loaded equally efficiently in cells expressing the empty vector control or the CD95L expressing virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38621.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Endogenous mRNAs are processed and loaded into the RISC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Length distribution of reads derived from five of the top ten most abundant genes loaded into the RISC of CD95L expressing HCT116 Drosha k.o. cells.

To begin to address this question, we subjected all processed coding genes with RISC bound sRNAs to a DAVID gene ontology analysis. Strikingly, genes found in many of these enriched clusters were involved in cell growth (green rows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>). In fact, the most significantly enriched genes were involved in protein translation (dark green rows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Interestingly, in addition to cyclin D1, MYC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and CDK6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary File 1</xref>) and many initiation and elongation factors, 38 of the mRNAs of the 50 ribosomal proteins (76%) in the analysis were processed in this way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>). This suggests that proteins involved in protein translation may be marked to be processed and loaded into the RISC.</p><p>Our data suggest that mRNAs of endogenous protein coding genes can be processed and loaded into the RISC especially under low miRNA conditions. This raised the question of whether RISC loaded sRNAs could negatively regulate cell growth. We noticed that Drosha k.o. cells consistently grew slower than their parental wt cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Based on our recent data on 6mer seed toxicity we wondered whether in the absence of most nontoxic and therefore protective miRNAs cells would incorporate sRNAs into the RISC that negatively affect cell growth through a low level of survival gene targeting. To address this question, we compared the 6mer seed toxicity of all sRNAs bound to Ago proteins in either wt or Drosha k.o. cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). The difference in predicted seed toxicity was striking. Most RISC bound sRNAs in wt cells were miRNAs with low seed toxicity (blue columns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In contrast, in Drosha k.o. cells the majority of RISC bound sRNAs had a rather toxic 6mer seed (red columns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This suggested that such sRNAs may constantly put pressure on the expression of survival genes. To test this, we knocked down AGO2 in the Drosha k.o. cells and this treatment resulted in an increase of their growth rate that was now similar to the one observed in wt cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). These data suggest that endogenous RISC bound sRNAs may regulate cell growth through the DISE mechanism.</p><p>In summary, our data suggest that si- and/or shRNAs with certain seed sequences present in CD95 and CD95L and the entire CD95L ORF are toxic to cancer cells. The CD95L mRNA is processed into sRNAs that are loaded into the RISC that then target critical survival genes. This results in cell death largely through 6mer seed toxicity. This process is independent of both Drosha and Dicer. Furthermore, our data suggest that a high miRNA content, by ‘filling up’ the RISC, might render cells less sensitive to this form of cell death and that multiple endogenous mRNAs are processed and loaded into the RISC and may regulate cell fate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We recently reported a novel form of cell death that was observed after expression of si/shRNAs designed from the sequences of CD95/CD95L mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Putzbach et al., 2017</xref>). More recently we described that cells die from a loss of multiple survival genes through a mechanism we call 6mer seed toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gao et al., 2018</xref>). The most toxic si/shRNAs derived from CD95 or CD95L were found in the ORF of CD95L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Putzbach et al., 2017</xref>). This pointed toward the CD95L mRNA itself being toxic.</p><p>We now show that expression of full-length CD95L mRNA triggers toxicity that is independent of the protein product and canonical apoptosis. This is intriguing considering that previous studies showed transgenic expression of CD95L using viruses killed multiple cancer cells that were completely resistant to CD95 mediated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">ElOjeimy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hyer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sudarshan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sun et al., 2012</xref>). These results were interpreted as intracellular CD95L triggering apoptosis more efficiently than when added to the cells. However, we now provide an alternate explanation—namely, both the CD95L protein <italic>and</italic> mRNA are toxic to cells through distinct mechanisms. The protein induces apoptosis, and the mRNA induces toxicity through an RNAi-based mechanism.</p><p>We demonstrate that Dicer and Drosha are not involved in generating the Ago-bound CD95L-derived fragments but there are several candidate RNases that are capable of processing mRNAs. Given the differences in length distribution between the cytosolic versus Ago-bound RNA fragments, it is likely that CD95L-derived fragment intermediates are incorporated into the RISC and then trimmed to the appropriate length by Ago. Indeed, a similar mechanism is known to occur during the maturation of the erythropoietic miR-451, where the pre-miRNA is first cleaved by AGO2 and then trimmed at the 3’ end to the final mature form by the exoribonuclease PARN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yoda et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, a similar process occurs with the recently identified class of Ago-bound RNAs called agotrons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hansen et al., 2016</xref>), which consist of an excised intron loaded into the RISC in a manner independent of Drosha or Dicer pre-processing. Once trimmed to the appropriate size, the guide RNAs in complex with the RISC can regulate gene expression through RNAi.</p><p>Our data provide the first evidence of an overexpressed cDNA exerting toxicity via an RNAi-dependent mechanism. It was first shown in plants that overexpressed transgenes can be converted into RNAi active short RNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hamilton and Baulcombe, 1999</xref>). Our data on the effects of overexpressed CD95L RNA, while mechanistically distinct from what was reported in plants, may be the first example of a transgene determining cell fate through the RNAi mechanism in mammalian cells. The CD95L-derived sRNAs will likely act in a miRNA-like fashion by targeting 3'UTRs of survival genes through 6mer seed toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gao et al., 2018</xref>). CAG-repeat-containing mRNAs have been shown to induce sRNA formation and cellular toxicity via RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bañez-Coronel et al., 2012</xref>). However, we recently reported that these sCAGs likely target fully complementary CUG containing repeat regions in the ORFs of genes critical for cell survival in an siRNA-like mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Murmann et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Murmann et al., 2018b</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the activity of exogenously added CD95L mRNA, we also provide evidence that certain endogenous coding mRNAs can be processed into multiple sRNAs that are then loaded into the RISC. Small mRNA-derived RNAs have been reported to be bound to all four Ago proteins before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burroughs et al., 2011</xref>). However, they were very small in numbers and amount and no specific cellular function could be ascribed to them. In contrast, we now show that in cells with disabled miRNA processing, about 3% of the the protein coding genes can be processed in this way and that these genes are strongly enriched in GO terms associated with protein translation (initiation and elongation) as well as with cell cycle regulation and cell proliferation. They contain a large number of 5' TOP genes (i.e. 76% of all ribosomal proteins) required for protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yamashita et al., 2008</xref>). Our findings may be relevant for situations in which cellular miRNA levels are low, such as in somatic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Morin et al., 2008</xref>) or in advanced cancers which are characterized by a global downregulation of miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lu et al., 2005</xref>). It is intriguing to note that the genes that are part of this group fall into GO clusters overlapping with the ones we found downregulated in cells undergoing DISE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Putzbach et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>A major question that arises from our data is whether CD95L mRNA is toxic in vivo. We and others have noticed upregulation of CD95L in multiple stress-related conditions such as after treatment with chemotherapy ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Friesen et al., 1999</xref>) and data not shown). While the amount of CD95L mRNA and the level of upregulation alone may not be enough to be toxic, it could be the combination of multiple RNA fragments, derived from multiple different mRNAs that are generated to kill cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Putzbach et al., 2018</xref>). We view CD95L as just one of many RNAs that have this activity. It is unlikely CD95L is the only gene whose mRNA is toxic to cells, as this mRNA-based level of toxicity would be redundant with the potent killing capacity of the CD95L protein. Also, upregulating an mRNA that, by itself, could decimate the cells that would otherwise need to upregulate that mRNA to carry out their biological function in the first place, such as in activated T cells upregulating CD95L to mount an immune response, would be self-defeating. Therefore, nature likely distributed this mRNA-based toxicity-inducing capacity over many genes in the genome to prevent activating it when any one of those genes is upregulated during specific cellular processes. It is more likely there exists an entire network of these genes that can release toxic sRNAs when the appropriate stimulus is encountered. Consistent with this hypothesis we recently identified other genes that contain sequences that when converted to shRNAs kill cancer cells through 6mer seed toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Patel and Peter, 2018</xref>). Future work will be aimed at studying the coding genes that are found in the RISC, identifying additional genes and the mechanism through which they are processed and under what conditions they kill cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (Homo sapiens)</td><td valign="top">CD95L</td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">NM_000639</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (H. sapiens)</td><td valign="top">CD95</td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">NM_000043</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (H. sapiens)</td><td valign="top">MCF-7</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">ATCC: HTB-22</td><td valign="top">Human adenocarcinoma of the mammary <break/>gland, breast;

The insert and the backbone were digested with NheI (NEB #R0131) and XhoI (NEB #R0146) restriction enzymes. Subsequent ligation with T4 DNA ligase created the pLenti-CD95L vector. The pLenti-CD95L<sup>MUT</sup> vector was created by sub-cloning a CD95L cDNA insert with two nucleotide substitutions in codon 218 (<italic>TAT - &gt; CGT)</italic> resulting in replacement of tyrosine for arginine, which has been described to inhibit binding to CD95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schneider et al., 1997</xref>) into the pLenti-GIII-CMV-RFP-2A-Puro vector. The pLenti-CD95L<sup>MUT</sup>NP vector was created by inserting a CD95L ORF cDNA sequence containing both the Y218R mutation and a single nucleotide substitution at the second codon (<italic>CAG - &gt; TAG</italic>), resulting in a premature stop codon right after the start codon, into the pLenti-GIII-CMV-RFP-2A-Puro vector.

Abundant Ago bound CD95L sRNA sequences were identified from Drosha k.o. Ago pull-down sequencing data. sRNA sequences mapping to <italic>FASLG</italic> were sorted by their 3’ end position. The number of sRNA reads terminating at the same nucleotide position were counted, and the most abundant sequences were selected for qPCR probe design from clusters 8 and 21. These probes were designed using ThermoFisher’s Custom TaqMan Small RNA Assay Design Tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.thermofisher.com/order/custom-">https://www.thermofisher.com/order/custom-genomic-products/tools/small-rna/</ext-link>) to target the cluster eight sequence (5’- AAGGAGCTGGCAGAACTCCGAGA-3’) and the cluster 21 sequence (5’- TCAACGTATCTGAGCTCTCTC-3’). Detection of these fragments involves a two-step amplification protocol used to detect miRNAs. In the first step, the High-Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit is used to selectively reverse transcribe the two clusters to be quantified using specific primers and 100 ng RNA input. The cDNA was diluted 1:5. The qPCR reaction mixture is composed of the diluted cDNA, the custom probes, and the Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems #43240018). Reactions were performed in triplicate. Ct values were determined using the Applied Biosystems 7500 Real Time PCR system with a thermocycle profile of 50°C for two min (step one), 95°C for 10 min (step two), and then 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s (step three) and 60°C for 1 min (step four). The ΔΔCt values between the sRNA of interest and the control were calculated to determine relative abundance of the sRNA.

The pellets were stored at −80°C until they could be used for the Ago pull-down experiment. The purpose of splitting the sample was so that we could compare the total cellular pool of sRNAs to the fraction that was bound to the RISC.

To identify CD95L-derived sRNAs among the sequenced reads, a BLAST database was generated from each set of reads, and blastn was used to query the CD95L ORF (derived from NM_000639.2) against reads from cells infected with pLenti-CD95L and to query the CD95L<sup>MUT</sup>NP ORF sequence against reads from cells infected with CD95L<sup>MUT</sup>NP. The only reads considered further were those matching a CD95L sequence with an e-value of less than 0.05% and 100% identity across the entire length of the read. This resulted in the loss of a few reads less than 19/20 nt in length. The filtered BLAST hits were converted to a bed formatted file, describing the locations of reads relative to the relevant CD95L sequence, and the R package Sushi was used to plot the bed files and generate <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–E</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Assessing toxicity of CD95L-derived sRNAs</title><p>To determine whether guide RNAs derived from the over-expressed CD95L mRNA could evoke toxicity, the small CD95L-derived RNA reads (corresponding to different clusters shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) bound to AGO from the HCT116 Drosha knock-out cells were converted to siRNAs. First, all reads less than 18 nucleotides were filtered out, as these do not efficiently incorporate into the RISC. siRNAs were designed with antisense strands fully complementary to the CD95L-derived sequences that mapped to areas of the CD95L mRNA secondary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) that are predicted to form duplexes. These sequences were designed as 19 nucleotide oligos with a 3’ deoxy AA. The complementary sense strand was designed with a 3’ deoxy TT and 2’-O-methylation at the first two positions to prevent its incorporation into the RISC. These oligos were ordered from IDT and annealed to form the final siRNAs. The sequences of the antisense strands (corresponding to the CD95L mRNA-derived cluster fragments) were as follows: 5’-AUUGGGCCUGGGGAUGUUU-3’ (c7/1), 5’-CCUGGGGAUGUUUCAGCUC-3’ (c7/2), 5’-CCAACUCAAGGUCCAUGCC-3’ (c11), 5’-AAACUGGGCUGUACUUUGU-3’ (c15/1), 5’- AACUGGGCUGUACUUUGUA-3’ (c15/2), 5’- CAACAACCUGCCCCUGAGC-3’ (c16/1), 5’- AACUCUAAGCGUCCCCAGG-3’ (c16/2), 5’- UCAACGUAUCUGAGCUCUC-3’ (c21), and 5’- AAUCUCAGACGUUUUUCGG-3’ (c22).</p><p>These eight siRNAs were reverse transfected into HeyA8, H460, M565, and 3LL cells using RNAiMAX transfection reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific) at 10 nM in triplicate as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Murmann et al., 2018a</xref>).

The corresponding average 6mer seed toxicity (between HeyA8 and H460 cells) was added for each unique sequence.

Identical reads were collapsed and counted and reads &lt;15 bp or &gt;50 bp in length were eliminated, as well as reads containing N's. The number of reads found at least 10 times across each pair of replicate samples were 10,839 for CD95L expressing cells and 10,617 for pLenti infected cells. The results were filtered so that only 100% matches across the entire length of the read were counted, in the direction of transcription. The start position was reported for each uniquely mapping, highly abundant (&gt;=10 copies) read. The number of such unique start positions was counted to obtain a putative number of stacks for each transcript.

These reads were blasted against all of the raw RNA-seq data. Only 100% matches across the entire length of the read were considered, in the direction of transcription, but all reads that matched the transcript at that stringency were plotted, regardless of their individual abundance or uniqueness, with each individual blue line representing an individual read, with its length in the plot proportional to the read length.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Determine the abundance of the coding genes that give rise to Ago-bound reads</title><p>To determine the abundance of coding genes with Ago bound reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), we isolated all genes that had an RPKM of at least 10 using uniquely mapped reads from a conventional long RNA-Seq data set.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jeffrey Settleman as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor.

This new study reports that transfection of CD95L mRNA is also sufficient to kill cells, independently of CD95L protein production, involving the generation of small RNA species that are loaded into a Ago2/RISC complex. Overall, the manuscript is well-written, the data are presented clearly, and experimental approaches are sound. Though the authors have painted the picture of a unique, biologically-relevant phenomenon, key missing data points must be addressed while other details should be clarified in order to provide full support for their conclusions. Moreover, while the findings are provocative and potentially interesting, they are somewhat incremental relative to the previous study. Several additional experiments would need to be completed to make this study relevant to the readers of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should repeat the experiment in Figure 3B with the mutant RNA forms (SIL and NP) to prove Ago2/RISC dependence. I would also suggest the authors perform this experiment in CD95 wt cells, to show that Ago2 KD only rescues viability in the absence of CD95, while in wt the CD95/CD95L interaction remains intact and toxic (the mutant RNAs should perform somewhat similarly in wt and CD95 KOs).</p><p>2) As the authors speculate in the Discussion, it would be important to know which additional mRNA species also show this property when transfected into cells?

They could also interrogate the Ago pulldown data to see if they get incorporated into the Drosha KO RISC. Is there something special about CD95L mRNA processing, or does RISC load up with spurious RNA fragments in Drosha KOs? This is not clear from the analysis as presented.

Is this due to expression of specific sRNAs that were not altered by codon editing (maybe answerable by sRNA sequencing)? Is the ~12% of protein providing this activity (maybe answerable by removing the start codon)? Subjecting this mutant construct to the secondary structure prediction could be informative. The authors should reconcile this counterintuitive result.</p><p>5) The authors identify &gt;20 potential segments within the CD95L mRNA that correspond to sRNAs sequenced after AGO IP. Similar to the experiments shown in Figure 1A, the authors should express (in HeyA8 cells) fragments of the CD95L mRNA (100-200 nts?, overlapping with one-another) in order to identify regions with the most toxic profile. If sensitization is necessary to see a phenotype, this experiment could be performed in the HCT116 wt and Drosha KO models. This is critical to understand if specific sequences (derived from the mRNA, not expressed separately via shRNA) direct the phenotype, and if local or broad RNA structure impacts sRNA biogenesis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38621.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript extends this group's previous observations that a large number of shRNA and siRNA sequences generated against CD95 and CD95L promote cellular toxicity.

While the research advance is meant to be an extension of work already published, our new analysis demonstrates with little doubt that not only the CD95L protein can kill cancer cells (through induction of apoptosis) but that the mRNA itself is toxic through induction of DISE. We are not aware that anybody has ever shown such an activity for any gene. In addition, our discovery that under low miRNA conditions about 3% of the protein coding human genome (mostly genes regulating cell proliferation) is processed in a way similar to CD95L mRNA and loaded into the RISC is highly novel. This finding could have relevance for situations in which miRNA expression is low such as is seen in stem cells or in advanced cancers. We noticed that the reviewers/editor referred to the CD95L-derived RNAs as sRNAs rather than siRNAs. We think that is a good idea and have adopted this terminology in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should repeat the experiment in Figure 3B with the mutant RNA forms (SIL and NP) to prove Ago2/RISC dependence.

Both the NP and the SIL mutant's toxicity requires Ago2 when expressed in CD95 k.o. cells. In wt cells the SIL mutant kills rapidly through apoptosis, and is not attenuated by Ago2 kd. In contrast, the NP mutant also kills wt cells but this is dependent on Ago2. All these experiments have now been added as new Figure 3—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As the authors speculate in the Discussion, it would be important to know which additional mRNA species also show this property when transfected into cells? Why was only CD95L and not CD95 tested here? Simply introducing the stop codon after the first exon would be an easy way to test this hypothesis in a relatively large number of genes.</p></disp-quote><p>This experiment is more complicated than it appears. For instance, we recently reported on a set of genes other than CD95/CD95L that potentially contain toxic sequences (Patel and Peter, 2017). However, just taking these genes (some of which are functionally not well characterized) and adding a stop codon may result in data that are difficult to interpret. Alternative start codons downstream of the main start codon may be used to produce truncated protein and the function and interaction partners of some of these genes or their truncated peptides could be multiple. Hence, results may be difficult to interpret. In contrast, CD95L has been very well characterized by many groups including the group of the corresponding author. In fact, the main reason we discovered this new activity of the mRNA was the established fact that there is no interaction partner in a cell other than CD95 (leaving aside decoy receptor DcR3, a secreted protein that will likely not be relevant in our cells), and the well described apoptosis-inducing activity of CD95L. The combination of the canonical apoptosis induction as a robust control form of protein induced cell death and the ability of eliminating this activity completely from any cell by deleting CD95 presents a unique situation we will not easily find with any other gene.</p><p>We previously showed that the most toxic sequences are located in the ORF of CD95L and the 3'UTR of CD95 (not the ORF of CD95). This is why CD95L was chosen over CD95. Also, si/shRNAs derived from CD95L were consistently more toxic than the ones derived from CD95.</p><p>Finally, we recently determined that the form of siRNA induced toxicity we described is in fact solely dependent on the 6mer seed sequence of the siRNA loaded into the RISC. This work is in press at Nature Communications, and has also been deposited at BioRxive (Gao et al., 2018). Based on this recent analysis we have called this activity 6mer seed toxicity. Once this phenomenon was discovered we could determine the rules of the toxicity by testing all 4096 possible 6mer seeds in a neutral backbone (after disabling passenger strand loading). We found that there is a good correlation between the toxicity of the shRNAs derived from the ORF of CD95L and the new 6mer seed toxicity (see Figure 1D in (Gao et al., 2018)). We therefore feel that the focus on CD95L in this research advance is well justified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Similar to the above point, the authors could interrogate their existing data on the presence of additional small RNAs in the total RNA fraction used in Figure 4C to ask how many additional endogenous genes end up being processed. They could also interrogate the Ago pulldown data to see if they get incorporated into the Drosha KO RISC. Is there something special about CD95L mRNA processing, or does RISC load up with spurious RNA fragments in Drosha KOs? This is not clear from the analysis as presented. They already document the presence of VTRNA2-1, VTRA1-2 and TFCP2L1 sequences in the RISC – is there any reason to think these sequences might be toxic, or have additional cellular consequences?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion made by the reviewer. Overexpression of CD95L mRNA caused loading of the RISC with small miRNA-sized RNAs derived from at least 22 regions in the CD95L ORF. This was most pronounced in Drosha k.o. cells devoid of most miRNAs. To determine whether this phenomenon could also be observed with endogenous coding mRNAs, we have now reanalyzed our small RNA Seq data of both total RNA and AGO bound RNA in HCT116 Drosha k.o. cells (infected with either empty vector or pLentiCD95L) as suggested by the reviewers. We identified all coding mRNAs that could give rise to sRNAs that were present in the AGO2 bound fraction with at least 10 reads. We only considered reads that uniquely aligned with their gene. While we found that the majority of protein coding mRNAs are not processed and loaded in the RISC in that fashion, about 3% of the coding genes in the genome are. Further analysis revealed that first, it is not only the expression level that determines whether a mRNA is processed (new Figure 5C). A number of very highly expressed mRNAs were not processed at all. Second, it demonstrated that CD95L was not just processed because it was a highly expressed exogenous gene. In fact, in the list of the most abundant RISC bound coding gene derived small RNAs, CD95L was number 14 from the top (see Figure 5D). Compared to the exogenously expressed CD95L the endogenously expressed mRNAs were processed in the same way. They were processed before being bound to the RISC but were further trimmed when bound to the RISC (new Figure 5A and Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). We are showing the top 10 genes with the highest read number bound to AGO proteins and the most read sites in their mRNAs represented in new Figure 5B and Figure 5—figure supplement 1B. Given the fact that not all mRNAs were processed in this way, we then asked whether the ones that were had specific cellular functions and the result was striking. We found a very strong enrichment for genes involved in cell proliferation (including cyclin D1 and MYC), and particularly for genes involved in protein translation. The majority of all mRNAs coding for ribosomal proteins (76%) were represented. While it is not clear how the sRNAs derived from these genes regulate cell function, the selective enrichment for genes of similar ontology to be RISC bound points at a biological function. We also find it intriguing that the gene ontology annotations that genes fall into are quite similar to the ones we found downregulated in cells undergoing DISE (Gao et al., 2018; Putzbach et al., 2018).</p><p>To obtain a preliminary sense of what sRNAs might be doing in the RISC we compared Drosha k.o. cells lacking most miRNAs with wt cells. We noticed that Drosha k.o. cells grow less well than wt cells (new Figure 5E). To test whether RISC bound sRNAs could negatively affect cell growth, we calculated the average seed toxicity of all sRNAs bound to Ago proteins and compared them to the average seed toxicity of the sRNAs bound to the RISC in wt cells (new Figure 5F). It was substantially different providing a possible explanation for the reduced growth rate of the k.o. cells. To directly test this we knocked down AGO2 (or AGO1-4, data not shown) to disable the RISC. This resulted in the cells growing as fast as the wt cells, suggesting that it is indeed RISC mediated RNAi that negatively affects cell growth. This experiment provides evidence of endogenous sRNAs being loaded into the RISC to negatively affect cell growth through the 6mer seed toxicity mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 1—figure supplement 2, I was surprised to see that the &quot;SIL&quot; mutant was as active as the wt CD95L mRNAs, despite expressing &gt;85% less protein and having ~37% (somewhat evenly distributed) nucleotide divergence.

The authors should reconcile this counterintuitive result.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewers suggestion we have performed a secondary structure prediction of the SIL mutant. It was however, not very informative as most mRNAs when folded have stem loop structures (data not shown). However, now that we know that small RISC-bound RNAs derived from coding genes can kill cancer cells through 6mer seed toxicity, we compared the WT and the SIL mutant by plotting the 6mer seed toxicity along their sequences to compare their ability to give rise to toxic sRNAs. While there are many sequence differences in the RNA, the predicted 6mer seed toxicity in a number of areas are similar in both constructs (data not shown) and when displaying the toxicity of all sRNAs in a density plot (new Figure 1—figure supplement 3D) the difference between the two constructs did not reach statistical significance confirming that the SIL mutant could still give rise to multiple toxic sRNAs. Finally, in new Figure 3—figure supplement 1A (right panel) we demonstrate that similar to WT CD95L the SIL mutant mRNA's toxicity is dependent on AGO2, suggesting that the toxicity is exerted through RNAi.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors identify &gt;20 potential segments within the CD95L mRNA that correspond to sRNAs sequenced after AGO IP. Similar to the experiments shown in Figure 1A, the authors should express (in HeyA8 cells) fragments of the CD95L mRNA (100-200 nts?, overlapping with one-another) in order to identify regions with the most toxic profile. If sensitization is necessary to see a phenotype, this experiment could be performed in the HCT116 wt and Drosha KO models. This is critical to understand if specific sequences (derived from the mRNA, not expressed separately via shRNA) direct the phenotype, and if local or broad RNA structure impacts sRNA biogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>Before testing smaller regions derived from CD95L we generated and tested two CD95L fragments, a 5' and a 3' fragment to test whether folding of full length CD95L was required to produce toxic sRNAs. When expressed in HeyA8 CD95 k.o. cells the 5' fragment, which did not produce any detectable protein, was somewhat toxic but much less than full length CD95L (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A-C). The 3' fragment did not show toxicity.</p><p>In addition, we expressed the two fragments in HCT116 cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 2D and 2E).</p><p>When compared to the NP mutant neither of the two fragments caused any toxicity in wt HCT116 cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 2E, left panel). Both CD95L fragments, however, showed moderate toxicity in the hypersensitive Drosha k.o. cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 2E, right panel). In these cells, the full length NP mutant was quite toxic. We feel that the analysis of the exact folding rules of CD95L and its fragments is beyond the scope of this manuscript. However, these data suggest that while the local folding environment is important, folding of the entire wt mRNA seems to favor generation of toxic sRNAs.</p></body></sub-article></article>
