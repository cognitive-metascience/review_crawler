lysosomes into the cytoplasm requires NPC1 protein; NPC1L1 mediates uptake of dietary cholesterol. We introduced single disulfide bonds into NPC1 and NPC1L1 to explore the importance of inter-domain dynamics in cholesterol transport. Using a sensitive method to monitor lysosomal cholesterol efflux, we found that NPC1’s N-terminal domain need not release from the rest of the protein for efficient cholesterol export. Either introducing single disulfide bonds to constrain lumenal/extracellular domains or shortening a cytoplasmic loop abolishes transport activity by both NPC1 and NPC1L1. The widely prescribed cholesterol uptake inhibitor, ezetimibe, blocks NPC1L1; we show that residues that lie at the interface between NPC1L1's three extracellular domains comprise the drug’s binding site. These data support a model in which cholesterol passes through the cores of NPC1/NPC1L1 proteins; concerted movement of various domains is needed for transfer and ezetimibe blocks transport by binding to multiple domains simultaneously.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ldl cholesterol</kwd><kwd>lysosome</kwd><kwd>niemann pick c disease</kwd><kwd>ezetimibe</kwd><kwd>cholesterol transport</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001790</institution-id><institution>Ara Parseghian Medical Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pfeffer</surname><given-names>Suzanne R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01HL134991-04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pfeffer</surname><given-names>Suzanne R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chan Zuckerberg BioHub</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elias</surname><given-names>Joshua E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Molecular analysis of cholesterol transport by NPC1 and NPC1L1 proteins reveals that cholesterol likely moves through these transporters, and ezetimibe blocks NPC1L1 by binding at the interface between multiple domains.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>NPC1 and NPC1L1 are structurally related, multi-spanning membrane proteins that are important for cholesterol transport in humans. NPC1L1 mediates the uptake of dietary cholesterol at the surface of the intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weinglass et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jia et al., 2011</xref>); the drug, ezetimibe (Zetia) blocks NPC1L1 and is an alternative to statins for patients with elevated plasma cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rosenblum et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">van Heek et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Davis et al., 2001</xref>). The related NPC1 protein functions in lysosomes to transport LDL-derived cholesterol to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pfeffer, 2019</xref>). Plasma LDL is delivered to the lysosome by endocytosis, and its cholesterol esters are cleaved by acid lipase to release free cholesterol for cellular use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown and Goldstein, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goldstein et al., 1975</xref>). NPC2 protein binds this released cholesterol via its iso-octyl group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2007</xref>) and transfers it to the N-terminal domain of NPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kwon et al., 2009</xref>). Mutations in either NPC2 or NPC1 protein can give rise to a severe neurodegenerative disorder called Niemann Pick Type C disease, which leads to massive accumulation of cholesterol in lysosomes of all tissues, and premature death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pentchev, 2004</xref>).</p><p>The availability of the structures of NPC2 (with and without cholesterol; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Friedland et al., 2003</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2007</xref>), NPC1 N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kwon et al., 2009</xref>), lumenal domains 2 and 3 (hereafter referred to as middle lumenal domain/MLD and C-terminal domain/CTD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2017b</xref>) and the full length NPC1 by cryoelectron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Long et al., 2020</xref>) has catapulted our understanding of these proteins to a new level. Moreover, the co-crystal structure of NPC2 bound to NPC1’s second lumenal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2016b</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Winkler et al., 2019</xref>) provides a valuable starting point for thinking about how cholesterol is likely to be transferred onto NPC1 protein. Despite these important breakthroughs, we still have much to learn about how NPC1 transfers cholesterol across the lysosome membrane after receiving it from NPC2.</p><p>It has been proposed that the NPC1 N-terminal domain uses the flexibility of a poly-proline linker to transfer cholesterol to a cavity detected on the other side of the protein, at the so-called sterol-sensing domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kwon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2017b</xref>). This cavity lies at the boundary between the inner leaflet of the lysosome membrane and the lumen, an advantageous position as the cavity would be available to both receive cholesterol from NPC1’s N-terminal domain and to transfer it to the adjacent membrane. Consistent with this model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Trinh et al. (2018)</xref> recently found that NPC1’s N-terminal domain appears to be able to transfer cholesterol (albeit inefficiently) to an adjacent NPC1 molecule for membrane transfer.</p><p>NPC1 domains that receive cholesterol from NPC2 are located ~80 Å from the membrane bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gong et al., 2016</xref>). This height corresponds well with the dimensions of the glycocalyx that is thought to line the limiting membrane of the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wilke et al., 2012</xref>). Given the existence of the glycocalyx, it is hard to imagine how NPC1’s N-terminal domain could gain access to the lipid bilayer to deliver cholesterol to the membrane. In considering the established mechanisms of transporters for amino acids, sugars, and hydrophobic small molecules, we noted that these extremely diverse proteins undergo significant conformational changes to enable an open extracellular pocket to bind ligand and then close, thereby opening a release site on the opposite side of the protein (and membrane). This type of ‘rocker arm’ model would require movement of protein domains in relation to one another, for transport functionality. We therefore set out to test whether NPC1 functions by conformational transformations rather than via a sterol hand-off pathway restricted to the N-terminal domain. We present here data consistent with a model in which cholesterol passes directly through NPC1 and NPC1L1 proteins and can be blocked by plugging the channel at the top with a small molecule inhibitor such as ezetimibe for NPC1L1 (this study) or itraconazole for NPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Long et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows the overall domain structure of NPC1 protein, which comprises a cholesterol binding N-terminal domain (red), a second lumenal domain that binds to NPC2 (‘MLD’, blue; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deffieu and Pfeffer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2016b</xref>) and a third lumenal domain (‘CTD’, yellow). The (red) N-terminal domain is attached to the rest of the protein by a potentially flexible polyproline linker sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> at left). Note that the putative sterol-binding site in the sterol-sensing domain (SSD, orange) is located within the membrane bilayer on the side of the protein opposite to the linker domain, adjacent to P691, a residue that is important for NPC1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Watari et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ko et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ohgami et al., 2004</xref>). To test whether locking the flexible linker in place would inhibit NPC1 function, we relied on the highest resolution (3.3 Å) NPC1 structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2017b</xref>) to introduce cysteines that could pair between the top of the polyproline linker and the NPC1 CTD. To design these experiments, we aligned the cryo-EM structure of full-length NPC1 (4.4 Å, PDBID: 3jd8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gong et al., 2016</xref>) with the high resolution (3.3 Å) crystal structure of N-terminal domain-deleted NPC1 (PDBID: 5u74 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

The protein is tagged with a fluorescent dye and can be detected by quantitative flow cytometry or light microscopy to monitor lysosomal cholesterol. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, NPC1<sup>-/-</sup> cells lacking transfected NPC1 showed strong PFO* staining; transient expression of wild type NPC1 protein (green) rescued the phenotype and could be easily quantified as a decrease in PFO* signal.</p><p>To compare the activities of wild type and mutant proteins more sensitively, we attempted to compare the initial rates of cholesterol clearance by functional or non-functional NPC1 upon expression in NPC1 knockout cells. For this purpose, we synchronized the cholesterol release process in cells expressing rescue constructs by addition of the NPC1-specific inhibitor, U18666A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2015</xref>) and then monitored the cholesterol export upon removal of the inhibitor. Protein constructs were expressed for ~30 h, followed by overnight treatment of cells with U18666A; we then washed out U18666A and monitored the subsequent relative function of rescue constructs after 1 h, as this short time scale allows for better functional discrimination than is possible when comparing cholesterol accumulation by constructs expressed for 18–24 h. U18666A drug efflux was accelerated by treating cells for 5 min in 10 mM methylamine hydrochloride to raise the pH of endo-lysosomes. The pH was then quickly restored by methylamine washout, and NPC1 function was monitored after 1 subsequent hour in lipoprotein-deficient medium. Control experiments showed that wild type NPC1 required at least 30 min to begin to decrease lysosomal cholesterol by this method.</p><p>Using this assay, we found that NPC1 P251C/L929C was as functional as wild type NPC1 in terms of its ability to clear cholesterol from lysosomes, monitored by quantitative flow cytometry or immunofluorescence light microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Note that the flow cytometry data have been gated such that only cells with comparable levels of expression of wild type or mutant GFP-tagged proteins are compared.</p><p>Critical to the interpretation of these data was a demonstration that a disulfide bridge had formed between residues C251 and C929. We noted that NPC1 P251C/L929C was more efficiently glycosylated in the secretory pathway than either the wild type protein or a single cysteine mutant, consistent with formation of this disulfide bond within the secretory pathway of expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Mature and fully glycosylated NPC1 protein migrates at ~200K upon SDS-PAGE; with endo H treatment to remove high mannose oligosaccharides, a slight mobility decrease is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Less well-folded NPC1 proteins are fully endo H sensitive and yield a band at ~120K upon endo H or protein N-glycanase treatment that may be O-glycosylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schultz et al., 2018</xref>). In our cells, under-glycosylated NPC1 wild type protein was detected, but much less of this form was seen for the P251C/L929C protein. That we detect differences in the steady state glycoforms of NPC1 proteins indicates that they are structurally distinct in cells, consistent with the presence of the additional disulfide bond.</p><p>To demonstrate unequivocally the presence of a disulfide bond between NPC1 residues C251 and C929, we used mass spectrometry to detect the disulfide bond in proteolytic digests of the GFP-tagged protein, isolated after expression in cultured cells. Unfortunately, it was difficult to identify the native peptides because of their lengths and polyproline content. To circumvent this challenge, we introduced two lysine residues adjacent to the polyproline stretch in NPC1 P251C/L929C to enhance trypsin cleavage and facilitate disulfide bond detection. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> shows the cholesterol rescue activity of NPC1 P251C/L929C/P249K/P259K. Importantly, this NPC1 mutant was correctly localized to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and showed full wild type rescue capacity by quantitative perfringolysin O* labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>Proteolysis of NPC1 P251C/L929C/P249K/P259K would be predicted to yield disulfide-bonded peptides, with C251 in CQPPPPPMK linked to C929 in NAAECDTY. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows the LC-MS elution profiles of both reduced (upper panel) and chemically oxidized (lower panel) forms of synthetic peptides corresponding to these NPC1 peptides (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Guided by these peptide standards, we detected the corresponding disulfide species in NPC1 P251C/L929C/P249K/P259K samples expressed in cultured cells followed by protein purification and protease digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> lower panel, C). The disulfide peak was lost upon reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> upper panel), yielding the corresponding thiol peptides. From this analysis we estimate that ~85% of C251 in the NPC1 N-terminal domain is disulfide bonded to C929 in NPC1's C-terminal domain.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Engineered cysteines C251 and C929 form a disulfide bond in NPC1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Extracted ion chromatograms from LC-MS analysis of synthetic peptides corresponding to engineered cysteines in NPC1.

Given the apparent importance of inter-domain interfaces in cholesterol transport by NPC1, we tested the possibility that inter-domain interface residues create a binding site for ezetimibe on NPC1L1.

Specifically, mutants that can lock the MLD to the CTD at the interface of these domains interfere with cholesterol transport; residues that comprise a loop at the cytoplasmic face of the transmembrane domains are needed to provide inter-domain mobility and/or an unconstrained conformation, and can be replaced with polyalanine for full function. Moreover, we have shown that ezetimibe inhibition of NPC1L1 relies on its interaction with multiple domains and depends on sequences that are predicted to contribute to domain interface interactions in the protein structure. A highly plausible model for ezetimibe inhibition would be that it functions in a manner analogous to the disulfide bond mutants: locking the domains to one another and thereby blocking cholesterol transport. By binding at the interface, ezetimibe could also plug a channel between these domains. We showed for the first time that purified NPC1L1 MLD binds bile salt micelles. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that ezetimibe blocks bile salt interaction in full-length NPC1L1, the mutagenesis experiments support the importance of interface residues for drug binding, which will have the additional consequence of blocking inter-domain dynamics.</p><p>It is currently accepted that NPC2 transfers bound cholesterol to the NPC1 N-terminal domain; however, the subsequent steps by which cholesterol transporters move cholesterol across the membrane remain unclear. Determination of the structure of NPC1 revealed that the N-terminal domain cholesterol binding site is located on the opposite side of the protein to the sterol-sensing domain; this finding led to the proposal that the N-terminal domain may transfer its cholesterol to an adjacent NPC1 molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2016a</xref>). The experiments presented here do not address this possibility directly, but they demonstrate that cholesterol transport does not require full release of the N-terminal domain from the rest of the protein. Locking the polyproline linker that attaches the N-terminal domain to the rest of NPC1 protein had no impact on the ability of NPC1 to export cholesterol from lysosomes using kinetically sensitive and quantitative assays for this process. These results suggest that the N-terminal domain need not hinge away from the rest of the protein to transfer cholesterol from the N-terminal domain to other parts of the protein and/or across the membrane. Note that the portion of the linker most proximal to the NTD will nevertheless retain some flexibility, despite the presence of the additional disulfide bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our data support a model in which cholesterol can pass directly through NPC1, either to the sterol-sensing domain or all the way through the membrane bilayer. This model is further supported by recent computations and structural experiments predicting a cholesterol transfer path through the center of NPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Elghobashi-Meinhardt, 2019</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wheeler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Winkler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Long et al., 2020</xref>). Because of the importance of cytoplasmically oriented residues for NPC1 function, we favor a model in which the sterol-sensing domain binding site represents a regulatory site and is not necessarily involved in the transport process per se.</p><p>Precedent for cholesterol passing through a related transporter comes from the structural work of Nieng Yan and Xiaochun Li and their colleagues who have recently reported structures of the related Patched (PTCH) protein, which is important for Hedgehog signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Qi et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qi et al., 2018b</xref>). PTCH has 12 transmembrane domains instead of 13; it also lacks the cholesterol binding N-terminal domain of NPC1 and NPC1L1. Transmembrane domains 2–6 comprise a sterol-sensing domain analogous to transmembrane domains 3–7 of NPC1. Yan and colleagues detected two sterol molecules in the PTCH structure: one in a cavity located between the two extracellular domains and the second, adjacent to the sterol-sensing domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gong et al., 2018</xref>). Their mutant analysis suggests that cholesterol binding causes significant conformational changes, with an untwisting of the interactions between the extracellular domains and reorientation of certain TMs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qi et al. (2018b)</xref> found two sterol-like ligand densities in the transmembrane domain of each PTCH molecule, one in the sterol-sensing domain and the other near transmembrane domain 12. Importantly, the structural analysis is consistent with a tunnel in the PTCH protein, through which a sterol could pass.</p><p>Does NPC1 also bind cholesterol in a cavity between its extracellular domains, analogous to PTCH? Does NPC1 contain a similar channel through which cholesterol might pass? Important hints came initially from Cravatt and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hulce et al., 2013</xref>), whose proteome-wide analysis of cholesterol binding proteins revealed novel cholesterol binding locations in NPC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Our mutant protein functional analysis is consistent with the possibility that NPC1 and NPC1L1 undergo significant conformational transitions to accomplish transport of cholesterol across the membrane.</p><p>While this study was under review, Xiaochun Li's team reported the cryo-EM structure of NPC1 with an added inhibitor, itraconazole, occupying a central cleft at the top of NPC1's MLD and CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Long et al., 2020</xref>). This finding meshes well with our proposal for how ezetimibe blocks cholesterol transport by NPC1L1 at a similar location in the corresponding structure. Whether cholesterol exits this channel at the sterol-sensing domain (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Winkler et al., 2019</xref>) or proceeds through the molecule to the other side of the bilayer is not yet clear, but our finding that constriction of the proteins' cytoplasmic domains blocks function suggests that the channel may indeed pass all the way through the transmembrane domain. Structural analysis of such mutant proteins may help to resolve this question.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene <italic>Mus musculus</italic></td><td>NPC1</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27551080">27551080</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>NPC1L1</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27075173">27075173</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>LAMP1</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27664420">27664420</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HeLa NPC1 KO</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26578804">26578804</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK293T</td><td>ATCC</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>293F</td><td>ATCC</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic>)</td><td>SF9</td><td>ATCC</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct <italic>Mus musculus</italic></td><td>NPC1-eGFP</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27551080">27551080</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>NPC1L1-eGFP</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27075173">27075173</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>LAMP1-eGFP</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27664420">27664420</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>pFastBac-NPC1L1-wt-N-terminal domain</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27075173">27075173</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>pCMV-FLAG-His6-NPC1L1-MLD</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27075173">27075173</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Chicken polyclonal anti-GFP</td><td>Life technologies</td><td/><td>1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>IRDye 680RD polyclonal Donkey anti-chicken</td><td>LI-COR</td><td valign="bottom">926–68075</td><td>1:10000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>IRDye 800CW streptavidin</td><td>LI-COR</td><td valign="bottom">926–32230</td><td>1:10000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal anti-GFP</td><td>NeuroMab</td><td>N86-38</td><td>1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rabbit polyclonal anti-LAMP1</td><td>Novus</td><td valign="bottom">NB120-19294</td><td>1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Alexa Fluor 488 polyclonal Goat anti-mouse</td><td>Life Technologies</td><td valign="bottom">A-11001</td><td>1:2000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Alexa Fluor 568 polyclonal Goat anti-rabbit</td><td>Life Technologies</td><td>A-11011</td><td>1:2000</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>293 fectin</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td valign="bottom"/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>polyethyleneimine</td><td>SIGMA-Aldrich</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>Lipofectamine 3000</td><td>Life Technologies</td><td valign="bottom">Cat #A10262</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Ezetimibe</td><td>Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td valign="bottom">sc-205690</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Flowjo</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.flowjo.com/">https://www.flowjo.com/</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>FIJI</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22743772">22743772</ext-link>, doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2019">10.1038/nmeth.2019</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>Cholesterol, U18666a, sodium taurocholate, mono-olein, oleic acid, phosphatidyl-choline (2-oleoyl-1-palmityl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO);

A targeted mass list including disulfides and carbamidomethylated cysteine peptides was used and dynamic exclusion was disabled. Precursor ions with charge state 2–7 (for NPC1 P251C/L929C/P249K/P259K) or 1–7 (for NPC1 A521C/K1013C) and intensity threshold above 50,000 were selected for fragmentation using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with quadrupole isolation, using an isolation window of 1.2 m/z and normalized collision energy of 30%. HCD fragments were analyzed in the Orbitrap mass analyzer with a resolution of 15,000 (FWHM). In the same run precursor ions with charge state 3–11 and intensity threshold above 50,000 were selected for fragmentation using electron transfer dissociation with 20% of supplemental collision energy (EThcD). Calibrated charge-dependent parameters were enabled. The AGC targets for full Fourier transform mass analyzers (FTMS) scans and FTMS2 scans were set to standard, and the maximum injection time for full FTMS scans was set to auto and for FTMS2 scans was set to dynamic. Extracted ion chromatograms were integrated using the Byos disulfide workflow (Protein Metrics) with a precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm and a fragment mass tolerance of 0.02 Da, with proteolysis at lysine, arginine, tryptophan, tyrosine, or phenylalanine, allowing up to two missed cleavages. For NPC1 A521C/K1013C, proteolysis after leucine was also allowed. The following modifications were permitted: carbamidomethylation or disulfide formation at cysteine, oxidation at methionine and tryptophan, and deamidation at asparagine.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>LC-MS quantification of NPC1 disulfide bonds</title><p>NPC1 samples were prepared as before but split into four aliquots after Nanotrap capture: the experimental tube, a heavy/heavy control, a light/light control, and a reduced control. All samples were incubated at room temperature in 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 3M urea. The reduced control was treated with 1 mM Tris 2-carboxyethyl phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) during this period. The samples were labeled with 20 mM iodoacetamide—either iodoacetamide-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>, 2-D<sub>2</sub> (98 atom % D, 99 atom % <sup>13</sup>C, Sigma-Aldrich) (heavy) or iodoacetamide with no isotope labels (light). Samples were alkylated for 2 h at room temperature in the dark on a thermomixer and washed to remove iodoacetamide. Next, all samples were treated with 1 mM TCEP reduction buffer for 30 min at room temperature in a thermomixer. Samples were then labeled again with either light or heavy iodoacetamide for 2 h at room temperature in the dark on a thermomixer. Samples were then deglycosylated, proteolyzed, and desalted as before, followed by vacuum centrifugation and resuspension in 0.1% formic acid.</p><p>NPC1 disulfide quantification samples were analyzed by online capillary nanoLC-MS/MS. Samples were separated on an in-house made 20 cm reversed phase column (100 µm inner diameter, packed with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 3.0 µm resin (Dr. Maisch GmbH)) equipped with a laser-pulled nanoelectrospray emitter tip. Peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 400 nl/min using a two-step linear gradient including 2–25% buffer B in 23 min and 25–40% B in 12 min (buffer A: 0.2% formic acid and 5% DMSO in water; buffer B: 0.2% formic acid and 5% DMSO in acetonitrile) in a Dionex Ultimate 3000 LC-system (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were then analyzed using a LTQ Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent mode using an inclusion list targeting disulfide and carbamidomethylated cysteine peptides with a 10 ppm tolerance. Full MS scans were acquired in the Orbitrap mass analyzer with a resolution of 60,000 and m/z scan range of 340–1600. The top 20 most abundant ions with intensity threshold above 500 counts and charge states 2 and above were selected for fragmentation using collision-induced dissociation (CID) with isolation window of 2 m/z, normalized collision energy of 35%, activation Q of 0.25, and activation time of 5 ms. The CID fragments were analyzed in the ion trap with rapid scan rate. Dynamic exclusion was enabled with repeat count of 2 in 30 s and exclusion duration of 20 s. The AGC target was set to 1,000,000 and 5000 for full FTMS scans and ITMSn (multi-stage ion trap MS) scans, respectively. The maximum injection time was set to 250 ms and 100 ms for full FTMS scans and ITMSn scans, respectively.</p><p>Extracted ion chromatograms were integrated for each isotopic peak corresponding to the carbamidomethylated peptides CQPPPPPMK and NAAECDTY that form the engineered P251C-K929C disulfide. For each peptide, the isotope distribution of the heavy/light sample was manually fit to a linear combination of the control distributions for the heavy/heavy and light/light samples weighted by intensity, resulting in a measurement of the fraction of the sample protected from heavy carbamidomethylation by the disulfide bond.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Protein purification</title><p>pFastBac NPC1L1-WT-N-terminal domain was used to make virus for infection of Sf9 insect cells.

The protein atomic coordinates were constructed from two sets of data. Residues 23–288 were taken from the lower resolution (4.43 Å) cryo-EM PDB structure 3jd8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gong et al., 2016</xref>) and residues 334–1255 were taken from PDB structure 5u74 (3.33 Å; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2017b</xref>). The two structures were overlapped using Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) and the new protein coordinates were saved. Missing internal residues (289-333, 642-649, 800-813) were reconstructed using a combination of CHARMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brooks et al., 1983</xref>) and the CHARMM-GUI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jo et al., 2008</xref>). Hydrogen atoms were added using H-build from CHARMM and the N- and C-termini were capped with neutral groups CH3--CO-- and methyl acetate --NH--CO--OCH3, respectively.

and NPC1L1, move cholesterol across the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane and the lysosome, respectively. Using a combination of clever biochemistry and cell biology approaches, the authors demonstrate how concerted movements of various domains of NPC1 and NPC1L1 allow for the movement of cholesterol through the cores of the two proteins.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Inter-domain dynamics drive cholesterol transport by NPC1 and NPC1L1 proteins&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Your study examines the important problem of how NPC1 and NPC1L1 proteins move cholesterol across membranes. Using knowledge gleaned from prior structural and biochemical studies of NPC1 and NPC1L1, you have carried out interesting protein engineering studies to show how movements of domains of either protein facilitate movement of insoluble cholesterol through the protein. While the reviewers all agreed that the study was interesting, they raised several concerns, addressing which would take more than the two month revision window. The reviewers welcome assessment of a revised submission, but only if it addressed all the points raised in the full reviews listed below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Saha et al. reports that multiple domain dynamics drive cholesterol transport by NPC1 and NPC1L1. The authors introduced disulfide bonds into NPC1 to block inter-domain dynamics, then performed PFO* staining to detect cholesterol accumulation in lysosomes after transfecting the mutant plasmids into NPC1-KO HeLa cells. Also, the authors performed molecular dynamics simulations to further support the model that cholesterol can pass directly through NPC1. In addition, the authors showed that the NTD and MLD of NPC1L1 can bind cholesterol in different environments. It appears very interesting and provides potential insights into NPC1L1-mediated dietary cholesterol uptake. However, the interpretation and analysis of the experiments presented here is questionable and additional experiments are required to support the conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The membrane fractionation glycoform analysis appears too weak to demonstrate that a disulfide bridge had formed between P251C and L929C. The amount of under-glycosylated NPC1 that is shown after endo H treatment does not mean that C251 and C929 have formed a disulfide bridge. It is possible that L929C affects the conformation of the domain 3 alone, which includes the most glycosylation sites of NPC1. The authors should use proteolysis and mass spec to verify the disulfide bridge.</p><p>2) The construct A521C/ K1013C also requires proteolysis and mass spec to identify formation of the disulfide bridge.</p><p>3) In Figure 1E, the PFO* fluorescence curve between NPC1<sup>-/-</sup> and wild type is significantly separate; while in Figure 3D, the difference is not as evident. It seems that the PFO* fluorescence assay is not stable or repeatable for this analysis. Can the author use more quantitative methods or modify their assay to make it clearer?</p><p>4) There is no data to show protein expression levels. It is possible that the mutants cannot transport cholesterol well due to the reduced protein expression rather than the domain locking.</p><p>5) The authors claimed that domain 2 of NPC1L1 can function to bind bile salt micelles; in contrast, the NTD of NPC1L1 does not. It is quite an interesting and novel observation. However, to further support this point, additional control assays are required. The authors may consider using some other 3H-steroid or 3H-25-hydroxycholesterol in NP40 and in bile salt micelles to repeat the binding assay. If domain 2 can still bind to those unrelated molecules, domain 2 may only recognize bile salt micelles; if not, cholesterol may also contribute to bind domain 2.<italic>Reviewer #2:</italic>This paper examines the mechanism by which the NPC1 protein moves cholesterol from a region outside the glycocalyx toward or into the limiting membrane. The paper takes advantage of prior structural studies and studies of cholesterol binding sites in NPC1. The authors interpret their data as being consistent with a model in which movements of domains of the protein facilitate cholesterol movement though the protein. They also suggest that a similar mechanism may operate for NPC1L1, a protein on intestinal cells that imports dietary cholesterol.</p><p>While the experiments are in general well described and provide interesting data, this reviewer is not convinced that the main conclusions of the paper are justified by the data.</p><p>1) The NPC1 protein with deletion Δ807-811 is ineffective at removing cholesterol from lysosomes. This is interpreted as requiring flexibility in the loop between TM7 and TM8. However, a change in the loop length could stably alter the interaction between these transmembrane domains either by changing the angle between them or by changing the penetration of one or both into the bilayer.</p><p>2) Similarly, crosslinking domains 2 and 3 might simply lock the protein into a conformation that does not allow cholesterol binding or movement. This does not show that there is a hand-off or similar concerted motion as occurs with transporters as described in the Introduction. It may just be that protein motion is required to expose cholesterol binding sites.</p><p>3) For NPC1L1 it is claimed that experiments with shortening the loop shows the importance of interdomain flexibility. The issues noted in comment 1 apply here also. Additionally, the distance correlation coefficients were not greatly altered in the NOC1 simulation with the deletion, and the RMSD vales were actually increased in the deletion mutant.</p><p>4) The experiments with domains of NPC1L1 are not conclusive. First, it may be that binding of cholesterol from bile salt micelles to Domain 2 may be very different in the presence or absence of the NTD and Domain 3.</p><p>5) The experiment on the effect of deleting the NTD on Ezetimibe binding does indicate that more than Domain2 is required for binding this inhibitor.</p><p>Overall, this paper has several interesting observations, but this reviewer does not feel that they justify the conclusions drawn about how NPC1 moves cholesterol.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic>This is a very interesting paper which uses a number of different approaches, including several clever biochemical experiments, to provide novel insights into the mechanisms of action of two key proteins involved in cellular cholesterol transport, NPC1 and NPC1L1. Introduction of several disulfide bonds to restrict domain movements was used to show that the N-terminal domain of NPC1 does not, as had been proposed previously, undergo a large conformational movement to transfer its bound cholesterol to the sterol sensing domain on either itself or on an adjacent NPC1 protein; rather, the results indicate that conformational changes in domains 2 and 3 must occur to allow normal cholesterol efflux to occur. A further key finding is that a short flexible loop on the cytoplasmic side of the protein is also required for sterol transport; these two observations imply that cholesterol is actually transiting through a presumably transient pore in the NPC1 structure. For NPC1L1 several similar experiments (namely introducing disulfides to constrain domains 2 and 3, and mutagenesis of the cytoplasmic loop) indicate that its inhibitor Ezetimibe binds to several domains and may thus act as a 'stopper' to prevent cholesterol from entering/generating a transmembrane pore.</p><p>This paper will undoubtedly be of high interest to researchers involved in studying cellular cholesterol homeostasis. There are nevertheless a number of comments that could be addressed to provide further support for some of the interpretations made and to clarify certain aspects of the presentation.</p><p>1) The kinetic assay for cholesterol trafficking which uses the recovery from U18666A-mediated cholesterol accumulation in NPC1 null cells transfected with WT and various mutants is said to be on a 'short' time scale; from the results included this seems to be about an hour. Recovery (disappearance of cholesterol staining) is used to conclude that a particular construct works or doesn't work. The results would be strengthened by (a) including a true time course and perhaps establishing rates of cholesterol mobilization, rather than a single time point for evaluation – this may allow additional insight into the various mutant proteins, e.g. showing which aspect of NPC1 or NPC1L1 motion might be of primary importance; and (b) demonstrating what happens over much longer time courses – is the NTD-polylinker-domain 3 mutant truly not at all different than the WT protein, or is there some possibility that the NTD conformation may be involved in the transport process? Overall, a snapshot at a single point in time is not really robust enough to draw 'kinetic' conclusions, as presented.</p><p>2) A very important aspect for interpretation of the data for the disulfide mutants is demonstration that these bridges had actually formed, as the authors acknowledge (otherwise the fact that they function like WT protein may simply be because they haven't formed the disulfide). The use of changes in glycosylation patterns is indirect but supportive evidence. Short of actually expressing and purifying the proteins, which would be ideal but quite challenging, the authors may wish to refer to their DiCC results presented in subsection “Molecular Dynamics Simulations of NPC1 and mutant proteins”, where they show that expected changes in interdomain mobility seem to occur.</p><p>3) NPC1L1 studies. It would be of interest to include a linker-domain 3 pair, similar to what was done for NPC1 – is the movement of the N-terminal domain also not important in NPC1L1?</p><p>4) Please add the control single cysteine mutant flow cytometry data to Figure 3D, presumably it appears like WT.</p><p>5) Point mutagenesis of NPC1L1 (Figure 8) shows numerous residues are essential for Ezetimibe binding. The rationale for the mutations chosen is not presented – why were some residues mutated to K, others to N, to D, to E, and to R? And, other than cell surface localization of the entire protein, is there a way of determining that the domains mutated are still folding properly?</p><p>6) In several instances the description of the figures in the text are a bit difficult to follow and the figure legends could be more specific:</p><p>a) Figure 1. Results section denotes the putative sterol sensing domain – this is not highlighted on the figure but should be. Also, it would be helpful if Figure 1B also used the color scheme to identify the domains, and also indicated the plane of the bilayer.</p><p>b) Figure 1 legend should include the time point following U18666A washout that the images were taken at, and define what &quot;briefly incubated&quot; with TMA-HCl means. Results section, please specify what is meant by &quot;a much shorter time scale.&quot;</p><p>c) Same for Figure 2, at what time point following U-washout were images taken?</p><p>d) Molecular dynamics figure (Figure 4) and its related text could be more congruent.</p><p>7) For molecular dynamics, please include how many times was each experimental trajectory run?</p><p>8) Why was Nonidet P40 chosen as a control for the mixed micelles rather than the micelles below their CMC?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for re-submitting your article &quot;Inter-domain dynamics drive cholesterol transport by NPC1 and NPC1L1 proteins&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus, the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this revised version, Saha et al. have addressed all the concerns raised in the review of the first submission. All reviewers were enthusiastic about this paper. They all agreed that this revised manuscript was strong and provided new insights into how cholesterol can be transported through the molecular channel of NPC1 and NPC1L1. A couple of concerns were raised that the authors should be able to address with clarifying explanations and/or additional data already in hand.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please rephrase the interpretation of the Δ807-811 mutant. The deletion of this loop could be due to altered mobility of the TM helices (as the authors propose), however the data do not rule out the possibility that this deletion favors a conformation of the protein that does not facilitate cholesterol transport. Distinguishing these two possibilities (which may be intertwined) is difficult and no new experiments are suggested, merely a rewording of the interpretation.</p><p>2) The images showing colocalization of NPC1 with LAMP1 are not convincing. The images are almost all dominated by a large unresolved object near to or surrounding the nucleus. This is a region that is dense with other organelles, so it is not clear whether two proteins in this region are indeed in the same organelles. There are some peripheral dots, but with the brightness adjusted for the large object they are very hard to see. We suggest providing insets of higher magnification and with brightness adjusted so that one can see clearly resolved lysosomes. This is not as important for the mutants that work to remove cholesterol, but is important for the mutants that are defective.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57089.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.
