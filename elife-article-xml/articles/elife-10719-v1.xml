A single presentation of a sugar reward to <italic>Drosophila</italic> activates distinct subsets of dopamine neurons that independently induce short- and long-term olfactory memories (STM and LTM, respectively). In this study, we show that a recurrent reward circuit underlies the formation and consolidation of LTM. This feedback circuit is composed of a single class of reward-signaling dopamine neurons (PAM-α1) projecting to a restricted region of the mushroom body (MB), and a specific MB output cell type, MBON-α1, whose dendrites arborize that same MB compartment. Both MBON-α1 and PAM-α1 neurons are required during the acquisition and consolidation of appetitive LTM. MBON-α1 additionally mediates the retrieval of LTM, which is dependent on the dopamine receptor signaling in the MB α/β neurons. Our results suggest that a reward signal transforms a nascent memory trace into a stable LTM using a feedback circuit at the cost of memory specificity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10719.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10719.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10719.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>An animal that finds particularly nutritious and palatable food will often develop a long-lasting memory—even if they experience that event only once.</p><p>One example of this is the ability of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic> to form a long-term association between a sugar reward and a specific odor that was present when they received the reward. The consumption of sugar triggers the release of a chemical called dopamine on specific compartments of a brain structure called the mushroom body. Dopamine then acts to modify the connection between cells called “Kenyon cells”, which encode specific odors, and the neurons that send signals out from the mushroom body (called MBONs). The result is the formation of a memory that links the odor with the reward.</p><p>However, little is known about how this process differs for long-term vs. short-term memories, and how it can occur when the fly has experienced the odor and reward together on only a single occasion. To find out, Ichinose et al. combined behavioral testing of fruit flies with genetics. The results confirmed that the dopamine neurons and the MBONs that project to a single compartment of the mushroom body, called α1, are both required for the formation of long-term odor-reward memories, but not their short-term equivalents. These neurons are called PAM-α1 and MBON-α1, respectively.</p><p>Unexpectedly, anatomical data revealed that PAM-α1 dopamine neurons receive input from MBON-α1; that is, long-term memory formation involves a feedback circuit: from PAM-α1 to Kenyon cells, then to MBON-α1 and back to PAM-α1. Blocking feedback from the MBON-α1 onto the PAM-α1 neurons shortly after odor-reward training disrupted long-term memory formation. Conversely, blocking feedback at a later stage did not. This suggests that prolonged activation of PAM-α1 by MBON-α1 helps to strengthen newly established memories, converting them into memories that will last for a long time.</p><p>The discovery of a specific circuit that supports long-term, but not short-term, memory formation in fruit flies is consistent with evidence of distinct mechanisms underlying these processes in mammals. Further work is now required to determine whether feedback circuits similar to those in fruit flies also contribute to reward-based learning in other animals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Environmentally relevant information, such as poison or food, can trigger formation of long-term memory (LTM) in a single association event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garcia et al., 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 1984</xref>). Because LTM formation is energetically costly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mery and Kawecki, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Placais and Preat, 2013</xref>), it is advantageous for animals to refer to surrounding conditions when selecting what information to retain as stable LTM. Appetitive olfactory learning in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> provides an opportunity to uncover the mechanisms underlying such integration of information, as a single presentation of nutritious sugar and an odor drives robust short-term memory (STM) and LTM, while non-nutritious sugar induces only STM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krashes and Waddell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colomb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burke and Waddell, 2011</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, sugar reward is mediated by a group of dopamine neurons called the protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Artificial activation of the PAM cluster neurons in the presence of odor drives robust appetitive STM and LTM formation. Recent studies subdivided the PAM cluster neurons into STM- and LTM-inducing cell types and identified several cell types responsible for LTM formation, including PAM-α1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huetteroth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yamagata et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the induced LTM is undetectable immediately after conditioning but gradually develops with time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Das et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huetteroth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yamagata et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Dopamine reward signals are conveyed by PAM cluster neurons to a brain structure called mushroom body (MB), where the convergence of the reward and the odor is assumed to take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krashes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Trannoy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2013</xref>). The MB represents odors using a sparse subset of ∼2000 intrinsic neurons, Kenyon cells (KCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Turner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Honegger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campbell et al., 2013</xref>). KCs send parallel fibers to form lobe structures, where multiple MB-output neuron (MBON) types elaborate spatially segregated dendritic arbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>). The KC-MBON synapses are presumed to be modified in the course of memory formation by the reinforcing dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tomchik and Davis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gervasi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sejourne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Placais et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boto et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>While there has been progress on the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying LTM formation resulting from repetitive conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pagani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Placais et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Philips et al., 2013</xref>), how a single presentation of a reward can trigger LTM remains to be understood. Here, we identify and behaviorally characterize a recurrent reward circuit that is essential for appetitive LTM formation and consolidation. The recurrent circuit consists of PAM-α1 dopamine neurons and a single MBON type, MBON-α1. This recurrent dopamine reward circuit may provide insights into a general mechanism for LTM formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MBON-α1 provides a glutamatergic feedback to PAM-α1</title><p>PAM-α1 delivers reward signals essential for appetitive LTM formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yamagata et al., 2015</xref>). To understand the neuronal circuit that regulates rewards for LTM formation, we first sought to anatomically identify the input neurons to PAM-α1. The presynaptic terminals of PAM-α1 are localized to the basal compartment of the MB α lobe (α1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2012</xref>), whereas the dendrites stretch horizontally across the superior medial, intermediate, and lateral protocerebra (SMP, SIP, and SLP, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yamagata et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B,H</xref>). By segmenting the dendrites of PAM-α1 in confocal images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>), we queried a database of GAL4 expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jenett et al., 2012</xref>) to computationally search for candidate upstream neurons. Strikingly, one of the input candidates we identified was the output neurons from the α1 compartment of the MB (MBON-α1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Transgenic expression of a presynaptic marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Robinson et al., 2002</xref>) by <italic>MB310C-GAL4</italic> revealed that the presynaptic terminals of MBON-α1 lie in close apposition to the dendrites of PAM-α1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,I</xref>). The terminals of MBON-α1 were immunoreactive for the vesicular glutamate transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Daniels et al., 2008</xref>) but not for markers for GABAergic or cholinergic neurons (glutamic acid decarboxylase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jackson et al., 1990</xref>] or choline acetyltransferase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Takagawa and Salvaterra, 1996</xref>], respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with MBON-α1 being glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>).

Odor mixtures were created by systematically varying the relative contents of the contaminant (trained odor: contaminant = 100:0, 80:20, 60:40, 40:60, 20:80, or 0:100): if the memory is specific to the trained odor, the performance quickly decreases with the increasing contaminant ratio. Strikingly, the performance decline is shallower in LTM compared to STM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C,D</xref>). We confirmed these results with another set of odorants, suggesting that compromised stimulus specificity in LTM is general (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). Considering that the only difference between these groups is the retention time, there may be a trade-off between consolidation and specificity, possibly due to the prolonged dopamine release in the MB following memory acquisition.<fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10719.018</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>LTM specificity is compromised.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Chemical structures of odorants.

Here, we extend the known role of MBONs and show that MB output through MBON-α1 is required not only for the retrieval, but also for the acquisition and early consolidation of long-term appetitive olfactory memory. This unanticipated aspect of the MB output for LTM formation appears to function through a recurrent loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>): MBON-α1 dendrites and the terminals of PAM-α1 occupy the same MB compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>); the <italic>DopR1</italic> dopamine receptor is required in the KCs of that compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>); MBON-α1 in turn sends a portion of its outputs to the dendrites of PAM-α1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1, 2</xref>) closing the loop; synaptic signaling by all three cell types—α/β KCs, MBON-α1, and PAM-α1—is required during LTM formation and consolidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig7 fig9">Figures 3, 7, 9</xref>). These findings strongly support our model that feedback signals from α/β KCs, mediated by MBON-α1, play a critical role in controlling the rewarding dopamine signals from PAM-α1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). Inhibitory recurrent circuits in the MBs have been implicated in appetitive learning of honeybees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grunewald, 1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">1999b</xref>). Our present study reveals a new circuit motif, a feedback circuit that is required for dopamine neurons to provide reinforcement during appetitive LTM formation.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10719.020</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Recurrent reward circuit drives appetitive LTM formation.</title><p>Feedback circuit model of appetitive LTM formation.

However, our results call into question this prevailing circuit model. More specifically, PAM-α1 might integrate simultaneous inputs from sugar perception and the nascent memory trace to augment and sustain the dopamine release to gate LTM formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). The requirement of the NMDA receptor in PAM-α1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) further supports this model. Such integration by PAM-α1 might enhance the reward gain selectively in relevant sensory environments. In other words, the reinforcing signal for LTM formation may depend on the presence of other sensory stimuli (e.g., odor). As LTM formation is energetically costly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mery and Kawecki, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Placais and Preat, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Musso et al., 2015</xref>), this gain control of the reinforcing signal might serve to restrict LTM formation to ecologically relevant situations. Although the requirement of NMDA receptor in PAM-α1 implies that MBON-α1 provides excitatory input, the synaptic connectivity between MBON-α1 and PAM-α1 awaits physiological demonstration, given functional inhibitory glutamate receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu and Wilson, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the role in memory acquisition, the PAM-α1 output is required during consolidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref>). The dopamine release is likely to be sustained by the ongoing activity of the recurrent circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C–F</xref>). A recent study reported a consistent finding that the output from α/β KCs during consolidation has an essential role for appetitive and aversive LTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2012</xref>) in addition to their role in retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krashes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Trannoy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xie et al., 2013</xref>).

Data did not violate the assumption of normal distribution (Shapiro–Wilk test) and homogeneity of variance (Bartlett test). Therefore, the data were analyzed with parametric statistics: one-sample t-test or one-way analysis of variance followed by the planned pairwise multiple comparisons (Bonferroni). The significance level of statistical tests was set to 0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank AB Friedrich, A Kucher, S Prech, T Tagawa, and T Onodera for excellent technical assistance; L Nevin, K Tsutsui, K Oyama, B Gerber, and Tanimoto-lab members for critical reading and discussions.

Your full submission has been evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior Editor) and three peer reviewers: Leslie Griffith, who is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, Martin Giurfa and one other.</p><p>The decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> since the amount of work required to make this submission completely solid is too substantial. The complete reviews are appended to help you in revising the work.</p><p>In summary, this paper leverages new anatomical reagents to investigate mechanisms of LTM formation for appetitive learning. The finding of an LTM-specific putative positive feedback loop for consolidation involving DANs and MBONs is very interesting. All the reviewers agree that the finding is important, but some of the connections that are made to support the story rest on rather weak or incomplete evidence. Another point of weakness for two of the three reviewers was that many of the key points of support for the new model are based on information that was already available in the literature; there is little new experimental territory explored in this paper. The few novel findings are very suggestive, but not by themselves conclusive or complete enough to warrant publication of this version of the paper. For these reasons the paper in its present form is rejected, but we encourage you to submit a substantially expanded paper when these matters are dealt with (this would of course be treated as a new submission). Specific issues included:</p><p>1) Neuronal connectivity: The coexistence in similar spatial domains of terminals from putatively connected neurons is the only evidence of direct connectivity and this is weak. There should be live imaging data (using sensors like GCaMP or EPAC) showing that the neurons in this putative circuit have functional relationships and respond to the postulated transmitters.</p><p>2) The evidence that there is no DAergic connection between PAM and MBON needs to be strengthened. To really nail this, the authors should rule out other DARs and be able to show no DA responses in MBON using functional imaging.</p><p>3) The nature of the glutamatergic connection (excitatory vs. inhibitory) between MBON and PAM is not investigated. This really matters since this is a synapse that could be inhibitory via mGluR/GluCl or excitatory via AMPA-like or NMDARs. The whole idea that this is an LTP-like excitatory feedback loop, while not inconsistent with data, rests on the assertion that this is an excitatory and potentiating connection. Some evidence is needed here. It is not sufficient for the sign of a synapse to be inferred from indirect behavioral evidence; you need to determine it experimentally. This can be done with functional imaging.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper leverages new anatomical reagents to investigate mechanisms of LTM formation for appetitive learning.

These data are presented as single example images with no quantification or indication of whether these images are typical. At minimum there should be markers showing the presence of dendritic/axonal markers (or citations if these experiments have already been published elsewhere) and GRASP to show contact.</p><p>b) There should be live imaging data (using sensors like GCaMP or EPAC) showing that the neurons in this putative circuit have functional relationships and respond to the postulated transmitters.</p><p>c) Completeness of model: The authors should be able to show that <italic>shi</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup> during consolidation in MBON also blocks LTM.</p><p>2) The evidence that there is no DAergic connection between PAM and MBON needs to be strengthened – basically a failure of a single RNAi to block LTM. This could be due to: 1) the RNAi not being effective in that cell type, or 2) a different DAR mediating the connection. To really nail this, the authors should rule out other DARs and be able to show no DA responses in MBON using functional imaging.</p><p>3) The nature of the glutamatergic connection (excitatory vs. inhibitory) between MBON and PAM is not investigated.

This can be done with functional imaging.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is an excellent work showing for the first time that one-trial appetitive conditioning leading to the formation of long-term memory in <italic>Drosophila</italic> relies on a previously unknown circuit integrated by PAM-α1 neurons, conveying the dopaminergic reward signal to αβ Kenyon cells (KC) of the mushroom bodies (MBs), and MBON-α1 neurons, which are extrinsic to α/β KCs and which provide an excitatory glutamatergic loop onto PAM-α1. In this way, dopamine reward signaling is enhanced via the glutamatergic feedback of MBON-α1, thereby leading to appetitive LTM formation.</p><p>In general, I am very enthusiastic about this work and the elegance of the experiments presented. I have a couple of general remarks that the authors could address to improve their manuscript.</p><p>I found very interesting that the authors identified two MBON-α1 cells with very similar morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Unfortunately, they did not elaborate on the redundancy/complementarity of these two cells for the phenomena under scrutiny. Personally I would like to know why there are two cells. Are they fully redundant? Are they modulating dopaminergic signaling at different rates? Do they contribute equally to LTM formation? Can the authors provide some experimental evidence aimed at disentangling the contributions of the two cells?</p><p>Also the circuits presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, create the wrong impression (in particular 2D, less in the case of 7C) of a closed circuit with no external input/output. What is missing in these figures, and it would be nice to see it, is the octopaminergic circuit proving relay sugar signals to PAM neurons. This is important to see from where does the sugar signal come from. On the other hand, the term “LTM read-out” is obscure. What do the authors mean in terms of circuitry, structures?</p><p>The Discussion was a bit poor, in particular given the richness and importance of the results presented in this work. Although it is clear that this would be the first excitatory loop found at the level of the MBs, various reports have studied the presence of inhibitory loops and their involvement in aversive LTM formation in the fly as well as in appetitive memory formation in the honeybee. The latter case is particularly relevant for this article given the common appetitive paradigm. I would appreciate that the authors discuss the parallels and differences between inhibitory, GABAergic feedback neurons, and excitatory, glutamatergic feedback neurons in LTM formation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors report an analysis of a neuronal circuit required for appetitive long-term memory (LTM) formation. A specific type of dopaminergic neurons (PAM-α1) targeting a specific region of the mushroom body is shown to be required for appetitive LTM, but not short-term memory. A connection to a mushroom body output neuron (MBON-α1) is demonstrated, and a feedback loop between MBON-α1 and PAM-α1 proposed. In addition, transmitter release from the specific mushroom body cells targeted by both MBON-α1 and PAM-α1 neurons (α/β-lobe Kenyon cells) are shown to be required during the learning process (acquisition) to induce the formation of LTM.</p><p>First, the authors report an anatomical interaction between MBON-α1 and PAM-α1. The cellular anatomy and the determination of the directionality of the signals using a dendrite marker and a presynaptic marker are beautifully described and convincing. However, this finding has been reported already in detail in Aso et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2014; 3:e04577 (Figure 14N; Figure 20C). The two MBON-α1 cells have been described in this publication to be glutamatergic and not cholinergic or GABAergic as well.</p><p>Second, the authors report that blocking the output from PAM-α1 neurons during training does not significantly affect appetitive short-term memory, but LTM. This has been reported already in Yamagata et al., PNAS 2015, 112:578-583 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H, I</xref>).</p><p>Third, the authors show that blocking output from MBON-α1 neurons during training likewise impairs LTM (tested 24h after training), but not STM (tested directly after training). In Aso et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2014, 3:e04580 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) it has been reported that blocking MBON-α1 impairs appetitive 2h memory. Therefore, the finding that LTM, but not STM is affected is novel. However, the conclusion that MBON-α1 neurons mediate specifically LTM (“…we found a similar selective impairment of LTM upon the blockade of MBON-α1”) is perhaps not entirely correct.</p><p>Fourth, the authors find that downregulating the dopamine receptor <italic>DopR1</italic> in MBON-α1 neurons does not affect LTM formation or acquisition. However, they find that RNAi-mediated downregulation of <italic>DopR1</italic> in α/β-type Kenyon cells does impair LTM.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>We thank the reviewers for constructive comments. In the current manuscript, we addressed all the points by substantially revising the text as well as performing a series of new experiments. The new data added in this manuscript are summarized as follows:</p><p>(1) We now performed a GRASP experiment between PAM-α1 and MBON-α1. Strong GRASP signals in the α1 compartment of the MB, SIP and SLP support the contacts between these neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>(2) Confocal imaging using a super-resolution detection system revealed that presynaptic bouton-like structures of MBON-α1 are heavily intermingled by PAM-α1 dendrites, again supporting the direct connection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B to 2D</xref>).</p><p>(3) To gain insight into the nature of the recurrent loop, we now performed a behavioral screening of UAS-RNAi lines for 16 glutamate receptor genes in the dopamine neurons. This screening identified the consistent requirement of NMDA receptor subunits in PAM-α1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This suggests a positive feedback signal by MBON-α1.</p><p>(4) As a further support for the positive feedback, we now provide behavioral evidence showing that transient activation of MBON-α1 can induce appetitive olfactory LTM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first data showing that the MB output can signal reinforcement, and strongly suggests PAM-α1 as a postsynaptic target of MBON-α1 in the formation of appetitive LTM.</p><p>(5) We performed a rescue experiment of a <italic>DopR1</italic> mutant, and found the full rescue of LTM by targeting transgene expression to Kenyon cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This shows the sufficiency of DopR1 signaling in Kenyon cells, but not the other cell types.</p><p>(6) We now demonstrate the requirement of MBON-α1 and α/β KC outputs during early consolidation of LTM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Together with the similar necessity of PAM-α1 in early consolidation, these results strongly suggest the prolonged activity in the recurrent circuit.</p><p>(7) We now made a comparison between the generalization profiles of STM and LTM, and found that LTM is less specific to the trained odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This trade-off between stability and the specificity of memory may well explain the consequence of the prolonged dopamine release without olfactory stimulation in early consolidation.</p><p>These new data findings substantially strengthened the previous version of the manuscript, and now offer a more complete picture of the circuit mechanism of appetitive LTM formation. For more than 20 years, physiological studies have postulated that reinforcing neurons in a brain are controlled by learned information both in mammals and in insects (e. g. Schultz et al., 1997, Science; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hammer, 1993</xref>, Nature). This study provides an underlying circuit mechanism, which we believe an important contribution to the field.</p><p>Please find below our point-by-point response to the reviewers.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>This paper leverages new anatomical reagents to investigate mechanisms of LTM formation for appetitive learning. The finding of an LTM-specific putative positive feedback loop for consolidation involving DANs and MBONs is quite interesting and a bit unexpected. The finding is really novel and important, but some of the connections that are made rest on rather weak or incomplete evidence.</italic></p><p><italic>1) Neuronal connectivity:</italic></p><p><italic>a) The coexistence in similar spatial domains of terminals from putatively connected neurons is the only evidence of direct connectivity and this is weak. These data are presented as single example images with no quantification or indication of whether these images are typical. At minimum there should be markers showing the presence of dendritic/axonal markers (or citations if these experiments have already been published elsewhere) and GRASP to show contact.</italic></p><p><italic>b) There should be live imaging data (using sensors like GCaMP or EPAC) showing that the neurons in this putative circuit have functional relationships and respond to the postulated transmitters.</italic></p><p><italic>c) Completeness of model: The authors should be able to show that shi</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup> <italic>during consolidation in MBON also blocks LTM.</italic></p><p>Our new experiments provided several lines of anatomical and behavioral evidence to clarify this neuronal connectivity. We now better visualize the presynaptic terminals of MBON-α1 enwrapped by the dendritic processes of PAM-α1 by confocal microscopy with the super-resolution detection system as well as the 3D rendered presentation. We also provide several specimens for a stretch of juxtaposition to show stereotypy. To further support this connectivity, we conducted a GRASP experiment by differentially expressing two halves of GFP in the pre- and post-synaptic neurons. All these new data strengthened the anatomical aspect of this feedback circuit.</p><p>As MBON-α1 is glutamatergic, we screened the 16 genes encoding different glutamate receptors for the requirement in the dopamine neurons. We found that the knockdown of <italic>dNR1</italic> and <italic>dNR2</italic> in the PAM-α1 caused a selective impairment in LTM. In response to the reviewer’s suggestion, we blocked the output of MBON-α1 and α/β KCs during early consolidation. Similar to the requirement of PAM-α1, these two components of the feedback circuit are necessary for LTM consolidation as well as acquisition, suggesting the sustained activity of this positive feedback loop upon associative training.</p><p>We cited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al. 2012</xref>, Nature, for the neuronal polarity of the PAM cluster neurons, whereas we present the polarity of MBON-α1 in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The data are consistent with the mutual feedback between PAM-α1 and MBON-α1. To show the direct monosynaptic connectivity of these neurons, temporally precise presynaptic stimulation with electrophysiological recording of the postsynaptic potential would be necessary. We leave such precise characterization for follow-up studies.</p><p><italic>2) The evidence that there is no DAergic connection between PAM and MBON needs to be strengthened – basically a failure of a single RNAi to block LTM. This could be due to: 1) the RNAi not being effective in that cell type, or 2) a different DAR mediating the connection. To really nail this, the authors should rule out other DARs and be able to show no DA responses in MBON using functional imaging.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the data in the previous experiment does not exclude the possible dopaminergic input to MBON-α1. To back up the argument, we performed a rescue experiment of the <italic>DopR1</italic> mutant LTM by expressing the wild-type transgene in the Kenyon cells. This localized expression fully rescued appetitive LTM, suggesting that <italic>DopR1</italic> signaling in the MBON-α1 neurons is dispensable for appetitive LTM.</p><p>As it is not our intention to exclude the contribution of the other dopamine receptors in MBON-α1, we revised the text accordingly and removed the scheme in the previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) The nature of the glutamatergic connection (excitatory vs. inhibitory) between MBON and PAM is not investigated. This really matters since this is a synapse that could be inhibitory via mGluR/GluCl or excitatory via AMPA-like or NMDARs. The whole idea that this is an LTP-like excitatory feedback loop, while not inconsistent with data, rests on the assertion that this is an excitatory and potentiating connection. Some evidence is needed here. It is not sufficient for the sign of a synapse to be inferred from indirect behavioral evidence; you need to determine it experimentally. This can be done with functional imaging.</italic></p><p>As described above, our RNAi screen for glutamate receptors identified the requirement of <italic>dNR1</italic> and <italic>dNR2</italic> in PAM-α1. Furthermore, depolarization of MBON-α1, just as activation of PAM-α1, was capable to induce appetitive olfactory LTM. These new data are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, and support our model of a positive feedback, while this should formally involve electrophysiological analysis with precise presynaptic stimulation. We also included discussion about this.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>This is an excellent work showing for the first time that one-trial appetitive conditioning leading to the formation of long-term memory in</italic> Drosophila <italic>relies on a previously unknown circuit integrated by PAM-α1 neurons, conveying the dopaminergic reward signal to αβ Kenyon cells (KC) of the mushroom bodies (MBs), and MBON-α1, neurons, which are extrinsic to α/β KCs and which provide an excitatory glutamatergic loop onto PAM-α1. In this way, dopamine reward signaling is enhanced via the glutamatergic feedback of MBON-α1, thereby leading to appetitive LTM formation.</italic></p><p><italic>In general, I am very enthusiastic about this work and the elegance of the experiments presented. I have a couple of general remarks that the authors could address to improve their manuscript.</italic></p><p><italic>I found very interesting that the authors identified two MBON-α1 cells with very similar morphology (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2C</italic></xref><italic>). Unfortunately, they did not elaborate on the redundancy/complementarity of these two cells for the phenomena under scrutiny. Personally I would like to know why there are two cells. Are they fully redundant? Are they modulating dopaminergic signaling at different rates? Do they contribute equally to LTM formation? Can the authors provide some experimental evidence aimed at disentangling the contributions of the two cells?</italic></p><p>We really appreciate for the encouraging comments. As to the two MBON-α1 cells, we did not find any anatomical and genetic evidence that these two cells are different, implying that they are redundant. Our recent systematic characterization of MB output neurons identified that many other MBON types consist of a single pair. This may correspond well to the pleiotropy of MBON-α1 functions. Our work highlighted that MBON-α1, unlike other MBON types, plays a role in all stages of appetitive LTM processing: acquisition, early consolidation and retrieval of LTM. It is therefore reasonable to devise multiple cells of the same function as a fail-safe mechanism. This said, a tool to reproducibly target transgene expression to one of these cells is necessary to show the functional differentiation. Our view above is thus a pure speculation for the moment, and we refrain from mentioning it in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Also the circuits presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2D</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7C</italic></xref><italic>, create the wrong impression (in particular 2D, less in the case of 7C) of a closed circuit with no external input/output. What is missing in these figures, and it would be nice to see it, is the octopaminergic circuit proving relay sugar signals to PAM neurons. This is important to see from where does the sugar signal come from. On the other hand, the term “LTM read-out” is obscure. What do the authors mean in terms of circuitry, structures?</italic></p><p>We omitted the scheme in previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> (see above), as it appears to be confusing. We added the sugar input that leads to the activation of PAM-α1, but we hesitate to add the octopamine input to the PAM-α1 neurons, since octopaminergic reward signals only induce STM, but not LTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burke et al., 2012</xref>, Nature; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huetteroth et al., 2015</xref>, Curr. Biol.). Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we amended “LTM read-out” to “Conditioned approach” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).</p><p><italic>The Discussion was a bit poor, in particular given the richness and importance of the results presented in this work. Although it is clear that this would be the first excitatory loop found at the level of the MBs, various reports have studied the presence of inhibitory loops and their involvement in aversive LTM formation in the fly as well as in appetitive memory formation in the honeybee. The latter case is particularly relevant for this article given the common appetitive paradigm. I would appreciate that the authors discuss the parallels and differences between inhibitory, GABAergic feedback neurons, and excitatory, glutamatergic feedback neurons in LTM formation.</italic></p><p>We added a discussion on the previous findings of an inhibitory feedback loop in the honeybee MB and contrasted it to our Results.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>The authors report an analysis of a neuronal circuit required for appetitive long-term memory (LTM) formation. A specific type of dopaminergic neurons (PAM-α1) targeting a specific region of the mushroom body is shown to be required for appetitive LTM, but not short-term memory. A connection to a mushroom body output neuron (MBON-α1) is demonstrated, and a feedback loop between MBON-α1 and PAM-α1 proposed. In addition, transmitter release from the specific mushroom body cells targeted by both MBON-α1 and PAM-α1 neurons (α/β-lobe Kenyon cells) are shown to be required during the learning process (acquisition) to induce the formation of LTM.</italic></p><p><italic>First, the authors report an anatomical interaction between MBON-α1 and PAM-α1. The cellular anatomy and the determination of the directionality of the signals using a dendrite marker and a presynaptic marker are beautifully described and convincing. However, this finding has been reported already in detail in Aso et al., eLife 2014; 3:e04577 (Figure 14N; Figure 20C). The two MBON-α1 cells have been described in this publication to be glutamatergic and not cholinergic or GABAergic as well.</italic></p><p>This criticism is not entirely correct. The overlap between different DANs and MBONs reported in our previous paper (Aso et al. 2014 <italic>eLife</italic>) is mainly based on the computational alignment of different samples (image registration), thus the connection is not conclusive. In the current study we provide a direct evidence that these two types of neurons contact in a close proximity using double labelling of PAM-α1 and MBON-α1 in the same brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Movie 1</xref>). This is further substantiated by our new GRASP data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2F</xref>).</p><p>We provided the raw data for the polarity of MBON-α1, since they were not presented in the paper. As it is obvious from the comments by Reviewer #1, it is frustrating without information on clear confocal photos and stereotypy. We are however ready to remove these data for polarity and neurotransmitters at the editor’s discretion. This would not compromise the significance of our findings.</p><p><italic>Second, the authors report that blocking the output from PAM-α1 neurons during training does not significantly affect appetitive short-term memory, but LTM. This has been reported already in Yamagata et al., PNAS 2015, 112:578-583 (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4H, I</italic></xref><italic>).</italic></p><p>This replication experiment of the PAM-α1 blockade serves as a good reference to the same manipulation in MBON-α1 by showing them side-by-side in the same figure. As this is not critical for the story, we are ready to remove these data and just cite the Yamagata et al. paper at the editor’s discretion.</p><p><italic>Third, the authors show that blocking output from MBON-α1 neurons during training likewise impairs LTM (tested 24h after training), but not STM (tested directly after training). In Aso et al., eLife 2014, 3:e04580 (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7B</italic></xref><italic>) it has been reported that blocking MBON-α1 impairs appetitive 2h memory. Therefore, the finding that LTM, but not STM is affected is novel. However, the conclusion that MBON-α1 neurons mediate specifically LTM (“…we found a similar selective impairment of LTM upon the blockade of MBON-α1”) is perhaps not entirely correct.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion to make our description more precise. We moderated the wording “selective” to “preferential”.</p><p><italic>Fourth, the authors find that downregulating the dopamine receptor</italic> DopR1 <italic>in MBON-α1 neurons does not affect LTM formation or acquisition. However, they find that RNAi-mediated downregulation of</italic> DopR1 <italic>in α/β-type Kenyon cells does impair LTM. The authors do not directly exclude that PAM-α1 neurons target MBON-α1, but correctly state that “…these results indicate that the DopR1-mediated LTM trace is primarily formed in α/β KCs, not in MBON-α1”.

Only very few aspects are new, which perhaps do not justify the publication of this manuscript in its current form.</italic></p><p>We are sorry that our previous version did not articulate the novelty of our results over existing literature. We made substantial revisions of the text for clarification and added new data. Following is the summary of our novel findings:</p><p>(1) PAM-α1 and MBON-α1 form a feedback circuit by making mutual contacts both inside and outside the MB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We provided data showing double labelling of these cell types in the same brain, super-resolution confocal images of them, GRASP signals between these cell types.</p><p>(2) Output from MBON-α1 is necessary for LTM acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>), making the first demonstration of a MBON function beyond memory retrieval.</p><p>(3) The NMDA receptor subunits are required in PAM-α1, supporting the glutamatergic feedback from MBON-α1 to PAM-α1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>(4) MBON-α1 can drive a reward signal for appetitive LTM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), suggesting the reward augmentation by the MB-output. Again this function is unexpected for the mushroom body output signal.</p><p>(5) The requirement of the dopamine receptor <italic>DopR1</italic> in α/β KCs for appetitive LTM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) revealed a clear cellular distinction to <italic>DopR1</italic> signaling for aversive LTM, supporting the idea that the memory trace is formed in the MB-α1 compartment.</p><p>(6) The requirement of MB output (α/β KCs) during the acquisition of LTM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) has never been shown (and not even a formulated hypothesis to our knowledge). This also suggests that the nascent memory trace in the α/β KCs is ‘read out’ to activate the α1 recurrent circuit.</p><p>(7) MBON-α1 is further involved in LTM retrieval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Given the dispensability of PAM-α1 during the test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), this is an additional function of MBON-α1 the α1 feedback circuit.</p><p>(8) Post-training dopamine release by the α1 recurrent circuit drives LTM consolidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>(9) For sugar memory, stability is achieved at the cost of stimulus specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>We were overall satisfied with the changes made in this paper since the last version that was reviewed.

In the revised manuscript, we explicitly acknowledged this. We thought that the positive feedback is the simplest interpretation of our behavioral data (thermo-activation of MBON-α1 [like dopaminergic PAM-α1] induces appetitive LTM; and NMDAR signaling in PAM-α1 is necessary for appetitive LTM), but these data do not exclude the possibility of inhibitory connection. For example, glutamate released by MBON-α1 might be received through inhibitory glutamate receptors, while NMDAR signaling in PAM-α1 might function in the glutamatergic synapses other than with MBON-α1. Thus we left the nature of connection for future studies.</p><p><italic>2) The wording on OA made it seem like OA is NOT involved. It is, just one synapse back. This should be clarified in the text.</italic></p><p>We do appreciate the work of others revealing octopamine as a reward signal in insect brains, and now modified the text to make it even clearer.
