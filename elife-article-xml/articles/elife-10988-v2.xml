The cells inside the ear that perform this transformation are called hair cells, which are so named because they have hundreds of hair-like structures on their upper surface. Pressure from sound waves causes movements in the inner ear that bend these ‘hairs’. This causes the hair cells to release chemical signals to neighboring nerve cell terminals that ultimately transmit information about the sound to the brain.</p><p>The chemical signals are stored inside the hair cells in bubble-like compartments called vesicles. To release the chemicals from the cell, the vesicles merge with the membrane that surrounds the hair cell. Most cells that communicate in this way are limited in how long they can transmit such messages. However, hair cells can continuously fuse vesicles to the membrane even when a sound lasts for a long time. This suggests that the hair cells have a different way of producing vesicles and getting them to the membrane than other cell types.</p><p>Inside the hair cells, vesicles are stored in regions called active zones. Each active zone contains a “ribbon” (attached to which are hundreds of vesicles) and also ion channels that allow calcium ions to flow into the cell. (An increase in calcium ion concentration inside the cell is necessary for the vesicle to fuse with the cell membrane and so release its chemical content). Now, Vincent et al. show that in hair cells, a cage-like network made from a protein called actin surrounds each active zone. This network helps to position the calcium ion channels. Treating the hair cells with a compound that disorganized the actin networks speed up the process of vesicle movement, which suggests that the actin network also controls the rate at which vesicles reach the membrane.</p><p>Next, it will be important to identify how the actin network interacts with other molecules that help vesicles to release their contents; in particular a protein called otoferlin, which is thought to act as a calcium ion sensor.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10988.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10988.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>exocytosis</kwd><kwd>hair cell</kwd><kwd>actin network</kwd><kwd>osmotic pressure</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-65</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petit</surname><given-names>Christine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A synaptic F-actin network tightly controls the flow of synaptic vesicles during exocytosis at the inner hair cell ribbons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Auditory hair cells convert tiny variations of sound pressure through the displacement of their apical hair bundles into analogous voltage waveforms. Neural encoding of these microphonic potentials occurs at the ribbon synapses of inner hair cells (IHCs) by mechanisms involving Cav1.3 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Platzer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brandt et al., 2005</xref>) and otoferlin-dependent exocytosis of synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Roux et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beurg et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vincent et al., 2014</xref>). Unlike most neuronal central synapses, IHCs have the extraordinary property to sustain indefatigably high rates of exocytosis during continuous sound stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Safieddine et al., 2012</xref>). The precise molecular mechanisms underlying this fast and massive recruitment of synaptic vesicles to the IHC ribbon active zones still remain elusive. The implication of an unconventional molecular regulation of synaptic vesicle fusion and replenishment of the releasable pool of vesicles has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nouvian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vogl et al., 2015</xref>). In other secretory cells such as neuroendocrine cells, a network of sub-membranous cortical F-actin is known to influence exocytosis greatly by tightly regulating plasma membrane tension and the access of the granules to the secretory sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apodaca, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Torregrosa-Hetland et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gutierrez and Gil, 2011</xref>). In central neuronal synapses, F-actin is also involved in maintaining vesicle pools and regulating vesicle mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cingolani and Goda, 2008</xref>). Electron-tomography evidence for F-actin and microtubules near the synaptic ribbons has been observed in bullfrog hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Graydon et al 2011</xref>). Whether IHC synaptic exocytosis is modulated by F-actin remains unknown. Other factors affecting membrane tension and exocytosis in many cell types, such as mast cells, include hydrostatic pressure across the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Solsona et al., 1998</xref>). This latter factor has also been shown to influence the spontaneous and evoked activity of vestibular hair cells of the dogfish by mechanisms that remain unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fraser and Shelmerdine, 2002</xref>). In the present study, we investigated whether F-actin and intracellular hydrostatic pressure regulate synaptic exocytosis in mouse IHCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Direct labeling of F-actin with fluorescent phalloidin revealed the presence of a dense F-actin network that surrounded the IHC ribbon synaptic zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

These cages displayed a mean size diameter of 0.8 ± 0.1 µm (n = 186 actives zones; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Overlapping with otoferlin, each F-actin cage was generally associated with one ribbon and one Cav1.3 co-immunoreactive patch. Similarly, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and the secretory machinery have been shown to be associated with the borders of F-actin cytoskeletal cages in chromaffin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Torregrosa-Hetland et al., 2011</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10988.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Confocal imaging of the synaptic F-actin cages in IHCs.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Confocal images from averaged Z-stack projection (20 slices of 0.25 µm) of P13-IHCs labeled in blue with otoferlin-immuno-reactivity.

The mean distance between the Cav1.3 immunoreactive patches and the ribbons increased from 218 ± 11 nm (n = 71) in controls to 260 ± 12 nm with latrunculin-A treatment (n = 102; p&lt;0.05). In the latter conditions, surprisingly, whole-cell patch clamp recordings revealed a largely facilitated exocytosis as compared to controls, while voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents were unchanged (Figure 2A,B). After 100 ms depolarization, from -80 to -10 mV, the exocytotic response in control IHCs reached a maximum amplitude of 22.0 ± 2.9 fF (n = 11). Considering that a 40 nm diameter synaptic vesicle corresponds to 37 aF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lenzi et al., 1999</xref>), we estimated a RRP size of about 590 vesicles, i.e 33 vesicles per ribbons if we assume a number of 18 ribbons per IHCs. This number of RRP vesicles fit well with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vincent et al., 2014</xref>). In latrunculin-treated IHCs, the exocytotic responses reached, at 100 ms, 32.4 ± 3.3 fF (n = 18), a value significantly larger as compared to control IHCs (p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Remarkably, while the exocytotic response saturated at 90–100 ms in controls, the response did not show saturation in latrunculin-treated IHCs. Since the exocytotic response was unchanged for short impulses below 30 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), these results suggested that the disruption of F-actin did not affect the steps of vesicle docking and priming but facilitated the replenishment of the RRP. In bassoon mutants with abnormal number of anchored ribbons and reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents both short (20 ms) and long (100 ms) impulse activated-exocytosis were affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jing et al., 2013</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10988.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Latrunculin-A treatment facilitated exocytosis in IHCs.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents, evoked by a voltage-ramp protocol, were not significantly affected by latrunculin-A (orange).

This sensitivity to EGTA suggested a spatial disorganization of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clusters in regards to the release sites in latrunculin-treated IHCs, in good agreement with confocal imaging (Figure 1C,D). Rising the EGTA concentration could also affect the extent to which neighboring calcium sources interact and summate to produce a global effect on free calcium.</p><p>The intriguing question now is: why is the disruption of the synaptic F-actin with latrunculin-A facilitating exocytosis in IHCs? One explanation is that the synaptic F-actin network, in addition to organizing Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains, also acts as a diffusion barrier for synaptic vesicles limiting the access to the site of release, as suggested in some central synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cingolani and Goda, 2008</xref>). Its disruption with depolymerising agents would therefore facilitate vesicle replenishment of the release sites, as shown in a large variety of secretory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Malacombe et al., 2006</xref>), by increasing the number of available vesicles for docking and priming. Alternatively, a disrupted F-actin could facilitate the diffusion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from its sites of entry and stimulate replenishment.</p><p>To directly test these hypothesis, we studied the effect of F-actin depolimerization on exocytosis triggered by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> uncaging, i.e. independently of the activation and the organization of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. In these experiments, a large exocytotic facilitation was also observed in latrunculin-treated IHCs (Figure 2C,D). The peak exocytotic rate, obtained by measuring the first derivative function of the curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, was nearly two fold larger in latrunculin-treated IHCs as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; 25.9 ± 2.7 pF/s (n = 14) and 13.7 ± 1.7 pF/s (n = 16), respectively; p&lt;0.05). The levels of the peak intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>free</sub>) reached upon UV-flash Ca<sup>2+</sup> uncaging were verified to be similar in control (n = 7) and latrunculin-treated IHCs (n = 5), respectively 59 ± 7 µM and 57 ± 5 µM (p=0.9; Figure 2C-inset). These Ca<sup>2+</sup> uncaging experiments again suggested that a synaptic F-actin network controls the diffusion rate of the synaptic vesicles to the sites of release in IHCs.</p><p>Furthermore, since intracellular hydrostatic pressure has been suggested to influence membrane tension and exocytosis through the F-actin network in many cell types such as mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Solsona et al., 1998</xref>), we probed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked exocytosis under various intracellular osmotic pressures in auditory IHCs. We first found that increasing intracellular osmotic pressure from 310 to 390 mOsm with sucrose produced a significant increase in the resting membrane capacitance of IHCs. The resting size of IHCs, voltage-clamped at -80 mV for a period of 2 min after break-in, was 9.93 ± 0.27 pF (n = 11, 310 mOsm) and 11.10 ± 0.34 pF (n = 10, 390 mOsm; p&lt;0.05), respectively. This augmentation of the IHC resting membrane capacitance was about 50 times larger than the size of the RRP evoked by membrane depolarization (Figure 2B; RRP = 22 fF). Where does this large addition of membrane come from? One possible explanation was that high intracellular hydrostatic pressure triggers the fusion of a large amount of extrasynaptic vesicles to the plasma membrane, as previously suggested for Ca<sup>2+</sup> uncaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vincent et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, in these latter conditions of intracellular hyperosmotic stress at 390 mOsm, voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents displayed larger amplitude (Figure 3A,C) and accelerated activation kinetics as compared to control conditions at 310 mOsm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). A shift in their voltage-dependence toward more negative potentials was also observed (Figure 3A,D). The hydrostatic pressure effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents were no longer visible when IHCs were pre-treated with latrunculin-A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, pink line) and were greatly reduced in IHCs lacking otoferlin (<italic>Otof<sup>-/-</sup></italic>; Figure 3B,C). This indicated that the Cav1.3 channels of IHCs are mechanosensitive, like the Cav1.2 channels in smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lyford et al., 2002</xref>). We cannot exclude the addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to the plasma membrane during the massive vesicular fusion caused by increased hydrostatic pressure. However, this mechanism appears unlikely in regards to results obtained in non-secretory cells such as smooth muscle and HEK cells where similar effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels were obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lyford et al., 2002</xref>). In our study, the sensitivity to membrane tension in IHCs required an intact synaptic F-actin network and otoferlin, a proposed synaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor thought to interact physically with the Cav1.3 II-III loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ramakrishnan et al., 2009</xref>). Notably, an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> current amplitude in low bath hydrostatic pressure (equivalent to increasing intracellular pressure) was also reported in dissociated guinea pig vestibular hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duong Dinh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haasler et al., 2009</xref>). In these latter studies, the change in Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents could be interpreted as due to a pressure activation of K<sup>+</sup> currents leading to less pronounced depolarization. Although pressure effects on K<sup>+</sup> currents have also been shown in guinea-pig IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kimitsuki, 2013</xref>), we don't think that these currents would influence our Ca<sup>2+</sup> current measurements since we were working in conditions where most K<sup>+</sup> currents are blocked. Overall, our results suggested here that the mechanosensitivity of the Cav1.3 channels is mediated through an intact synaptic F-actin network.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10988.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Intracellular hydrostatic pressure modulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents and exocytosis.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Comparative Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents evoked by a voltage-ramp protocol in <italic>Otof<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Otof<sup>+/+</sup></italic>IHCs (expressing otoferlin).

In these latter conditions of intracellular hyperosmotic stress, the strength of exocytotic facilitation was maximal at 390 mOsm and abruptly decreased at 410 mOsm, a high pressure at which the intrinsic organization of the IHC exocytotic machinery may have been damaged. At 390 mOsm, the maximum amplitude of the exocytotic response was 1.5 ± 0.15 pF (n = 9) as compared to 1.0 ± 0.1 pF (n = 16) in controls at 310 mOsm (p&lt;0.05; Figure 4A,C).

In the same way, the mobility of vesicles in pancreatic cells and primary hepatocytes was shown to be affected by hydrostatic pressure, a process related to molecular crowding and microfilaments polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nunes et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Do large changes in hydrostatic pressure occur in the cochlea during physiological or pathological conditions? In the cochlea, large intercompartmental osmotic gradients from 289 to 322 mOsmol/kg H<sub>2</sub>0 are present between the perilymphatic and endolymphatic compartments, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sterkers et al., 1984</xref>).

The role of actin in the process of exocytosis is unknown for auditory hair cell ribbon synapses, although these synapses have an abundant supply of actin, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> of this paper. At other synapses, it is thought that actin modulates the process of exocytosis and the recruitment of vesicles to the readily releasable pool (RRP). The authors of this paper show that a 45-minute treatment with latrunculin-A, a drug that depolymerizes actin, increases the amount of exocytosis in hair cells. Interestingly, it also appears to allow Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to be located further away from the synaptic ribbon. It thus appears that actin is involved in stabilizing the exact localization of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at synaptic ribbon active zones. These are important and novel findings. They will be of interest to a wide audience of neuroscience and cell biology. I have only a few major concerns that need to be addressed:</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> the authors should state whether the level of peak free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration reached in both condition (control and latrunculin-A treated) was the same. If available, please show the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration levels in panel 2C.</p><p>2) Another way to quantify the inflexion point (or breaking-point) is to calculate the first derivative of the traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and then show a bar graph of the peak values of the first derivative. Is this what the authors have done? If not, I would like to see this also shown in panel 2D.</p><p>3) Changing the osmolarity of the internal solution 310 to 390 mOsm seems like a drastic change. Does this ever occur under physiological or pathological conditions? Please discuss this further.</p><p>4) Is there some particular physiological context where an osmolarity change from 310 to 390 can occur in the mammalian organ of Corti? Perhaps under pathological conditions? The authors need to discuss this more fully.</p><p>5) The increase in capacitance jumps with latrunculin-A seems to suggest that actin acts as a barrier that controls the trafficking of vesicles from the cytoplasm to the release sites near the synaptic ribbon. Electron-tomography evidence for actin and microtubules near the synaptic ribbon has been provided by Graydon et al. (JNeurosci., 2011; see their Figure 5B). This paper should be cited in the Introduction.</p><p>6) The level of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration reached in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and 4B</xref> should be mentioned in the text or the figure caption. Average numbers should be given in the text for this set of experiments.</p><p>7) Please cite and discuss a recent paper that shows how changes in external hypertonic stress affect vesicle mobility (see &quot;Ionic imbalance, in addition to molecular crowding, abates cytoskeletal dynamics and vesicle motility during hypertonic stress&quot;, by Nunes, P. et al. (PNAS, 2015). By contrast, the manipulations that the authors are performing may facilitate vesicle motility and thus increases in exocytosis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In the paper the authors present a fascinating series of observations linking an intracellular actin network to trafficking of synaptic vesicles, and potentially to changes in hydrostatic pressure. F-actin 'cages' appear to surround hair cell active zones. When cages are disrupted by latrunculin, the spacing of synaptic ribbons and calcium channel clusters is widened. Latrunculin treatment increases the voltage-evoked capacitance increase thought to reflect fusion of synaptic vesicles. Increased hydrostatic pressure also increased voltage-gated calcium current. Calcium-invoked capacitance increases are enhanced by increased hydrostatic pressure. This work raises many interesting questions. The initial observation of F-actin-dependent synaptic structure and function is significant and potentially quite important, particularly in view of the organized membranous domains of hair cells (see for example, Bullen et al., J Cell Sci. 2015 Jul 15;128(14):2529-40). A number of suggestions and questions follow:</p><p>1) Introduction, first paragraph: Introducing hair cells as 'highly sensitive barometers […]' in a paper that examines the effects of hydrostatic pressure might mislead many readers to think that the authors are suggesting that hair cells are stimulated by changes in hydrostatic pressure at acoustic frequencies. But of course the adequate stimulus is hair bundle displacement, not cytoplasmic pressure.</p><p>2) Results and Discussion, first paragraph – cages or cylinders? It’s not obvious from the images. Are these maximum intensity z-stack projections? We need more information in the figure legends.</p><p>3) Results and Discussion, second paragraph: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and 1D</xref> need re-labeling.</p><p>4) Results and Discussion, second paragraph: Can the authors provide an estimate of the number of vesicles per ribbon that make up the RRP? Does it make sense?</p><p>5) Results and Discussion, second paragraph: &quot;[…] a switch from nanodomain to microdomain […].&quot; This seems like an unwarranted throw away statement in this context. The capacitance change being measured occurs over 100 ms, effectively steady-state with respect to buffer effects. EGTA concentration could affect the extent to which neighboring calcium sources interact and summate to produce a global effect on free calcium – is that what the authors intend? Without further explanation this reference to nano/micro is irrelevant.</p><p>6) Results and Discussion, second paragraph: The authors refer here to &quot;number of docked vesicles at release sites&quot;, but later to &quot;diffusion rate of the synaptic vesicles to the sites of release&quot;. These are quite different mechanisms to explain the effect of latrunculin, with the second idea probably closer to reality. What is the authors' conclusion?</p><p>7) Results and Discussion, third paragraph: ~1.2 pF capacitance increase with increased pressure, approximately equivalent to the calcium-evoked capacitance increase in control and latrunculin-treated cells (0.9 to 1.4 pF), but – 30-40-fold greater than RRP. So presumably not just synaptic vesicles – what other organelles could be involved in these much larger membrane fusions?</p><p>8) Results and Discussion, third paragraph: could the authors clarify the reference to 'mechanosensitive' Cav1.3 channels. Is it just that calcium channels are added to the membrane during the massive vesicular fusion caused by increased hydrostatic pressure?</p><p>9) In the Results and Discussion, third paragraph, please rephrase the following passage: “Notably, a change in Ca<sup>2+</sup> current amplitude…”. The authors should replace “change” for “reduction”.</p><p>10) Results and Discussion, last paragraph: F-actin regulates vesicle trafficking by sensing and regulating focal changes in hydrostatic pressure? What are these 'focal changes in hydrostatic pressure'? How would these be generated?</p><p>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: provide hair cell outline in right hand panel at hi mag. Is this a z-axis projection? Also, panel B is mislabeled as panel C on figure. What are the large black holes at the bottom of latrunculin-treated IHCs? What are the dimensions of F-actin cages in latrunculin? Are these center-to-center distances of ribbon and CaV1.3?
