We used the lethality induced by chromosomal inactivation of the antitoxin to select mutations that suppress toxicity. We found that single point mutations are sufficient to allow cell survival. Mutations located either in the 5’ untranslated region or within the open reading frame of the toxin hamper its translation by stabilizing stem-loop structures that sequester the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. We propose that these short hairpins correspond to metastable structures that are transiently formed during transcription to avoid premature toxin expression.

In bacteria, a fine tuning of gene expression can be achieved at the translational level through the control of the accessibility of the ribosome binding site (RBS), which encompasses the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence and the start codon. Messenger RNA structures occluding the RBS have been reported to control the expression of many important genes for which a timely control is crucial. Regulation of translation initiation via SD-sequestration is an old theme that initially started with the study of bacteriophage genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Smit and van Duin, 1990</xref>) and ribosomal proteins (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duval et al., 2015</xref>). More recently, its impact on other bacterial genes such as sigma factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mearls et al., 2018</xref>) and translational riboswitches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rinaldi et al., 2016</xref>) has been reported.</p><p>Hence, in many cases, preventing gene expression via SD-sequence sequestration is crucial. This is particularly true for type I toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems. In contrast to the largest type II TA family, antitoxins belonging to type I TA systems do not directly interact with the toxin protein but rather prevent its expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harms et al., 2018</xref>). This regulation occurs through the direct base-pairing of the RNA antitoxin with the toxin mRNA and leads to toxin translation inhibition and/or mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brantl and Jahn, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Durand et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wen and Fozo, 2014</xref>). However, the action of the RNA antitoxin is often not sufficient to avoid toxin expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Masachis and Darfeuille, 2018</xref>). Indeed, due to the coupling between transcription and translation occurring in bacteria, translation of the nascent toxin mRNA can potentially occur before antitoxin action. Thus, a tight control of toxin synthesis is usually achieved via the direct sequestration of its SD sequence within stable stem-loop structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Masachis and Darfeuille, 2018</xref>). The existence of a non-translatable toxin primary transcript is a major hallmark of type I TA loci. In this transcript, the RBS occlusion occurs through the base-pairing of the SD sequence with a partially or totally complementary sequence termed anti-SD (aSD). Such aSD sequences are often located a few nucleotides (up to 11) upstream or downstream of the SD sequence and trap it within a hairpin structure. However, in some cases, RBS occlusion involves an aSD sequence encoded far downstream and is achieved via a long-distance interaction (LDI) between the 5’ and 3’ ends of the toxin mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gultyaev et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>This strategy of toxin expression regulation via the formation of a LDI has been recently described for a type I TA family of the <italic>Epsilon</italic> proteobacteria. This family, named <italic>aapA</italic>/IsoA, is present in several copies on the chromosome of the major human gastric pathogen <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>. We characterized the <italic>aapA1</italic>/IsoA1 TA system at the locus I and showed that the <italic>aapA1</italic> gene codes for a small toxic protein whose expression is repressed by a <italic>cis</italic>-overlapping antisense RNA, IsoA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnion et al., 2017</xref>). We have shown that transcription of this toxic gene generates a highly stable primary transcript whose translation is post-transcriptionally impeded by a 5’−3’ LDI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consequently, a 3’-end ribonucleolytic event, that we termed ‘mRNA activation step’, is necessary to remove the LDI, thus enabling toxin translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnion et al., 2017</xref>). We also showed that this peculiar mRNA folding is strongly conserved at various loci in other related bacterial species, clearly suggesting that this particular mode of control would also be conserved. However, several aspects of this regulation remain enigmatic. In particular, how can such a long-distance interaction prevent translation while the mRNA is being made? Indeed, in principle, the ribosome could bind to the nascent transcript, initiating toxin translation before the 3’ end is synthesized. Previous work has shown that in some cases, metastable structures are formed during mRNA transcription to prevent ribosome binding and avoid translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu and Meyer, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the present work, we aimed at deciphering further the mechanism of toxin regulation, studying another member of the <italic>aapA</italic>/IsoA family, <italic>aapA3</italic>/IsoA3. We first show that, in the absence of antitoxin expression, chromosomal toxin expression is lethal. Taking advantage of this lethal phenotype, we used a genetic approach to select suppressors allowing survival. This method, that we previously named FASTBAC-Seq for Functional AnalysiS of Toxin-antitoxin in BACteria by deep Sequencing, allows the mapping of intragenic toxicity suppressors within a given TA locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Masachis and Darfeuille, 2018</xref>). Applying FASTBAC-Seq to the <italic>aapA3</italic>/IsoA3 TA locus revealed that single point mutations are sufficient to counteract the lethality caused by the absence of antitoxin. Unexpectedly, one-third of suppressors mapped to non-coding regions of the toxin mRNA. Some of them target well-known regulatory elements, such as the toxin promoter and the SD sequence. Remarkably, we show that one of the suppressors located in the SD sequence does not act at the sequence level but at the mRNA structural level. Indeed, this mutation inhibits translation of the active mRNA by stabilizing an RNA hairpin in which the SD sequence is masked by an upstream-encoded aSD sequence (aSD1). A synonymous mutation within the Open Reading Frame (ORF) acts similarly but on another hairpin in which the SD sequence is masked by a downstream-encoded aSD (aSD2). These suppressor mutations reveal two transient hairpin structures that sequentially form during transcription and which are then replaced by a more stable LDI upon transcription termination. Our results indicate that, in addition to the post-transcriptional control achieved via a stable LDI, metastable structures are also required to prevent premature toxin expression in a co-transcriptional manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The small antisense RNA IsoA3 is essential to prevent AapA3 translation</title><p>We previously studied the regulation of <italic>aapA1</italic>/IsoA1, a member of the <italic>aapA</italic>/IsoA type I TA family recently identified in <italic>H. pylori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnion et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we studied the <italic>aapA3</italic>/IsoA3 module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; for sequence details see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Like other TA systems of this family, the <italic>aapA3</italic>/IsoA3 locus codes for an antisense RNA, IsoA3 (80 nucleotides), encoded on the opposite strand of a small ORF, AapA3. The AapA3 peptide (30 amino acids) shares 60% sequence identity with the AapA1 peptide, whose ectopic expression is toxic in <italic>H. pylori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnion et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we first investigated whether <italic>aapA3</italic> expression from the chromosome is toxic. For this purpose, we inactivated the antitoxin promoter by introducing two point mutations in its −10 box, while maintaining the amino acid sequence of the toxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, pIsoA3* in all figures), as previously described for the IsoA1 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnion et al., 2017</xref>). Insertion of these mutations on the chromosome was performed using a counter-selection cassette, which allows the generation of unmarked transformants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dailidiene et al., 2006</xref>). Briefly, the TA locus of a streptomycin-resistant <italic>H. pylori</italic> 26695 strain (K43R) was replaced by the <italic>rpsL<sub>Cj</sub>-erm</italic> double-marker cassette, giving rise to the streptomycin-sensitive Δ<italic>aapA3</italic>/IsoA3<italic>::rpsL<sub>Cj</sub>-erm</italic>/K43R strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Masachis and Darfeuille, 2018</xref>). Then, we performed gene replacement assays using PCR constructs carrying either a wild-type (WT) or an antitoxin-inactivated (pIsoA3*) TA locus. Strains that had undergone homologous recombination were selected on streptomycin. However, no transformants were obtained unless a non-sense or frameshift mutation was introduced in the <italic>aapA3</italic> ORF. This result indicated that, in the absence of IsoA3 synthesis, the AapA3 toxin expression from its chromosomal locus is constitutive and too toxic to obtain a viable strain.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47549.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>IsoA3 small RNA is essential to prevent AapA3 translation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Organization of the aapA3/IsoA3 locus in the H. pylori 26695 strain.

This latter was not detected in presence of IsoA3 RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lanes 1, 2, 5–8) and corresponds to the truncated mRNA species previously described for the <italic>aapA1</italic>/IsoA1 homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnion et al., 2017</xref>). Translation assays demonstrated that only the truncated mRNA is efficiently translated in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, lane 3).

Importantly, Northern blot analysis revealed that the absence of IsoA3 leads to the accumulation of <italic>aapA3</italic>-Tr without affecting the amount of <italic>aapA3</italic>-FL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> lanes 9–12), indicating that IsoA3 specifically targets <italic>aapA3</italic>-Tr in vivo.

This approach, called FASTBAC-Seq, has been described recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Masachis et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with the above-mentioned first transformation assay, deep-sequencing data analysis showed that 97.7% of the pIsoA3* transformants contained mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). A strong mutation rate (51.2%) was also observed with the WT PCR product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), which results from an unanticipated technical artifact linked to PCR amplification (see Material and methods section). Analysis of the number of mutations per read in the complete sequencing dataset (all replicates combined) showed that more than half of the pIsoA3* transformed clones (51.8% out of ~5.1 million) were mutated at a single nucleotide position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This result demonstrates that single point mutations are sufficient to abolish AapA3 toxin activity and/or expression. A low number of pIsoA3* transformants (2.3%) had a WT locus sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, pIsoA3* zero mutation), which can be explained by the sequencing error rate (around 1.5%) and/or suppressor mutations lying in regions outside the TA locus (i.e. outside the amplicon). Single-nucleotide mutations were mainly substitutions, which are favored by PCR biases. Only 4% were insertions and deletions (indels). Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that the location and frequency of single substitutions were highly similar in the three biological replicates, indicating that the locus coverage was close to optimum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Contrary to substitutions (which were found in both coding and non-coding regions), the single-nucleotide indels were almost exclusively present in the AapA3 ORF, generating truncated or longer forms of the peptide. Moreover, in some cases, they were not present in all three replicates, reflecting their under-representation in the PCR products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Expectedly, the highest mutation densities (defined as the number of mutated nucleotides divided by the total number of nucleotides in the region of interest) were observed in the AapA3 ORF (53%), and in well-known regulatory regions such as the −10 box of the toxin mRNA (66.7%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and the SD sequence (42.8%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). For the <italic>aapA3</italic> −10 box, out of the six positions (5’-TAGGAT-3’), suppressor mutations were mostly found in the first two and last nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This result allowed us to determine the minimal functional <italic>aapA3</italic> −10 box motif 5’-TANNNT-3’, which is in perfect agreement with the previously determined consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>). This result also confirmed that the arbitrarily-chosen False Discovery Rate cut-off (padj ≤0.05) was stringent enough to avoid false positives but permissive enough to allow the identification of suppressor substitutions. Remarkably, 17 mutations were unveiled in the 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions (UTR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Several of these point mutations created mismatch pairing, probably destabilizing two terminal stem-loop located at both ends of the active mRNA (<italic>aapA3</italic>-Tr) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Due to the lack of AapA3-targeting antibodies, its translation was assessed indirectly by polysome fractionation coupled to Northern blot analysis. As a control, we used a suppressor mutation isolated during our FASTBAC-Seq selection, which suppresses the toxin activity but not its expression. We thus generated a strain containing the pIsoA3* mutations in combination with a mutation in the toxin ORF converting a phenylalanine at position 19 (of the peptide) into a serine (T107C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Polysome fractionation of this strain confirmed that the toxin full-length mRNA (<italic>aapA3-FL</italic>) is mainly found in non-ribosomal fractions (only 3% present in polysomes, lanes 10 to 14 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> for quantification), whereas the truncated isoform (<italic>aapA3</italic>-Tr) is associated with the monosome and disome fractions (73% present in these fractions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The absence of the <italic>aapA3</italic>-Tr form in heavier polysomes is probably due to the short length of the ORF (90 nt), which cannot accommodate more than two ribosomes. This result clearly confirmed that the <italic>aapA3</italic>-FL is indeed a translationally inert isoform, whereas the <italic>aapA3</italic>-Tr is translationally active. Hence, polysome fractionation is a powerful tool to study translation efficiency of toxin mRNAs in vivo.</p><p>We then analyzed the efficiency of toxin mRNA translation in strains containing a mutation either in the start codon (<italic>start</italic>) or in the SD sequence (G43A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In both cases, the active mRNA isoform (<italic>aapA3</italic>-Tr) was nearly absent from the polysome fractions. Instead, significant levels of <italic>aapA3</italic>-Tr mRNA degradation products were detected in the top of the gradient, which may arise from the lack of ribosome protection and/or the extended time of sample collection and treatment prior to RNA extraction. The strong degradation observed for the <italic>start</italic> strain impeded the quantification of <italic>aapA3</italic>-Tr. For the G43A strain, the relative amount of <italic>aapA3</italic>-Tr mRNA in translating fractions was strongly reduced (approximately 4%, lanes 10 to 14, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>) compared to the T107C strain. This result confirmed that the single G43A mutation was sufficient to prevent ribosome binding, consequently impairing translation of the toxin. Remarkably, a similar result was observed for the A28C and A40T suppressor mutations. The A40T mutation had the strongest effect with only 7% of <italic>aapA3</italic>-Tr associated with translating ribosomes, compared to 19% for the A28C strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). In vitro translation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>) further confirmed that the A28C and A40T suppressor mutations, like the G43A mutant, act by reducing AapA3 translation efficiency.</p><p>Together, these results demonstrate that a single mutation within the 5’ UTR, either inside or outside the SD sequence, is able to overcome antitoxin absence by impeding toxin translation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The suppressor A28C and A40T mutations inhibit toxin translation by stabilizing a SD-sequestering hairpin</title><p>We next asked by which mechanism A28C and A40T mutations inhibit translation. Both substitutions lie in a single-stranded region upstream of the minimal SD sequence (5’-AGGA-3’), which may be crucial for translation initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, in both cases, a unique type of transversion mutation was selected (<italic>i.e.,</italic> A28T and A40C were not selected) suggesting that the mutations may act at the structure rather than at the primary sequence level. Indeed, secondary structure predictions with the RNAfold algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gruber et al., 2008</xref>) suggested that both mutations could stabilize a local hairpin in which the SD is sequestered by an upstream aSD sequence (anti-SD sequence 1 [aSD1], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Indeed, while the A28C suppressor transversion extended this hairpin by one G-C base-pair, the A40T mutation created two additional A-U base-pairs. To investigate whether this stabilization was responsible for the translation inhibition effect, we tested whether the combination of A40T and antagonist A33T mutations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), which is expected to destabilize the stem-loop, restored a toxic phenotype. Due to this potential toxicity, a strain containing an additional mutation in the AapA3 start codon was also generated (A33T/A40T/<italic>start</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Transformation assay was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As expected, the suppressor A40T mutation was not toxic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). However, a log-fold reduction of ~2 in the number of Str<sup>R</sup> transformants was observed with the A33T/A40T construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This effect disappeared when the toxin start codon was mutated (A33T/A40T/<italic>start</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) demonstrating that the toxicity comes from the AapA3 peptide synthesis. This approach could not be used to study the A28C suppressor mutation since the non-compensatory mutation would lie within the SD sequence. Therefore, we tested the SD accessibility for all mutants (A40T, A28C, A40T/A33T) in vitro by performing an RNase H/oligonucleotide assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We propose that they act as functional metastable structures (MeSt1 and MeSt2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), that is they form co-transcriptionally and sequentially to prevent premature toxin expression before a third aSD (aSD3) traps the <italic>aapA3</italic>-FL mRNA into a highly stable and translationally inert conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

This regulation is often achieved at the translation initiation step through the sequestration of the SD sequence in stable RNA hairpins that prevent ribosome binding to the RBS of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duval et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duval et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meyer, 2017b</xref>). Although recent advances using in vivo probing at the genome scale have confirmed that translation efficiency strongly correlates with the mRNA structure around the RBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mustoe et al., 2018</xref>), little is known about the influence of co-transcriptional folding on translation. Bacteria could, in principle, reduce or delay the translation of a specific mRNA by playing with its secondary structure while the mRNA is being made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu and Meyer, 2015</xref>). In this article, we identified two functional RNA hairpins within a type I toxin-encoding mRNA for which a tight control of translation is essential. We propose that these hairpins correspond to metastable structures that form sequentially and transiently to occlude SD accessibility during mRNA synthesis.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>FASTBAC-Seq uses toxin lethality to identify suppressor mutations</title><p>To date, most studies on TA systems, including our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnion et al., 2017</xref>), used artificial expression systems to characterize the effects of toxin expression. The use of such overexpression vectors is often a source of misinterpretations, as toxic proteins may not be found at such high concentrations under physiological conditions. To study the AapA3 toxin expression at the chromosomal level, we inactivated the endogenous IsoA3 antitoxin promoter as previously described for IsoA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnion et al., 2017</xref>). However, we were unable to obtain a viable strain without introducing additional mutations in the toxin-encoding gene. Suppressor mutations have been also reported in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> for two chromosomally encoded type I toxins with killer activity (<italic>txpA</italic>/RatA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Silvaggi et al., 2005</xref>] and <italic>bsrG</italic>/SR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jahn et al., 2012</xref>]). Strikingly, lethality at the chromosomal level has not been reported for chromosomally-encoded TA loci in Gram-negative bacteria. Indeed, the killer activity observed for the plasmid-encoded <italic>hok</italic>/Sok TA system was even believed to be not conserved for the chromosomally-encoded homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pedersen and Gerdes, 1999</xref>). Interestingly, most of the <italic>hok</italic>/Sok homologs (<italic>hokA</italic>, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>E</italic>) in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> are inactivated by the presence of insertion elements located close to the toxin ORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pedersen and Gerdes, 1999</xref>). This observation, together with studies showing a differential expression of several TA systems in response to various stresses (e.g. temperature shift, oxidative stress, starvation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harms et al., 2018</xref>), suggests that chromosomally-encoded TA systems may not be involved in a bactericidal activity, but rather, in a reversible growth arrest in response to a specific stress. Conversely, our results clearly demonstrate that, in line with the bactericidal activity observed for the overexpressed AapA1 toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnion et al., 2017</xref>), the chromosomal expression of the AapA3 toxin is constitutive and lethal in absence of the IsoA3 antitoxin. Consequently, we took advantage of this lethality to select suppressors and developed the FASTBAC-Seq method to rapidly identify hundreds of intragenic suppressor mutations with nucleotide resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Masachis et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A single-nucleotide substitution is sufficient to impede toxin translation</title><p>The FASTBAC-Seq method revealed a wide range of unanticipated <italic>cis</italic>-encoded toxicity determinants, affecting either the toxic activity of the protein (described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Masachis and Darfeuille, 2018</xref>), or its expression (this study). Among the mutations affecting the toxin mRNA expression, we identified five single-nucleotide substitutions able to inhibit the translation of the <italic>aapA3</italic> mRNA without affecting its stability. Three of them were located in the SD sequence. The most highly enriched mutations substituted the guanines at positions 42 and 43 by either an adenine, a cytosine, or a uracil. This revealed 5’-AGG-3’ and 5’–GGA-3’ as the minimal functional SD motifs allowing AapA3 translation, in agreement with the previously identified <italic>H. pylori</italic> SD consensus sequence (5’-AAGGA-3’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>). The third mutation (A40T) was much less enriched, and remarkably, only the transversion from an adenine to a thymine was selected. Another transversion mutation (A28C) was selected 14 nt upstream of the SD sequence. The fact that only transversion mutations were selected at these two positions indicated that the nature of the substituted nucleotide was important, suggesting that they may not directly act at the sequence, but rather at the structure level. Indeed, our results demonstrated that the A28C and A40T mutations create respectively one or two additional base-pair(s) within a stem-loop structure formed by the pairing between the SD sequence and an upstream complementary aSD sequence (aSD1, 5’-UCCU-3’). Destabilizing the A40T-mutated stem by mutating the complementary nucleotide (A33T) restored toxicity, clearly showing that the A40T mutation, despite being located within the SD sequence, acts at the mRNA structural level and not at the sequence level.</p><p>Interestingly, the T78C mutation revealed the existence of a second aSD sequence (aSD2) located downstream the SD sequence, within the toxin coding region. This synonymous substitution (UC<underline>U</underline>→UC<underline>C</underline>, Ser codon at position 9) creates a perfect aSD sequence (5’-CUCCU-3’). Although this mutation could potentially create a rare codon reducing toxin translation efficiency, we did not favor this hypothesis since the less frequently used Ser codon in <italic>H. pylori</italic> is UCG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lafay et al., 2000</xref>). Interestingly, synonymous mutations close to the translation initiation region (TIR) have been shown to influence gene expression by modulating the stability of mRNA folding rather than by acting at the codon usage level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kudla et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, a strong codon bias has also been observed within the first 15 codons, which avoids tight mRNA structure close to the TIR region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentele et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharyya et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we showed that despite the presence of up to thirteen CU-rich sequences in the <italic>aapA3</italic> mRNA, only mutations in the sequences closest to the SD could be selected, reflecting a distance-dependence of these translation regulatory elements. A similar aSD sequence (5’-UCCU-3’) has been identified in the coding sequence of the <italic>gnd</italic> gene in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carter-Muenchau and Wolf, 1989</xref>). Interestingly, displacing this aSD sequence from its natural position (codon 66) to a more proximal position (codon 13) greatly increased its capacity to inhibit translation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Suppressor mutations reveal functional metastable structures acting co-transcriptionally to impede premature toxin translation</title><p>The three mutations studied here (A28C, A40T and T78C) act post-transcriptionally after the 3’-end processing by stabilizing SD-sequestering hairpin structures. Importantly, these suppressor mutations do not interfere with the folding pathway of the full-length mRNA, neither affecting its transcription, stability, nor its 3’-end maturation, indicating that they exclusively act on the active, truncated, <italic>aapA3</italic> mRNA form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Interestingly, by using the KineFold software, these local hairpins were previously predicted to form during the co-transcriptional folding pathway of several <italic>aapA</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnion et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xayaphoummine et al., 2005</xref>). Now, our FASTBAC-seq approach reveals that these structures are functional, that is they transiently form during transcription to prevent toxin translation before the full-length transcript is completed. Indeed, stabilizing these hairpins inhibits translation of the <italic>aapA3</italic>-Tr form. This temporal control of gene expression is achieved through the sequential formation of two RNA hairpin structures that mask the SD sequence via CU-rich elements. In the full-length mRNA, these structures are replaced by a more stable one (aSD3) involving an LDI between both ends of the transcript. Similar to the <italic>hok</italic> mRNA, this final mRNA structure is so stable that its translational activation requires a 3’-end processing that removes the aSD3 sequence element. The highly stable structure of the <italic>aapA3</italic>-FL mRNA is also similar to the cloverleaf-like structure present in the 5’ UTR of the MS2 coliphage maturation gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Groeneveld et al., 1995</xref>). Interestingly, in this case, it may take up to several minutes for the mRNA to be synthesized and properly folded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van Meerten et al., 2001</xref>), explaining the need of functional transient structural intermediates preventing premature gene expression.</p><p>The selection of three stabilizing mutations suggests that the thermodynamic stability of such SD-sequestering stem-loops in the WT context is not sufficient to inhibit the translation of the active <italic>aapA3</italic> mRNA form. Instead, our results suggest that in the WT situation, these SD-sequestering hairpins (MeSt1 and MeSt2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) are only transiently formed to co-transcriptionally impede premature toxin translation. This transient character is essential to ensure the proper transcription termination and folding of the full-length mRNA, and this is achieved by hierarchically increasing thermodynamic stabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>). Importantly, the suppressor mutations do not provide enough stabilization to impede the formation of the next most stable structure. Indeed, the A40T-mutated MeSt1 has an energy of −21.10 kcal/mol, while that of the WT MeSt2 is −29.30 kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>). This may explain why the SD-sequestering mutations do not interfere with the co-transcriptional folding pathway and why the last SD-aSD3 pairing is finally formed in the mutants.</p><p>The importance of metastable structures in the <italic>aapA3</italic> mRNA is attested by the strict conservation of the UCU Serine codon at position 9. As our results have shown, a synonymous UCC codon at this position (T78C mutation) would inhibit AapA3 toxin expression, rendering the TA locus non-functional and probably promoting its rapid loss. Our study represents the first in vivo evidence of the existence of sequential RNA metastable structures that avoid, directly but transiently, the co-transcriptional translation of a toxin-encoding mRNA.</p><p>The formation of metastable structures has been reported in several RNA-mediated regulatory pathways, including viral RNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Repsilber et al., 1999</xref>), RNA catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pan and Woodson, 1998</xref>), RNA editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mazloomian and Meyer, 2015</xref>), and ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sharma et al., 2018</xref>). They are usually described as folding intermediates that work in a hierarchical manner to help an RNA molecule reaching its functional conformation (i.e. the most thermodynamically stable conformation). A nice example of such metastable structures has been reported for the regulation of the <italic>hok</italic>/Sok type I TA system in <italic>E. coli</italic>. In this pioneering work, the authors showed that the formation of a metastable hairpin ensures the proper folding of the Hok mRNA into a translationally inert conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Møller-Jensen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nagel et al., 1999</xref>). Although this metastable hairpin is located at the 5’ end of the mRNA, it does not directly mask the SD sequence. Instead, it favors a conformation in which the SD is sequestered by a downstream anti-SD. Other metastable structures are directly involved in the activation or inhibition of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu and Meyer, 2015</xref>), as examplified by the structures in the Trp operon leader, the SAM riboswitch and the 5’ UTR of the MS2 phage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu and Meyer, 2015</xref>). The metastable structures of <italic>aapA3</italic> are more reminiscent of the latter example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van Meerten et al., 2001</xref>), except that in the case of MS2, the transient structure allows translation to occur before the cloverleaf-like structure is formed. Nevertheless, in both cases, a functional transient RNA structure exerts a temporal control of translation, either negatively or positively.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although the coupling between transcription and translation in bacteria plays important roles in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kriner et al., 2016</xref>), it can be harmful in the case of toxin-encoding mRNAs. Thus, the metastable RNA structures identified in the present study are essential to uncouple transcription and translation processes and allow the presence of type I TA systems on bacterial chromosomes. Although transient RNA structures can be predicted in silico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meyer, 2017a</xref>), their in vivo characterization remains challenging. Several high-resolution methods have been recently devised for analyzing the co-transcriptional folding of regulatory RNAs, both in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Uhm et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Watters et al., 2016</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Incarnato et al., 2017</xref>). These complementary techniques may be useful to analyze the formation of these metastable hairpins in real-time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

bacterial growth was stopped at the desired OD<sub>600nm</sub> by adding 650 μl cold Stop Solution (95% ethanol, 5% phenol pH 4.5) to 5 ml of culture, which was placed on ice. Cells were then centrifuged for 10 min at 3,500 rpm and 4°C, and the pellets were stored at −80°C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 600 μl Lysis Solution (20 mM NaAc pH 5.2, 0.5% SDS, 1 mM EDTA) and added to 600 µl hot phenol pH 5.2. After incubation for 10 min at 65°C, the mixture was then centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm and room temperature. The aqueous phase was next transferred to a phase-locked gel tube (Eppendorf) with an equal volume of chloroform and centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm and room temperature. Total RNA was then precipitated from the aqueous phase by adding 2.5 volumes of ethanol 100% and 1/10 vol of 3 M NaAc pH 5.2. After centrifugation for 30 min at 13,000 rpm and 4°C, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was washed with 75% ethanol. Finally, the supernatant was discarded and the RNA pellet air-dried and resuspended in H<sub>2</sub>O. For RNA half-life determinations, rifampicin (Sigma, prepared at 34 mg.ml<sup>−1</sup> in methanol) was added to the culture at a final concentration of 80 µg.ml<sup>−1</sup> and cells were harvested at the desired time points. A culture where rifampicin was replaced by the same volume of methanol served as a non-treated control.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Northern blot</title><p>For Northern blot analysis, 1 to 10 μg RNA were separated on an 8% polyacrylamide (PAA), 7M urea, 1X Tris Borate EDTA (TBE) gel. RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, GE Healthcare Life Science) by electroblotting in TBE 1X at 8V and 4°C overnight. Then, RNA was cross-linked to the membrane by UV irradiation (302 nm) for 2 min in a UV-crosslinker and hybridized with 5’-labeled (γ<sup>32</sup>P) oligodeoxynucleotides in a modified Church Buffer (1 mM EDTA, 0.5 M NaPO<sub>4</sub> pH 7.2, 7% SDS) overnight at 42°C. Membranes were washed two times 5 min in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS, and revealed using a Pharos FX phosphorimager (Biorad). For riboprobes, a DNA template containing a T7 promoter sequence was amplified by PCR from <italic>H. pylori</italic> 26695 genomic DNA as template. In vitro transcription was performed as described in the MaxiScript T7 Transcription Kit (Ambion) in the presence of 50 µCi of <sup>32</sup>P-α-UTP and 1 mM cold UTP and purified on a Sephadex G25 column (GE Healthcare).

Reverse transcriptions were performed with Superscript II (Invitrogen, cat. 18064–022) at 42°C for 30 min. The extension products were then separated on 6% polyacrylamide/7 M urea gels and detected by autoradiography using a Pharos FX phosphorimager (Biorad). Sequencing reactions were carried out as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Darfeuille et al.

Then, reads having an average base quality lower than 28 were discarded using prinseq-lite 0.20.4 (‘-min_qual_mean 28’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmieder and Edwards, 2011</xref>). Read pairs for which both mates passed the quality filtering steps were recovered by means of cmpfastq (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://compbio.brc.iop.kcl.ac.uk/software/cmpfastq.php">http://compbio.brc.iop.kcl.ac.uk/software/cmpfastq.php</ext-link>), and mates were assembled into a single sequence using PANDAseq 2.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Masella et al., 2012</xref>) run with options ‘-N -o 30 -O 0 t 0.6 -A simple_bayesian -C empty’. About 5 million read pairs (combining the three biological replicates) could be assembled for the WT (<italic>aapA3</italic>/pIsoA3) and pIsoA3* (<italic>aapA3</italic>/pIsoA3*) samples. These assembled reads were aligned onto the 426-nt reference sequence from <italic>H. pylori</italic> 26695 by the BWA-SW algorithm of BWA 0.7.12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>) run with options ‘-a 1 -b 3 -q 5 r 2 -z 1’ to produce alignments in BAM format. Mapped sequences of length 426 showing a single substitution compared to the reference were then extracted using utilities from the samtools 1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2009</xref>) and bamtools 2.3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barnett et al., 2011</xref>) packages based on the various flags and tags in the BAM files (in particular the CIGAR string and NM tag). This gave a dataset of 1,653,406 WT and 2,559,164 pIsoA3* single-substitution sequences. Mapped sequences of length 425 and 427 harboring a single deletion or insertion, respectively, were also extracted (40,998 WT and 100,754 pIsoA3* single-deletion sequences; 4,799 WT and 7048 pIsoA3* single-insertion sequences).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses of the differential distribution of substitutions in the WT and pIsoA3* single-substitution sequences were carried out. To determine whether substitutions were enriched at particular positions in the pIsoA3* compared to WT sequences, a ‘positional’ analysis was conducted by summing together the counts of all sequences that showed a substitution at a given position, regardless of the identity of the substituted nucleotide. A ‘nucleotide-specific’ analysis comparing the amount of each individual sequence was also done to determine whether particular nucleotides were enriched at specific positions. As positions +87 and +90 were mutated to inactivate the IsoA3 promoter (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), for the ‘nucleotide-specific’ analysis all sequences showing a difference to the reference at one or both of these two positions were excluded from the pIsoA3* and WT datasets (11,319 pIsoA3* and 38,575 WT sequences, respectively), and the pIsoA3* reference was converted back to the WT reference in order to make data comparable between WT and pIsoA3* samples. Differential analyses were conducted following the protocol of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haas et al. (2013)</xref> using tools from the Trinity 2.2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haas et al., 2013</xref>) and DESeq2 1.10.1 packages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Love et al., 2014</xref>), taking into account variability among the three biological replicates. The sequence abundance estimation step was not performed; actual sequence counts were used. The four positions at each extremity of the 426-nt amplicon corresponding to pieces of the primers could not be included in the statistical analyses as there were no substitutions at these positions in any the WT and pIsoA3* replicates. Substitutions were considered as significantly over- or under-represented in the pIsoA3* vs. WT samples if the p-value adjusted for multiple testing (False Discovery Rate [FDR] calculated using the Benjamini-Hochberg [BH] method in DESeq2) was equal or lower than 5% (padj ≤0.05). Bar plots of normalized sequence counts and log2 ratios of fold change were drawn using R 3.2.0 (R Core Team, 2015. R: A language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.R-project.org/">http://www.R-project.org/</ext-link>). Similar ‘positional’ analyses were also carried out for single-insertion and single-deletion sequences to determine whether insertions or deletions were statistically enriched at particular positions in the pIsoA3* dataset.</p><p>For the ‘positional’ analysis, a heatmap and hierarchical tree clustering of samples according to sequence count patterns was also performed. This was based on TMM-normalized (trimmed mean of M values), median-centered, log2-transformed FPKM (fragment per kilobase per million reads mapped) values, computed according to the protocol and tools of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haas et al. (2013)</xref>. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used as distance metric and average linkage was chosen as clustering method (options ‘--sample_dist sample_cor --sample_cor pearson --sample_clust average’ for the ‘analyze_diff_expr.pl’ utility script). A log2 cut-off of 0 and a p-value cut-off of 1 were set (options ‘-C 0 P 1’) in order to include all sequence positions in the map. The clustering script ‘PtR’ was manually edited to suppress the clustering by sequence (i.e. rows) and sort the positions by numerical order instead.</p><p>Depending on the type of statistical analysis, ‘position-specific’ or ‘nucleotide-specific’, there were statistically enriched substitutions in absence of antitoxin (padj ≤0.05) at 70 or 72 positions within the <italic>aapA3</italic>/IsoA3 locus, respectively (65 positions in common between the two analyses). Substitutions identified in only one of the analyses included (relative to <italic>aapA3</italic> +1 TSS): i) positions −26 and −7 within the promoter region; ii) position +28 in the 5’ UTR; iii) positions +64 and +97 in the AapA3 ORF; and iv) positions +146 and +177 in the 3’ UTR. Such positions had generally a close-to-cut-off padj value, but not in all cases. For instance, position +28, which has been studied herein, had a highly significant padj value of 7.2 × 10<sup>−6</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Structural alignment and covariation analysis</title><p>To obtain further support for the proposed secondary structures, a phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide covariation in sequence alignments was carried out. A set of 107 AapA3 mRNA sequences from 55 <italic>Helicobacter</italic> genomes available in our T1TAdb database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://d-lab.arna.cnrs.fr/t1tadb">https://d-lab.arna.cnrs.fr/t1tadb</ext-link>) was retrieved. Significantly mutated sequences (annotated as ‘ghost’ or with a ‘*’ in T1TAdb) were not considered. In addition, strains corresponding to different isolates of other strains were discarded to avoid redundancy (i.e. Rif1 and Rif2, corresponding to 26695, BM012B and BM012S, corresponding to BM012A, and BM013B corresponding to BM013A). Using MAFFT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Katoh and Toh, 2008</xref>), a structural alignment was generated for two different transcript lengths (45 and 80 nucleotides) representing respectively the nascent AapA3 transcript extending up to the metastable structure 1 or 2. MAFFT was run in the ‘X-INS-I’ mode (‘mafft-xinsi’) with pairwise structural alignments computed by MXSCARNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tabei et al., 2008</xref>) (‘--scarnapair’ option) and a maximum of 1000 iterations (‘--maxiterate 1000’ option). Alignments were then manually slightly corrected. We used the secondary structures of AapA3 subsequences determined in vivo by DMS footprinting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), covariation was revealed by means of R-chie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lai et al., 2012</xref>). Options ‘--rule1=7’ (to obtain base-pair covariation scores) and ‘--group1=4’ (to group covarying base-pairs into four classes of scores) were set for R-chie.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Data availability</title><p>The deep-sequencing raw and analyzed datasets reported in this paper have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (NCBI GEO) data repository under the accession code GSE121423 and can be accessed at the URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE121423">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE121423.</ext-link></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank all present and past members of the ARNA laboratory for helpful discussions and in particular, Anaïs Le Rhun for critical reading of the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Kenn Gerdes (Reviewer #1) and Irmtraud Meyer (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Masachis, Darfeuille et al. analyse a type I toxin – antitoxin (TA) module of the major human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori (Hp). Expression of toxins encoded by Type I modules is controlled by small, labile, cis-encoded antisense RNAs and often also by complicated mRNA metabolism that involves conserved mRNA folding pathways and/or mRNA processing. Using a combination of elegant and robust in vitro and in vivo methods, the authors first show that the aapA3/IsoA3 TA system of Hp is regulated in a way very similar to that of the homologous aapA1/IsoA1 system from the same organism (Figures 1 and 2). This initial part of the manuscript sets the stage for the next step, where the authors employ a powerful genetic screen combined with deep sequencing to identify single nucleotide changes that abolish production of the AapA3 toxin (Figure 3). This principle, which was invented by the authors, is technically robust, intellectually attractive and very powerful, and may yield novel insights that at present cannot be reached by other approaches. In particular, the authors discover that single point mutations outside the toxin gene reading frame suppress toxin gene translation. Focusing on the translation initiation region, they discover two mRNA hairpin structures that, when stabilized by single base changes, reduce translation by preventing ribosome binding (Figures 4 – 6). They propose that these structures are metastable and form during transcription to keep the toxin translation-rate low, as explained in the model figure (Figure 7).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All of the reviewers thought the quality of the experimental work in the manuscript is outstanding and the conclusions are justified. However, all thought it would be nice to have additional evidence of the proposed metastable structures in the nascent toxin mRNA. While the reviewers understood this might be technically difficult, they agreed that it is worth a try and had the following suggestions.</p><p>1) Phylogeny (i.e. nucleotide co-variation in sequence alignments) was previously used to deduce the existence of stem-loop structures not only in ribosomal RNAs but also in mRNAs (e.g., hok mRNAs). Did the Authors consider using this approach to support the existence of the proposed metastable structures in the nascent toxin transcript? This possibility depends on the actual homologous sequences available and is not possible in all cases. If phylogeny indeed supports the existence of the metastable structures, the Authors could look for coupled nucleotide covariations that would support a conserved mRNA folding pathway (that is, one mRNA sequence elements pairs with two or more other elements during the fife-time of the mRNA). The authors state in the Discussion that &quot;these local hairpins were previously predicted to form during the co-transcriptional folding pathway of several AapA mRNAs (Arnion et al., 2017).&quot; However, they authors did not explain how these hairpins were predicted.

However, all thought it would be nice to have additional evidence of the proposed metastable structures in the nascent toxin mRNA. While the reviewers understood this might be technically difficult, they agreed that it is worth a try and had the following suggestions.</p><p>1) Phylogeny (i.e. nucleotide co-variation in sequence alignments) was previously used to deduce the existence of stem-loop structures not only in ribosomal RNAs but also in mRNAs (e.g., hok mRNAs). Did the Authors consider using this approach to support the existence of the proposed metastable structures in the nascent toxin transcript? This possibility depends on the actual homologous sequences available and is not possible in all cases. If phylogeny indeed supports the existence of the metastable structures, the Authors could look for coupled nucleotide covariations that would support a conserved mRNA folding pathway (that is, one mRNA sequence elements pairs with two or more other elements during the fife-time of the mRNA). The Authors state in the Discussion that &quot;these local hairpins were previously predicted to form during the co-transcriptional folding pathway of several AapA mRNAs (Arnion et al., 2017).&quot; However, they authors did not explain how these hairpins were predicted. It is worth explaining this central point.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we used a phylogenetic approach to analyze nucleotide co-variation in sequence alignments. For this analysis, we used 107 AapA3 mRNA sequences from 55 <italic>Helicobacter</italic> genomes available in our T1TAdb database (https://d-lab.arna.cnrs.fr/t1tadb). A structural alignment was carried out on two different transcript lengths (around 45 and 80 nucleotides) using MAFFT (Katoh and Toh, 2008), and then manually corrected. Covariation was revealed by means of R-chie (Lai et al., 2012). This analysis supports the secondary structure determined in vivo (see point 2 below) for both nascent mRNAs. The existence of both MeSt1 and MeSt2 metastable hairpins is very well supported by the nucleotide co-variation observed. These results are now presented in Figure 8—figure supplement 1 and discussed in the corresponding section. A complete and detailed description of this analysis can be found in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>Regarding the prediction of the metastable hairpins during co-transcriptional folding in our previous work, this was done using the KineFold software with default parameters (Xayaphoummine et al., 2005). This precision has now been included in the text.</p><p> <italic>2) Although transient structures are by definition hard to detect, the authors could try</italic> in vivo <italic>structure probing (DMS) of truncated mRNAs 1-64 and 1-90 to demonstrate the existence of the first and the second metastable structures, respectively.</italic> </p><p>To confirm the existence of the metastable structures, we used in vivo DMS footprint analysis, as suggested by the reviewers. We constructed two <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains that constitutively express the 1-60 or 1-90 aapA3 transcripts at the endogenous <italic>aapA3</italic> chromosomal locus. These truncated transcripts are expected to mimic the two nascent RNAs harboring the first and second metastable structure, respectively. These short transcripts were fused upstream of the well-characterized non-coding RNA RepG to ensure both their stability and a proper transcription termination. Northern blot analysis confirmed that these chimeric transcripts were stable and displayed a defined size (data not shown). We also constructed variant strains containing the A40T and T78C suppressor mutations that respectively stabilize the MeSt1 and MeSt2 structures. The four strains were treated with DMS and methylated nucleotides were detected by reverse transcription. As shown in Figure 8, the pattern of modification obtained fits very well with the predicted secondary structures, confirming that both MeSt1 and MeSt2 hairpins can form in vivo. These results definitely reinforce the conclusions of our work and they have now been included in the Results section (Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is preferable to carry out 2D structure predictions on the naturally occurring transcript, not a sub-sequence. 2D structure prediction generated by algorithms such as RNAfold (or Mfold) that are guided by δ-G stability optimisation are sensitive to the sequence context, so the correct sequence needs to be used to be able to draw conclusions.

A more detailed analysis of these mutations will be presented in a future manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
