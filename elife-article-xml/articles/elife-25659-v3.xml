to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis. Evidence suggests that APP intracellular domain (AICD) could regulate synapse function, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. We addressed AICD actions at synapses, per se, combining in vivo AICD expression, ex vivo AICD delivery or APP knock-down by in utero electroporation of shRNAs with whole-cell electrophysiology. We report a critical physiological role of AICD in controlling GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors (NMDARs) at immature excitatory synapses, via a transcription-dependent mechanism. We further show that AICD increase in mature neurons, as reported in AD, alters synaptic NMDAR composition to an immature-like GluN2B-rich profile. This disrupts synaptic signal integration, via over-activation of SK channels, and synapse plasticity, phenotypes rescued by GluN2B antagonism. We provide a new physiological role for AICD, which becomes pathological upon AICD increase in mature neurons. Thus, AICD could contribute to AD synaptic failure.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25659.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25659.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>APP</kwd><kwd>AICD</kwd><kwd>NMDA receptor</kwd><kwd>GluN2B</kwd><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd><kwd>Alzheimer's disease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pousinha</surname><given-names>Paula A</given-names></name><name><surname>Gwizdek</surname><given-names>Carole</given-names></name><name><surname>Dhib</surname><given-names>Gihen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPF20130526736</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pousinha</surname><given-names>Paula A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007494</institution-id><institution>Fondation Plan Alzheimer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior Innovative Grant 2010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mouska</surname><given-names>Xavier</given-names></name><name><surname>Raymond</surname><given-names>Elisabeth F</given-names></name><name><surname>Marie</surname><given-names>Hélène</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006331</institution-id><institution>Canceropôle PACA</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zaragosi</surname><given-names>Laure-Emmanuelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-INBS-09-03 ANR-10-INBS-09-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mouska</surname><given-names>Xavier</given-names></name><name><surname>Zaragosi</surname><given-names>Laure-Emmanuelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The APP intracellular domain (AICD) physiologically regulates synaptic GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor current, a process that could contribute to pathological Alzheimer's disease-related synaptic failure upon increase of AICD levels in adult neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human genetic evidence indicates that the amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays an important physiological role in the central nervous system and is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In humans, a polymorphism in APP that reduces APP processing protects from sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and normal aging-dependent decline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jonsson et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, mutations in APP and in genes that regulate APP processing are causative of AD pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Kant and Goldstein, 2015</xref>). APP is a transmembrane protein that undergoes extracellular cleavage by one of two activities, α- or β-secretase, resulting in the formation of large N-terminal extracellular fragments of secreted APP and smaller, membrane-bound C-terminal fragments. Subsequently, the membrane-retained C-terminal fragments are subjected to an intramembranous scission by the γ-secretase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wolfe et al., 1999</xref>) to generate the APP intracellular domain (AICD) and simultaneously release p3 (after α-secretase cleavage) or amyloid-β peptide (Aβ, after β-secretase cleavage). In collaboration with other teams, we also recently described a new secretase activity, called η-secretase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Willem et al., 2015</xref>). Cleavage by η–secretase occurs primarily at amino acids 504–505 of APP695 and releases a ~ 500 amino acid-long ectodomain and a membrane-bound fragment called CTF-η, which is further processed by α- and β- secretases to release a long and a short Aη peptide (Aη-α and Aη-β, respectively). Importantly, APP processing is regulated by synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kamenetz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cirrito et al., 2005</xref>) and one of the early neurochemical changes in AD is the dysfunction of cholinergic and glutamatergic synapses, which correlates with cognitive decline ante mortem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Selkoe, 2002</xref>). It is therefore necessary to elucidate the physiological role of APP at the synapse by clarifying which functions are mediated by APP itself and by its proteolytic cleavage products. These data will be crucial to better understand how changes in APP expression/ proteolytic processing contribute to synapse failure in AD pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Selkoe, 2002</xref>).</p><p>When studying APP function, a confounding factor is the presence of the functionally redundant APP-like protein-1 and -2 (APLP1 and APLP2), which display strong similarity to APP within the cytoplasmic domain. APLP1 and APLP2 are processed like APP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Müller and Zheng, 2012</xref>) and release intracellular peptides that, like AICD, can potentially regulate gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Scheinfeld et al., 2002</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that the APP intracellular domain might play a crucial role on synapse physiology, given that mice lacking the last 15 amino acids of APP (APP-CT15 domain) in an APLP2-KO background (APPΔCT15-DMs) present hippocampal synaptic deficits. In particular, these mice showed impaired long-term potentiation (LTP), apparently due to post-synaptic alterations, and deficits in spatial working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klevanski et al., 2015</xref>). Yet, the synaptic mechanisms associated to these synaptic and behavioral alterations have not been clarified. AICD is very short (~50 amino acids), but includes important sequence motifs and adapter protein-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>), raising the possibility that APP functions could be dictated by molecular interactions of AICD with cytoplasmic proteins at the membrane or after its release from the membrane by γ-secretase cleavage. This 6 kDa peptide is unstable, hence difficult to isolate and characterize biochemically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Belyaev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Flammang et al., 2012</xref>). However, studies on cells, in vitro, demonstrated that cleavage of APP in endosomes, through BACE1-dependent amyloidogenic processing, generates an AICD fragment capable of inducing nuclear signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goodger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kimberly et al., 2001</xref>). In line with these findings, AICD was shown to shuttle to the nucleus, via binding of the highly conserved YENPTY motif to the nuclear adaptor protein Fe65, but whether AICD harbors transcriptional activity remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao and Südhof, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao and Südhof, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Riese et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The fact that the APPΔCT15-DMs present synaptic deficits and that the AICD domain interacts with multiple cytoplasmic partners, presenting bioactivity, suggests that APP, via AICD, might regulate synapse function. To specifically confirm this hypothesis, we assessed the actions of AICD, per se, by using different technical approaches: in-vivo virus-mediated AICD expression, ex-vivo AICD peptide delivery and APP knock-down by in-vivo electroporation of shRNAs, in combination with whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology. We now report a critical and previously unrecognized role for AICD on controlling GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors (NMDARs) at CA1 excitatory synapses, via a transcription-dependent mechanism. In addition, we provide strong evidence that the increased presence of AICD in mature CA1 neurons, as previously reported in AD mouse models and human patients, alters their synaptic NMDAR profile to an immature-like phenotype with increased GluN2B-NMDAR contribution. This alteration leads to abnormal signal integration, via over-activation of SK channels, and impaired long-term potentiation (LTP), functional phenotypes that could be rescued by partial GluN2B antagonism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In vivo AICD production in the hippocampus</title><p>To investigate the actions of AICD, per se, on hippocampal synaptic function, we used in vivo transduction of neurotropic recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAV) encoding AICD. This approach enabled us to minimize other confounding factors such as concomitant increase of other bioactive APP fragments or genetically-induced compensatory effects observed when using transgenic models. The human AICD cDNA sequence was inserted in an AAV vector also expressing GFP (called hereafter AICD virus) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As AICD is unstable but probably harbors transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cupers et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pardossi-Piquard and Checler, 2012</xref>), we also created an AAV expressing AICD coupled to a nuclear localization signal (NLS) (called hereafter AICD-NLS virus) to potentiate nuclear AICD effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The AAV vector expressing only GFP was used as control (called hereafter GFP virus) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We optimized sparse transduction of CA1 pyramidal neurons, in vivo, by stereotaxic microinjections of these viruses into hippocampi of 21–22 days old rats. Twelve to twenty days post-injection, acute hippocampal slices were prepared and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained from CA1 transduced neurons (identified by GFP fluorescence) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To confirm increased AICD production in transduced neurons, we performed single cell quantitative PCR. On average, GFP mRNA expression was similar in GFP, AICD and AICD-NLS neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; left side of panel). As expected, increased expression of mRNA representing the C-terminal domain of APP was observed in AICD and AICD-NLS neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; right side of panel).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25659.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Construction and expression of AAVs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) AAV constructs: AICD or AICD-NLS were inserted downstream of the CMV promoter and β-globin intron and upstream of an IRES-GFP sequence.

We compared the relative contribution of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and NMDARs to excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) by measuring AMPAR/NMDAR ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>; one-way ANOVA). This ratio was significantly decreased in AICD neurons, an effect that was more pronounced in AICD-NLS neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting a nuclear-dependent effect. To confirm this finding, we created an AAV expressing AICD tagged with a nuclear export signal (NES) using the same AAV vector described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. Neurons transduced with AICD-NES presented an AMPAR/NMDAR ratio similar to GFP neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Phosphorylation of tyrosine 682 in the <sup>682</sup>YENPTY motif within AICD, which regulates binding of cytoplasmic proteins such as Fe65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grimm et al., 2013</xref>), was necessary for this synaptic phenotype. Indeed, we created an AAV expressing AICD with an Y682G mutation (same AAV vector as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and neurons expressing AICDY682G exhibited a normal AMPAR/NMDAR ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). APP, APLP1 and APLP2 exhibit some functional redundancy and their C-terminal domain is highly conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shariati and De Strooper, 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Kant and Goldstein, 2015</xref>). We thus tested if the C-terminal domains of APLP1 and APLP2 could also mediate this phenotype. For this, AAV expressing the last 50 amino acids of APLP1 and APLP2 were created (APLP1–ICD and APLP2-ICD, respectively). Interestingly, APLP2-ICD, but not APLP1-ICD, lowered the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Together, these data show that AICD, via its nuclear activity and phosphorylation of its tyrosine 682, affects excitatory post-synaptic transmission, a function also displayed by the APLP2 C-terminal domain, but not that of APLP1.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25659.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>AICD increases NMDAR, but not AMPAR, transmission in CA1 pyramidal neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scatter dot plot graph shows AMPAR/NMDAR ratios from GFP, AICD, AICD-NLS, AICD-NES, AICDY682G, APLP1-ICD and APLP2-ICD neurons, as indicated.

It does not indicate whether AMPARs, NMDARs, or both have been modified. To further characterize this phenotype, we first analysed the miniature AMPAR EPSCs (mEPSCs). One could observe similar amplitude and frequency of mEPSCs, suggesting that AICD does not affect AMPAR transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, one way ANOVA). We then performed pairwise comparison of AMPAR and NMDAR EPSC amplitudes by double patch clamp of infected and closely adjacent uninfected neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We focused on AICD-NLS neurons, which displayed the most significant reduction in the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio. AICD-NLS neurons exhibited unchanged AMPAR EPSCs, confirming the results obtained with AMPAR mEPSC analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>; matched-pairs Student’s t-test), whereas NMDAR EPSCs were markedly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, matched-pairs Student’s t-test).

To investigate if AICD-mediated alterations of NMDAR currents were due to modifications of NMDAR subunit composition, we measured the time constants for the fast, slow and weighted components (τ<sub>fast</sub>, τ<sub>slow</sub> and τ<sub>weighted</sub>) of NMDAR EPSC deactivation kinetics. AICD-NLS neurons exhibited a slower deactivation time course than GFP neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), an effect mediated by a significant increase in τ<sub>slow</sub> and τ<sub>weighted</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>; two-way ANOVA), without noticeable changes in τ<sub>fast</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>; two-way ANOVA). These results suggest that AICD causes alterations in NMDAR transmission due to an increase of synaptic GluN2B currents. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effect of the selective GluN2B inhibitor, ifenprodil, on NMDAR EPSCs. Ifenprodil (5 µM) significantly reduced NMDAR EPSC amplitude in AICD-NLS neurons, being much less effective in GFP neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>; one-way ANOVA).

We pre-incubated hippocampal slices with different doses of TAT-AICD-NLS (10, 30 or 100 nM), or vehicle (DMSO; point 0 nM on graph 3D) for at least 2 hr. We then measured the effect of ifenprodil on NMDAR EPSCs amplitude in CA1 pyramidal neurons.

Notably, doses as low as 30 nM were sufficient to reach maximal incorporation of GluN2B within synapses (~50% of NMDAR current) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This maximal effect was similar to that observed with two weeks in vivo expression of virally encoded AICD and was not observed with incubation of 100 nM of control peptide (scrAICD-NLS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, one-way ANOVA).

To confirm this hypothesis, we tested the effect of ifenprodil on slices pre-incubated in TAT-AICD-NLS together with inhibitors of protein transcription or translation, actinomycin or anisomycin, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, one-way ANOVA), TAT-AICD-NLS failed to increase synaptic GluN2B-NMDAR currents in the presence of these inhibitors, confirming that the effect of AICD on synaptic GluN2B-NMDAR is transcription and translation-dependent. In a control experiment, we confirmed that TAT-AICD-NLS is enriched in the nucleus compared to TAT-AICD-NES. As we could not obtain a selective antibody against TAT, we performed this experiment in a mouse neuroblastoma cell line in which APP is knocked out (N2a-APPKO; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>) to allow selective identification of exogenously applied TAT-AICD-NLS or TAT-AICD-NES using the APP antibody Y188.

The other in utero electroporated brains were used to measure NMDARs EPSCs, and effects of ifenprodil, in GFP positive CA1 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–H</xref>). Inactive shAPP did not affect the synaptic NMDAR function, as ifenprodil effect (~50%) was similar to what has been extensively described for immature neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,H</xref>) (for eg.

Thus, ex vivo delivery of nuclear AICD is sufficient to restore the physiological profile of GluN2B-NMDARs at immature synapses in the absence of APP. To determine if the actions of APP and AICD on GluN2B-NMDARs could be cumulative, in other words, if they could be related to different mechanisms, we investigated if the delivery of nuclear AICD (with TAT-AICD-NLS incubation) could further increase the contribution of GluN2B-NMDARs to NMDAR EPSCs on neurons expressing the control inactive shAPP.

Importantly, we could demonstrate that low nanomolar concentrations of TAT-AICD-NLS are enough to trigger this effect. We then asked if the amount of exogenous AICD, delivered to neurons upon 2 hr incubation of brain slices in TAT-AICD-NLS, is comparable to AICD physiological levels and if its addition to endogenous AICD levels could reach the level observed in an AD mouse model. To access the amount of TAT-AICD-NLS incorporated in the hippocampal cells, we pre-incubated hippocampal slices with TAT-AICD-NLS (100 nM) for two hours and then processed this tissue for western-blotting analysis. In each experiment, the TAT-AICD-NLS mass was calculated based on a dose-response calibration curve of known doses of TAT-AICD-NLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). As shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), the amount of TAT-AICD-NLS incorporated in hippocampal slices after 2 hr incubation was ~10 pg per µg of tissue lysate, which is approximately twofold the concentration we obtained for adult (5 months old WT) brain tissue lysate, representing adult physiological levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>).

Since the effect of AICD on synaptic GluN2B-NMDAR currents obtained with both exogenous delivery or in vivo viral-mediated expression was similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we decided to perform these experiments by using in vivo transduction of AICD or AICD-NLS or GFP viruses to allow neurons to remain in their natural environment during AICD expression and to avoid long pre-incubation periods before electrophysiological recordings. We challenged these neurons at different frequencies of stimulation. EPSPs triggered by 5 pulses at different frequencies (0.1, 1, 10 and 50 Hz) were recorded in GFP, AICD and AICD-NLS neurons. For the first three frequencies, we measured EPSP amplitude for each pulse. At 50 Hz, during which the neuron will discharge action potentials (APs), we measured the discharge probability. GFP, AICD and AICD-NLS neurons exhibited similar mean EPSP amplitudes at low frequencies (0.1 and 1 Hz) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>; two-way ANOVA multiple comparisons). At 10 Hz, however, AICD and AICD-NLS neurons exhibited a decrease in mean EPSP amplitude after the second pulse compared to GFP neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, two-way ANOVA multiple comparisons).

Intuitively, we did not expect that enhanced NMDAR function, observed in AICD neurons, could promote synaptic failure in a frequency-dependent manner. We, however, describe below how AICD-induced altered NMDARs currents affect the small-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated potassium channels (SK), which are at the origin of this failure.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25659.008</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Synaptic signal integration and discharge probability are perturbed in AICD neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A, B and C</bold>) Panels show absolute amplitude values of five consecutive EPSPs induced at the following frequencies: (<bold>A</bold>) 0.1 Hz, (<bold>B</bold>) 1 Hz, (<bold>C</bold>) 10 Hz.

Synaptic SK2 channels and NMDARs colocalize within 25–50 nm in the post-synaptic densities of CA1 pyramidal neurons. This SK2-NMDAR coupling allows for a tight negative regulation of NMDAR effects in spines, favoring rapid Mg<sup>2+</sup> reblocking of NMDARs, thus limiting the amplitude of synaptic potentials and reducing Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, especially for stimulation frequencies higher than 5 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stackman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mateos-Aparicio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hammond et al., 2006</xref>). As NMDAR function is strongly enhanced in AICD neurons, we hypothesized that this could over-activate SK channels. We tested the effect of apamin, a specific antagonist of SK channels, on the amplitude of EPSPs in both GFP and AICD-NLS neurons. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and C</xref>, apamin (100 nM) increased the mean amplitude of EPSPs in GFP neurons, as previously reported by others at this synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ngo-Anh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hammond et al., 2006</xref>). Apamin-induced potentiation of neurons was significantly stronger in AICD-NLS than in GFP neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>; two-way ANOVA). Moreover, blocking GluN2B with ifenprodil (5 µM) completely abolished this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>; two-way ANOVA). We thus evidenced over-activation of synaptic SK channels in AICD neurons due to excessive presence of GluN2B-NMDARs. We next asked if we could normalize the signal integration at 10 Hz frequency and above by blocking SK channels or GluN2B-NMDARs. As illustrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D–G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, two-way ANOVA and multiple comparisons), these phenotypes were rescued by partial blockade of GluN2B-NMDARs with ifenprodil (300 nM) or blockade of SK channels with apamin (100 nM). Together, these results show that increasing AICD production alters synaptic signal integration and AP discharge probability at 10 Hz frequencies and above, impairment due to excessive GluN2B-NMDARs and SK channel functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>LTP, but not LTD, is impaired in AICD neurons, a phenotype rescued by partial blockade of GluN2B subunits</title><p>The AICD-dependent synaptic signal integration and discharge probability alterations are likely to strongly perturb NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity, especially LTP, which is evoked by high frequency stimulation.

Additional analysis of EPSC slopes during LTD and LTP induction in GFP and AICD-NLS neurons confirmed this finding.

As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Foster et al., 2010</xref>), ifenprodil dose-dependently inhibited LTP in GFP neurons, with a maximal efficacy observed within the micromolar range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> ; two-way ANOVA).

In addition, we provide strong evidence that an increase of AICD in mature neurons, similar to levels observed in AD mouse models, can modify their synaptic NMDAR profile to an immature-like phenotype, with increased contribution of GluN2B-NMDAR. This over-activates SK channels, disrupting integration of synaptic signals in a frequency-dependent manner, thus compromising LTP, but not L</p><p>The evidence that AICD alters the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio confirms our hypothesis that AICD regulates synaptic transmission at CA1 excitatory synapses. Moreover, in the electrophysiological measures where AICD and AICDN-NLS were compared, AICD displayed a similar phenotype, albeit sometimes less pronounced, than AICD-NLS and expelling AICD from the nucleus by tagging it with a NES, completely prevented AICD effects on glutamatergic transmission. We, therefore, conclude that AICD exerts its effect at synapses via a nuclear-dependent mechanism. Accordingly, there is evidence that AICD is stabilized by the nuclear adaptor protein Fe65, which enables AICD to translocate to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kimberly et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cupers et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, a single Tyr(682) to Gly (Y682G) mutation in the AICD construct was sufficient to prevent AICD-dependent synaptic actions. Since this conserved Tyr(682) residue is a docking site for several cytoplasmic partners, such as Fe65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grimm et al., 2013</xref>), one might postulate that the absence of AICDY682G action could be due to its inability to translocate to the nucleus. Interestingly, although the YENPTY motif is present in the three members of the APP family, APLP2-ICD, but not APLP1-ICD, could mimic the synaptic phenotype. These data further support the well-documented functional redundancy between APP and APLP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shariati and De Strooper, 2013</xref>). Of note, APLP2 more readily co-localizes than APLP1 with APP in intracellular compartments such as endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaden et al., 2009</xref>). Also, APP and APLP2, but not APLP1, harbor a phosphorylation-dependent Pin1-binding site, which is implicated in APP C-terminal conformation and in Fe65 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Kant and Goldstein, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pastorino et al., 2006</xref>). Together, these observations could explain why, although all three APP family members contain the YENPTY motif, only APLP2-ICD mimics the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio phenotype. Interestingly, with regards to the experiments performed on <italic>in utero</italic> electroporated mice, the lack of AICD in APP KD neurons was not compensated by endogenous APLP2. Recently, Callahan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Callahan et al., 2017</xref>) generated and characterized an APP conditional knockout mice (APPflox), where deletion of APP is tamoxifen-inducible, to allow for clarification of the discrepancy in results observed between shRNA-induced APP reduction and germline APP knockout data. In accordance with our data, these authors could show that knocking down APP during a particular developmental window does not permit compensation by other APP family members, thus uncovering APP physiological roles that are otherwise masked by compensation in germline APP KOs.</p><p>As the vast majority of studies on APP have focused on its role for AD pathogenesis, its physiological function still remains elusive. Using neuron cultures, two studies had suggested a functional relationship between APP and NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cousins et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoe et al., 2009</xref>). Also, the developmental role of APP in mammalian development persists after birth, as APP expression levels peak in the second post-natal week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Löffler and Huber, 1992</xref>). Strikingly, it coincides with the timing of the NMDAR developmental switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Williams et al., 1993</xref>), suggesting that APP might play a role in this process. To our knowledge, our study is the first in vivo demonstration showing a crucial physiological role of APP in controlling synaptic GluN2B-NMDARs and AICD as the mediator of this control. This finding is in apparent disagreement with the observation reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoe et al. (2009)</xref> where addition of the β-secretase-derived βAPP fragment (C99), precursor of Aβ and AICD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wolfe et al., 1999</xref>), decreased NMDAR currents. These opposite effects may be due to concomitant generation of Aβ, which was shown to decrease synaptic NMDARs in cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Snyder et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoe et al. (2009)</xref> suggested that APP enhanced GluN2B-NMDARs by decreasing receptor internalization, but the authors did not clarify the mechanism. Also, it was shown that the APP intracellular domain associated-1 protein (AIDA-1) is implicated in endoplasmic reticulum export of GluN2B-containing NMDARs to synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tindi et al., 2015</xref>) and that over-expression of APP resulted in enhanced cell surface NMDAR expression, which was not GluN2-subunit specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cousins et al., 2009</xref>), an effect that was also observed with over-expression of APLP1 and APLP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cousins et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting an implication of the highly conserved intracellular domain in the control of NMDAR function. Yet, none of these studies showed if the APP/NMDAR interaction is direct or mediated via an intermediary protein and/or cascade of events. The assembly of our results supports a transcription-dependent mechanism, as AICD’s effect on synaptic GluN2B-NMDAR currents was not observed if AICD was coupled to a nuclear export signal and was prevented by both mRNA translation and gene transcription inhibitors. Importantly, an increase in AICD levels correlated with an increase of GluN2B mRNA levels.</p><p>Several human studies have linked APP over-expression and alterations in APP processing to synaptic dysfunction and/or cognitive deficits. This is observed in trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McCarron et al., 2014</xref>), and trisomy 16 in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cataldo et al., 2003</xref>), where an additional copy of the chromosome harboring APP is found. It is also true for rare familial autosomal dominant AD cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rovelet-Lecrux et al., 2006</xref>) and de novo genetic variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rovelet-Lecrux et al., 2015</xref>), where duplication of the APP locus has occurred. In these contexts, APP over-expression will lead to increased production of the different proteolytic products, including AICD. Also, autosomal dominant genetic mutations observed in familial AD cases (e.g. KM670/671 NL Swedish mutation, A673V mutation; E682K Leuven mutation) and susceptibility loci discovered through genome-wide association studies (e.g. ATXN1) point to increased processing of APP via the amyloidogenic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Citron et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Fede et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertram et al., 2010</xref>), leading to an increase of APP products. Accordingly, besides Aβ, AICD and other APP fragments accumulate in brains from individuals with Trisomy 21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sun et al., 2006</xref>), in brains of humans diagnosed with AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Willem et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ghosal et al., 2009</xref>) and in APP over-expressing AD mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Willem et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lauritzen et al., 2012</xref>). It is therefore important to discriminate the contributions of the different APP fragments to the synaptic dysfunction observed in these scenarios. AICD has generally not been considered to participate in AD-associated synaptic failure. This is partly due to the lack of strong evidence demonstrating accumulation of AICD in human brains. However, it is well known that AICD is difficult to detect biochemically and unstable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hébert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giliberto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Waldron et al., 2008</xref>) and accumulation of this peptide is unlikely to occur even in disease conditions. Yet, according to our data, low nanomolar concentrations of AICD are sufficient to alter levels of synaptic GluN2B-NMDARs. We thus suggest that AICD does not need to accumulate to disrupt synapse function under pathological conditions. Notably, AICD could participate in excessive NMDAR function observed in APP over-expressing and presenilin mutant mouse models of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marchetti and Marie, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaczorowski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lanté et al., 2015</xref>). An AICD-dependant mechanism could also be the target of the NMDAR-GluN2B antagonist memantine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xia et al., 2010</xref>) commonly used for more than a decade to prevent declines in cognition, behavior and autonomy in AD patients, albeit with modest efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matsunaga et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our findings clearly support a crucial physiological role of AICD in the control of NMDAR function at synapses.

For all other experiments where the outcome could be predicted that is, existing previous literature already describing expected effect (e.g. ifenprodil effect in PND7 and PND30 in wild-type rodent) or if our own data within this study strongly suggested outcome (e.g. no perturbation of LTD but LTP impairment because of disrupted synaptic signal integration at high stimulation frequencies), we planned experiments on a minimum of 3 independent animals and 4 cells. On average, we replicated our findings in independent 5 animals and 10 cells per condition (see full numbers in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Wilcoxon matched pairs were performed to analyze significance between the simultaneous responses recorded from uninfected (considered 100%) and its neighbor infected neuron. Student’s t-test and Mann Whitney test were performed whenever two conditions were compared, according to the samples distribution normality. One factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to analyze significance among the different conditions. In studies where drug effects were evaluated, two factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to detect interaction between treatment and cell type.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Stefan Kins (Technische Universität Kaiserslautern, Germany) for APLP1 and APLP2 cDNAs. pAAV-Syn-GFP was a gift from Edward Boyden (Addgene plasmid # 58867).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ilya Bezprozvanny (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Pousinha et al. investigated the role of APP intracellular domain (AICD) in regulating the basal transmission and long-term synaptic plasticity at the glutamatergic CA3-CA1 hippocampal synapses. The authors report that AICD specifically alters GluN2B-NMDAR transmission and NMDAR-dependent synaptic long-term potentiation. To this end, the authors used a combination of molecular tools to manipulate peptide expression in vivo and ex vivo and electrophysiological recordings. They further show that enhanced NR2B function leads to enhanced coupling with SK2 channels, which in turn causes disruption in synaptic signal integration. This is a very interesting study that tackles an important aspect of the APP functions at excitatory synapses. However, a biological role (or even presence of substantial amounts) remains elusive. The authors should provide additional evidence to support physiological relevance of their findings.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Physiological relevance:</p><p>The authors provide little, if any, evidence that the AICD peptide (not only the mRNA) is indeed present in the cytoplasmic and/or dendritic compartments, and that the AICD-NLS peptide is enriched within the nucleus.

Are they comparable?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25659.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Physiological relevance:</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors provide little, if any, evidence that the AICD peptide (not only the mRNA) is indeed present in the cytoplasmic and/or dendritic compartments, and that the AICD-NLS peptide is enriched within the nucleus.</italic> </p><p>For immunohistochemistry, the currently available commercial antibodies against the C-terminal domain of APP do not permit to distinguish between full-length APP, CTFs or AICD nor to distinguish between endogenous AICD and synthetic AICD peptides. In an effort to specifically analyze the localization of the synthetic AICD peptide, we tried the two commercially available antibodies against the TAT sequence that was introduced in the synthetic AICD peptide, but none recognized this TAT sequence successfully (data not shown). We thus decided to work in an APP knock-out background and to use the Y188 antibody recognizing the c-terminal domain APP. We used N2a cells that were KO for APP (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). We first performed a localization study of our virally-encoded AICD and mutants. However, unfortunately, these N2a cells were not efficiently transduced by our AAV viruses expressing the different mutants of AICD (data not shown). These cells were however efficiently penetrated by the synthetic peptides expressing TAT. We thus could show that TAT-AICD-NLS is indeed enriched in the nucleus (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G, H</xref>). We compared this nucleus/cytoplasm ratio to the one obtained in N2a APP KO cells incubated in the newly synthesized TAT-AICD-NES, demonstrating that, in presence of NLS, there is an enrichment of this peptide in the nucleus, comparing to TAT-AICD-NES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H, I</xref>).</p><p>This new data has been described in the main text of the manuscript: “In a control experiment … compared to TAT-AICD-NES”.</p><p><italic>How is amount of AICD present in neurons under normal physiological conditions comparable to 30 nM of TAT-AICD-NLS peptide, the concentration altering NR2B receptor function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</italic> </p><p>As suggested by the reviewers (see also point 3 of major revisions below), we now introduced a new section in the Results “Physiological and pathological levels of AICD in brain tissue”, dedicated to the analysis of AICD levels. We first quantified the TAT-AICD-NLS levels incorporated in cells after pre-incubation of hippocampal slices with TAT-AICD-NLS (100 nM) for two hours. We decided to use the 100 nM concentration for this quantification, because most of our experiments and controls have been performed at this concentration. This tissue was then processed for western-blotting analysis. In each experiment, the TAT-AICD-NLS mass was calculated based on a dose-response calibration curve of known doses of TAT-AICD-NLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) (see Materials and methods, subsection “Immunoblotting” for details). To allow a comparison between this result and the endogenous physiological and pathological AICD levels, we quantified the AICD levels in the Tg2576 AD mouse model brains, at an early symptomatic age (5 month old) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B-C</xref>), and their respective age-matched wild type littermates (WT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C</xref>). We could clearly observe an approximately fivefold increase of AICD in Tg2576 brains, when comparing to the adult physiological controls. Importantly, this quantitative analysis demonstrates that the addition of TAT-AICD-NLS to endogenous AICD levels in mature neurons (adult physiological AICD levels + TAT-AICD-NLS levels) could reach an AICD concentration in the range of values observed in the Tg2576 AD mouse model.</p><p>This new data has been described in the main text of the manuscript: “Our data… observed in AD” and a dedicated figure was added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows that knockdown of APP by shAPP causes complete disappearance of ifenprodil-sensitive component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, 4D</xref>). a) Quantification should be provided for both, immunoblot and the immunocytochemical evidence.</italic> </p><p>We have now provided quantification of effective down-regulation of APP expression by the active shRNA against APP (shAPP active) in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and in slices after in utero electroporation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) (see also subsection “APP knock-down eliminates synaptic GluN2B NMDARs, an effect rescued by nuclear AICD delivery”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>b) It is expected that APLP2-ICD should compensate for the lack of AICD in APP KD neurons (based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Why this is not happening?</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting observation. Recently, Callahan et al. (Callahan et al. 2017) generated and characterized an APP conditional knockout mice (APPflox), where deletion of APP is tamoxifen-inducible to allow for clarification of the discrepancy in results observed between shRNA-induced APP reduction and germline APP knockout data. In accordance with our data, these authors could show that knocking down APP during a particular developmental window does not permit compensation by other APP family members, thus uncovering APP physiological roles that are otherwise masked by compensation in germline APP KOs. We have now added this point to our Discussion and the reference to the main manuscript (Discussion, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) Mechanism of AICD effects:</italic> </p><p><italic>Nuclear targeting is essential for effects on NMDA currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Additional control is to test effects of inhibitors of protein transcription and translation. Is synthesis of new proteins necessary for AICD effects on NMDARs?</italic> </p><p>We have now added the results obtained with the newly synthesized TAT-AICD-NES peptide control. We observed that AICD, when coupled to NES, is unable to significantly increase synaptic GluN2B-NMDAR currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We also tested the effects of the transcription inhibitor, actinomycin, and the translation inhibitor, anisomycin. Both prevented the actions of TAT-AICD-NLS peptide on GluN2B currents (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), demonstrating that AICD exerts its effect via a gene transcription and protein translation dependent-mechanism.</p><p>This new data has been described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and the main text of the manuscript: “To confirm… is transcription-dependent”. It is also briefly discussed in the Discussion: “The assembly of … transcription inhibitors”.</p><p><italic>The authors propose that AICD action starts at the transcriptional level. Accordingly, the transcription of GluN2B itself and/or the transcription of other genes involved in the expression and/or trafficking of GluN2B should be increased.

Unfortunately, while this approach worked well for over-expressed cDNA of GFP and AICD, the variability was too high for adequate quantification of this endogenous gene. As an alternative, we constructed new high titer AAVs encoding GFP or AICD together with GFP under the synapsin promoter (called synGFP and synAICD viruses; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) to direct specific expression of AICD cDNA (without NLS) in neurons with high transduction efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We micro-dissected hippocampi regions highly transduced by synGFP or synAICD for quantitative PCR analysis. As expected, AICD expression was increased in SynAICD-expressing hippocampi compared to synGFP transduced tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Importantly, SynAICD-expressing hippocampi displayed a significant increase in endogenous GluN2B mRNA levels compared to synGFP-expressing hippocampi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), demonstrating that increasing AICD levels correlates with increased Grin2b expression.</p><p>This new data constitutes a new Results section “AICD regulates GluN2B mRNA levels” and has been described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and in the main text of the manuscript: “Our data… Grin2b expression”. It is also briefly discussed in the Discussion: “Importantly,… GluN2B mRNA levels”. Full investigation of the underlying molecular mechanism linking nuclear AICD to Grin2b expression levels will be the subject of a future study.</p><p><italic>3) Relevance to Alzheimer's pathophysiology: The authors state that they observed increased AICD in neurons from Tg2576 mouse model (data not shown).
