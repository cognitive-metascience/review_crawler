lysosomes (LE/Lys) is crucial for proper axon growth. However, the role of energetic nutrients has been poorly explored. Malonyl-CoA is a precursor of fatty acids, and its intracellular levels highly fluctuate depending on glucose availability or the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). We demonstrate in HeLa cells that carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1C (CPT1C) senses malonyl-CoA and enhances LE/Lys anterograde transport by interacting with the endoplasmic reticulum protein protrudin and facilitating the transfer of Kinesin-1 from protrudin to LE/Lys. In cultured mouse cortical neurons, glucose deprivation, pharmacological activation of AMPK or inhibition of malonyl-CoA synthesis decreases LE/Lys abundance at the axon terminal, and shortens axon length in a CPT1C-dependent manner. These results identify CPT1C as a new regulator of anterograde LE/Lys transport in response to malonyl-CoA changes, and give insight into how axon growth is controlled by nutrients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>malonyl-CoA</kwd><kwd>axon growth</kwd><kwd>late endosome/lysosome</kwd><kwd>carnitine palmitoyltransferase

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During the development of the nervous system, axon growth and guidance is known to be tightly regulated by soluble guidance cues, such as semaphorines, ephrins, etc., but also by the proper regulation of intracellular transport of molecules and organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tymanskyj et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to the recycling endosomes, late endosomes/lysosomes (LE/Lys) can also be recycled to the cell surface in sites of protrusion formation to provide extra membrane for neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Raiborg et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, the role of protrudin in protrusion growth in neurons and other cells has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Raiborg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shirane and Nakayama, 2006</xref>). Protrudin is an ER integral membrane protein that interacts with the GTPase Rab7 and phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) at the LE/Ly membrane and transfers kinesin-1 to the Rab7-associated FYCO1 to mediate plus-end microtubule based transport of LE/Lys. Interestingly, LE/Lys contact the ER repeatedly during their anterograde movement suggesting the existence of some kind of check-point regulation at ER-LE contact sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wijdeven et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, amino acids have recently been described to play a regulatory role. In sufficient nutrient conditions, the presence of amino acids facilitates protrudin-mediated translocation of LE/Lys to the cell periphery for mTORC1 activation, and consequently, for protein synthesis and cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hong et al., 2017</xref>). By contrast, when amino acids are not available, LE/Lys cluster in the perinuclear area in order to fuse with autophagosomes and replenish the cell with amino acids derived from the digestion of damaged organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cabukusta and Neefjes, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Korolchuk et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, cholesterol has been demonstrated to be a regulator of the minus-end transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rocha et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wijdeven et al., 2015</xref>). High endosomal cholesterol levels, promote minus-end transport of LE/Lys, whereas under low-endosomal cholesterol conditions, the cholesterol sensing protein ORP1L at the LE/Ly membrane changes its conformation and favours the establishment of extensive ER-LE/Ly contact sites and the release of the minus-end-directed motor complex dynactin-dynein, which stops the retrograde transport. Collectively, data indicate that amino acids and cholesterol are distinct regulators of LE/Lys position and motility.</p><p>Even though axon growth is a highly energy-consuming process, no regulatory role has been assigned to the energetic nutrients par excellence, glucose and fatty acids, on LE/Lys transport. Moreover, metabolic stresses that regulate axon growth are poorly understood. It is known that the master energy sensor 5′-AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates axon growth in developing neurons. AMPK is activated to maintain cellular energy homeostasis by switching off ATP-consuming processes. Specifically during neuron development, activated AMPK phosphorylates the motor protein KIF5 preventing PI3K transport to the axon tip, necessary for axon growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amato et al., 2011</xref>). However, the roles of other well know down-stream effectors of the AMPK pathway, such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), have not been studied. ACC synthesizes malonyl-CoA, the precursor of fatty acids, when glucose is abundant in the culture media. By contrast, in energy stressful conditions, AMPK phosphorylates and inhibits ACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hardie and Pan, 2002</xref>). In consequence, malonyl-CoA levels highly fluctuate depending on the energy status of the cell, being high after feeding and low upon fasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tokutake et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tokutake et al., 2010</xref>). Since malonyl-CoA is in the crossroad of fatty acids and glucose metabolism, it emerges as an interesting metabolite to be considered as a putative regulator of LE/Lys transport.</p><p>On the other hand, malonyl-CoA is the physiological regulator of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), the rate-limiting enzyme of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Saggerson, 2008</xref>). Interestingly, the neuron-specific CPT1 isoform, CPT1C, is thought to be a pseudoenzyme because it is localized to the ER, and has minimal catalytic activity compared to the mitochondrial isoforms CPT1A and CPT1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sierra et al., 2008</xref>). Since CPT1C maintains the ability to bind malonyl-CoA, we and other groups have postulated that CPT1C could behave as a sensor of malonyl-CoA in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Price et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wolfgang and Lane, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Casals et al., 2016</xref>). The development of Cpt1c knock-out (KO) mice has shed light on the physiological role of CPT1C in neurons. <italic>Cpt1c</italic> KO mice show motor function deficits, such as ataxia, dyscoordination, and muscle weakness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carrasco et al., 2013</xref>), in addition to learning deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carrasco et al., 2012</xref>) and impaired hypothalamic control of body energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Casals et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pozo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rodríguez-Rodríguez et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, the unique two CPT1C mutations described in humans to date have been associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rinaldi et al., 2015</xref>). HSPs are a group of inherited neurological disorders characterized by slowly progressive weakness and spasticity of the muscles of the legs, caused by axonopathy of corticospinal motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blackstone et al., 2011</xref>). Of note, Impairment in organelle transport along the axon is a common trait in the development of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boutry et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we explore the role of CPT1C as a sensor of malonyl-CoA in the regulation of axon growth in response to nutritional changes. Our results show that CPT1C is necessary for proper axon growth and identify the malonyl-CoA/CPT1 axis as a new regulator of LE/Lys anterograde transport. Under normal nutrient conditions, CPT1C promotes the anterograde transport of LE/Lys by enhancing protrudin-mediated transfer of the motor protein kinesin-1 to LE/Lys; while under energy stress, which leads to a decrease in malonyl-CoA levels, CPT1C stops this enhancement and the plus-end motion is arrested. The regulation of LE/Lys positioning in response to intracellular malonyl-CoA is crucial for proper regulation of axon growth in cortical neurons and can give new clues for the understanding of HSP.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CPT1C is necessary for proper axon growth</title><p>Since CPT1C has been associated with HSP, we decided to study whether CPT1C is necessary for proper axon growth. Cultured cortical neurons derived from wild type (WT) and <italic>Cpt1c</italic>KO mice were analyzed at 4 days of in vitro division (DIV) and we observed that <italic>Cpt1c</italic>KO neurons had shorter axons (about a 40% length reduction) compared to WT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Accordingly, CPT1C<sup>M589S</sup> overexpression in WT cultures reduced axon length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Of note, CPT1C overexpression in WT cultures was not enough to increase axon length, indicating that CPT1C is necessary but not sufficient for promoting axon growth.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CPT1C is necessary for proper axon growth.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Primary cortical neurons derived from WT and <italic>Cpt1c</italic> KO E16 mouse embryos were cultured and fixed at 4DIV.

However, under energy stress, such as glucose depletion or the activation of AMPK pathway, N-regulatory domain of CPT1C switches to its extended conformation (Nβ). In this state, CPT1C does not enhance the transfer of kinesin-1 to FYCO1, and in consequence, the anterograde transport of LE/Lys is not promoted and axon growth arrested.

Results shown here complete the regulatory role previously described for amino acids on LE/Lys positioning. The presence of nutrients in the media will increase intracellular malonyl-CoA in addition to amino acides, and in consequence favours mobile LE/Lys to move towards the periphery for mTORC activation, local cell growth and membrane expansion, which is of special importance during neuron development. By contrast, upon starvation, the intracellular decrease of malonyl-CoA and amino acids will stop the plus-end transport in order to save energy and facilitate their fusion with autophagosomes. Since malonyl-CoA levels depend on the metabolism of fatty acids and glucose, but not on amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wolfgang and Lane, 2006</xref>), CPT1C is unlikely to regulate protrudin-mediated LE/Lys positioning in response to changes in amino acids. Instead, amino acid mediated activation of PI3P production has been shown to play such a role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hong et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In growing neurons, mitochondria are also targeted into actively extending axons, in order to supply ATP necessary for this high energy consuming process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sheng, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith and Gallo, 2018</xref>). Recently, it has been demonstrated that LE/Lys also act as mRNA translation platforms for the synthesis of new proteins necessary to sustain mitochondria function in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cioni et al., 2019</xref>). Collectively, data from the literature indicate that LE/Lys anterograde transport is necessary for axon growth, either for rapid membrane expansion, or to provide platforms for local protein synthesis.</p><p>It is important to emphasize the relevance of malonyl-CoA as a metabolic intermediary in energy metabolism since it is at the crossroad of glucose and fatty acid metabolism. Malonyl-CoA is a derivative of glucose catabolism used for fatty acid synthesis. Its levels highly fluctuate depending on the feeding or fasting state of the individual. Specifically in the brain cortex, malonyl-CoA levels are 9 times higher after feeding than under fasting conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tokutake et al., 2010</xref>). Malonyl-CoA levels are tightly controlled by AMPK. The involvement of the AMPK pathway in axon growth control was previously described in the literature. AICAR treatment of newly platted hippocampal neurons resulted in KIF5 phosphorylation and the prevention of PI3K enrichment at the neurite tip, which was necessary for proper axon growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amato et al., 2011</xref>). Our results identify another downstream pathway of AMPK activation, which is ACC phosphorylation and the consequent depletion of malonyl-CoA levels.</p><p>It is important to note that AMPK is activated by metabolic stresses (fasting, exercise), but also by some natural products (resveratrol), drugs (metformin), or hormones (ghrelin, adiponectin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hardie, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">López, 2018</xref>). Moreover, in neurons AMPK is also phosphorylated and activated by the calcium sensor CaMKK in response to membrane depolarization. Therefore, it will be interesting to study in the future whether all these other effectors could regulate LE/Lys transport and axon growth through the malonyl-CoA/CPT1C axis.</p><p>Another interesting finding of this work, is the interaction between CPT1C and protrudin. We propose that both proteins form stable complexes in the ER, since glucose depletion or TOFA treatment does not separate them. CPT1C could be considered a sensor of malonyl-CoA that regulates protrudin. We speculate that this regulation is mediated through the N-regulatory domain of CPT1C, which is a peptide of 50 residues that can adopt two different conformations (Nα and Nβ) as determined by NMR spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Samanta et al., 2014</xref>). This N-regulatory domain switches between the two conformations depending on malonyl-CoA levels. This proposed mechanism shows similarities with the regulation of LE/Lys transport by ORP1L-sensing of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rocha et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wijdeven et al., 2015</xref>). Both CPT1C and ORP1L would act as nutrient sensors that regulate LE/Lys transport by changes in their own conformation.</p><p>The energetic regulation of LE/Lys plus-end transport mediated by CPT1C seems to be of particular importance for corticospinal neurons, the ones with longer axons in the body, since individuals carrying the missense CPT1C<sup>R37C</sup> or the nonsense CPT1C<sup>Q76X</sup> mutations develop HSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rinaldi et al., 2015</xref>). Arg37 is predicted to establish an electrostatic interaction with Glu3, stabilizing the Nα state of CPT1C. The loss of positive charge in Arg37Cys mutation increases the distance between the two residues and probably avoids the formation of the electrostatic interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). This would favour the extended conformation (Nβ state), leaving CPT1C<sup>R37C</sup> in the malonyl-CoA-unbound state, which would explain why R37C mutation results in reduced axon growth.</p><p>In summary, the present work demonstrates that CPT1C is a new regulator of LE/Lys anterograde transport by sensing malonyl-CoA levels. This is the first time that an energetic intermediate, such as malonyl-CoA, has been implicated in the regulation of LE/Lys transport. We find that protrudin is an important effector of CPT1C; although we cannot exclude that other mechanisms could be involved. Under normal nutrient conditions, CPT1C would enhance protrudin-mediated transfer of kinesin-1 to FYCO1 at the LE/Lys membrane, favoring plus-end transport. By contrast, when glucose is not available to cells or malonyl-CoA levels decrease, CPT1C would change its N-terminal conformation and slowdown the plus-end transport of LE/Lys preventing them to reach the axon tip and temporarily stop axon growth. This regulation seems of special importance in neurons with long axons, such as corticospinal motor neurons, since individuals with mutated CPT1C develop hereditary spastic paraplegia.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HeLa</td><td valign="top">Institute Curie, Paris, France</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HEK293T</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">CRL-1168</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">WT</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6J</td><td valign="top">Provided by UAB animal facility</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Cpt1c</italic> KO</td><td valign="top">DOI:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M111.337493">10.1074/jbc.M111.337493</ext-link></td><td valign="top">B6129SvEv/C57BL/6J <italic>Cpt1c</italic><sup>-/-</sup></td><td valign="top">Exons deleted: 12–15.

The objective used was a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.40 N.A. oil DIC III (Carl Zeiss). Confocal images of cultured neurons were obtaines using Leica DMi8 confocal microscope, using a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.40 N.A. oil objective. For quantification, sets of cells were cultured and stained simultaneously, and imaged using identical settings. Measurements were performed with the Imaris 9.2 image processing package (Bitplane). For colocalization studies, the Manders overlap coefficient was calculated using ImageJ software. Usually a region of the cytoplasm between the nucleus and the tip of a protrusion, and not crowded with vesicles, was selected as a region of interest in Manders analysis. For the analysis of percentage of cells with Lamp1 in their protrusion tips, ER, CPT1C, M589S and protrudin positive cells were picked based on intensity of the stained turquoise and citrine tags respectively. Peripheral Lamp1 clusters were detected by setting threshold values of intensity and size using Cell and Surface tools from Imaris software. For circularity analysis, NIS-Elements software was used. For the analysis of axon outgrowth in cortical neurons, several images of the same cell were taken and merged to follow the trajectory of the axons stained with the neurofilament marker SMI-312R, and the axonal lengths were measured using Tracing tool of Imaris software. For the measurement of Lamp1 intensity at the growth cone about 20 z-stacks (every 0.5 μm) per axon terminal (stained with SMI-312R) were taken and the mean intensity, volume and total intensity of the most apical Lamp1-positive dot accumulation at the axon terminal was determined using Surface tool of Imaris software. The same threshold values were used in all the samples. For the analysis of Lamp1 linear fluorescence profile, the sum intensity histogram from Z-projection images for each cell was obtained using Fiji software. 1 µm line width was drawn along the axon from the tip towards the soma and only the terminal 50 µm were analyzed (values were taken every 0.1 µm).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Live-cell imaging</title><p>Live cell imaging to monitor vesicle movement in HeLa cells was done as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Raiborg et al., 2015</xref>).

Exceptionally, the outliers were excluded if the values were above or below the mean ±two standard deviations. Statistical analysis was performed using PRISM (GraphPad Software). Data normality was determined according to Shapiro-Wilk test and D’Agostino and Pearson test. Significances between groups were detected using either Student’s t test or a Mann-Whitney U test (parametric and non-parametric, respectively) and a 95% confidence interval. For comparisons among 3–4 groups, ANOVA was performed (One-way or Two-way), followed by the Bonferroni’s multiple comparison post-test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are very grateful to Eva M Wenzel for her help in the settings of live imaging experiments and critical discussion.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor.

The data are of high interest to cell and neurobiologists alike and of relevance for biomedicine as CPT1C is mutated in a subset of human hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) patients. The story is presented in a compelling manner. The data presented, of which there are many pieces, are largely consistent with the proposed model. Although the precise mechanism by which malonyl CoA alters the interaction between CPT1C and protrudin remains to be worked out, the take home, as is, is a significant advance warranting publication in <italic>eLife</italic> if the following issues can be adequately addressed. Reviewers identified two major issues that need to be resolved in a resubmitted manuscript prior to a final decision.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A key result, demonstrating physical interaction between CPT1C and protrudin (Figure 3), is not convincing. In Figure 3A, the CPT1C signal in the citrine-protrudin IP is very faint and also in the midst of a high background of the IP antibody in the sample. One worries that the weak signal in the blot is just incompletely reduced antibody from the IP. In contrast, in Figure 3F, the CPT1C signal looks much stronger and much cleaner (were different antibodies used?), but there are no controls shown. In light of this, Figure 3A should be repeated, preferably using an antibody for the blot that does not pick up the antibody used for the IP. Additionally, a negative control using a mCitrine-tagged ER membrane protein must be used to ensure that this IP-blot result is not simply due to incomplete solubilization. (Ideally, this would be a mutated version of protrudin that lacks the CPT1C binding site. Such a construct could then be used in the rescue experiments thereby validating not just the physical interaction but also its functional importance. This is mentioned as encouragement because it would greatly strengthen the study at the mechanistic level. However, because the binding site will need to be mapped, it is not a requirement for resubmission.)</p><p>2) The subcellular localization of CPT1C remains unclear. In Supplementary Figure 2B, C it is shown that CPT1C fails to colocalize with LAMP1, while its binding partner protrudin partially overlaps with LAMP1. Overexpressed CPT1C in the images shown seems rather diffusive, while the biochemical data suggest that it may be located at the ER. It is suggested that the localization of CPT1C be studied in more detail at near endogenous expression levels, either by endogenous antibodies or low-level lentiviral expression. Is CPT1C detectable at ER-lysosome membrane contact sites?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51063.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A key result, demonstrating physical interaction between CPT1C and protrudin (Figure 3), is not convincing.

This plasmid encodes citrine with the tag KDEL, which drives the protein to the ER membrane. Hela cells were co-transfected with mCitrine-ER-5 or mCitrine-Protrudin and Myc-CPTC, and were immunoprecipitated by the GFP-trap assay. A faint signal corresponding to CPT1C was observed in the IP fraction of mCitrine-KDEL, probably due to incomplete solubilization or nonspecific binding. However, a far more intense band of CPT1C was observed in the mCitrine-protrudin IP. This experiment has been performed in triplicates, with similar results. The old Figure 3A has been replaced by the new Figure 3A.</p><p>We find the recommendation given by the reviewers of mapping the region of protrudin involved in the binding to CPT1C very interesting. However, we have not conducted this study because it exceeds the time given for the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The subcellular localization of CPT1C remains unclear.

To resolve this issue, we have repeated the experiments in cells with low CPT1C-mTurq and mCitrine-protrudin overexpression levels, and posterior staining of Lys with anti-Lamp1 (new Figure 6). Moreover, we have confirmed CPT1C localization in the ER, using VAPA as a marker. Our new data demonstrate that CPT1C is nicely localized in the ER, as expected. Moreover, CPT1C is found in ER-lysosome contact sites, even though it is not enriched there, compared to protrudin, which is highly enriched in the contact sites. This agrees with the fact that CPT1C does not form the contact sites, and only regulates their activity. In light of these findings, we have decided to remove the older Supplementary Figure 2 and substitute it by the new Figure 6.</p></body></sub-article></article>
