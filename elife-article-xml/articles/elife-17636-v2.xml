remains elusive. Flaviviruses include numerous important human pathogens, e.g., dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). Here, we revealed a highly conserved, conformation-tunable <italic>cis</italic>-acting element named 5′-UAR-flanking stem (UFS) in the flavivirus genomic 5′ terminus. We demonstrated that the UFS was critical for efficient NS5 recruitment and viral RNA synthesis in different flaviviruses. Interestingly, stabilization of the DENV UFS impaired both genome cyclization and vRNA replication. Moreover, the UFS unwound in response to genome cyclization, leading to the decreased affinity of NS5 for the viral 5′ end. Thus, we propose that the UFS is switched by genome cyclization to regulate dynamic RdRp binding for vRNA replication. This study demonstrates that the UFS enables communication between flavivirus genome cyclization and RdRp recruitment, highlighting the presence of switch-like mechanisms among RNA viruses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17636.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17636.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17636.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Flaviviruses include a large family of viruses that are harmful to human health, such as dengue virus, West Nile virus and Zika virus. Understanding the details of the life cycle of these viruses is important for better controlling and treating the diseases that they cause.</p><p>The genetic information of flaviviruses is stored in single-stranded molecules of RNA. To form new copies of a virus, the RNA must be replicated in a process that involves two critical steps. First, an enzyme called viral RNA polymerase NS5 must be recruited to a specific end of the RNA strand (known as the 5′ end). Then, the ends of the RNA strand bind together to form a circular loop. However, little is known about whether these two processes are linked, or how they are regulated.</p><p>Using bioinformatics, biochemical and reverse genetics approaches, Liu et al. have now identified a new section of RNA in the 5′ end of the flavivirus RNA, named the 5′-UAR-flanking stem (or UFS for short), which is critical for viral replication. The UFS plays an important role in efficiently recruiting the NS5 viral RNA polymerase to the 5′ end of the flavivirus RNA.</p><p>After the RNA forms a circle, the UFS unwinds. This makes the NS5 polymerase less likely to bind to the 5′ end of the RNA. Stabilizing the structure of the UFS impairs the ability of the RNA strand to form a circle, and hence reduces the ability of the RNA to replicate. Thus, the UFS links and enables communication between the processes that form the flavivirus RNA into a circle and that recruit the viral RNA polymerase to the RNA.</p><p>The structural basis of the interaction between the flavivirus RNA 5′ end, including the UFS element, and the viral RNA polymerase now deserves further investigation. It will be also important to explore whether other types of viruses regulate their replication via a similar mechanism.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17636.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17636.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>flavivirus</kwd><kwd>genome cyclization</kwd><kwd>viral replicase recruitment</kwd><kwd>cis-acting element</kwd><kwd>viral RNA structure</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31270196</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qin</surname><given-names>Cheng-Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31000083</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xiao-Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>30972613</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qin</surname><given-names>Cheng-Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Basic Research Program of China, 2012CB518904</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qin</surname><given-names>Cheng-Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Excellent Young Scientist Program, 81522025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qin</surname><given-names>Cheng-Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000691</institution-id><institution>Academy of Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Newton Advanced Fellowship, 81661130162</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qin</surname><given-names>Cheng-Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Project of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016YFD0500304</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qin</surname><given-names>Cheng-Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A conserved element in the flavivirus genomic 5′ terminus switches its conformation in response to long-range RNA interactions, and thereby regulates the dynamic recruitment of viral replicase for efficient viral RNA replication.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Cis</italic>-acting regulatory elements play essential yet diverse roles in the life cycle of RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nicholson and White, 2014</xref>).

In particular, local RNA elements in viral genomes are often involved in long-range RNA-RNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nicholson and White, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shetty et al., 2013</xref>), which are often referred to as genome cyclization and can bring regions separated by several thousand nucleotides into proximity. Such strategies have been observed in different classes of RNA viruses and play different roles in virus propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nicholson and White, 2014</xref>). In fact, the entire genomes of some RNA viruses are highly structured and have complex global architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Athavale et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The genus flavivirus includes important causative agents for human diseases, such as dengue virus (DENV1-4), West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), yellow fever virus (YFV) and the emerging Zika virus (ZIKV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fauci and Morens, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mlakar et al., 2016</xref>). Major phylogenetic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blitvich and Firth, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moureau et al., 2015</xref>) of flaviviruses include mosquito-borne flaviviruses (MBFVs), tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFVs), insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFVs) and flaviviruses with no known vectors (NKVs). Leading to diseases with symptoms ranging from mild fever and rash to severe hemorrhagic fever and encephalitis, the emergence and re-emergence of flaviviruses always arouses global concern. The flaviviruses are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses, and their genome is approximately 11 kb and contains a single ORF, which encodes a polyprotein precursor with more than 3000 residues. The precursor is further processed into 3 structural proteins (capsid, pre-membrane/membrane and envelope) and at least 7 nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5). The largest nonstructural protein, NS5, performs methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Egloff et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>), guanylyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Issur et al., 2009</xref>) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nomaguchi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Uchil and Satchidanandam, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yap et al., 2007</xref>). NS5 interacts with vRNA, other viral nonstructural proteins and host factors to assemble to the viral replication complex essential for vRNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klema et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, the highly structured 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) occupy the termini of the viral genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friebe and Harris, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gebhard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Villordo et al., 2016</xref>) and contain <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements crucial for vRNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clyde et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Filomatori et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lodeiro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rouha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Villordo et al., 2010</xref>), translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clyde and Harris, 2006</xref>), viral pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chapman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Funk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roby et al., 2014</xref>) and host adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Villordo et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Hybridization of complementary sequences at the 5′ and 3′ termini, which include the 5′-3′ upstream AUG region (UAR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), downstream AUG region (DAR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friebe and Harris, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Friebe et al., 2011</xref>) and cyclization sequence (CS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khromykh et al., 2001</xref>) elements, circularizes the genome of MBFV. Genome cyclization, which is also modulated by the downstream of 5′ CS pseudoknot (DCS-PK) in the capsid-coding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Borba et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), is crucial for the translocation of NS5 from the 5′ stem-loop A (SLA) promoter to the RNA synthesis initiation site at the 3′ end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Filomatori et al., 2006</xref>). However, the mechanistic details of this critical process are poorly understood. The 5′ SLA structure and genome cyclization strategy were also identified in other phylogenetic groups of the flavivirus genus, although the specific details differ. The 5′ UAR element in MBFV usually participates in the formation of a local hairpin, stem-loop B (SLB), in the linear conformation of the vRNA. The SLA and SLB elements are separated by a short uracil-rich sequence, which has been shown to mediate vRNA replication of DENV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lodeiro et al., 2009</xref>). In the present study, we demonstrated that the U-rich region of MBFV is involved in the formation of a conserved RNA duplex that is designated as a 5′-UAR-flanking stem (UFS) because it locks the 5′ UAR/SLB element between its two strands. A combination of our results suggested that the UFS and its cousin elements regulate the binding of viral RdRp to vRNA dynamically by switching their conformations in response to the long-range interactions between the viral 5′ and 3′ ends. Furthermore, UFS switching is a general replication strategy in flaviviruses with vertebrate hosts, highlighting their role in the host adaptation and evolution of flaviviruses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The UFS structure is conserved among the flavivirus genus</title><p>Although the U-rich region in the 5′ end of the MBFV genome has been shown to enhance vRNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friebe and Harris, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lodeiro et al., 2009</xref>), there were controversial opinions regarding the detailed structures downstream of SLA in flaviviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gebhard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Villordo and Gamarnik, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>).

The local RNA structures in the 5′ and 3′ ends of DENV4 vRNA are demonstrated, and elements involved in long-range interactions are highlighted. Structure prediction of the 5′ end local structures showed that the U-rich region of most MBFVs (except the YFV clade) forms a duplex with complementary sequences in or near the viral translational starting region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Because this duplex confines the 5′ UAR/SLB element between its two strands, we designated it as the UFS. Furthermore, the UFS duplex was predicted to unwind due to the formation of the panhandle structure between the 5′ and 3′ ends when long-range interactions between the genome termini were considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17636.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification and comparison of the 5′ UAR-UFS elements among flaviviruses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Terminal RNA structures of the DENV4 genome.

Local structures similar to UFS were also identified in ISFVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and Modoc virus (MODV) among the NKVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), whereas the non-vectored Rio Bravo virus (RBV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) was shown to contain a ψUFS structure. The UFS and ψUFS in NKVs were also involved in genome cyclization, similar to the corresponding structures in MBFVs. In contrast, the UFS-like structures were not predicted to be involved in genome cyclization in ISFVs, suggesting that the UFS in MBFVs and UFS-like structures in ISFVs function differently. Finally, the UFS/ψUFS structure was not identified in TBFVs or in the Yokose virus clade of NKVs; instead, a short hairpin with a large loop occupied the analogous location of the UFS in these viruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Taken together, the above results demonstrated the conservation of UFS elements among the flavivirus genus and suggested that the secondary structures of UFS elements are affected by genome conformation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>In vitro formation of UFS duplexes in different flaviviruses</title><p>To investigate whether the duplex conformation of the UFS can indeed exist locally under in vitro conditions, RNA molecules corresponding to the 5′ ends of DENV1-4, JEV and ZIKV were analyzed by selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE). The SHAPE reactivity data were annotated on RNA structure models generated by <italic>mfold</italic> prediction and sequence comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The SHAPE results were shown to agree well with the predicted RNA structures. It was shown that the UFS element of JEV forms a conical duplex structure under in vitro conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) because all nucleotides of the UFS exhibited low SHAPE reactivity. Similar results were obtained for DENV serotypes 1, 3, 4 and ZIKV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D,E and F</xref>), except that several nucleotides in the ZIKV and DENV1/3 UFS regions had elevated SHAPE reactivity, which was likely due to the presence of internal loops. In contrast, the SHAPE results indicated that the UFS duplex of DENV2 is highly unstable because the DENV2 UFS region showed considerable SHAPE reactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This result was consistent with thermodynamic calculations and suggested that the UFS duplex is a highly dynamic structure, at least in some flaviviruses. The presence of the DENV UFS duplex conformation was further confirmed by SHAPE analysis of DENV3 5′ end RNA molecules containing mutations in the UFS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). It was shown that the SHAPE reactivity of the UFS region significantly increased in UFS-disrupted mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, D3-M13A and D3-M13B), and restoration of UFS base-pairing endowed the corresponding region with low SHAPE reactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, D3-M13C). The above results demonstrated that the UFS duplex can exist locally in the vRNA 5′ end under in vitro conditions, suggesting that the UFS can assume the duplex conformation, at least under certain states of the flavivirus genome.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17636.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>SHAPE analysis of the 5′ end RNA of representative flaviviruses.</title><p>The SHAPE reactivity results are labeled in the structure models of different flaviviruses.

This peculiar localization of the UFS suggests a unique role in vRNA replication. Functional mutagenesis of the UFS was performed using a DENV4 replicon with internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-controlled viral translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). To eliminate the possibility that productive 5′-cap-directed translation is caused by mutations altering the start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clyde and Harris, 2006</xref>), which is embedded in the DENV4 UFS duplex, a nonsense mutation was introduced into the variable loop 3 of DCS-PK in the background of p4-cHPstop-SP-IRES-Rluc-Rep to generate the p4-Dualstop-SP-IRES-Rluc-Rep replicon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The replication characteristics of the two replicons were basically the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). First, a panel of mutants was generated, and their replication efficiency was assessed in BHK-21 cells. Disrupting the base-pairing of the UFS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>. M1A, M1B, M3A and M3B) greatly reduced vRNA replication, whereas reconstituting base-pairing by combining the corresponding mutations was able to restore vRNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>. M1C and M3C), although the M3C mutant replicated moderately less efficiently than the wild-type (WT) replicon, possibly due to the apparent primary sequence changes in the U-rich region. Next, the impact of the M1 and M3 mutations on the circularized vRNA structure was assessed using the <italic>mfold</italic> online server. It was shown that the overall genome cyclization pattern was only slightly affected by the M1 and M3 mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>), and the changes in the stability of the predicted circularized structures was considerable smaller than the changes in the local UFS structure. To further confirm the function of local UFS structure in vRNA replication, we designed a panel of mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), which nether affected vRNA cyclization pattern nor the internal loop structure in the circular form, and the corresponding mutants were assessed for replication efficiency. It was shown that disruption of UFS base pairing (mutant AGU and GAU) reduced vRNA replication greatly, whereas substituting of a few base pairs in the UFS (mutant AUA and ACG) only have moderate effects on vRNA replication.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17636.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The secondary structure of the UFS is required for flavivirus vRNA replication.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The organization of the DENV4 replicon constructs.

To this end, DENV4 NS5-GVD-vRNAs containing different UFS mutations were transfected into BHK-21 cells by electroporation, and vRNA copies were determined at 4, 24, 48 and 72 hr post-transfection. Only negligible differences in RNA stability were found between WT RNA and the mutants of the M1 or M3 groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H</xref>), and the stability of the M5C mutant was moderately reduced compared with that of the M5A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Thus, the differences in the RNA stability of the UFS mutants did not account for their different replication characteristics. The above results demonstrated that the UFS element is required for virus propagation due to its function in vRNA replication. In agreement with the function of DENV4 UFS, we also showed that disrupting of the UFS greatly reduced viral propagation of ZIKV, whereas reconstitution of the UFS duplex restores ZIKV propagation by IFA tests performed in transfected BHK-21 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The duplex conformation of the UFS is required for robust NS5Pol binding and RdRp activity</title><p>To understand the mechanism of how the UFS fulfills its role in vRNA replication, a series of in vitro assays were performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

The binding of NS5Pol to 5′-300 nt RNA containing the M1A or M1B mutation in UFS was much weaker than the binding to 5′-300 nt WT RNA, whereas the 5′-300 nt M1C and WT RNA bound to NS5Pol with comparable affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, top and middle panels). The 5′-300 nt M3A and M3B RNA also interacted with NS5Pol weakly, whereas the combination of the two mutations apparently restored the interaction between NS5Pol and 5′-300 nt M3C RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, bottom panel). The above results indicated that the UFS duplex is required for efficient NS5Pol binding in DENV4.

Apparently fewer products were generated in the reactions containing templates with disrupted UFS elements compared with the reaction containing the 5′-160 nt WT template, and restoration of the UFS duplex greatly increased the amounts of RdRp products in reactions using the corresponding 5′-160 nt mutants as templates. Moreover, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiment using 5′-160 nt RNA as a probe confirmed the function of UFS in NS5Pol recruitment, although the overall affinity of 5′-160 nt RNA for NS5Pol was lower than that of 5′-300 nt RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

Furthermore, internal loops and/or wobble base pairs are prevalent inside the UFS or at the junction connecting the UFS and SLB, which further decreases their structural stability. To investigate whether the low stability of the UFS duplex is associated with its function, UA base pairs of the DENV4 UFS were progressively substituted with GC base pairs, and the replication efficiency of the corresponding mutants was assessed using the above replicon system in BHK-21 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

Shortening the length of the internal loop to 1 nt or 2 nt did not affect vRNA replication greatly. In contrast, total deletion of the internal loop, which caused the SLB to stack onto the UFS, significantly reduced the vRNA replication efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, L1D, L2D and L3D). Moreover, replication assays performed for various purine-to-purine and purine-to-pyrimidine substituting mutations targeting the internal loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) suggested that the purine-rich properties of the internal loop are optimal for efficient DENV4 vRNA replication. Taken together, the above results demonstrated that the stability of the UFS duplex is a critical determinant for its function in vRNA replication. The defects in the vRNA replication of the over-stabilized UFS mutants were not caused by alternations in their affinity for NS5Pol, as an EMSA indicated that the 5′-300 nt M2C RNA bound to NS5Pol efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Over-stabilized UFS hinders genome cyclization</title><p>RNA structure prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sztuba-Solinska et al., 2013</xref>) suggested that the UFS duplex is melted after genome cyclization, whereas the 5′ UAR/SLB element, which is locked by the UFS duplex, is important for flavivirus genome cyclization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). We speculated that an over-stabilized UFS duplex would be too difficult to unwind and would hinder 5′-3′ UAR hybridization. To confirm this probability, a DENV4 5′-3′ RNA binding assay was employed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). The M1A, M1B and M1C mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), as well as the M3 series mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), had little effect on the formation of 5′-3′ complex. However, when the M2 series mutants were assayed, although the M2A and M2B mutations also did not influence the formation of 5′-3′ RNA complex apparently, the complex formed by the 3′ UTR and 5′-300 nt M2C RNA was greatly reduced compared to the amounts of complexes formed by the 3′ UTR and other 5′-300 nt RNA species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Estimation of dissociation constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>) revealed that the Kd of 5′-300 nt M2C binding with 3′ UTR is approximately ten fold higher than the Kds of the other 5′ RNAs. These results together indicated that increasing the stability of the UFS hinders vRNA terminus interactions. Furthermore, the 5′-300 nt L3D mutant, in which the internal loop was deleted, also interacted with the 3′ UTR poorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17636.027</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Increasing the stability of the UFS hinders vRNA cyclization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of experimental design.

When the 5′:3′ ratio was 1:1, the SHAPE reactivity of the UFS element in 5′-300 nt WT RNA exhibited a significant increase compared with the reactivity when the 3′ UTR was absent, and the SHAPE reactivity of the SLB loop and 5′ CS region was obviously reduced. When the 3′ UTR was in 5-fold excess of 5′-300 nt RNA, the SLB loop region of WT 5′ RNA showed essentially no SHAPE reactivity, indicating a complete transition from the SLB structure to a UAR duplex. In contrast, when the 5′-300 nt M2C RNA was incubated with an equal concentration of 3′ UTR RNA, there were only minor changes in the SHAPE reactivity of the UFS and SLB loop regions compared with those of 5′-300 nt M2C RNA alone. When the 5′:3′ ratio was 1:5, the SLB loop region of 5′-300 nt M2C RNA still showed moderate SHAPE reactivity. The above results demonstrated that the UFS duplex is melted when the 3′ UTR binds to 5′ end RNA, and stabilization of the UFS renders it difficult to unwind in response to the 3′ UTR and thus hinders genome cyclization. Thus, although the UFS does not participate in 5′-3′ hybridization directly, the stability of its secondary structure must be maintained below a threshold to enable the necessary conformational changes required for genome cyclization. It can be speculated that the unwinding of the UFS during genome cyclization may be important for its function in viral RNA synthesis.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17636.030</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>SHAPE analysis of the interactions between DENV4 genomic ends.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SHAPE analysis was performed for DENV4 5′-300 nt WT and M2C RNA in the presence of various amounts of 3′ UTR RNA.

The DENV4 WT mini-genome and those containing the desired mutations were constructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). First, using native PAGE, we found that the WT mini-genome, as well as the M1A, M1B, M1C, M3A, M3B, M3C and M2A mini-genomes, existed mostly in a circularized conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>), whereas the CS-M mutant, in which the 5′ CS sequence was mutated, was confined to a linear conformation, as expected. The M2C mutant also mainly stayed in a linear conformation, agreeing with the results of the 5′-3′ RNA binding assay. The above results demonstrated that these corresponding mini-genomes are highly circularized; thus, it is unlikely that the UFS duplex structure exists in them. Next, the affinity of different mini-genomes for NS5Pol was assessed. The WT, M1A, M1B and M1C mini-genomes all showed low levels of binding to NS5Pol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>).

The differences in RdRp activity between WT mini-genome and the UFS mutants were likely caused by changes of primary sequence in these constructs, In supporting of this, the M1C and M3C mutants were not able to reach the same level of replication as WT in replicon assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), and it has been reported that the base composition of U-rich sequence in the UFS was actually able to affect vRNA replication of DENV2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friebe and Harris, 2010</xref>).Taken together, the above results demonstrated that genome cyclization disables the function of the UFS in NS5Pol recruitment, suggesting that the UFS has to function dynamically during vRNA replication. Moreover, the attenuation of the affinity of NS5Pol for vRNA by genome cyclization is potentially important for the translocation of NS5Pol from the 5′ end to the 3′ end of vRNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Mechanistic model for the function of the UFS in flavivirus replication</title><p>It has been suggested that both the linear and circular conformations of the flavivirus genome are required for vRNA replication and exist in equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Villordo et al., 2010</xref>). However, circular states should be dominant among its conformations. Although the highly circularized mini-genome is much shorter than the actual viral genome, it has been theoretically proposed that the generic properties of a large RNA molecule lead its two ends to stay close to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yoffe et al., 2011</xref>), which was supported by results from single-molecule FRET assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leija-Martinez et al., 2014</xref>).

A mechanistic model to explain the function of the UFS is described below. (i) vRNA released in the cytoplasm is translated to generate a sufficient level of viral proteins, which leads to the eventual binding of NS5 to the SLA and the initiation of (−) strand synthesis, even without the presence of the UFS duplex. (ii) Completion of (−) strand synthesis generates the dsRNA RF, which serves as the template for the synthesis of progeny vRNA in the presence of viral NS5/NS3 and other viral/host factors (not shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). (iii) During the elongation of the nascent (+) strand, the 5′ terminus of the parental (+) strand RNA is displaced first, and the UFS duplex is folded on the protruding 5′ end; this 'ON' state of the UFS facilitates the recruitment of NS5 to the free 5′ end. (iv) After the completion of the nascent chain synthesis, the NS5-bound vRNA undergoes genome cyclization, and the UFS element is set to 'OFF' by the hybridization between genome termini, which decreases the binding strength of NS5 to the 5′ terminus and promotes its translocation to the 3′ terminus to initiate next-round synthesis of negative-strand vRNA. Such dynamic modulation of NS5 binding should be of great significance to maintain an appropriate level of (−) vRNA synthesis to ensure the global balance of vRNA replication because the dsRNA RF is a highly active template for (+) vRNA synthesis.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17636.033</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Model explaining the functional mechanism of the UFS switch.</title><p>A proposed mechanistic model of flavivirus vRNA replication.

Our results demonstrated that the UFS links two events of vRNA replication, NS5 recruitment and genome cyclization, together, and the structural stability of the UFS is elaborately balanced to meet the requirements of both. Especially, the conformational change of the UFS caused by genome cyclization is coupled with its function in modulating dynamic RdRp recruitment. As the function of UFS in viral replication and RdRp recruitment was investigated using different flaviviruses (DENV4, JEV and ZIKV), it is plausible to consider that the UFS is a general regulatory strategy of viral replication among the flavivirus genus. Although a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Filomatori et al., 2011</xref>) has suggested that the UFS may not be functional in DENV2, this was more likely to be an exception, as our SHAPE data also indicated that the UFS in DENV2 is highly unstable in vitro, in contrast to the UFS elements from other viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>By applying a systemic RNA structure prediction and comparison approach covering different members of the flavivirus genus, the structure of the downstream SLA region in the 5′ end of the flavivirus genome was unambiguously illuminated. The UA-base-pair-rich UFS and the UFS-like element have been identified in MBFVs, two clades of NKVs, and ISFVs, demonstrating that the UFS element is evolutionarily conserved. Interestingly, while the UFS duplex unwinds during genome cyclization in MBFVs and NKVs, neither the conserved mode of genome cyclization nor the unwinding of UFS-like elements during this process was found in ISFVs. The ISFVs have been indicated to be the most divergent outgroup among the genus flavivirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blitvich and Firth, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cook and Holmes, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moureau et al., 2015</xref>), which led us to assume that modern flaviviruses are evolved from an insect virus ancestor. We speculated that primordial UFS-like structures are potential viral replication enhancers with RdRp-recruiting functions in ancient ISFVs. When the viruses were introduced into vertebrates, the intense selection pressure caused by shifting between two hosts promoted the emergence of a highly efficient genome cyclization strategy, and the UFS-like elements evolved into the RNA switches in modern flaviviruses. Moreover, although the UFS structure itself was lost when the ancestral ISFV adapted into ticks and some special vertebrates, its functional mechanism was inherited by the appearance of elements such as 5′-SL2/CS-A in TBFVs. Thus, by looking into the evolutionary history of flaviviruses and exploring the modes of genome cyclization among them, we propose that the UFS may play a critical role during the evolution of the genus flavivirus.</p><p>UFS elements usually localize close to, or overlap with, the translation start region, suggesting a possible role for the UFS in viral translation regulation. Moreover, the replication of most positive-strand RNA viruses occurs in virus-induced membrane structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gillespie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Welsch et al., 2009</xref>). It is possible that during (+) vRNA synthesis of flaviviruses, the parental (+) RNA is anchored to the vesicle membranes and prevented from being transported out of the vesicle through interactions between the UFS-containing 5′ end and the membrane-bound viral replicase. Interestingly, DENV has been reported to conceal its dsRNA in membrane structures to escape from host immunity surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Uchida et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, other potential functions of the UFS need further investigation.</p><p>Functional long-range interactions are likely to be a general mechanism in positive-strand RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nicholson and White, 2014</xref>). Genome cyclization is responsible for the delivering of viral replication factors that bind 5′-terminally or internally to the very 3′ end of the viral genome. Such tactics have been observed in positive-strand RNA viruses, which infect animals, plants and bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nicholson and White, 2014</xref>). However, to our knowledge, this is the first report describing that an RNA switch triggered by genome cyclization integrates the recruitment and translocation of the viral RdRp into the dynamic process of nascent RNA synthesis. This deliberate control mechanism used by flaviviruses could also be used by other positive-strand RNA viruses in similar forms, and further pursuit of these mechanisms will provide deeper insight into the replication and evolution of positive-strand RNA viruses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>DNA constructs</title><p>The p4 infectious clone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Durbin et al., 2001</xref>) of the DENV4 814669 strain and its host <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BD1528 were kindly provided by Professor Stephen S.

After ultra-sonication, the suspension was centrifuged at 30,000 g at 4°C for 20 min. The soluble recombinant NS5Pol protein in the supernatants was then purified using a HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). The fraction containing NS5Pol was eluted with Buffer A containing 300 mM imidazole. The eluted protein was exchanged into 50 mM Tris.Cl (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl and 20% glycerol using a HiTrap desalting column (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) and concentrated to mg/ml grade by ultrafiltration using Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units (30 kDa-cutoff, Merck Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA). Dithiothreitol (DTT) was added into the purified NS5Pol protein to a final concentration of 1 mM. The final product was dispensed into single-use aliquots and stored at -80°C before use. NS5Pol of JEV SA-14-14-2 strain was cloned, expressed and purified using the same strategy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>EMSA assay</title><p>An RNA-RNA binding EMSA was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2013</xref>) with minor modifications. For the NS5Pol-RNA EMSA assays, the different DENV4 5′-300 nt RNA species were first diluted in 0.5× TE buffer and heated at 95°C for 2 min. The RNA samples were then placed on ice immediately. 5× RNA folding buffer T (250 mM Tris.Cl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl and 25 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) was added to the samples, and the RNA was refolded at 37°C for 20 min. The concentration of the renatured RNA was set to 500 nM. The binding reactions contained 50 nM 5′-300 nt RNA, 4 μl of 5× EMSA buffer (200 mM Tris.Cl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 25 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>), 0.05 mg/ml heparin sodium salt, 7.5% glycerol and different amounts of NS5Pol (0, 3, 5.25, 7.5 and 11.25 μg) in a 20 μl volume. Due to the solvent components in RNA and protein preparations, the final reactions contained 64.15 mM Tris.Cl (pH 8.0), 182.5 mM NaCl, 5.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 40 nM EDTA and 375 nM DTT. The reactions were incubated at 30°C for 30 min, and then, 10× gel loading solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts) was added, and the mixtures were separated by electrophoresis on 6% native PAGE gels running in 0.5× TBE. The gel apparatus was placed in an ice-water bath to prevent the dissociation of RNA-protein complexes. After running at 60 V for 4 hr, the gels were stained with SYBR Gold nucleic acid gel stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts) for 30 min, and gel pictures were captured using a BioSpectrum Imaging System (UVP, LLC, Upland, California) with a UV transilluminator. EMSAs using 5′-160 nt RNA or mini-genome RNA were performed similarly, with a few exceptions: for the 5′-160 nt RNA-based EMSA, the NS5Pol concentrations were higher (0, 5.4, 10.8, 16.2 and 21.6 μg, respectively); for the mini-genome-based EMSA, the heparin concentration was set to 0.16 mg/ml, and the electrophoresis was performed with 4.5% PAGE gels at 75 V for 6 hr in an ice-water bath. EMSA assay using JEV NS5Pol and 5′-320 nt RNA was performed with similar conditions for DENV4 5′-300 nt RNA EMSA assay.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>RdRp assay</title><p>In vitro RdRp initiation assays were performed using: (I) 5′-160 nt RNA of DENV4, (II) DENV4 mini-genome RNA as templates. The RNA templates were diluted with RNase-free water to a final volume of 8 μl, then heated at 95°C for 2 min and immediately cooled on ice. Two microliters of RNA fold buffer T2 (250 mM Tris.Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 25 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) was added, and the RNA templates were folded at 37°C for 20 min. Unless otherwise specified, the 30-μl RdRp reactions contained 450 ng of template RNA (3 μl of 150 ng/μl folded RNA), 55.6 mM Tris.Cl (pH 7.4), 12 mM NaCl, 5.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM DTT, 40 U of recombinant RNase inhibitor (40 U/μl), approximately 5.4 μg NS5Pol (in 1 μl) and 0.5 mM ATP, GTP, and UTP; 0.1 mM CTP; and 0.25 mM biotin-11-CTP (Roche, Penzberg, Germany). According to previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann and Padmanabhan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Filomatori et al., 2006</xref>), the RdRp reactions were incubated at 30°C for the desired length of time. The reaction products were purified using an RNAclean Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China), and 2× RNA loading dye (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, Massachusetts) was added into the purified RNA. The samples were preheated at 70°C for 5 min, snap-cooled on ice, and analyzed using 6% PAGE/8 M urea gels. The gel-separated RNA was electro-transferred onto a Hybond N+ Nylon membrane (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). After air-drying the membrane, the transferred RNA was UV-crosslinked by a UV transilluminator for 10 min. The membrane was blocked using 10% non-fat dry milk, and then streptavidin-conjugated HRP (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) was incubated with the membrane at room temperature for 2 hr. The membrane was then extensively washed using PBS with 0.05% Tween 20, and chemiluminescence signals were detected using a Pro-light chemiluminescent kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China) and a Smartchemi II imaging system (Sage Creation Science Co, Beijing, China).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using the statistical functions of GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California, USA).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wenhui Li as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jeffrey S Kieft (Reviewer #1) and Alexander Khromykh (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Liu et al. propose that a previously undetected structural element in the 5' UTR of diverse flaviviruses is important for replication, but that upon genome cyclization this structure is disrupted by 5'-3' interactions.

Overall, the reviewers found that the model presented is reasonable but is not adequately supported by the experimental results. If the authors can provide additional data, analysis, and discussion to support this model, the manuscript may become suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors used many mutants, taking into account the impact on the linear form of the genome. However, the authors must also consider and discuss the impact of these mutations on RNA cyclization and on the internal loop structure (including UFS sequences) in the circular form. The predicted cyclization of DENV4 RNA is similar to that reported for JEV (Khromykh et al. 2003 JVI <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and different from other dengue serotypes. The model of genome cyclization of DENV4 RNA must be revised to include account possible hybridization of the U rich region of UFS with 3' end sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5,</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). For instance, in the M1 series, M1A may increase complementarity while M1B could reduce complementarity, similar analysis can be done for the M3 series. This possibility should be taken into account for the interpretation of results with all the mutants and the sequence/structure changes of the internal loop in the mutants should be analyzed.</p><p>2) The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> indicate that mutations within UFS alter SHAPE reactivity of SLA (which is the promoter for polymerase binding and activity), possibly explaining the reduced binding of the polymerase in the UFS mutants. Evaluation of the impact of UFS mutations on the overall molecule is crucial because the results regarding NS5 binding and RNA synthesis may be due to undesired changes within the promoter SLA. The authors must use the SHAPE data to generate predictions for these changes, for instance using RNAstructure software.</p><p>3) The authors find that NS5 affinity for the RNA is reduced when the UFS structure is disrupted by mutations. Considering that this observation is not caused by changes in SLA, the results do not agree with previous observations reported for DENV2. Specifically, mutations, deletions or complete replacement of UFS by unrelated sequences did not affect NS5 binding nor RNA synthesis in vitro (Filomatori et al. 2011 JBC <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, and Lodeiro et al. JVirol. 83,2, 993, 2009). Importantly, a substitution of the bottom half of UFS by As in the DENV2 infectious clone (mutant 6U/6A, Lodeiro et al. JV 2009) results in a replication competent virus similar to the WT. In this case UFS is completely disrupted and the virus shows efficient replication. These discrepancies suggest that the observations reported here are not applicable to other flaviviruses. The authors must better present their work in light of these potential differences; if the authors wish to conclude that their findings can be extended to other flaviviruses, additional data must to be provided to support this.</p><p>4) The authors propose that UFS formation is necessary for NS5 recruitment (linear form of the RNA) and when cyclization takes place, NS5 is released, promoting interaction with the 3' end initiation site of the RNA.

The minigenome WT and mutants bind the polymerase NS5 with low affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref> and subsection “Genome cyclization reduces the affinity of NS5 for vRNA by inducing the unwinding of the UFS”, first paragraph). However, RNA synthesis is efficient with the WT RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>), but not with mutant M1C (which is reconstituted).

We have also noticed that the U rich region of UFS is predicted to hybrid with the 3' end sequences by algorithms such as <italic>mfold</italic>, however, this hybridization pattern was not supported by our SHAPE data in this work (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). We have shown that when the 5'-300 nt RNA and 3' UTR RNA of DENV4 forms a complex, which is an in vitro mimic of circularized genome, the U-rich region exhibited high SHAPE reactivity, suggesting that this region becomes single-stranded after genome cyclization. Thus we believe that the U-rich region is not directly involved in interaction with the 3' UTR, at least in DENV4. Besides, we totally agree that the impact of mutations on RNA cyclization and on the internal loop structure in the circular form should also be discussed. To this end, using the DENV4 mini-genome sequence as the query sequence, the influence of M1 and M3 mutations on genome cyclization was assessed by using the <italic>mfold</italic> on line server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://unafold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold/RNA-Folding-Form">http://unafold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold/RNA-Folding-Form</ext-link>). The results of RNA structure prediction by <italic>mfold</italic> were provided as supplementary file, and the corresponding information has been added in the manuscript. It was shown that the overall genome cyclization pattern was only slightly affected by the M1 and M3 mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The difference in free energy of the predicted circularized structures between WT and M1 mutants was only about 0.7 kcal/mol, whereas the M1A and M1B mutations decreased the local UFS structure by 3.4 and 2.3 kcal/mol, respectively, suggesting that these mutations mainly affected viral RNA replication through their disruptions of the UFS structure. Similar analysis was also performed for the M3 mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>), indicating more markedly local structure changes over those of circularized structures. To further confirm the function of local UFS structure in vRNA replication, we designed a panel of mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3 —figure supplement 1</xref>), which neither affect the pattern of RNA cyclization nor the internal loop structure in the circular form, and the corresponding mutants were assessed for replication efficiency. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, the disruption of UFS base pairing reduced vRNA replication greatly, whereas substituting of a few base pairs in the UFS only have moderate effects on vRNA replication. We believe that these new data and analysis would help to understand the function of UFS in vRNA replication in consideration of the impact of mutations on genome cyclization.</p><p><italic>2) The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> indicate that mutations within UFS alter SHAPE reactivity of SLA (which is the promoter for polymerase binding and activity), possibly explaining the reduced binding of the polymerase in the UFS mutants. Evaluation of the impact of UFS mutations on the overall molecule is crucial because the results regarding NS5 binding and RNA synthesis may be due to undesired changes within the promoter SLA. The authors must use the SHAPE data to generate predictions for these changes, for instance using RNAstructure software.</italic> </p><p>Thanks for the reviewers’ insightful suggestions. We have used the <italic>RNAstructure</italic> software to generate results of RNA structure predictions by incorporating the constraints of SHAPE data as suggested, and the results of prediction indicated that the secondary structure of SLA was not affected by the DENV4 mutants M1A, M1C, M3A and M3C, thus the changes in NS5 binding and RNA synthesis of UFS mutants were not induced by unwanted disruption of the SLA element. The above results also confirmed that the UFS structure was disrupted/destabilized or reconstituted as designed. These results of prediction were provided as supplementary file (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>). In fact, we have speculated the observed changes of SHAPE reactivity of SLA and 5′ CS by UFS mutations M1A and M3A could be caused by the nature of data processing procedure of the QuShape software, which automatically determines the numbers of outliers in normalization procedure (described in QuShape Tutorial, which can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chem.unc.edu/rna/qushape/">http://www.chem.unc.edu/rna/qushape/</ext-link>). As the M1A/M3A mutants exhibited more highly reactive sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), the automatically normalization process of QuShape would make the overall SHAPE reactivity of these mutants to become generally lower than the less-highly-reactive- sites-containing WT or “C” mutants.</p><p><italic>3) The authors find that NS5 affinity for the RNA is reduced when the UFS structure is disrupted by mutations. Considering that this observation is not caused by changes in SLA, the results do not agree with previous observations reported for DENV2. Specifically, mutations, deletions or complete replacement of UFS by unrelated sequences did not affect NS5 binding nor RNA synthesis</italic> in vitro <italic>(Filomatori et al. 2011 JBC <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, and Lodeiro et al. JVirol. 83,2, 993, 2009). Importantly, a substitution of the bottom half of UFS by As in the DENV2 infectious clone (mutant 6U/6A, Lodeiro et al. JV 2009) results in a replication competent virus similar to the WT. In this case UFS is completely disrupted and the virus shows efficient replication. These discrepancies suggest that the observations reported here are not applicable to other flaviviruses. The authors must better present their work in light of these potential differences; if the authors wish to conclude that their findings can be extended to other flaviviruses, additional data must to be provided to support this.</italic> </p><p>Thanks for the reviewers’ suggestions. In order to extend our findings to the flavivirus genus, we have performed in vitro EMSA assay using JEV as the model, as well as mutagenesis analysis based on the infectious clone of Zika virus. The results of EMSA indicated that the UFS element is required for the efficient binding of JEV NS5Pol to viral 5' RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>),and we showed that disrupting of the UFS greatly reduced viral replication of Zika virus, whereas reconstitution of the UFS duplex restores Zika virus replication in BHK-21 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, these results demonstrated that the function of UFS element is indeed conserved in different flaviviruses. Regarding to the function of UFS in DENV2, although the biochemical assays mentioned by the reviewers indicated that UFS is not functional in DENV2 in vitro, the replication characteristics of the mutant 6U/6A (Lodeiro et al. 2009. J Virol. 83:993) was investigated only qualitatively. The original authors demonstrated that at 3 days post transfection, the DENV-positive cells were indistinguishable between WT and mutant 6U/6A, however, differences in replication were possible to be neglected as the authors did not provide the IFA results at 1-2 days post transfection, which is the period when most differences in flavivirus vRNA replication are observed. In fact, a similar mutant (Mutant poly (A)-10, Friebe et al. 2010. J Virol. 84:6103, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) was viable but showed reduced replication efficiency compared with its parental DENV2 replicon. Based on these reasons, we suggest that the previous evidences were not strong enough to conclude that the UFS is not functional in DENV2 vRNA replication. Even if the UFS was actually not a replication element in DENV2, that would make DENV2 to be an exception among flaviviruses based on our combined results. The relevant discussion was added into the first paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>4) The authors propose that UFS formation is necessary for NS5 recruitment (linear form of the RNA) and when cyclization takes place, NS5 is released, promoting interaction with the 3' end initiation site of the RNA. This idea is interesting; however, the data presented is not sufficient to support the model. The minigenome WT and mutants bind the polymerase NS5 with low affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref> and subsection “Genome cyclization reduces the affinity of NS5 for vRNA by inducing the unwinding of the UFS”, first paragraph). However, RNA synthesis is efficient with the WT RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>), but not with mutant M1C (which is reconstituted). Also, it is uncertain why disrupted mutant M3A shows higher RNA synthesis than M3B? The presented data is over interpreted and the results do not support adequately the model proposed. Quantitative measurements should be provided and these discrepancies addressed.</italic> </p><p>Thanks for the suggestions. We have analyzed the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref> using ImageJ software, and demonstrated the RdRp activity as percentage of WT. In fact, the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> were not in conflict with the model which we have proposed. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, we have shown that the mini-genomes are highly-circularized RNA molecules, and that means the UFS duplex is <italic>not</italic> present in these mini-genomes except for the CS-M mini-genome, which cannot circularize since the 5' CS element was mutated. Because of the above reasons, the mini-genomes except CS-M bind the polymerase NS5 with low affinity as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>. In the meantime, the presence of the core promoter, SLA, in these min-genomes and their pre-circularized nature should ensure the template activities of them in RdRp activity assay. Since the UFS duplex was not present in the mini-genomes, its function will not be reflected in the RdRp activity assay using mini-genomes as templates. The differences in RdRp activity between WT and M1C and between M3A and M3B should be caused by changes of primary sequence in these constructs, but not the alteration of UFS structure. In supporting of this idea, the M1C and M3C mutants were not able to reach the same level of replication as WT in replicon assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Moreover, it has been reported (Friebe et al. 2010. J Virol. 84:6103) that substitution of U-rich sequence by adenosines is tolerated, but not by cytosines or guanosines. As the M1B and M1C mutants contains more guanosines in the U-rich region of the UFS than the other mutants, it is acceptable that these two mutants exhibited the lowest RdRp activity. We have added the above analysis into the corresponding Results section.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>: the RNA-RNA complex formation with WT and mutated 5' 300 RNAs was analyzed in a range of concentration that are little informative in regard to differences in binding affinities. Kds must be calculated and presented.</italic> </p><p>Thanks for the suggestions. We have re-performed the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> with a larger range of 5' RNA concentrations, and calculated the Kds, which are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>. The results indicated that the binding affinity of 5' M2C RNA was at least 10-fold higher than the other 5' RNA molecules, which have Kds ranging from approximately 70-250 nM.</p><p><italic>6) The authors indicate that &quot;UFS formation is essential for flavivirus replication&quot; (subsection “Mechanistic model for the function of the UFS in flavivirus replication”, last paragraph). This RNA structure may function as enhancer of DENV4 replication but is not essential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In addition, disruption of the proposed UFS of DENV2 replicates similar to the WT virus, so the extrapolation to other flavivirus requires further studies.</italic> </p><p>Thanks for the suggestions. We have changed the corresponding description as suggested. In order to extend our findings to other flaviviruses, firstly, we performed in vitro EMSA assay using JEV as the model species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), which demonstrating that the UFS element is also required for the efficient binding of JEV NS5Pol to the corresponding viral 5' RNA. Secondly, mutagenesis analysis targeting the UFS were performed based on the infectious clone of ZIKV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We showed that disrupting of the UFS greatly reduced viral replication, whereas reconstitution of the UFS duplex restores viral replication in BHK-21 cells. Together, these results suggested that the UFS plays a conserved role in vRNA replication of the flaviviruses.</p></body></sub-article></article>
