BNST in defensive behaviors are unclear. Here we examined whether the BNST mediates freezing to conditioned stimuli (CSs) that poorly predict the onset of aversive unconditioned stimuli (USs) in rats. Reversible inactivation of the BNST selectively reduced freezing to CSs that poorly signaled US onset (e.g., a backward CS that followed the US), but did not eliminate freezing to forward CSs even when they predicted USs of variable intensity. Additionally, backward (but not forward) CSs selectively increased Fos in the ventral BNST and in BNST-projecting neurons in the infralimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), but not in the hippocampus or amygdala. These data reveal that BNST circuits regulate fear to unpredictable threats, which may be critical to the etiology and expression of anxiety.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>anxiety</kwd><kwd>BNST</kwd><kwd>fear Conditioning</kwd><kwd>freezing</kwd><kwd>fos</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH065961</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maren</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000872</institution-id><institution>McKnight Endowment Fund for Neuroscience</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Memory and Cognitive Disorders Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maren</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain and Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Distinguished Investigator Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maren</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH117852</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maren</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31MH107113</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goode</surname><given-names>Travis D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is required for the expression of defensive behavior to uncertain threats, a function that is central to pathological anxiety.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Excessive apprehension about potential future threats, including financial loss, illness, or death, is a defining feature of many anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Behar et al., 2009</xref>).

Several recent studies have demonstrated changes in the function of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Andreescu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Brinkmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Brinkmann et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Brinkmann et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Buff et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">MÃ¼nsterkÃ¶tter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Rabellino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Straube et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib178">Yassa et al., 2012</xref>). However, the conditions that recruit the BNST to aversive learning and memory processes believed to underlie anxiety disorders are still not understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Avery et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Avery et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ch'ng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Daniel and Rainnie, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Davis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Fox and Shackman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Goode and Maren, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Gungor and ParÃ©, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Lebow and Chen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Perusini and Fanselow, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Shackman and Fox, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib171">Walker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib172">Walker and Davis, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Early work on this question revealed that BNST lesions in rats impair defensive behaviors evoked by unconditioned threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Gewirtz et al., 1998</xref>). For example, BNST inactivation results in a loss of unconditioned defensive responding to the presence of predator odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Breitfeld et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Fendt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib177">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, unconditioned increases in the acoustic startle reflex produced by either intracranial administration of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) or exposure to bright light require the BNST, whereas fear-potentiated startle to punctate conditioned stimuli (CSs) do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib171">Walker et al., 2009</xref>). However, the involvement of the BNST in defensive responding is not restricted to unconditioned threat: BNST lesions produce deficits in both freezing and corticosterone release elicited by contextual, but not auditory, CSs after Pavlovian fear conditioning in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">LeDoux et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Sullivan et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, however, it is not stimulus modality that differentiates the effects of BNST lesions on tone and context freezing. BNST lesions impair freezing responses to long-duration (e.g., 10 min) auditory conditioned stimuli (CSs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib169">Waddell et al., 2006</xref>), and spare freezing to short-duration (1 min) contextual stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Hammack et al., 2015</xref>). Based on this work, it has been proposed that the BNST is required to organize behavioral and hormonal responses to sustained threats (whether conditioned or unconditioned) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Hammack et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Hammack et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Takahashi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib170">Waddell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib169">Waddell et al., 2006</xref>). Of course, the duration of the behavioral responses in these situations is confounded with the duration of the eliciting stimulus. Thus, it has been argued that the BNST mediates sustained defensive <italic>responses</italic> independent of the specific features and durations of the stimuli that evoke them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Davis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Davis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib171">Walker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib172">Walker and Davis, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Of course, another factor that differentiates discrete tones from contexts, or short- from long-duration stimuli (whether tones or contexts), is the temporal information the stimuli provide about when an aversive event will occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Goode and Maren, 2017</xref>). For example, long-duration CSs or contexts provide relatively poor information about <italic>when</italic> a future unconditionedÂ stimulusÂ (US) will occur (i.e., the US will occur at some distal time in the future), whereas short-duration CSs or contexts provide more immediate certainty about the temporal imminence of US onset (i.e., the US will occur soon). We and others have proposed that the BNST may have a critical role in processing temporally unpredictable threats, particularly in mediating defensive responses to threatening stimuli that poorly predict when an aversive event will occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Goode and Maren, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Lange et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Luyck et al., 2018b</xref>). Consistent with this view, punctate auditory CSs that are followed by shock at unpredictable latencies yield freezing responses that are sensitive to BNST manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Daldrup et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Lange et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests that a crucial parameter that determines the role for the BNST in defensive behavior is neither the duration nor modality of the threat (nor the duration of the elicited defensive response), but rather the information a signal provides about when an aversive event will occur.</p><p>Here we directly examined this possibility by investigating the role of the BNST in conditioned freezing responses elicited by procedures that equated both the duration and modality of the threat CSs, as well as the total number of US presentations, but differed according to the timing of the aversive US in relation to the CS. Specifically, we arranged a brief (10 s) auditory CS to either precede (forward conditioning, FW) or follow (backward conditioning, BW) a footshock US in rats. Although extensively-trained BW CSs become conditioned inhibitors that dampen responding to other first-order excitatory cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andreatta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ayres et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Christianson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Gerber et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Moscovitch and LoLordo, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Siegel and Domjan, 1971</xref>), minimally-trained BW CSs elicit excitatory conditioned responses that transfer across contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ayres et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Barnet and Miller, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Bevins and Ayres, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Chang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Connor et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Heth, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Mahoney and Ayres, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">PrÃ©vel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">PrÃ©vel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Rescorla, 1968</xref>). After conditioning, we examined the effect of pharmacological inactivation of the BNST on freezing to FW or BW CSs. We hypothesized that pharmacological inactivation of the BNST would selectively disrupt fear expression to the BW CS and that the presentation of the BW CS would recruit BNST neurons (as assessed by Fos) in greater numbers than the FW CS. Furthermore, we anticipated that the backward CS would increase the activity of BNST-projecting neurons in afferent brain regions implicated in anxiety states. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that BNST inactivation reduced freezing to a BW, but not FW, CS. This effect was related to the uncertainty of the BW CS in predicting US onset, because the same outcome was observed when USs occurred randomly with respect to the CS. We also observed that BW CSs selectively increased Fos expression in the BNST and BNST-projecting medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC) neurons. These data reveal that BNST circuits process the expression of defensive behavior in the presence of unpredictable threat signals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reversible inactivation of the BNST attenuates fear to backward, not forward, CSs</title><p>To examine the role of the BNST in threat uncertainty, we reversibly inactivated the BNST during retrieval of fear to either a forward- (âFWâ; predictable threat) or backward-trained (âBWâ; unpredictable threat) CS.

As shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), inactivation of the BNST produced a selective decrease in conditioned freezing to the BW CS.

It has been suggested that the BNST mediates sustained but not acute fear responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Davis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Davis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib171">Walker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib172">Walker and Davis, 2008</xref>). However, it is notable that in this experiment BNST inactivation selectively attenuated conditioned freezing to the backward CS, which produced less sustained freezing during the retrieval test compared to the FW CS.</p><p>The different effects of BNST inactivation on freezing to FW and BW CSs may have been related to differences in memory strength between the two CSs (reflected in overall levels of freezing to each CS across the retrieval test). Indeed, to generate conditioned freezing to a backward CS we used more conditioning trials than typical in our laboratory. Of course, this may have resulted in moderate overtraining of the FW CS, which might have rendered the FW response less sensitive to disruption. To examine this possibility, we also examined the effects of BNST inactivation of FW and BW conditioning after five conditioning trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). The behavioral design for the five-trial experiment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A</xref>; cannula placements for this experiment are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>.</p><p>During the 5-trial conditioning procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3B</xref>), animals exhibited reliable increases in freezing across the session (repeated measures: <italic>F</italic><sub>5,115</sub> = 12.154, pÂ &lt;Â 0.0001; there were no main effects of conditioning procedure or drug treatment and no interaction of these variables: <italic>F</italic>âsÂ &lt;Â 2.3, <italic>p</italic>âsÂ &gt;Â 0.15). After infusions of NBQX or VEH, animals were tested to the CS in a familiar context that was distinct from the conditioning context. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3B</xref>, BNST inactivation did not affect conditioned freezing to either the FW or BW CS. An ANOVA revealed a main effect of trial (repeated measures [including baseline freezing]: <italic>F</italic><sub>5,105</sub> = 22.118, pÂ &lt;Â 0.0001), a main effect of conditioning procedure (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,21</sub> = 15.930, pÂ &lt;Â 0.001), and a trialÂ ÃÂ conditioning procedure interaction (repeated measures: <italic>F</italic><sub>5,105</sub> = 12.346, pÂ &lt;Â 0.0001). A separate ANOVA performed on trials 1â5 (excluding baseline; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3B</xref>) revealed a significant main effect of conditioning procedure (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,21</sub> = 21.585, pÂ =Â 0.0001; there was no main effect of drug and no interaction: <italic>F</italic>âsÂ &lt;Â 0.15, <italic>p</italic>âsÂ &gt;Â 0.7). Thus, the failure of BNST inactivation to impair conditioned freezing to the FW CS in the 12-trial procedure does not appear to be due to a ceiling effect; freezing to the FW CS in the 5-trial procedure was not maximal and remained insensitive to BNST inactivation. That said, the absence of an effect of BNST inactivation on freezing to the BW CS in this experiment may be due to a floor effect insofar as the 5-trial procedure did not yield conditional significant freezing to the CS (at least freezing that exceeded the pre-CS baseline). Together, these data indicate that the BNST is required for the expression of conditioned freezing to an excitatory BW, but not FW, CS.</p><p>One index that might reveal differences in the ability of the CS to predict the US is the US-evoked response itself. Footshock USs elicit an unconditioned response (UR) that includes vocalization, autonomic adjustments, and burst of locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bali and Jaggi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Fanselow, 1994</xref>). To better understand the mechanisms of forward and backward conditioning on behavior, we examined shock-evoked activity bursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Kunwar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib180">Zelikowsky et al., 2018</xref>) during the conditioning session in a separate cohort of animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5</xref>). Fear conditioning resulted in robust freezing in both groups of animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5A</xref>). An ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of trial (repeated measures: <italic>F</italic><sub>6,180</sub> = 67.02, pÂ &lt;Â 0.0001) with no differences between levels of freezing in FW or BW animals (no other main effects and no interactions: <italic>F</italic>âsÂ &lt;Â 1.80, <italic>p</italic>âsÂ &gt;Â 0.15). In contrast, shock-induced activity differed in FW and BW animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5C</xref>). All animals exhibited a reliable decrease in shock-induced activity across the conditioning session (repeatedÂ measures:Â <italic>F</italic><sub>5,150</sub> = 9.59, pÂ &lt;Â 0.0001) and the rate of decline in activity was similar in the two groups (no trialÂ ÃÂ group interaction: <italic>F</italic>Â &lt;Â 1.70, pÂ &gt;Â 0.09), but the overall level of shock-induced activity was significantly lower in the FW animals (main effect of group: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,30</sub> = 9.59, p &lt; 0.05; significant two-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test for mean levels: <italic>t</italic><sub>30</sub>Â = -2.08, p &lt; 0.05).

Hence, USs that were not signaled by a forward CS evoked greater activity bursts than those that were, which may suggest greater regulation of the shock-induced activity when the US is preceded by a temporally predictive cue.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Inactivation of the BNST disrupts freezing to a discrete CS associated with random USs</title><p>The differential effect of BNST inactivation on freezing to a FW or BW CS suggests that the BNST regulates defensive behavior to stimuli that poorly signal US onset. However, the BW CS does not completely lack temporal information about US onset; the BW conditioning procedure may have resulted in forward trace conditioning to the CS, which always preceded the next US by 60 s (after trial 1). To address this possibility, separate rats were implanted with cannulas in the BNST and submitted to one of three conditioning procedures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Nonetheless, these data indicate that conditioned freezing (in both FW and BW rats) is associated with increased activity in BNST-targeting cells of HPC, and that BW CSs selectively increase Fos in BNST-projecting neurons in IL. Hence, IL projections to the BNST may regulate the effects of BW CSs on BNST Fos expression and freezing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we demonstrate that the BNST is critical for processing unpredictable threats, specifically discrete auditory CSs that are poor predictors of when aversive footshocks will occur. Reversible inactivation of the BNST disrupted CS-elicited freezing to a backward CS, but did not prevent freezing to a CS that reliably signaled the imminent onset of shock, even when that CS signaled an unpredictable intensity of the US. Moreover, pharmacological blockade of the BNST attenuated fear to both a backward CS and a CS that was trained with random US onset. These data suggest that uncertain timing of shock is a critical factor in recruiting the BNST to conditioned fear. Moreover, BNST inactivation did not affect freezing to a forward CS that was paired with a US that varied in intensity, suggesting that contributions of the BNST to conditioned fear may depend on the type of uncertainty imbued by the CS. Interestingly, freezing to the backward CS was less sustained than that to the forward CS, suggesting that neither long-duration stimuli nor sustained freezing responses are required to recruit the BNST. Finally, although both forward and backward CSs increased Fos expression in the hippocampus, BNST, amygdala, and mPFC, only backward CSs selectively increased Fos expression in both the ventral BNST and BNST-projecting neurons in the infralimbic cortex. Collectively, these data reveal that the BNST and its mPFC afferents may mediate defensive responding to threats that signal uncertain or remote onset of shock.</p><p>Unpredictable threats come in many forms [including uncertain timing, magnitude or type, or probability of threat: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bennett et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Daldrup et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Davies and Craske, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">McHugh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">McNally et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Schroijen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Seidenbecher et al., 2016</xref>); these subtypes of uncertainty may have dissociable and cumulative contributions to anxiety.

In turn, BNST lesions or circuit inactivations reduce defensive responding to contextual cues that poorly signal the imminence of the aversive US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Asok et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Davis and Walker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Goode et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Hammack et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Luyten et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Poulos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Sullivan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib169">Waddell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib182">Zimmerman and Maren, 2011</xref>; but, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Luyck et al., 2018a</xref>). Consistent with the possibility that the BNST mediates conditioned fear to temporally uncertain threats, we observed significant and selective decreases in the expression of defensive freezing when we inactivated the BNST in the presence of BW CSs or CSs trained with randomized USs. Conversely, cues that predicted imminent shock were not affected by BNST inactivation. Additionally, we observed significant differences in shock reactivity during forward and backward conditioning, insofar as rats exhibited more robust shock-elicited activity bursts than during forward conditioning. These data may suggest that conditioning in the presence of predictive cues may reduce the magnitude of the unconditioned response, in a way that is not present for the backward CS.</p><p>A critical finding in the present study is that the BNST mediates conditioned freezing to short-duration discrete CSs. This contrasts with prior work suggesting that the BNST only mediates freezing behavior to long-duration cues or contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Hammack et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib169">Waddell et al., 2006</xref>). However, recent data in other paradigms suggest a role for the BNST in the processing of responses to relatively brief threat stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Brinkmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Choi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Haufler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Kinnison et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Kiyokawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Klumpers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Luyck et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Luyck et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Naaz et al., 2019</xref>). Together, these data suggest that stimulus duration is not necessarily a determinant of BNST involvement. Similarly, it does not appear that response duration is the primary determinant of the BNST in threat reactions. In the present work, conditioned freezing to the backward CS was generally shorter-lived than that to the forward CS, but was more sensitive to BNST inactivation than freezing to the forward CS. One might conclude from this observation that the BNST mediates weak (but not strong) freezing responses. However, we and others have shown that BNST lesions or inactivation reduce the expression of freezing even when those levels are relatively high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Goode et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Hammack et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, the BNST mediates fear to cues that signal uncertain or remote threat, independent of the duration of the antecedent stimuli or behavioral responses associated with the threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Goode and Maren, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, it has been suggested that fear to a backward CS relies on associations between the CS and the conditioning context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Chang et al., 2003</xref>), which more strongly predicts the US. That is, extinction of fear to the conditioning context reduces fear to a BW, but not FW, CS. Thus, it is possible that the BNST mediates fear expression to a backward CS by retrieving a memory of the context-US association. Indeed, considerable work indicates that BNST is involved in the expression of contextual fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Davis and Walker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Goode et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Hammack et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Luyten et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Sullivan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib169">Waddell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib182">Zimmerman and Maren, 2011</xref>). Increases in immediate early gene expression, metabolic activity, and changes in electrophysiological firing patterns have been observed in the BNST in response to direct exposure to conditioned contextual cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Campeau et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Daldrup et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Jennings et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Lemos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Luyten et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Marcinkiewcz et al., 2016</xref>). If the backward CS functions similarly to a conditioned context, then one might expect Fos activity to be elevated in the BNST of animals exposed to the backward CS. Indeed, we observed significantly more Fos expression in the BNST in response to the backward compared to the forward CS. The backward CS-elicited Fos expression was specific to vBNST, insofar as backward and forward rats did not differ in overall levels of Fos in dBNST or ovBNST. Similarly, others have shown elevated Fos expression, in regions in or near vBNST after stress or conditioned fear-related behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Besnard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib158">Sterrenburg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib167">Verma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Radley and Johnson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Radley and Sawchenko, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Of course, another possibility is that the backward conditioning procedure yielded forward trace conditioning after the first trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Burman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Marchand et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Raybuck and Lattal, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">Tipps et al., 2014</xref>). Although there has been considerable work on the neural mechanisms of trace conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Raybuck and Lattal, 2014</xref>), a role for the BNST in this form of learning has not yet been established. Because trace conditioning also degrades the temporal imminence of the US following the CS, it might be expected to require the BNST. Consistent with this possibility, we found that inactivation of the BNST reduced fear in the presence of a cue that was conditioned with randomized onset of shock after the CS. In either event, the BNST appears to be recruited by stimuli, whether cues or contexts, that signal remote or temporally unpredictable onset of shock.</p><p>The amygdala, PFC, and hippocampus have strong connections with the BNST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Canteras and Swanson, 1992</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">deCampo and Fudge, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Dong et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Glangetas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Johnson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">McDonald et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Reichard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Reynolds and Zahm, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib164">Torrisi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib168">Vertes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib174">Weller and Smith, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib176">Wood et al., 2019</xref>). In line with previous work, the expression of freezing (whether elicited by a forward or, in our case, backward CS) increased the number of Fos-positive neurons in these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Herry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Jin and Maren, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Knapska and Maren, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Lemos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib173">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, we found that forward and backward CSs increased Fos expression in BNST-targeting cells of the HPC (with similar, but trending, effects within the BLA). HPC and BLA projections to the BNST are thought to regulate hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Crestani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Forray and Gysling, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib181">Zhu et al., 2001</xref>), and these afferents may be engaged in high-fear states to mobilize corticosterone release, for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). However, unlike the HPC and BLA, we observed a greater number of Fos-positive cells in the IL in response to a backward CS relative to forward CS. This suggests a unique role for BNST-projecting neurons of the IL [which appear to be glutamatergic: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Crowley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Glangetas et al., 2017</xref>)] in processing excitatory backwards CSs. There is growing evidence for a regulatory role for prefrontal connections to the BNST in stress and anxiety-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Fox et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Glangetas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Glangetas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Johnson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Kinnison et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Motzkin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Naaz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Radley et al., 2009</xref>), the present data adds to this work by suggesting that the IL may be involved in generating freezing and/or stress responding to the backward CS. This would stand in contrast to considerable data indicating that the IL is involved in the inhibition of freezing behavior after extinction, for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Milad and Quirk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Quirk and Mueller, 2008</xref>). However, the fact that the backward CS elicits less fear (or more extinguishable fear) could suggest this circuit is active, in part, to gate or regulate fear expression. Indeed, there is evidence for a role of the infralimbic cortex in regulating discrimination of conditioned excitors and inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Sangha et al., 2014</xref>). An alternative view is that the IL is involved in processing contextual information conveyed by the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Corcoran and Quirk, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Marek et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib179">Zelikowsky et al., 2013</xref>) during threat processing. To the extent that that backward CSs elicit fear via CS-(context-US) associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Chang et al., 2003</xref>), it is possible that the IL is involved in retrieving CS-context associations.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate a novel role for the BNST and its circuits in processing discrete cues, including excitatory backward CSs and randomized CSs. Specifically, BNST inactivation impaired conditioned freezing to a backward, but not forward, auditory CS that differed only in their temporal relationship to a footshock US. This reveals that neither stimulus modality nor duration (or response duration) are the critical parameters driving BNST involvement in defensive behavior. We further show that backward CSs increase the number of Fos-positive neurons in the vBNST and in BNST-projecting neurons in the infralimbic cortex. This suggests a novel role for mPFC projections to the BNST in processing unpredictable threats, possibly of the aversive contexts to which backward CSs are associated. These findings may help in our understanding of the broader contributions of the BNST to motivated behaviors that depend on uncertainty, such as during BNST-dependent triggers of fear and drug relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Aston-Jones and Harris, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Avery et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Goode et al., 2018</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Goode and Maren, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Harris and Winder, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Miles et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Silberman and Winder, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Stamatakis et al., 2014</xref>).

Rats were housed in a climate-controlled vivarium and kept on a fixed light/dark cycle (lights on starting at 7:00 AM and off at 9:00 PM; experiments took place during the light phase of the cycle). Rats were individually housed in clear plastic cages (with bedding consisting of wood shavings; changed weekly) on a rotating cage rack. Group assignments for behavioral testing were randomized for cage position on the racks. Animals had access to standard rodent chow and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Animals were handled by the experimenter(s) (~30 sec/day) for five consecutive days prior to the start of any surgeries or behavior.

Each behavioral room housed eight identical rodent conditioning chambers (30 cmÂ ÃÂ 24 cm Ã 21 cm; MED Associates, Inc). Each chamber was housed in a larger, external sound-attenuating cabinet. Rear walls, ceilings, and the front doors of the testing chambers were made of Plexiglas, while their sidewalls were made of aluminum. Grid floors of the chambers were comprised of nineteen stainless steel bars (4 mm in diameter), and spaced 1.5 cm apart (center to center). The grid floors were attached to an electric shock source and a solid-state grid scrambler for delivery of the US (MED Associates, Inc). A speaker attached to each chamber was used to deliver the auditory CS. As needed for each context, the chambers were equipped with 15 W house lights, and small fans were embedded in the cabinets (providing background noise ofÂ ~70 dB). An aluminum pan was inserted beneath the grid floor to collect animal waste. A small camera was attached to the top of the cabinet for video monitoring of behavior.</p><p>Measurements of freezing were performed using an automated and unbiased system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Maren, 1998</xref>). Specifically, each behavioral testing chamber rested on a load-cell platform that was sensitive to cage displacement due to the animalâs movements. During behavioral testing, load-cell activity values (ranging from â10 toÂ +10 V) were collected and digitized at 5 Hz using Threshold Activity Software (MED Associates, Inc). Offline conversions of the load-cell activity values were performed to generate absolute values ranging from 0 to 100; lower values indicate minimal cage displacement, which coincided with freezing behaviors in the chambers. Accordingly, freezing bouts were defined as absolute values ofÂ â¤10 for 1 s or more. The percentage of freezing behavior during the pre-CS baseline, the CS, and the inter-trial intervals was computed for each behavioral session. Shock reactivity was analyzed by directly reporting the absolute values generated by the Threshold Activity Software (i.e., larger values indicated more movement in the cage).</p><p>Unique contexts (A and B) were used for conditioning retrieval testing. Chamber assignments were unique to each context and group assignments were counterbalanced across test chambers when possible. For each experiment, context A was assigned to one of the behavioral rooms, and B the other. For context A, the test chamber was wiped down with an acetic acid solution (3%) and a small amount was poured in the pans beneath the grid floors. The cage lights were turned on, while the chamber fans were turned off. The cabinet doors were closed. The behavioral room was illuminated with dim red light. Animals were transported to and from the chambers using white plastic transport boxes. For context B, an ammonium hydroxide solution (1%) was used to wipe down and scent the chambers, black Plexiglas panels were placed over the grid floors, the cage lights were turned off, the chamber fans were turned on, and the cabinet doors remained open. The behavioral room was illuminated with white light (red room lights were turned off).

Hair on top of the rodentâs head was shaved, povidone-iodine was applied, and a small incision was made in the scalp to expose the skull. Bregma and lambda were aligned on a horizontal plane, and small holes were drilled in the skull for the placement of anchoring screws and bilateral stainless-steel guide cannulas (26 gauge, 8 mm from the bottom of their plastic pedestals; Small Parts). The cannulas were inserted into the BNST at the following coordinates: â0.15 mm posterior to bregma,Â Â±2.65 mm lateral to the midline, and â5.85 mm dorsal to dura (guide cannulas were angled at 10<bold>Â°</bold> with their needles directed at the midline). Dental cement was used to secure the cannulas to the screws and stainless steel obturators (33 gauge, 9 mm; Small Parts) were inserted into the guide cannulas.

A single small hole was drilled into the skull to allow for the insertion of a glass micropipette. Injection tips were backfilled with mineral oil and secured in the injector; CTb-488 was then drawn up into the injector immediately before use. Rats received unilateral CTb-488 infusions into either the left or right hemisphere (group assignments were randomized for sites of CTb-488 infusion): â0.15 mm posterior to bregma,Â Â±2.65 mm lateral to the midline, and â6.50 mm dorsal to dura (the pipette was angled at 10<bold>Â°</bold> with the tip directed at the midline). CTb-488 (5.0 mg/Î¼l; total volume of 0.25 Î¼l) was microinfused into the brain using a Nanoject II auto-nanoliter injector (Drummond Scientific Co) secured to the arms of the stereotaxic frame. For the infusion process, 50 nl (25 nl/s) of CTb-488 was infused once per min for 5 min to achieve 0.25 Î¼l of the total infusion (the injection needle was left in the brain for five additional minutes to allow for diffusion of CTb-488).

On the day of infusions, animals (in predetermined squads of four to eight rats; representing all drug/behavioral groups as possible) were transported to the laboratory, obturators were removed, and injectors were inserted into the guides.

One additional rat was excluded due to a technical issue that resulted in the loss of tissue at the level of the prefrontal cortex. This resulted in the following (final) group numbers (shown in data/figures): FW (<italic>n</italic>Â =Â 8); BW (<italic>n</italic>Â =Â 14); NoCS(Test) [<italic>n</italic>Â =Â 17 (BW-trained: <italic>n</italic>Â =Â 9; FW-trained: <italic>n</italic>Â =Â 8)]; NoTest (<italic>n</italic>Â =Â 8). For behavioral training, rats (in squads of six to eight; with all groups intermixed) were transported to the laboratory and placed in context B to acclimate for 5 min (no CS or US) and then returned to their homecages. Later that day, the animals were transported to context A where they received twelve trials of either FW or BW fear conditioning, which was identical to the other aforementioned procedures. We alternated FW and BW conditioning squads. After conditioning, the rats were returned to their homecages. Twenty-four hours after conditioning, all rats were exposed to context B for 20 min in the absence of the CS or US to acclimate them to the test context.</p><p>Forty-eight hours afterÂ conditioning, FW, BW, and NoCS(Test) rats were transported to context B to receive a retrieval test to the CS or were merely placed in the context [NoCS(Test) condition]. Squads alternated between the CS and no CS test. For rats undergoing CS retrieval, FW and BW animals (intermixed in each squad) received CS trials as described previously. Rats were perfused 90 min following the first CS of the test, in groups of three to four. For NoCS(Test) rats (with FW- and BW-trained animals intermixed), animals were exposed to context B in the absence of the CS or US. NoCS(Test) rats were perfused 95 min after being placed in the test context, in groups of three to four. NoTest rats were perfused alongside groups of FW, BW, and NoCS(Test) rats. Rats were returned to their homecages after testing and prior to the perfusions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Histological procedures</title><p>At the conclusion of behavioral testing, cannula-implanted animals were overdosed with sodium pentobarbital (Fatal Plus; 100 mg/ml, 0.5 ml, i.p.). Transcardial perfusions were then performed using chilled physiological saline followed by 10% formalin. Brains were extracted and stored in 10% formalin for 24 hr at 4Â° C; brains were transferred to a 30% sucrose-formalin solution for three or more days (at 4Â° C) before sectioning. Brains were flash frozen with crushed dry ice and coronal sections (40 Î¼m) containing the BNST were collected using a cryostat (Leica Microsystems) at â20Â° C. The tissue was wet-mounted to gelatin-subbed microscope slides and stained with 0.25% thionin prior to adding glass coverslips secured with mounting medium (Permount, Sigma). To further examine the spread of drug, a subset of animals was infused (identical to the aforementioned infusion parameters) with fluorescent muscimol (1.0 Î¼g/Î¼l; EverFluor TMR-X conjugate, Setareh Biotech) before being sacrificed (these animals were not perfused) and having brains dissected (40 Î¼m; brains were stored in 30% sucrose solution at 4Â° C until sectioning). These tissues were wet-mounted to slides and aqueous mounting medium (Fluoromount; Sigma-Aldrich) was used to secure glass coverslips.</p><p>For CTb-injected animals, post-behavior perfusions mirrored the aforementioned procedures. For sectioning, coronal sections (which included regions of the prefrontal cortex, BNST, basolateral amygdala, and ventral hippocampus) were collected into well plates containing phosphate-buffered saline (1ÃÂ PBS) and stored in the dark at 4Â° C until immunohistochemistry could be performed. For localization of the CTb-injection site, separate sections at the level of the BNST were wet-mounted and coverslipped using Fluoromount mounting medium.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Immunohistochemistry for Fos was performed on free-floating brain tissue similar to prior reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Jin and Maren, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Marek et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Orsini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib173">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). For sections containing the BNST, Fos was stained using the following procedures [all steps were performed at room temperature (~20Â° C) on a shaker, unless stated otherwise; rinses were brief (~20 s)]. The tissue was first rinsed in 1ÃÂ tris buffered saline (TBS; 7.4 pH), and then incubated in 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (in TBS) for 15 min, followed by rinses (Ã3) in TBS.

First, the tissue was rinsed (10 min;Â Ã2) in 1ÃÂ TBS, followed by a 10 min wash in 1ÃÂ TBST. The tissue was incubated in 10% normal donkey serum (NDS; in TBST) for 1 hr. The slices were then rinsed (5 min;Â Ã2) in TBST. Sections were transferred to primary antibody [goat anti-c-fos, 1:2000 in 3% NDS (in TBST); Santa Cruz Biotechnology] and incubated on a rotator in the dark for 72 hr at 4Â° C. The tissue was rinsed (10 min;Â Ã3) in TBST before incubating in secondary antibody [biotinylated donkey anti-goat, 1:200 in 3% NDS (in TBST); Santa Cruz Biotechnology] for 2 hr. Slices were then rinsed (10 min;Â Ã3) in TBST. Sections were transferred to wells containing streptavidin (Alexa-Fluor 594-conjugate, 1:500 in 3% NDS (in TBST); Thermo Fisher Scientific] for 1 hr.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Bed nucleus of the stria terminalis mediates fear to ambiguous threat signals&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The primary problem, which is mentioned in each review but came out more strongly as an issue requiring further experimentation in the online discussion, is the lack of clear evidence that backward and forward conditioning differ primarily in the uncertainty of the prediction. Each reviewer felt this problem in the manuscript, though for each it is expressed a bit differently. In the end it was felt that addressing this, as well as other concerns about the strength of some of the results, would require more experiments. As <italic>eLife</italic> has a policy not to invite revisions if they require more than a couple months of experiments, the decision was made to reject. However, the reviewers all agreed that these were potentially very interesting experiments, so if the additional work were done, they were open to the authors coming back, essentially as a resubmission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In the current study, the authors present a series of nicely controlled and straightforward experiments comparing the effects of BNST inactivation on expression of backward and forward conditioned fear responses. The underlying idea was to elucidate the role of the BNST in responses to cues that were predictors of an aversive US versus those that were uncertain predictors. A backward conditioning design was used for the latter as a way to maintain some uncertainty while avoiding confounding changes in the duration of the cue or the strength of the US, its replicability, etc. This is a nice aspect of the design. The authors show clearly that inactivation impairs freezing after BW but not FW conditioning. The lack of effect is not due to differences in the strength of conditioning for FW, since FW was not affected with when lighter conditioning was used. Nor was it affected when a variable US was employed. Finally, the authors show that BW also induces Fos expression in parts of BNST and afferent prefrontal regions, not affected by FW. Overall this provides a very nice set of experiments differentiating the role of this circuit versus amygdalar circuits in these two forms of conditioning.</p><p>What I am less convinced of is that the involvement of the BNST in BW is due to some special role in uncertainty. To some extent this reflects my ignorance regarding BW and how it is conceptualized. In some other studies, procedures such as these are used to examine safety signaling for example. This is not to say I do not see the authors' point; it seems to me that this is something that might be given more explanation in the Introduction (which currently is all about BNST).</p><p>Perhaps related to this, I am a bit unclear on the significance of the data in Figure 3. This seems to be presented to substantiate that BW is making the subjects fearful but uncertain â is this correct? I wonder if showing this earlier might help support the paradigms. Or showing some direct relationship with the efficacy of BNST inactivation would make this relationship more clear. That is, if a failure to reduce the activity bursts to the US with conditioning reflects uncertainty about the shock and this is mediated by BNST, then the less this reduction, the more BNST should be required for the conditioned responding no? Likewise, it would be useful to know whether there were any relationships within groups between behavior and Fos expression in the various regions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In a series of experiments, Goode and colleagues examined the role of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in a traditional fear conditioning arrangement (forward conditioning: tone â shock) and the inverse arrangement (backward conditioning: shock â tone). The logic behind this approach was that, historically, BNST manipulations have had little/no impact in traditional fear conditioning procedures. However, BNST is essential to fear driven by contexts or long duration stimuli â both of which introduce a measure of temporal uncertainty. Goode and colleagues speculated that backward fear conditioning may also introduce a degree of uncertainty, and therefore be sensitive to BNST manipulations. Consistent with their predictions, the authors demonstrate that BNST inactivation with NBQX selectively impaired 24 hour fear recall of the backward conditioned tone, but not the forward conditioned tone. This effect was not observed with fewer forward and backward conditioning trials nor did BNST inactivation impair fear recall to a forward conditioned cue associated with variable foot shock intensity. Using c-Fos, the authors demonstrate that the backward conditioned cue selectively activated the ventral subdivision of the BNST, particularly BNST cells receiving direct inputs from the infralimbic cortex.</p><p>The inactivation, tracing and c-Fos imaging methods are all appropriate and are the strength of the manuscript. The innovation comes from the use of backward conditioning. This is a behavioral procedure with a rich history in learning theory but has received little or no attention from neuroscientists. However, no effort is made to draw from this tradition. Instead, the authors immediately cast backwards conditioning as capturing 'threat uncertainty' and 'ambiguous threat' with no convincing explanation. Even more, there are Pavlovian fear conditioning procedures that directly manipulate ambiguity [Rescorla, (1968); McHugh et al., (2015); Erlich, Bush and Ledoux, (2012)]. Thus, there is a strong mismatch between the process the authors set out to investigate, and the processes captured by backward conditioning. The best general advice I can give is for the authors to search for and thoroughly read backward conditioning papers by Heth, Rescorla, Wagner, Ayres, LoLordo, Domjan and their contemporaries.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In experiment 1 the authors demonstrate the backward conditioning yields less fear, or more extinguishable fear, compared to a forward conditioned cue. Backward fear is also greater in rats given the cue during test, compared to rats given no cue. There is still a concern that rather than producing weak excitatory conditioning, freezing produced by the backward cue is non-associative. That is, equivalent levels of freezing would be observed to a cue unpaired with foot shock. Showing that backward conditioned rats expressed greater freezing in test, compared to unpaired rats, would definitively demonstrate that freezing was the result of associative learning.</p><p>2) ANOVA for Experiment 1 was adequately performed and the main effects &amp; interactions reflect the patterns in the data. However, some issues with post-hoc testing crept up. The following must be a typo, as a group cannot differ from itself:</p><p>Results section: &quot;Importantly, BW-VEH rats exhibited significantly higher levels of freezing than BW-VEH rats (p &lt; 0.005), which did not differ from No-CS groups.&quot;</p><p>If I am interpreting Figure 1B test data correctly, freezing for the FW-NBQX and FW-VEH group are virtually overlapping for every two-trial block (1-6). Yet the authors report significant differences for NBQX and VEH groups.</p><p>Results section: &quot;Fisher's PLSD revealed significant differences in NBQX- and VEH-treated animals in both the BW and FW groups (p's &lt; 0.0005).&quot;</p><p>How was this statistical result achieved? If these two groups differ, how could any group fail to differ? Or am I missing something?</p><p>3) Experiment 2/Figure 2 is more helpful as a supplement. It is helpful to know backward conditioning is not observed with more limited training. However, even this limited training appeared to produce near ceiling levels of fear to the forward tone. Thus, it was not convincing that a ceiling was avoided to the forward conditioned tone. This is important because it still possible that if weaker fear was acquired during training, then freezing during recall may become sensitive to BNST-NBQX.</p><p>4) The authors demonstrate that shock-induced activity, overall, is greater to foot shock on forward trials than on backward trials. In the discussion it is argued that &quot;uncertainty about the timing of the aversive USs increases their aversiveness&quot;. Studies of conditioned diminution, and the related concept of conditioned analgesia, would argue exactly the opposite. The observed effect is driven by the predictive ability of the forward cue to diminish the response to foot shock. That is, the backward CS arrangement did not back the US more aversive, instead the forward arrangement made it less aversive.</p><p>5) In experiment 3 the authors use a separate manipulation of uncertainty (variable shock intensity) to further probe the role of the BNST. Forward conditioning is performed with fixed or variable shock intensity, followed by a recall test with BNST intact or inactivated. Visually, it appeared that test freezing was greatest in the variable-VEH group, with lesser and equivalent levels of freezing to the remaining three groups. ANOVA found no training condition x drug interaction. However, the n per group is 7-8. Compare this to Figure 1 in which the groups of most interest had 12 (BW-NBQX) and 13 (BW-VEH). The lack of statistical result on generalized contextual freezing would only be convincing in the authors dedicated 12-13 individuals per group.</p><p>For Figure 4B, I understand why baseline subtracted freezing was used, but the authors use the same axis label for conditioning, test and test (BL subtraction). That is confusing. Either the bar graphs need their own axis label, or the authors need to report non-baseline subtracted freezing.</p><p>Of course, even the variable manipulation does not capture uncertainty. The cue fully predicts foot shock is imminent, just on some trials its more intense than others. The subject is certain the shock will be presented, but uncertain of the specific intensity. Why not use a probabilistic versus deterministic cue?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Overall my reaction to this manuscript is somewhat mixed but mostly skewed towards the positive. I do have several questions and comments. I think the manuscript is well written, includes some really nice, sophisticated behaviour, and I enjoyed the thorough analysis of Fos expression in the BNST-projecting afferent structures to determine where information about ambiguous threat might be emerging from. I also enjoyed most of the discussion and thought that some very thoughtful and insightful points were raised there.</p><p>However, I do have a couple of major issues that would have to be addressed regarding whether these data do actually warrant the conclusion that the BNST is mediating fear learning to temporally ambiguous stimuli and not to stimuli that are otherwise ambiguous. I will explain these in more detail below.</p><p>1) My first question is exactly how ambiguous is a backwards CS using the particular parameters that were employed in this manuscript? Specifically, according to the Materials and methods section, the shock US always precedes the backwards CS, and the intertrial intervals are always 70 seconds. As such, the animal can actually perfectly predict when the shock US will occur using temporal information, including how long it has been since the offset of the backwards CS. If the authors wanted to use a truly temporally ambiguous CS, then would it not make more sense to deliver the shock randomly during the CS presentation? Or alternatively, to randomly alter the length of the intertrial interval?</p><p>Another method that could be used to increase the ambiguity of a backwards CS is different intervals between US offset and CS onset, which have been demonstrated to produce excitatory (short intervals 0-4 seconds) versus inhibitory (longer intervals &gt; 10seconds) conditioning, whereas intermediate intervals (4-10seconds) have been shown to produce either type of conditioning (e.g. Sanderson et al., 2014; Hellstern et al., 1998; Delamater et al., 2003). Thus, a backwards CS with a US offset-CS onset interval of 4-10 seconds would perhaps be more 'ambiguous'. Of course, once again if the intertrial intervals are kept consistent at 70 seconds then it would still be questionable whether the US is still &quot;temporally unpredictable.&quot;</p><p>At minimum, I think an experiment showing the involvement of the BNST in regulating fear to a CS that is truly ambiguous (and not predicted by precise intertrial intervals) is necessary to complete this dataset.</p><p>2) There is another sense in which a backwards CS is not really ambiguous, and that is because when the animal receives the backwards CS, they can be sure that they wonât receive the US for at least the duration of that CS and a period of time afterwards. However, on test when the animal does not receive the US prior to CS onset, perhaps the effect of these altered conditions is to introduce some ambiguity (i.e. the shock that yesterday preceded the backwards CS has not yet occurred, therefore it seems possible that it may occur on test). However, the forwards CS also of course suffers this same type of ambiguity when the US does not follow its presentation, such that every presentation after the first might also be rendered ambiguous, and yet BNST inactivation does not affect freezing to the forwards CS. It might be that the types of ambiguity rendered on test to the two types of CSs might manifest differently, but it would be good if the authors could discuss how. Also, more experiments could be needed: BNST affected CS where shock is delivered in a temporally unpredictable manner during CS presentation, and showing a similar effect, OR having an effect on a backwards CS with a US offset-CS onset interval between 4-10 seconds. Finally, a Fos study where animals are sacrificed following a 'test' session during which USs are actually delivered, and the differences in vBNST Fos persist, would provide stronger evidence that it is the ambiguity produced by the different predictiveness of the two types of CSs, rather than the ambiguity produced by the test session.</p><p>3) It looks, to me at least, like there might actually be an effect of BNST inactivation in the variable US intensity experiment (results in Figure 4), particularly on the test (4B), although the authors do not report it as such. From the figure, the difference in freezing on test between fixed-veh and variable-veh looks much larger than the difference between fixed-mus and variable-mus. I understand that the interaction is not significant, but the F is high-ish at at 2.7, p &gt;.15 (Results section). Certainly, with the number of animals in this kind of study the authors would have at best a small-medium amount of power to detect a medium effect size. This then begs the question that if more animals were added, would this effect become significant, and most importantly, within the population about which the authors are making inferences, is this an effect? If this were an effect with more animals added, then does it matter? Surely it would simply mean that the BNST is involved in multiple situations of ambiguity of fear predictiveness, rather than just temporally ambiguous stimuli.</p><p>The authors subtract baseline freezing to show that (Figure 4B right panel), when higher baseline freezing is taken into account, the rats in fact freeze equally among groups. They justify this by saying the baseline freezing was not significantly different between groups, but the F here really does appear to approach significance (3.6, p &gt;.05, Results section), and as the authors note, freezing looks highest in 'variable-veh' at baseline. This is the group that, having received shocks of variable intensity, would be showing most anxiety (because of the unpredictability of the shock) and thus I do wonder, does it not fit the author's story for BNST-inactivation to be having an effect here?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46525.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The primary problem, which is mentioned in each review but came out more strongly as an issue requiring further experimentation in the online discussion, is the lack of clear evidence that backward and forward conditioning differ primarily in the uncertainty of the prediction.

We have expanded the introduction and discussion to better describe the rational and significance of using the forward and backward procedures, and the caveats that are involved in their use. While BW CSs can be used to signal safety, this generally requires a significant number of training trials for discrete CSs. Nonetheless, there is evidence that a BW CS can serve as a conditioned excitor (Chang et al., 2003, and othersâsee text), which may depend on contextual conditioning and may occur prior to the transition of the signal becoming a conditioned inhibitor. In our hands, the BW training procedure appeared to serve as a conditioned excitor, as evidenced by the increases in freezing we observed following onset of the BW CS and by the lack of increases we see for animals not receiving the CS at test. Regarding uncertainty, we have added an additional experiment which explores the contribution of the BNST to CS that was conditioned using uncertain timing of shock following the offset of the CS. Inactivation of the BNST appeared to mirror the effect of its inactivation during exposure to a backwards CS. We now address in greater detail in the manuscript these outcomes, and how they might explain contributions of the BNST to ambiguous threats.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Perhaps related to this, I am a bit unclear on the significance of the data in Figure 3.

At this time, we have not explicitly addressed whether BNST inactivation reduces the magnitude of activity bursts, but this may be a reasonable expectation. Regarding correlations between behavior and Fos expression, correlations of gross freezing profiles of BW or FW rats did not reveal significant relationships with Fos, suggesting that fear CS exposure was more predictive of Fos expression than freezing performance <italic>per se</italic>. We have noted these findings in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[â¦] The inactivation, tracing and c-Fos imaging methods are all appropriate and are the strength of the manuscript.

That said, we have now added a separate experiment that includes a group of animals that were given footshock US presentations in the absence of any discrete CS; these same rats were later tested in the presence of the novel auditory tone. The results indicated that freezing was not increased after onset of the nonconditioned tone for these animals. We believe this further suggests that there are associative mechanisms involved in the expression of the freezing to the BW-trained CS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) ANOVA for Experiment 1 was adequately performed and the main effects &amp; interactions reflect the patterns in the data.

Nonetheless, CS-elicited freezing is still substantial in all groups (as indicated by the baseline subtraction). In other words, the freezing in the presence of the CS is only increased relative to the baseline and is not masked by it. Thus, and with more animals, the BNST inactivation may reduce contextual generalization for the variable animals, but it does appear that this would prevent the freezing elicited by the CS itself (as freezing levels are equivalent in the baseline subtraction and is similar in both drug groups).

Indeed, our argument is that both the fixed and variable US magnitude groups are trained with a sense of temporal certainty (i.e., the shock is coming soon), but differ in the expectation of the magnitude of the outcome. We wished to include these data as it may help to address whether the BNST contributes to learning about cues that predict variable aversive outcomes (which may be distinct from temporal uncertainty). While we did not address probabilistic cues in this manuscript (as we wanted to equate US exposure, in particular), we have added an additional experiment which includes random timing of shock, which may help with the overall interpretation of the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[â¦] However, I do have a couple of major issues that would have to be addressed regarding whether these data do actually warrant the conclusion that the BNST is mediating fear learning to temporally ambiguous stimuli and not to stimuli that are otherwise ambiguous. I will explain these in more detail below.</p><p>1) My first question is exactly how ambiguous is a backwards CS using the particular parameters that were employed in this manuscript? Specifically, according to the Materials and methods section, the shock US always precedes the backwards CS, and the intertrial intervals are always 70 seconds. As such, the animal can actually perfectly predict when the shock US will occur using temporal information, including how long it has been since the offset of the backwards CS. If the authors wanted to use a truly temporally ambiguous CS, then would it not make more sense to deliver the shock randomly during the CS presentation? Or alternatively, to randomly alter the length of the intertrial interval?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, this is a fair point with regards to the issue of timing. Indeed, it is possible that the animals could be using the static intervals to be timing the onset of shock (the same could be said for the FW groups, which are separated by the same duration of intervals). Nevertheless, we have added an additional experiment that explicitly modulates the timing of the shock, relative to the CS. Specifically, animals received presentations of the CS with randomized onset of shock following CS offset. BNST inactivation appeared to reduce freezing to a similar extent as the BW CS, suggesting similar roles for the BNST in both. That said, we have modified the text to better clarify the interpretations of our data set.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another method that could be used to increase the ambiguity of a backwards CS is different intervals between US offset and CS onset, which have been demonstrated to produce excitatory (short intervals 0-4 seconds) versus inhibitory (longer intervals &gt; 10seconds) conditioning, whereas intermediate intervals (4-10seconds) have been shown to produce either type of conditioning (e.g. Sanderson et al., 2014; Hellstern et al., 1998; Delamater et al., 2003). Thus, a backwards CS with a US offset-CS onset interval of 4-10 seconds would perhaps be more 'ambiguous'. Of course, once again if the intertrial intervals are kept consistent at 70 seconds then it would still be questionable whether the US is still &quot;temporally unpredictable.&quot;</p><p>At minimum, I think an experiment showing the involvement of the BNST in regulating fear to a CS that is truly ambiguous (and not predicted by precise intertrial intervals) is necessary to complete this dataset.</p></disp-quote><p>These are important points and important studies. Indeed, and as mentioned in the previous response, we have included an experiment where we modulated the intervals between CS offset and US onset at each trial (impeding the ability the animals to properly time the onset of the US). As was similar for BNST inactivation in the presence of a BW CS, we found BNST inactivation reduced freezing to the randomized CS. We have edited the text to incorporate these new data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There is another sense in which a backwards CS is not really ambiguous, and that is because when the animal receives the backwards CS, they can be sure that they wonât receive the US for at least the duration of that CS and a period of time afterwards. However, on test when the animal does not receive the US prior to CS onset, perhaps the effect of these altered conditions is to introduce some ambiguity (i.e. the shock that yesterday preceded the backwards CS has not yet occurred, therefore it seems possible that it may occur on test). However, the forwards CS also of course suffers this same type of ambiguity when the US does not follow its presentation, such that every presentation after the first might also be rendered ambiguous, and yet BNST inactivation does not affect freezing to the forwards CS. It might be that the types of ambiguity rendered on test to the two types of CSs might manifest differently, but it would be good if the authors could discuss how. Also, more experiments could be needed: BNST affected CS where shock is delivered in a temporally unpredictable manner during CS presentation, and showing a similar effect, OR having an effect on a backwards CS with a US offset-CS onset interval between 4-10 seconds. Finally, a Fos study where animals are sacrificed following a 'test' session during which USs are actually delivered, and the differences in vBNST Fos persist, would provide stronger evidence that it is the ambiguity produced by the different predictiveness of the two types of CSs, rather than the ambiguity produced by the test session.</p></disp-quote><p>These are fair points. As per the other responses, we have included new data that directly modulates timing of shock onset, which may best address the possibility of BNST contributions to cues of uncertain timing of shock (see above). However, in the current data set, we cannot remove the possibility that the absence of the US at the test doesnât contribute to a sense of ambiguity that is sensitive to BNST inactivation (but, as mentioned, this would be true for both the FW and BW CS, in which BNST inactivation was selective only to the BW CS). Additionally, the presence of shocks at test would be somewhat confounded by the new learning that would take place as a result. We do not have Fos data to speak to contributions of the BNST at the time of a retrieval session that includes the presence of shocks. That said, we have cited studies that have found Fos in the BNST after shock exposure generally, so it may be difficult to isolate recall-induced Fos in the BNST in the presence of shocks from new learning-induced Fos activation in the BNST (which is why, in part, we tested animals in a shock-free state).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It looks, to me at least, like there might actually be an effect of BNST inactivation in the variable US intensity experiment (results in Figure 4), particularly on the test (4B), although the authors do not report it as such. From the figure, the difference in freezing on test between fixed-veh and variable-veh looks much larger than the difference between fixed-mus and variable-mus. I understand that the interaction is not significant, but the F is high-ish at at 2.7, p &gt;.15 (Results section). Certainly, with the number of animals in this kind of study the authors would have at best a small-medium amount of power to detect a medium effect size. This then begs the question that if more animals were added, would this effect become significant, and most importantly, within the population about which the authors are making inferences, is this an effect? If this were an effect with more animals added, then does it matter? Surely it would simply mean that the BNST is involved in multiple situations of ambiguity of fear predictiveness, rather than just temporally ambiguous stimuli.</p></disp-quote><p>Similar to what we discussed above, it is possible that the null results are due to the lower number of animals compared to the other experiments. However, the potential effect seems to be driven by differences in the baseline freezing, which is why we include the baseline subtraction data. In other words, the effect we are seeing is the result of BNST inactivation on generalized context fear (or sensitized responding more generally), but not CS-elicited fear (as it is riding on top of the baseline). Subtracting the baseline does not eliminate the significant increase in CS-elicited freezing (regardless of drug treatment). Conversely, BNST inactivation eliminated CS-elicited freezing to the 12-trial BW CS (and for the RANDOM CS), regardless of the baseline.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors subtract baseline freezing to show that (Figure 4B right panel), when higher baseline freezing is taken into account, the rats in fact freeze equally among groups. They justify this by saying the baseline freezing was not significantly different between groups, but the F here really does appear to approach significance (3.6, p &gt;.05, Results section), and as the authors note, freezing looks highest in 'variable-veh' at baseline. This is the group that, having received shocks of variable intensity, would be showing most anxiety (because of the unpredictability of the shock) and thus I do wonder, does it not fit the author's story for BNST-inactivation to be having an effect here?</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified these points in the text (also, see responses above). Indeed, we believe the heightened freezing at baseline is consistent with a role for the BNST in generalized context fear (which may involve some BNST-dependent sensitization), but nevertheless, these potential impacts of BNST inactivation on freezing are specific to the baseline (but not the CS-elicited freezing, as indicated by the increase in freezing regardless of baseline levels), suggesting that CS-elicited freezing to the variable FW CS is not dependent on the BNST for expression.</p></body></sub-article></article>
