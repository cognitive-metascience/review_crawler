This neuroplasticity is thought to occur primarily through structural and functional changes in pre-existing neurons. Whether neurogenesis also mediates the effects of experience on brain growth is unclear. Here, we characterized the importance of motor experience on postembryonic neurogenesis in larval zebrafish. We found that movement maintains an expanded pool of forebrain neural precursors by promoting progenitor self-renewal over the production of neurons. Physical cues associated with swimming (bodily movement) increase neurogenesis and these cues appear to be conveyed by dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in the zebrafish body: DRG-deficient larvae exhibit attenuated neurogenic responses to movement and targeted photoactivation of DRG in immobilized larvae expands the pallial pool of proliferative cells. Our results demonstrate the importance of movement in neurogenic brain growth and reveal a fundamental sensorimotor association that may couple early motor and brain development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31045.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Sensory experiences early in life help the brain to grow and develop. For example, raising animals in complete darkness stops the visual areas of their brain from forming properly. Previous studies have shown that sensory input helps to strengthen the connections between already existing brain cells, but it is unclear if it affects the actual creation of new brain cells.</p><p>Conditions that reduce the mobility of young children, such as muscular disease, are often accompanied by learning difficulties. This suggests that physical movement may be important for healthy brain development. Scientists have previously found a link between exercise and an increased production of new brain cells in adults. However, such a link has not been established earlier in life, when the brain is developing the most.</p><p>To address this, Hall and Tropepe studied how movement affects the brain development in zebrafish larvae, at an age when many of their brain cells are created. Restraining the larvae decreased their physical movement, while making them swim against a current increased their movement. Hall et al. looked at how this affected the larvae’s number of so called progenitor cells – the cells from which brain cells are created. When the larvae moved less, the number of progenitor cells decreased. But when they moved more frequently, the amount of progenitor cells increased.</p><p>The experiments also showed that some sensory cells, which detect sensations associated with movement of the body during swimming, are linked to brain cell production. Blocking the development of these sensory cells prevented the rise in progenitor cells seen with increased movement in the larvae. However, activating these sensory cells in immobilised larvae increased the number of progenitor cells, even though the larvae could not move. These findings suggest that measures to increase physical movement in young children could be used to help the brain develop normally.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>brain</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd><kwd>motor experience</kwd><kwd>dorsal root ganglia</kwd><kwd>neural stem cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Post-doctoral fellowship (PDF 454019-2014)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>Zachary Jonas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Discovery grant (RGPIN-2016-06325)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tropepe</surname><given-names>Vincent</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Early postembryonic bodily movement sends neural feedback through dorsal root ganglia to the forebrain in order to regulate the rate of neurogenesis and subsequent brain growth.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During postembryonic development, the brain begins processing sensory information from the environment for the first time and continues to grow, exhibiting elevated levels of neuroplasticity compared to later stages of life. The combination of these factors makes postembryonic brain development highly susceptible to sensory experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Knudsen, 2004</xref>). This susceptibility to experience is evident in the ‘critical’ and ‘sensitive’ periods early in life, in which sensory experiences drive permanent or near permanent changes in brain structure and function, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Knudsen, 2004</xref>). Historically, neuroplastic changes associated with early sensory experience were thought to be restricted to structural and functional changes in pre-existing neurons, such as visual experience-dependent synaptic remodeling in thalamocortical projections associated with the development of ocular dominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coleman et al., 2010</xref>). However, neurogenesis persists postembryonically throughout the brain, either ceasing or curtailing in adolescence or adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lindsey and Tropepe, 2006</xref>). Some neuronal populations appear to be uniquely generated during postembryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wei et al., 2011</xref>), and this process may be regulated by sensory experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">He et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, neurogenesis may also mediate the effects of early experience on brain development.</p><p>Outside of postembryonic development, one of the best-characterized models of experience-dependent regulation of neurogenesis is the increase in cell proliferation in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus in the adult mammalian hippocampus (HP) following periods of aerobic running exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van Praag et al., 1999a</xref>). Since its initial discovery, studies have gone on to link exercise-induced neurogenesis to improvements in cognition, such as spatial learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van Praag et al., 1999b</xref>) and cognitive flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anacker and Hen, 2017</xref>). Studies have also incorporated exercise as a therapeutic intervention to combat neuropsychiatric disorders associated with impaired neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vakhrusheva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kandola et al., 2016</xref>). However, whether physical activity affects forebrain neurogenesis during postembryonic development, when animals first gain control of their movements while exhibiting elevated levels of neurogenesis throughout the brain compared to adulthood, remains unexplored. Furthermore, such a relationship between movement and forebrain growth early in development may help explain the positive correlation between physical activity and cognitive function reported in human children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tomporowski et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Best, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Here, we sought to investigate the relationship between movement and neurogenesis in larval zebrafish during a developmental period in which they first begin to exhibit voluntary movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buss and Drapeau, 2001</xref>), have brains and peripheral nervous systems sufficiently developed to process sensory input, and continue to exhibit elevated rates of neurogenesis in many brain divisions compared to adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lindsey and Tropepe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feliciano et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to the well-documented advantages of larval zebrafish as models for genetic and pharmacological tractability, here we also use them for our ability to control the sensory experiences of larvae, enabling the isolation of different sensory cues associated with movement to identify the nature of sensory feedback driving neurogenic change. We first developed paradigms to both reduce and increase swimming behaviour in larvae and sample for changes in neurogenesis in the forebrain. We then sought to isolate the different sensory cues associated with movement and identify which cue drives a neurogenic response in the forebrain. Finally, we tested whether dorsal root ganglia (DRG), sensory neurons that convey mechanical sensations from the zebrafish trunk, are required to mediate movement-dependent neurogenesis. We did this by both pharmacologically generating larvae deficient in DRG along the trunk and by stimulating the DRG via photoactivation of ankyrin-containing transient receptor potential channels (TRPA1b) in completely immobilized larvae. Altogether, we present a novel and robust relationship between movement and postembryonic forebrain neurogenesis, demonstrating that neural feedback associated with physical movement may provide a simple mechanism through which motor and brain development become coupled early in life.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>All statistical tests are preceded by a superscript numeral that can be used to reference that test in our calculations of statistical powers, summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31045.003</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Statistical powers derived from posthoc power calculations for all major findings.</title><p>All power analyses were performed using G*Power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Faul et al., 2007</xref>).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Statistical test</th><th valign="top">Power (1-β error probability)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">1</td><td valign="top">0.999</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">2</td><td valign="top">1.000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">3</td><td valign="top">1.000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">4</td><td valign="top">0.983</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">5</td><td valign="top">0.159</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">6</td><td valign="top">0.053</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">7</td><td valign="top">0.939</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">8</td><td valign="top">0.840</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">9</td><td valign="top">0.999</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">10</td><td valign="top">0.076</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">11</td><td valign="top">0.110</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">12</td><td valign="top">0.956</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">13</td><td valign="top">0.886</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">14</td><td valign="top">0.062</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">15</td><td valign="top">0.998</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">16</td><td valign="top">0.814</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">17</td><td valign="top">0.060</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">18</td><td valign="top">0.101</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">19</td><td valign="top">0.164</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">20</td><td valign="top">0.918</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">21</td><td valign="top">0.992</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">22</td><td valign="top">0.383</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">23</td><td valign="top">0.683</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">24</td><td valign="top">0.226</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">25</td><td valign="top">0.702</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">26</td><td valign="top">0.212</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">27</td><td valign="top">0.600</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">28</td><td valign="top">0.052</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">29</td><td valign="top">0.910</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">30</td><td valign="top">0.420</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">31</td><td valign="top">0.075</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">32</td><td valign="top">0.050</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">33</td><td valign="top">1.000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">34</td><td valign="top">0.836</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">35</td><td valign="top">0.603</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">36</td><td valign="top">1.000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">37</td><td valign="top">1.000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">38</td><td valign="top">1.000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">39</td><td valign="top">0.585</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">40</td><td valign="top">0.575</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s2-1"><title>Movement restraint reduces swimming episodes without impairing swimming ability</title><p>We first established a paradigm through which we could control the amount of swimming exhibited by zebrafish larvae noninvasively.

We reasoned that a reduction in this cell population might occur when either proliferative cells generate more differentiated cells at the expense of self-renewal, reducing the size of the proliferative population over successive divisions, or by apoptosis in the proliferative population. To sample cell differentiation in these forebrain populations, we exposed larvae to 5 mM 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), a synthetic thymidine analog that is incorporated in dividing cells, for 24 hr starting on 5 dpf, then sampled the proportion of EdU+ cells that also express Elavl3 protein, a marker of cells with a differentiated neuronal fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lindsey et al., 2012</xref>). If movement restraint biased the production of differentiating cells over progenitor self-renewal, we would predict that restrained larvae would exhibit more EdU+ cells that co-expressed Elavl3. Movement restraint significantly increased the proportion of newly generated cells that co-label with Elavl3 in both the pallium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>; <sup>15</sup>t<sub>6</sub> = 6.02, p&lt;0.01) and subpallium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N–T</xref>; <sup>16</sup>t<sub>6</sub> = 3.43, p=0.01) without affecting the absolute number of EdU+ cells produced in the pallium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>; <sup>17</sup>t<sub>6</sub> = 0.35, p=0.74) or subpallium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F</xref>; <sup>18</sup>t<sub>7</sub> = 0.73, p=0.49). Conversely, movement restraint did not affect the number of cells expressing the apoptotic marker activated caspase-3 (Casp3) in the forebrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2G</xref>; <sup>19</sup>t<sub>7</sub> = 1.06, p=0.32) by 6 dpf. By 9 dpf, however, movement restraint significantly increased the number of activated Casp3+ cells in the forebrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2H</xref>; <sup>20</sup>t<sub>13</sub> = 3.56, p&lt;0.01). This increase in apoptosis at 9 dpf was specific to the pallium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2I</xref>; <sup>21</sup>U = 1, p&lt;0.01) and not found in the subpallium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2J</xref>; <sup>22</sup>t<sub>13</sub> = 1.76, p=0.10). Despite this increase in pallial apoptosis, cell death rates remained low by 9 dpf and Casp3+ cells were not observed along the midline or dorsal surface of the brain, where the neurogenic niche lies. Together, these findings suggest that movement restraint biased newly generated cells to differentiate into neurons, ultimately at the expense of self-renewal.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Rearing larvae against a strong current increases the size of the pallial proliferative cell population</title><p>Because physical restraint may restrict more than just movement (i.e., reducing sensory input in a smaller space), we tested whether increasing movement could also impact forebrain cell proliferation.

On 9 dpf, the size of both brain regions was not affected by rearing treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

Previous work has focused on coupling increased physical activity via aerobic exercise with increases in cell proliferation in the adult mammalian SGZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fabel and Kempermann, 2008</xref>). Here, we found that physical activity also modulates forebrain cell proliferation postembryonically in the larval zebrafish pallium. Whereas we found that increased physical activity in fish led to an increase in pallial cell proliferation, we also report a negative neurogenic response when movement is reduced via restraint or immobilization. In the most extreme case, restricting larval movement resulted in the near absence of a proliferative population in the pallium by 9 dpf, even though these larvae were fully capable of swimming normally thereafter. Furthermore, we found that these changes in progenitor populations had subsequent impacts on neurogenic brain growth: restrained larvae, who exhibit reduced pallial cell proliferation by 6 dpf, develop smaller forebrains by 9 dpf due to a combination of reduced neurogenesis and, to a lesser extent, pallial cell apoptosis.</p><p>The mechanisms through which the neurogenic niche is affected by exercise in the adult rodent hippocampus include proposed changes in cell fate, cell cycling, and apoptosis in neural precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Overall et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we found that, postembryonically, movement appears to maintain proliferative cell populations in the zebrafish pallium primarily by promoting self-renewal in neural progenitor cell populations whereas restraining movement promoted their premature differentiation. Because control and restrained larvae produced the same number of cells in the forebrain from 5 to 6 dpf, movement-dependent regulation of postembryonic forebrain cell proliferation appears to occur predominantly through regulating self-renewal and the production of differentiated cells over factors that might affect the absolute number of cells produced, such as cell cycle length. Within the neurogenic niche, movement-dependent maintenance of the progenitor pool may involve the Shh signaling pathway, which expands progenitor populations via symmetric cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Machold et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Collectively, our findings demonstrate the importance of movement in maintaining a source of new neurons to support forebrain growth postembryonically and present zebrafish as a novel model in which movement modulates early brain development over the course of a few days.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Movement produces non-visual, non-lateral line neural feedback conveyed via DRG to affect pallial neurogenesis</title><p>In addition to characterizing the relationship between movement and postembryonic neurogenesis in the forebrain, we also sought to identify the nature of the feedback signal associated with movement that drives this neurogenic change. We found that physical cues associated with movement send ascending neural feedback to the brain via DRGs to drive changes in neurogenesis. Specifically, larvae deficient in DRGs along their trunk exhibited an attenuated neurogenic responses to swimming compared to controls. However, we still found significant modulation of pallial cell proliferation on 9 dpf in DRG-deficient larvae. This continued modulation of neurogenesis in the older larvae may be attributed to the nature of our treatment, which blocks the development of DRGs along the trunk, but does not affect DRG populations that are derived from neural crest cells in the head that may also signal movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Honjo et al., 2008</xref>). Other proposed mechanisms of movement-dependent neurogenesis, such as the circulation of growth factors proposed to mediate exercise-dependent adult neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cotman et al., 2007</xref>), and other mechanosensory cell populations, such as Rohon-Beard cells, may also play a role in driving motor experience-dependent neurogenic brain development. A previous study has demonstrated that treating zebrafish embryos with AG1478 can impair proliferation during embryogenesis in the zebrafish optic tectum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sato et al., 2015</xref>). In that study, changes in tectal neurogenesis were observed using a near 8-fold increase in AG1478 concentration (compared to that used here) and neurogenesis was found to resume normally within hours following drug washout. Recognizing the possibility of a lasting effect of early AG1478 treatment, we sampled forebrain neurogenesis in 3 dpf larvae treated earlier with AG1478 or DMSO and found no effect of AG1478 treatment on pallial neurogenesis prior to movement or Optovin manipulations. We also found that earlier AG1478 treatment had no effect of pallium size in restrained or unrestrained control larvae by 6 dpf. In conjunction with our original movement and Optovin experiments, which do not include AG1478 manipulations, our results suggest that motor experience-dependent neurogenesis is mediated, in part, via peripheral neural feedback and is likely not attributed to early AG1478 treatment. However, future work would benefit by contrasting the results obtained here with larvae in which DRG development is blocked using alternative means. Furthermore, the ErbB signaling inhibitor used in our studies may have non-neural effects on skin or heart development. Although it is unlikely that these could be a factor in determining transmission of movement information to the brain to alter forebrain neurogenesis, this could be examined in the future.</p><p>Using completely immobilized larvae, we were able to stimulate pallial cell proliferation by stimulating DRG along with other cells. Furthermore, this increase in pallial cell proliferation due to stimulation was not observed in larvae deficient in trunk DRGs. In conjunction with our studies reducing specific DRG populations along the trunk, our results suggest that neural feedback associated with movement is sensed predominantly by DRG and that DRG activation is sufficient to expand a progenitor pool in the forebrain. This previously undocumented role for DRG in conveying physical cues associated with movement to expand pools of forebrain progenitors may in turn provide a larger source of neurons and support more neurogenic brain growth in the most active animals.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>DRG are essential to receiving sensory input associated with movement independent of the lateral line</title><p>We found that physical movement of the body was the most important component of movement driving pallial neurogenesis. Accordingly, we propose that movement triggers mechanosensory input detected by DRGs that are then sent to the brain. In zebrafish larvae, mechanosensory input is most likely to come from one of three sources. The first possibility is the lateral line, which detects changes in water flow and vibration in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dijkgraaf, 1963</xref>). Here, ototoxic ablation of this system had no impact on pallial proliferation, suggesting it does not play a role in maintaining pallial progenitor populations. Second, Rohon-Beard (RB) cells, an early-developing population of spinal neurons, transmit mechanosensory signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Faucherre et al., 2013</xref>) and contain TRPA1b receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Prober et al., 2008</xref>) that can be activated by Optovin stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kokel et al., 2013</xref>). Originally, RB cells were thought to die off entirely by 4 dpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reyes et al., 2004</xref>), but subsequent work using transgenic markers suggests they may persist up to 1–2 weeks post-fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kucenas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Palanca et al., 2013</xref>). Our studies showed that early AG1478 treatment, which specifically affected DRG development with resident RB cell populations remaining unaffected, blocked the Optovin-induced increase in proportional PCNA+ cells in the pallium following light presentations, suggesting DRG and not RB are responsible for the increase in pallial neurogenesis following Optovin and light treatment. However, our data indicate that RBs may also contribute to motor experience-dependent pallial cell proliferation, particularly in DRG-deficient larvae by 9 dpf. Finally, DRGs can transmit mechanosensory information from the trunk owing to the array of sensory channels they contain including TRPA1b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kokel et al., 2013</xref>). Because both the removal and activation of DRGs produced neurogenic consequences in the pallium, we propose that these sensory neurons are the primary mediators of movement-dependent postembryonic neurogenesis.</p><p>TRPA1 channels exhibit deep evolutionary conservation across vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christensen and Corey, 2007</xref>). Zebrafish have two orthologs of the TRPA1 channel: only TRPA1b, however, likely processes external signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Prober et al., 2008</xref>) and is activated by Optovin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kokel et al., 2013</xref>). Whereas TRPA1 function has been implicated in touch stimuli in DRG of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kwan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brierley et al., 2011</xref>) and sensory neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kindt et al., 2007</xref>), this channel is also associated with transducing chemosensory and nociceptive input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Prober et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we found evidence suggesting a novel function for TRPA1 in transducing physical cues associated with bodily movement during locomotion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Movement and neurogenic brain growth are coupled early in life</title><p>Our results demonstrate a robust connection between motor and brain development during postembryonic development.

Therefore, if conserved across taxa, this close relationship between movement and neurogenesis may couple early motor and brain development. Furthermore, this relationship could help explain correlations between early physical and mental development, such as the long-observed comorbidity of physical and mental impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnett et al., 2012</xref>) and correlation between sedentary lifestyle and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anton et al., 2006</xref>), which has been previously associated with impaired neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jacobs et al., 2000</xref>), in children.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td>Tg(dlx5/6:gfp)</td><td/><td>ZFIN ID: ZDB-FISH-150901–22615</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td>Tg(GFAP:gfp)</td><td/><td>ZFIN ID: ZDB-ALT-060623–4</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td>Tg(βactin:gfp)</td><td/><td valign="bottom">ZFIN ID: ZDB-ALT-061107–2</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td>Tg(isl2b:gfp)</td><td/><td>ZFIN ID: ZDB-FISH-150901–2212</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Zebralab</td><td>ViewPoint, Montreal, Canada</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>IMARIS</td><td>Bitplane, Belfast, United Kingdom</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>mouse anti-Human Neuronal Protein HuC/HuD</td><td>Life Technologies, Waltham, Massachusetts</td><td>A-21271; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_221448">AB_221448</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>mouse anti-PCNA</td><td>Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California</td><td>MA5-11358; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10982348">AB_10982348</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rabbit anti-activated caspase 3</td><td>Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Massachusetts</td><td>Asp175; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2341188">AB_2341188</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rabbit anti-GFP alexa 488-conjugated</td><td>Life Technologies, Waltham, Massachusetts</td><td>A-21311; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_221477">AB_221477</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rabbit anti-tbr2</td><td>Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom</td><td>ab23345; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_778267">AB_778267</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse</td><td>Jackson ImmunoReseach, West Grove, Pennsylvania</td><td>115-165-146; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2338690">AB_2338690</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit</td><td>Jackson ImmunoReseach, West Grove, Pennsylvania</td><td>111-165-003; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2338000">AB_2338000</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Cy2-conjugated goat anti-rabbit</td><td>Jackson ImmunoReseach, West Grove, Pennsylvania</td><td>111-225-114</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>AG1478</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>T4182 SIGMA</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Optovin</td><td>Hit2Lead, San Diego, California</td><td>Chemibridge ID#5707191</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All zebrafish used in this study were of an AB genetic background.

All adult zebrafish crossings included 2–3 male and female fish. Larvae were collected on the day of fertilization in system water and moved to a dark incubator held at 28°C. On 1 dpf, larval water was bleached for 30 s, rinsed four times with fresh system water, and larvae were dechorionated using forceps, before being returned to the incubator. From 3 dpf onward (dpf), larvae were housed in a facility room held under a 14/10 light/dark cycle at 28°C (Lights on at 08:00/Lights off at 22:00; light intensity = 300 lux). Larvae housed individually in well plates had half of their system water replaced twice daily (at 08:00 and 14:00). From 5 dpf onward, larvae were also fed size 0 zebrafish food (Gemma Micro; Skretting, Tooele, Utah) twice daily immediately following water changes. Zebralab (ViewPoint, Montreal, Canada) recordings were made in a separate testing room with similar environmental conditions as the fish facility. After recordings, all larvae were returned to the housing facility. In all experiments aside from those involving movement tracking (see below), larvae were randomly assigned to experimental conditions from the same clutch prior to experimental manipulations. Minimum sample sizes were selected to mirror those in preliminary experiments and our initial findings reported here, in which we found that restraint influenced the number of proliferative cells in the forebrain. Following all experimental procedures, larvae were sacrificed using an overdose of tricaine prior to tissue collection and fixation (see below).

Following a 30 min habituation period, swimming was recorded for 4 hr before larvae were moved into fresh system water in a new tray and returned into the Zebrabox recording apparatus for a 30 min habituation and then an additional 4 hr of swimming before being returned to the facility room (at 17:00). On 6 and 8 dpf, larvae were also fed prior to habituation in the morning (at 08:00) and between recording sessions (at 13:00). Because only single trays of larvae were recorded in a session, restraint and control groups were reared as cohorts offset by 1 day and, accordingly, were recorded on alternating days. In all movement tracking experiments, we used 2 tanks of mixed-sex adult zebrafish (each containing 3 males and 3 females) from the same genetic background to generate each cohort. To control for genetic variation between families, parentage was reversed and balanced between treatment groups in subsequent cohorts. For example, the tank of adult zebrafish crossed to generate the control group in our first cohort was crossed to generate the restraint group in our second cohort. Tracking experiments were repeated to achieve the sample sizes reported here and included at least two cohorts.

Once set, additional warmed agarose was added around the embedded larvae to secure the embedded larvae in the well.

Gratings were displayed on a Dell P2212Hb computer monitor mounted horizontally, with plastic trays containing immobilized larvae sitting on top of the screen. In pilot experiments, grating bandwidth and speed were adjusted such that they would drive 6 dpf free-swimming larvae in a petri dish placed on the screen to swim along the grating axis.

Olfactory bulb sampling was only possible in single, 20 µm sections and both hemispheres were sampled together. Both pallial and subpallial PCNA+, Hoechst+, tbr2+, and GFAP+ cell sampling were performed across both hemispheres in three consecutive, 20 µm sections for all histology involving 6 and 9 dpf larvae. PCNA +cell sampling in 3 dpf used only two consecutive coronal sections, as the telencephalon was not sufficiently grown to span 3 consecutive sections. Optic tectum sampling on 6 dpf was performed on the first coronal section posterior to the tectal neuropil, sampled in and averaged across both hemispheres in each brain.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We define a biological replicate as an individual larvae derived from a mixed clutch borne of at least two male and two female adult zebrafish. Whereas we did not perform any technical replicates of our experiments, which we define as a complete repetition of a single experiment, we instead replicated our main findings by either repeating them in later, more elaborate experiments (for example, control vs. restraint paradigms in both initial experiments and AG1478 experiments) or repeating experiments over multiple time courses (for example, identifying the effects of exercise on forebrain neuroproliferation by both 6 and 9 dpf). All statistical test results are preceded by a superscript numeral enabling reference to each test in our calculations of statistical power summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. In experiments involving two groups, treatment groups were compared using Student’s t-test or, when parametric assumptions were not met, Mann-Whitney U tests. In experiments involving three or more groups, treatment groups were compared using either one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA (with a within-groups variable for repeated data). All post hoc comparisons were made using Tukey’s test with a correction for multiple comparisons. When neural precursor counts (PCNA+, tbr2+, and GFAP+ cells) were reanalyzed using the absolute number of cells/section (instead of corrected for the number of Hoechst+/cells), similar results were obtained as present here.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Marc Ekker, Dr. Chi-Bin Chien, Dr. Ashley Bruce, Dr. Pierre Drapeau, and Dr. James Dowling for sharing reagents.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Laure Bally-Cuif (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Senior Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors address here whether feedback relationships exist between physical activity and forebrain neurogenesis in the early zebrafish larva. This is a very interesting and unresolved question in the broad context of how sensory and physical modalities shape brain development in vertebrates. The authors combine behavior assays (affecting physical or vision-faked locomotion), pharmacological assays (affecting the lateral line, DRGs or RB neurons) and neurogenesis quantifications, to conclude that physical locomotion is positively correlated with pallial neurogenesis, and that this effect is in part mediated by DRG activity.</p><p>Overall, this is a carefully designed and interpreted piece of work, resulting in an interesting and novel finding. The manuscript at this stage lacks any direct insight into the exact circuitry and (neuro)mediators involved but is certainly the first to identify a link between locomotion and neurogenesis during stages of pallial construction.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors start by designing a restraint system that prevents fish from swimming to the extent that they normally do in a 3.5 cm well. Importantly, not only does restraint affect forebrain proliferation, but it also affects overall growth. The authors show that between 6 and 9 dpf, restrained larvae grow less than unrestrained larvae, but that despite this effect on growth, restrained larvae and unrestrained larva of the same age swim the same amount. My biggest concern about this manuscript is that the authors have not addressed the extent to which the overall growth deficit of restrained larvae contributes to their forebrain neural proliferation deficit. A possible way to examine this issue would be to compare fish of the same size, for example older restrained larvae that are the same body length as younger unrestrained larvae and see whether this contributes to differences in the number of progenitors and differentiating neurons. Alternatively, the authors could select individual restrained and unrestrained larvae of the same age and size for direct comparisons. They may already have the data in hand for this experiment if they tracked the body length of all of the larvae they studied, but that information isn't included in the manuscript.</p><p>Understanding the role of overall growth on the effect of movement on forebrain neurogenesis is also an important consideration elsewhere in the manuscript. For example, was overall growth affected in the experiments in which larvae experienced different levels of water flow? The authors sampled the number of Hoechst positive cells per section as a proxy for forebrain size and concluded that brain size wasn't affected. But they don't elaborate on how many sections they examined per brain and whether brains of larvae from the two conditions had the same number of brain sections.</p><p>2) For most of the behavioral or pharmacological assays used (except for the starting point of the paper, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), the only read-out of &quot;neurogenesis&quot; is the number of PCNA-positive cells. The effects of restraining movements in a mesh are comprehensively analyzed by looking at proliferation (PCNA), cell types (Tbr2, GFAP), cell death (Cas3) and cell fate (EdU); however, PCNA is the sole measurement for all subsequent assays (in particular those serving as a control to movement restraint, such as excess swimming, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, or those assessing the role of DRGs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Given that key interpretations appear conclusive only when opposite manipulations are considered jointly (notably re. the role of DRGs), I see it as important to better assess the neurogenesis phenotype in the different paradigms used. I would suggest, at least, to assess neural progenitor cell fate (using EdU chase) in complement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p>3) Several points were raised about AG1478 and Optovin:</p><p>– The authors found that blocking DRG formation with AG1478 had a significant effect at 6 dpf that diminished considerably by 9 dpf, it is worth considering what other cell types might be involved. The authors discuss the possibility of RB neurons, but don't perform any tests. As the authors report, RBs also express TRPA1b receptors, so perhaps the activation experiments affect forebrain neurogenesis via both DRGs and RBs. There may be subpopulations of RBs, which could suggest that some RBs are involved, along with DRGs, in movement-induced forebrain neurogenesis, or that DRGs and RBs act at different times in the process. Second, in addition to a requirement for ErbB signaling in DRG formation, ErbB signaling is also known to affect Schwann cell development and myelination, cardiac development, and skin development. Although it seems unlikely that these could be a factor in determining transmission of motility information to the brain to alter forebrain neurogenesis, without ruling them out it isn't certain, so at least they should be acknowledged.</p><p>– The ErbB antagonist AG1478 impairs mitosis, so the effects of the apparent DRG ablation on proliferation could in fact be a direct effect of the antagonist on the proliferative cells themselves (see PMID 26001123). The proper interpretation for this study is that decreasing proliferation of PCNA (+) cells does not alter swimming behavior. Moreover, trpa1 has been shown to be expressed in mammalian somatosensory context and so, making the assumption that expression patterns are conserved across fish and mammals, activation with Optovin might mediate effects within the CNS rather than the DRG (see PMC5413904). Given the off-target effects of these reagents, nothing can be said from these particular data about the effects of DRGs on CNS proliferation.</p><p>4) Sample sizes and origins of samples don't seem to be optimized in this study. Moreover, it seems from the methods that controls, and experimental fish came from separate sets of parents? Clarification on the number of crosses used, the number of individuals used from a given cross, and how the genetic background or family was controlled in experimental design or statistics should be provided. What was the genetic background of these fish (i.e., tinbergen, oregon, AB, etc.) and was it consistent across experimental groups and experiments?</p><p>5) Given that the authors' major focus is on locomotor activity (LMA), given that LMA is under circadian control, and given that neuroblast migration in zebrafish is under circadian control, more attention and clarity to zeitgebers and zeitgeber time should be provided. It seems that the authors acknowledge the possibility of circadian effects at least superficially when reporting some of the times of day that experiments were performed. However, time of day doesn't really matter. Rather time after lights on, intensity of light prior to and during LMA recording, feeding times (esp. important in zebrafish as a zeitgeber) etc., would be more valuable factors to readers and the authors for determining whether circadian effects including time of day and masking (esp. in the Optovin treatment experiment) have confounded the data.

This is a very interesting and unresolved question in the broad context of how sensory and physical modalities shape brain development in vertebrates. The authors combine behavior assays (affecting physical or vision-faked locomotion), pharmacological assays (affecting the lateral line, DRGs or RB neurons) and neurogenesis quantifications, to conclude that physical locomotion is positively correlated with pallial neurogenesis, and that this effect is in part mediated by DRG activity.</p><p>Overall, this is a carefully designed and interpreted piece of work, resulting in an interesting and novel finding. The manuscript at this stage lacks any direct insight into the exact circuitry and (neuro)mediators involved but is certainly the first to identify a link between locomotion and neurogenesis during stages of pallial construction.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the positive feedback and appreciate the reviewer’s acknowledgement of the novelty of our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors start by designing a restraint system that prevents fish from swimming to the extent that they normally do in a 3.5 cm well. Importantly, not only does restraint affect forebrain proliferation, but it also affects overall growth. The authors show that between 6 and 9 dpf, restrained larvae grow less than unrestrained larvae, but that despite this effect on growth, restrained larvae and unrestrained larva of the same age swim the same amount. My biggest concern about this manuscript is that the authors have not addressed the extent to which the overall growth deficit of restrained larvae contributes to their forebrain neural proliferation deficit.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the concerns of the reviewers regarding the role of overall growth in the relationship between movement and forebrain neurogenesis. In the manuscript we provide a two-pronged approach demonstrating that body length can be dissociated from changes in the number of pallial PCNA<sup>+</sup> cells using paradigms in which movement is both restrained and increased.</p><p>1) First, we would like to reiterate data already present in the original manuscript demonstrating that changes in forebrain neurogenesis occur between groups of fish that are the same size but have different movement experiences. In our restraint studies, 6 dpf represents a time point in which body length is not different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) between restrained and control larvae, but the number of forebrain PCNA<sup>+</sup> cells is disproportionately lower in restrained larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B). This disproportionate decrease in the number of forebrain PCNA<sup>+</sup> cells is also notable in that no such differences were detected in these same treatment groups in either the olfactory bulb or optic tectum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>). Furthermore, we present new data summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> demonstrating that pallium and subpallium size did not differ on 6 dpf between control and restrained larvae. We concluded that by 6 dpf, movement experience could influence progenitor cell proliferation in the pallium without affecting overall growth of the brain or body. Nonetheless, this change in neuroproliferation in restrained larvae should ultimately have some consequence on brain growth. Thus, we opted to continue restraint until 9 dpf to characterize the developmental consequences of chronically reduced movement. Accordingly, we observed a decrease in forebrain size and this was also associated with an overall decrease in growth (body length). Thus, the forebrain neural proliferation deficit in restrained larvae precedes any overt changes in brain growth or body growth, which are only evident under relatively chronic (9 dpf) restraint conditions.</p><p>2) Second, we introduce new data demonstrating that when larvae were reared against strong water current, changes in forebrain neurogenesis could not be explained by changes in overall growth. We have incorporated this data into the manuscript to show that body length is not affected by fast water current rearing by 9 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), whereas the number of proportional PCNA<sup>+</sup> cells in the pallium is significantly higher in larvae reared in a fast current compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Furthermore, we show that fast water current rearing did not affect pallium size by 9 dpf (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), consistent with the notion that motor experience could affect neuroproliferation specifically without affecting overall growth. Along with 6 dpf larvae in our restraint paradigm, these two experiments demonstrate that movement-related changes in pallial neurogenesis cannot be explained by changes in overall growth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A possible way to examine this issue would be to compare fish of the same size, for example older restrained larvae that are the same body length as younger unrestrained larvae and see whether this contributes to differences in the number of progenitors and differentiating neurons. Alternatively, the authors could select individual restrained and unrestrained larvae of the same age and size for direct comparisons. They may already have the data in hand for this experiment if they tracked the body length of all of the larvae they studied, but that information isn't included in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>The first comparison proposed by the reviewer is interesting. However, we believe that comparing larvae of different age groups is complicated by potential age-related changes in neurogenesis that have been observed in the zebrafish brain later in life (e.g., PMID 23641971). Alternatively, the reviewer suggested we compare larvae of the same age and size for differences in forebrain neurogenesis. In our response to the comments above, we outline how this approach was the solution already taken in our restraint paradigm and is also supported by our newly added data on body length in fast water current-reared larvae as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Understanding the role of overall growth on the effect of movement on forebrain neurogenesis is also an important consideration elsewhere in the manuscript. For example, was overall growth affected in the experiments in which larvae experienced different levels of water flow? The authors sampled the number of Hoechst positive cells per section as a proxy for forebrain size and concluded that brain size wasn't affected. But they don't elaborate on how many sections they examined per brain and whether brains of larvae from the two conditions had the same number of brain sections.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed the question of whether overall growth was affected in the fast water current experiments above. To clarify our sampling paradigms used for all PCNA measurements, we have included both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, which depicts how brain regions were sampled in coronal micrographs, and a “Cell counting” subsection in our Methods section. Important to this specific comment, all 6 and 9 dpf larval forebrains were sampled across three consecutive coronal sections per brain in every treatment group. We apologize for this omission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) For most of the behavioral or pharmacological assays used (except for the starting point of the paper, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), the only read-out of &quot;neurogenesis&quot; is the number of PCNA-positive cells. The effects of restraining movements in a mesh are comprehensively analyzed by looking at proliferation (PCNA), cell types (Tbr2, GFAP), cell death (Cas3) and cell fate (EdU); however, PCNA is the sole measurement for all subsequent assays (in particular those serving as a control to movement restraint, such as excess swimming, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, or those assessing the role of DRGs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Given that key interpretations appear conclusive only when opposite manipulations are considered jointly (notably re. the role of DRGs), I see it as important to better assess the neurogenesis phenotype in the different paradigms used. I would suggest, at least, to assess neural progenitor cell fate (using EdU chase) in complement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment and agree that demonstrating whether forebrain neurogenesis is modulated similarly across our experiments is critical to understanding the impact of motor experience on postembryonic pallial development. As suggested by the reviewer, we have repeated our Elavl3/EdU co-labeling experiment for the two most relevant experiments complementing our restraint paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M, N</xref>), in larvae reared against a fast water current, and in larvae deficient in trunk DRGs. In our strong current-rearing experiment, we were unable to expose larvae to a complete 24 hours of EdU prior to sacrifice because fresh system water constantly passes the larvae during swimming sessions. Instead, after the second swim on 8 dpf, each treatment group was transported into a separate petri dish and exposed to 5 mM EdU for 13 hours overnight. Following EdU exposure, now on 9 dpf, larvae were transferred back into their swimming canals for a final 5 hour swim and then sacrificed. We found that larvae reared in a strong current exhibited a decrease in the number of EdU+Elavl3+ co-labeled cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), consistent with increased movement prioritizing the production of proliferative cell populations over differentiated neurons in the pallium. We also repeated the same EdU chase paradigm on unrestrained AG1478- and DMSO-treated larvae, to test whether a deficiency in trunk DRGs biases forebrain neurogenesis to produce more differentiated cells as seen following movement restraint. We found that 6 dpf AG1478-treated larvae exhibit an increase in the number of Elavl3/EdU co-labeled cells compared to DMSO-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>), similar to the effects of movement restraint. In both of these experiments, we noted that group differences in EdU/Elavl3 co-labeling are attenuated compared to those in our restraint experiment, which is consistent with a similar difference in magnitude reported in our PCNA labeling experiments when comparing similar treatment groups.</p><p>The reviewer also suggested incorporating this EdU pulse-chase paradigm into the experiment presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. However, because our tail movement vs. visual stimulation experiment included larvae that are differentially exposed to agarose (tail cut free compared to fully embedded), we believe this may interfere with the exposure of EdU dissolved in the system water differentially between groups potentially leading to technical complications in the labeling. Given this limitation, we feel that the new data described above adequately addresses the reviewer’s comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Several points were raised about AG1478 and Optovin:</p><p>– The authors found that blocking DRG formation with AG1478 had a significant effect at 6 dpf that diminished considerably by 9 dpf, it is worth considering what other cell types might be involved. The authors discuss the possibility of RB neurons, but don't perform any tests. As the authors report, RBs also express TRPA1b receptors, so perhaps the activation experiments affect forebrain neurogenesis via both DRGs and RBs. There may be subpopulations of RBs, which could suggest that some RBs are involved, along with DRGs, in movement-induced forebrain neurogenesis, or that DRGs and RBs act at different times in the process. Second, in addition to a requirement for ErbB signaling in DRG formation, ErbB signaling is also known to affect Schwann cell development and myelination, cardiac development, and skin development. Although it seems unlikely that these could be a factor in determining transmission of motility information to the brain to alter forebrain neurogenesis, without ruling them out it isn't certain, so at least they should be acknowledged.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we would like to clarify that our AG1478 experiments do not necessarily show a significant effect on 6 dpf that is diminished by 9 dpf. On 6 dpf, we found that DMSO-treated larvae exhibit a significant difference in the number of forebrain PCNA<sup>+</sup> cells between Control and Restraint groups, whereas no such difference was detectable in AG1478-treated larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, we were unable to resolve whether the number of pallial PCNA<sup>+</sup> cells differed between unrestrained larvae in the DMSO- and AG1478-treated groups. We believe clarifying this distinction was critical towards understanding the importance of DRG in movement-dependent pallial neurogenesis. To resolve this difference, we repeated the experiment and extended all treatments until 9 dpf. On 9 dpf, we found that unrestrained AG1478-treated larvae exhibit significantly less forebrain PCNA<sup>+</sup> cells than unrestrained DMSO-treated larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), suggesting DRG are at least partially involved in movement-dependent pallial neurogenesis. However, on 9 dpf we also found that AG1478-treated larvae still exhibit a degree of movement-dependent neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that trunk DRG play a role in mediating movement-dependent pallial neurogenesis, but that other mechanisms are also involved.</p><p>As mentioned by the reviewer, our Optovin treatment could possibly be mediated by RBs, which express TRPA1b receptors. This is an excellent point that needed to be addressed experimentally. Accordingly, we present new data in which we tested whether early treatment with AG1478 (to generate trunk DRG-deficient larvae that still have the normal number of RB cells) would block the Optovin-and-light-dependent increase in the number of pallial PCNA<sup>+</sup> cells from 5-6 dpf. All larvae were embedded in agarose on 3 dpf and, on 5 dpf, incubated with Optovin and exposed to the same light treatment paradigm as previously reported (both treatment groups together in the same Zebrabox at the same time). We found that AG1478-treated larvae failed to exhibit the increase in the number of pallial PCNA<sup>+</sup> cells following light-and-Optovin treatment compared to DMSO-treated larvae, with means of both groups consistent with those observed in our previous Optovin experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This finding suggests that DRG specifically mediate the Optovin-dependent increase in pallial PCNA from 5-6 dpf.</p><p>Together, these findings suggest that DRG play an important role in mediating movement-dependent pallial neurogenesis; however, other systems are likely involved. We have expounded on these points in the relevant Discussion section (subsection “Movement produces non-visual, non-lateral line neural feedback conveyed via DRG to affect pallial neurogenesis”; subsection “DRG are essential to receiving sensory input associated with movement independent of the lateral line”), including proposing a role for RB that may also contribute to a persistent difference in the number of pallial PCNA<sup>+</sup> cells between restrained and control 9 dpf larvae, even following AG1478 treatment.</p><p>Finally, the reviewer indicates the possibility of non-DRG specific effects of the inhibition of ErbB signalling. We agree with the reviewer that changes in skin, myelination, or cardiac development are less parsimonious possibilities for explaining the transmission of movement information to the brain to modulate neurogenesis. Nonetheless, as requested by the reviewer, we acknowledged these less likely possibilities for future consideration in the Discussion section (subsection “Movement produces non-visual, non-lateral line neural feedback conveyed via DRG to affect pallial neurogenesis”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The ErbB antagonist AG1478 impairs mitosis, so the effects of the apparent DRG ablation on proliferation could in fact be a direct effect of the antagonist on the proliferative cells themselves (see PMID 26001123). The proper interpretation for this study is that decreasing proliferation of PCNA (+) cells does not alter swimming behavior. Moreover, trpa1 has been shown to be expressed in mammalian somatosensory context and so, making the assumption that expression patterns are conserved across fish and mammals, activation with Optovin might mediate effects within the CNS rather than the DRG (see PMC5413904). Given the off-target effects of these reagents, nothing can be said from these particular data about the effects of DRGs on CNS proliferation.</p></disp-quote><p>With all due respect to the reviewer’s point that “…nothing can be said from these particular data about the effects of DRGs on CNS proliferation”, we believe there are several convincing reasons why a direct effect of the AG1478 on pallial progenitor cells does not explain our data.</p><p>1) We are aware that the study referenced by the reviewer (PMID 26001123) reported a direct effect of the AG1478 inhibitor on neuroproliferation in zebrafish embryos. However, there are significant differences in the methodologies of this study compared to those used in our manuscript. To mention one example, these authors used 30 µM of AG1478, which represents a 8-fold increase in concentration compared to our use of 4 µM. They also used a 2% DMSO solvent concentration for the drug and control treatment group, whereas we do not go above 0.4% DMSO. In our hands, 2% DMSO is highly toxic to embryos. Importantly, while these authors treated embryos from ~1 dpf to ~2 dpf and reported changes in proliferation in the optic tectum (not the forebrain), they also clearly showed that after the drug was washed out, the proliferation defects quickly normalized within hours of the washout period and was therefore completely reversible almost immediately. We would like to emphasize that every AG1478 treatment reported in our manuscript only involved exposing embryos to this drug at a much lower concentration from 8-30 hours post-fertilization (hpf), after which the drug was rinsed from the embryo media and larvae were never exposed to AG1478 again. In fact, we only start treating larvae in movement restraint or strong water currents at 3 dpf, which is almost 2 days after the washout of the AG1478 drug.</p><p>Previously aware of this finding in their paper, we tested whether 8-30 hpf treatment with the AG1478 would have lasting effects on forebrain structure or neurogenesis in larvae at 3 dpf, prior to any movement manipulations, in our original manuscript. We found no effect of earlier drug treatments on the number of PCNA<sup>+</sup> cells in the 3 dpf forebrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, we include new data in the revised manuscript demonstrating that this early AG1478 treatment did not affect pallium size on 3 or 6 dpf (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Accordingly, we disagree with the reviewer that our experiment was primarily a manipulation of mitosis followed by a swimming assay. Instead, our study shows that the AG1478 treatment effectively generates trunk DRG deficient larvae (as originally demonstrated by Cotman, Berchtold and Christie, (2007)) without impacting pallial neurogenesis or pallium growth directly prior to postembryonic movement manipulations.</p><p>2) Regarding the potential central expression of TRPA1 in zebrafish larvae, unlike mammals, zebrafish contain two paralogs of the TRPA1 gene, TRPA1a and TRPA1b. These paralogs exhibit largely segregated expression profiles. As mentioned in the manuscript, TRPA1b is the paralog upon which Optovin acts. Prober et al., (2008, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) found that TRPA1b is exclusively expressed in sensory ganglia and exhibits no central brain expression up to at least 5 dpf, the age at which we treated larvae with Optovin and light. We have added this detail to the manuscript (subsection “Activating DRG in immobilized larvae is sufficient to increase pallial neuroproliferation”). Consistent with the importance of TRPA1b in sensory ganglia mediating the Optovin response, Kokel et al., (2013, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) found that the Optovin-and-light-dependent motor response could be triggered in a spinalized adult zebrafish. Finally, as mentioned above, we present new data demonstrating the Optovin-dependent increase in the number of pallial PCNA<sup>+</sup> cells from 5-6 dpf can be blocked by prior AG1478 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), suggesting DRG play a critical role in mediating this neurogenic response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Sample sizes and origins of samples don't seem to be optimized in this study. Moreover, it seems from the methods that controls, and experimental fish came from separate sets of parents? Clarification on the number of crosses used, the number of individuals used from a given cross, and how the genetic background or family was controlled in experimental design or statistics should be provided. What was the genetic background of these fish (i.e., tinbergen, oregon, AB, etc.) and was it consistent across experimental groups and experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>As outlined in our original manuscript, sample sizes were selected based on preliminary experiments and the initial studies performed identifying a restraint-dependent reduction in forebrain PCNA (subsection “Animals”).</p><p>We apologize for confusion regarding origins of samples in our experiments. First, all zebrafish used in this study were of an AB genetic background and we have added this information as the first sentence under subsection “Animals” in our Materials and methods section. To further clarify, the only experiments in which controls and experimental fish did not come from the same clutch were in experiments in which Zebralab was used to track locomotor activity on 4, 6, and 8 dpf. As we recorded swimming behaviour for 8 hours each testing day, we were only able to record one group each day. In hopes of minimizing variation, we divided adult fish into two mixed-sex tanks. In our first cohort of recordings, we collected a control clutch from crossing the first tank of adults (“Tank A”) and a restraint clutch from crossing the second tank of adults (“Tank B”) the following day. As we repeated restraint experiments to obtain additional cohorts, the parentage was reversed and balanced. For example, our second cohort consisted of a restraint clutch born from crossing “Tank A” (first used for control larvae) and a control clutch born from crossing “Tank B” (first used for restraint larvae). We have clarified this detail in our Materials and methods section (subsection “Animals” and subsection “Movement tracking”).</p><p>Importantly, we also clarify that larvae reared for Zebralab experiments were not used for histological analysis of forebrain neurogenesis. All non-Zebralab experiments included clutches born from crossing 2-3 adult males and females from the same genetic background and randomly assigning embryos/larvae from the same clutch to treatment groups. We have clarified this random assignment procedure in our Materials and methods section(subsection “Animals”). Thus, in response to the reviewer’s concerns, we have controlled for genetic and familial background of our fish in Zebralab experiments by using at least 2 clutches to generate data in which parentage was reversed and balanced across clutches and by randomly assigning larvae from the same clutch in all other experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Given that the authors' major focus is on locomotor activity (LMA), given that LMA is under circadian control, and given that neuroblast migration in zebrafish is under circadian control, more attention and clarity to zeitgebers and zeitgeber time should be provided. It seems that the authors acknowledge the possibility of circadian effects at least superficially when reporting some of the times of day that experiments were performed. However, time of day doesn't really matter. Rather time after lights on, intensity of light prior to and during LMA recording, feeding times (esp. important in zebrafish as a zeitgeber) etc., would be more valuable factors to readers and the authors for determining whether circadian effects including time of day and masking (esp. in the Optovin treatment experiment) have confounded the data. ZT and relevant CTs should be tested and ruled out as a contributing factor statistically.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have added the times of lights on/lights off in our Materials and methods section to contextualize time of day relative to our light scheduling, feeding times, and intensity of light in home rooms and our Zebralab recording apparatus (subsection “Animals”, subsection “Movement restraint apparatus” and subsection “Movement tracking”).</p><p>When designing our experiments, we aimed at avoiding issues regarding circadian rhythmicity by rearing control and experimental groups together or following the same daily schedule. As clarified above, outside of movement tracking experiments, we reared all treatment groups simultaneously, feeding them at the same time, exposing them to the same environmental conditions in the facility room, and importantly sacrificing all treatment groups simultaneously in each experiment. In movement tracking experiments, we reared cohorts following the same daily schedule, including timed feeds and movements between the Zebralab recording room and facility room. In our Optovin experiment, we exposed some treatment groups to pulses of light not experienced by dim groups. Aware of the potential differences in circadian entrainment attributed to lighting, we also ran a DMSO+light group, which did not exhibit an upregulation in the number of pallial PCNA<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), suggesting lighting alone does not account for changes in Optovin+light-induced pallial neurogenesis. Accordingly, we are unable to identify environmental cues differentially experienced between treatment groups that would override the group differences reported here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Adding a table showing the brain regions where analyses were done will make it easier to follow and to understand which regions were surveyed, where things changed, and where things were unaffected.

We reference this video in subsection “Movement restraint reduces swimming episodes without impairing swimming ability” and provide a caption.</p></body></sub-article></article>
