In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans,</italic> wounding the epidermis triggers an immune reaction and a repair response, but it is not clear how these are coordinated. Previous work implicated the microtubule cytoskeleton in the maintenance of epidermal integrity (Chuang et al., 2016). Here, by establishing a simple wounding system, we show that wounding provokes a reorganisation of plasma membrane subdomains. This is followed by recruitment of the microtubule plus end-binding protein EB1/EBP-2 around the wound and actin ring formation, dependent on ARP2/3 branched actin polymerisation. We show that microtubule dynamics are required for the recruitment and closure of the actin ring, and for the trafficking of the key signalling protein SLC6/SNF-12 toward the injury site. Without SNF-12 recruitment, there is an abrogation of the immune response. Our results suggest that microtubule dynamics coordinate the cytoskeletal changes required for wound repair and the concomitant activation of innate immunity.</p></abstract><kwd-group

animal defences against infection. In one well-studied example, when the fungus <italic>Drechmeria coniospora</italic> infects <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, by piercing the cuticle and growing through the underlying epidermis, it triggers an innate immune response, characterized by the induction of expression of a battery of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pujol et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Taffoni and Pujol, 2015</xref>). These include the genes of the <italic>nlp-29</italic> cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pujol et al., 2012</xref>), which are principally controlled in a cell autonomous manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Sterile wounding also upregulates the expression of the <italic>nlp-29</italic> cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pujol et al., 2008a</xref>). In both cases, these changes in gene expression result from the activation of the GPCR DCAR-1 that acts upstream of a conserved p38 MAPK signalling cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zugasti et al., 2014</xref>). The p38 MAPK PMK-1 itself acts upstream of the STAT transcription factor-like protein STA-2. Although the precise details are as yet unclear, activation of STA-2 is believed to require the SLC6 family protein SNF-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dierking et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Triggering the immune response upon wounding has a prophylactic role and is a safeguard against the potential entry of pathogenic microbes. To ensure longer term protection, a wounded tissue must also be repaired to maintain organismal integrity. Thus, in addition to AMP gene induction, skin wounding in <italic>C. elegans</italic> also triggers a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signalling cascade that promotes wound repair through actin ring closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu and Chisholm, 2011</xref>). The nematode skin is mainly a syncytium. Except at the head and tail, a single multinucleate epidermal cell, hyp7, covers the whole animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Altun and Hall, 2014</xref>). Its repair processes exhibit some of the characteristics previously described for single cell wound repair in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sonnemann and Bement, 2011</xref>). On the other hand, actin ring closure in <italic>C. elegans</italic> does not rely on myosin-II contractility and the ‘purse string’ mechanism described in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Begnaud et al., 2016</xref>), but instead requires Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu and Chisholm, 2011</xref>).</p><p>A small number of reports have indicated that microtubules (MTs) cooperate with the actomyosin cytoskeleton during wound closure. In a single-cell wound-healing model using <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes, MTs were shown to be required to restrict the assembly zone of actin and myosin around the wound edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bement et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mandato and Bement, 2003</xref>). A study in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryos also revealed that perturbation of MT dynamics, in a + end-binding protein 1 (EB1) mutant, resulted in a delay of actomyosin assembly at the wound edge in multi-cellular wounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abreu-Blanco et al., 2012</xref>). The direct role of MTs in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> wound response has not been previously addressed.</p><p>The tissue repair processes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> have been described to act in parallel to the innate immune response that accompanies wounding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu and Chisholm, 2011</xref>). Several pieces of evidence suggest, however, a coordination of the two responses. Earlier work had shown that loss of DAPK-1, homolog of death-associated protein kinase, causes both undue tissue repair and an inappropriate activation of an immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tong et al., 2009</xref>). A more recent study showed that loss of <italic>dapk-1</italic> function causes excessive MT stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chuang et al., 2016</xref>). These results suggest that MT stability could directly influence immune signalling.</p><p>Here, we develop the use of a 405 nm laser to wound the <italic>C. elegans</italic> epidermis and characterise the subsequent subcellular events in vivo. We show for the first time a rapid membrane reorganisation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) domains, as well as a recruitment of EB1 and reorganisation of MTs around the wound. Rings of EB1 and actin close at the same pace, with EB1 at the leading edge. We demonstrate that specific inactivation in the adult epidermis of several alpha and beta tubulin isotypes leads to a decrease in MT dynamics, revealed by an absence of EB1 comets. This inactivation also blocks EB1 accumulation and decreases the recruitment of actin at the wound site. Further, it also abrogates the directed trafficking to the wound site of the key signalling protein SNF-12 and causes a block of the subsequent immune response. These results suggest that the recruitment of MT + end and EB1 to wounds coordinates the activation of the innate immune response and wound repair.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> epidermis can be wounded with a 405 nm laser</title><p>The adult epidermis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is a single cell layer, covered on its apical surface by an impermeable cuticle that serves as an exoskeleton. The epidermal syncytium hyp7 can be divided into two distinct regions, one lateral, where the nuclei and most of the cytoplasm are, and the dorso-ventral part above the muscles where the apical and basolateral plasma membranes of hyp7 are juxtaposed and crossed by hemidesmosomes that anchor the muscles to the cuticle exoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Altun and Hall, 2014</xref>). The large size of hyp7 makes it an attractive model for the study of cellular wound repair mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pujol et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu and Chisholm, 2011</xref>). Previous studies on <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes have demonstrated that the plasma membrane can be perforated in an extremely targeted manner using standard 405 nm microscopy imaging lasers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burkel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mandato and Bement, 2001</xref>). We found that we could efficiently wound the hyp7 lateral syncytial epidermis of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) with a short pulse of 405 nm laser light (maximum power for 1–3 s) in Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) mode. Coupled with spinning disk or confocal microscopy, it provides a reproducible way to monitor in vivo the immediate consequences of a carefully controlled injury and the subsequent steps in the wound healing process. Using this system, we first confirmed all the previously described wound hallmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pujol et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu and Chisholm, 2011</xref>), such as an immediate autofluorescent scar, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> burst, the formation of an actin ring and later the induction of AMP reporter gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Using a 405 nm laser to wound the worm epidermis reveals rapid membrane reorganisation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic view of a section through an adult <italic>C. elegans</italic> worm near the mid-body.

We observed that MTs were arranged predominantly in longitudinal but haphazard bundles in the lateral epidermis, in marked contrast to their ordered, parallel and circumferential organisation underneath the muscle quadrants in the dorsal and ventral epidermis as well as during molting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costa et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with previous reports, EB1 comets were observed to run along MT bundles, with a preferred directionality in the A/P axis as observed for MT bundles in the main epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>). Tracking of EB1 comets confirmed this observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). After wounding, no change in the direction of EB1 comets was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Detailed observations with confocal microscopy revealed MT tips growing and retracting within second at the site of injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>). The dynamics of the MT tips paralleled the arrival of EB1 at the wound. At later time points, a global reorganisation of the MT network was observed as a knitting web with orthoradial MTs around the wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video2">Figure 3—videos 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video3">3</xref>). The orientation of the MTs was analysed using a MAP1/MAPH-1.1::GFP reporter strain by quantifying the direction of the largest eigenvector of a local intensity structure tensor. Maps of their local orientation were defined within three concentric regions (R1-R3). The angle θ between the local direction of microtubule bundles and the direction to the centre of the wound region was then estimated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). After wounding, microtubules in the immediate wound periphery (R1) were perpendicular to the wound centre direction (θ ≈ 80). Such preferential orientation didnot exist in controls, for example in the distant sector R3 to the wound centre nor in any sectors R1-3 before laser ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Thus, in concordance with the apparent random orientation of EB1 comets, these results show that MT were not arranged radially towards the wound, but displayed an increased orthoradial orientation proximal to the wound after 10 min. Together, these results lead to a working model in which MTs rapidly seed the accumulation of EB1, so facilitating the recruitment of actin, as well as knitting a webbed network around the site of injury.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Microtubules are dynamic and orthoradially organised at the wound site.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) EB1 comets are tracked and mapped in a region of 150 × 150 pixels centred on the wound (black dot) for 5 min.

In resting conditions, short abrogation of <italic>tbb-2</italic> from the L4 stage, altered the MT network in young adult worms, as visualised with TBB-2::GFP; it became less dense and less longitudinally structured in the lateral epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The actin network was also less dense in these worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Upon wounding, less actin was recruited around the site of injury following <italic>tbb-2</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and G</xref>). Further, analyses of the dynamics of radial intensities across the wound revealed that as well as accumulating to lower levels, actin was recruited later in <italic>tbb-2</italic> RNAi treated than in control worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–F</xref>). Moreover, the actin ring did not constrict as quickly as in control worms, as measured by the area inside the ring after 15 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Notably, the relationship between MTs and actin was not reciprocal. Thus, reduction of the level of actin via inactivation of <italic>act-2</italic> did not change the overall pattern of MTs nor EB1 dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

We therefore characterised further the localization of SNF-12 and its behaviour following wounding.

Thus, the movement of SNF-12 towards the wound site was not simply a reflection of cytoplasmic flow. Two exceptions were RAB-5, a marker of early endosomes, and RAB-11. RAB-5::GFP appeared localised in large static donut-shaped structures (0.3–0.8 µm) arranged in a reticular pattern, exchanging with smaller vesicles (0.2–0.4 µm), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chuang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video3">Figure 6—video 3</xref>).

RAB-11::GFP was found in extremely motile (1.31 ± 0.33 µm/s) vesicles (0.2–0.4 µm) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). They moved long distances in one direction, presumably on microtubule tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video5">Figure 6—video 5</xref>). Upon wounding they started to accumulate around the wound site within 10–15 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video6">Figure 6—video 6</xref>) and reached a maximum density between 30 and 60 min post wounding.

In between the reorganisation of PIP<sub>2</sub> membrane subdomains and the restoration of membrane integrity involving the endocytic pathway, an actin ring forms in a myosin-independent, ARP2/3-dependent manner, tightly linked to the recruitment of MT + tip binding-protein EB1. The coordinated recruitment of endosomal vesicles and the uncharacterised SNF-12-associated clusters, which are both dependent upon MT reorganisation, tie together wound repair and the innate immune response.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Early and recycling endosomes are recruited to the wound site.</title><p>Representative spinning disk images of worms carrying <italic>dpy-7p::GFP::RAB-5</italic> (<bold>A</bold>) and <italic>dpy-7p::GFP::RAB-11</italic> (<bold>B</bold>).

We demonstrated that a simple FRAP laser can be used to induce wounds with high precision, and can be combined easily with fast image acquisition. Using this system, we observed in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> epidermis the phenomenon of rapid membrane reorganisation previously described in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davenport et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that these initial steps of plasma membrane repair, as well as subsequent steps in wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakamura et al., 2018</xref>), may be conserved throughout Metazoans.</p><p>In addition to the acute patching of the membrane, wounding was followed by reorganisation of PIP<sub>2</sub> domains. PIP<sub>2</sub> is known to influence the adhesion between the actin-based cortical cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Raucher et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, its redistribution could be linked to the dramatic changes in the actin cytoskeleton that occurred in the minutes after wounding. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> epidermis is bounded on its apical side by a flexible collagen-rich cuticle that serves as an exoskeleton. As in plant cells, this is likely to give the structural support that is otherwise provided by a highly organised cortical actin network in most animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Salbreux et al., 2012</xref>). This may explain why cortical actin is not organized in the adult lateral epidermis. During moulting, however, when the cuticle is remodelled, a highly organized cytoskeleton comprised of circumferential actin and microtubule bundles forms transiently, disappearing when the new cuticle is formed. This parallels the situation in the epidermis upon injury. Actin is rapidly assembled around the wound, and disassembled once it is repaired. Thus changes in membrane tension, either linked to alterations of the cuticle during development, or caused by a breach in its integrity are closely linked to cytoskeleton dynamics.</p><p>Wound repair has been previously suggested to involve a recapitulation of developmental programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin and Parkhurst, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Razzell et al., 2014</xref>). Thus for example, in the syncytial <italic>Drosophila</italic> early embryo, wound closure occurs through a myosin-II-dependent purse-string mechanism, driven mainly by the contractile force exerted by myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abreu-Blanco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bement et al., 1999</xref>). This parallels the tight control exerted by myosin on the actin cytoskeleton during morphogenetic cell shape changes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lecuit and Lenne, 2007</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, if myosin motor activity is inhibited, wounds still close, though at a much slower rate. The residual force driving wound closure is thought to be given by the treadmilling of actin, with a preferential recruitment of Rho GTPase at the wound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burkel et al., 2012</xref>). The recruitment we observed of ARX-2/ARP2 to wounds reinforces the hypothesis that the actin ring in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> epidermis closes due to polymerisation of branched actin networks.</p><p>Actin-dependent processes, including cell migration and cell protrusion, can be influenced by MT dynamics. The mechanisms that underlie their functional crosstalk are still being characterised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dogterom and Koenderink, 2019</xref>). MT + tip proteins like EB1 have been suggested to be involved in microtubule guidance, attachment to cellular structure or acting as concentration devices for signalling events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2015</xref>). For example, a recent in vitro study showed that the MT + end-associated protein CLIP-170, together with the formin mDia1, can accelerate the actin filament polymerization which occurs at the tip of growing MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Henty-Ridilla et al., 2016</xref>). We showed here that in <italic>C. elegans</italic> the recruitment of MT + end binding protein EB1 to the wound is concomitant with that of actin. The two proteins then converge during wound closure at the same rate, with EB1 being at the leading edge. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that EB1 can interact directly with actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alberico et al., 2013</xref>). We demonstrated that perturbation of MT dynamics in vivo slows actin ring closure in <italic>C. elegans</italic> epidermis. Together, this suggests that MT dynamics could facilitate actin ring closure by bringing EB1 to the wound site. This MT-dependent mechanism, which is independent of myosin-based contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu and Chisholm, 2011</xref>), could arise because the epidermis is bounded by a rigid apical extracellular matrix, the tensile cuticle exoskeleton.</p><p>Injuring the epidermis not only leads to wound healing, but also provokes an innate immune response. Previous results in <italic>C. elegans</italic> suggested that the pathways involved in these two processes were distinct. Thus, although mutants for the p38 MAPK PMK-1 and for the SARM orthologue TIR-1, that acts upstream of the p38 cascade, are defective for the induction of AMP gene expression after wounding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pujol et al., 2008a</xref>), they exhibit normal actin ring closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu and Chisholm, 2011</xref>). If innate immune signal transduction pathway components are not required for wound repair, our results suggest, on the other hand, that cytoskeleton components can play a role in regulating AMP production. Indeed, several tubulin genes are required for AMP expression upon infection and wounding, potentially through their effect on the localization and dynamics of innate immune signalling proteins including SNF-12. The fact that overexpression in the epidermis of the MT severing protein Spastin caused a similar effect on SNF-12 dynamics as knocking down tubulin expression, supports a role for MTs in positioning SNF-12-containing vesicles. Determining the precise nature of these vesicles, their connection with MTs and the mode of SNF-12 activation remain challenges for the future. We speculate that this spatial regulation of signalling may contribute to restricting defence gene activation to the immediate vicinity of a wound or site of infection within the major epidermal syncytium.</p><p>A further link between cytoskeleton reorganization and AMP production comes from the study of the protein DAPK-1, a negative regulator of both wound closure and innate immune gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tong et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>dapk-1</italic> mutants have defects in the epidermis that were shown to result from the hyperstabilisation of MTs. DAPK-1 inhibits the function of PTRN-1, a MT - end binding protein, which acts as a MT nucleator and promotes MT stabilization. Loss of <italic>ptrn-1</italic> function suppresses the epidermal defects seen in <italic>dapk-1</italic> mutants as well as their constitutive AMP gene expression and accelerated wound closure. Loss of <italic>dapk-1</italic> function is associated with an increase in EB1 comets. This too is suppressed in a <italic>dapk-1;ptrn-1</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chuang et al., 2016</xref>). Taken together with our results, this suggests that the accelerated wound healing seen in <italic>dapk-1</italic> mutant worms may be due to an increased recruitment of EB1 protein thus speeding up MT-dependent actin ring closure.</p><p>The cytoskeleton is an assembly of co-regulating components that function together in a precise and dynamic way. Our results suggest that this co-regulation extends to the coordination of physical changes required for membrane wound healing and immune signal transduction driving transcriptional responses to injury.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Nematode strains</title><p>All <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains were maintained on nematode growth medium (NGM) and fed with <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stiernagle, 2006</xref>): the wild-type N2, IG274 <italic>frIs7[col-19p::DsRed, nlp-29p::GFP]</italic> IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pujol et al., 2008a</xref>), IG823 <italic>frIs43[col-12p::SNF-12::GFP, ttx-3p::DsRed2]</italic> and IG1235 <italic>cdIs73[RME-8::mRFP, ttx-3p::GFP, unc-119(+)]; frIs43[col-12p::SNF-12::GFP, ttx-3p::DsRed2]</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dierking et al., 2011</xref>), IG1327 <italic>rde-1(ne219) V; juIs346[col-19p::RDE-1, ttx-3p::GFP]</italic> III; <italic>frIs7[nlp-29p::GFP, col-12p::DsRed]</italic> IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zugasti et al., 2014</xref>), CZ13896 <italic>juIs319[col-19p::GCaMP3, col-19p::tdTomato]</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu and Chisholm, 2011</xref>), CZ14453 <italic>juEx3762[col-19p::EBP-2::GFP, ttx-3p::RFP]</italic>, JLF302 <italic>ebp-2(wow47[EBP-2::GFP]) II; zif-1(gk117) III</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sallee et al., 2018</xref>), CZ14748 <italic>juls352[GFP::moesin, ttx-3p::RFP]</italic> I, CZ21789 <italic>juSi239[col-19p::GFP::TBB-2]</italic> I, CZ9334 <italic>juEx1919[dpy-7p::GFP::RAB-5, ttx-3p::RFP]</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chuang et al., 2016</xref>), SA854 <italic>tbb-2(tj26[GFP::TBB-2])</italic> III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Honda et al., 2017</xref>), SV1009 <italic>Is[wrt-2p::GFP::PH-PLC1δ, wrt-2p::GFP::H2B, lin-48p::mCherry]</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wildwater et al., 2011</xref>), BOX188 <italic>maph-1.1(mib12[GFP::maph-1.1]) I</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Waaijers et al., 2016</xref>), GCP417 <italic>dnc-2[prt42(3xflag::GFP::DHC-2)] III</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barbosa et al., 2017</xref>), GN675 <italic>tba-1(pg77[TagRFP-T::TBA-1]) I</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lockhead et al., 2016</xref>), GOU2047 <italic>arx-2(cas607[GFP::ARX-2])</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2017</xref>), MBA365 <italic>Ex[dpy-7p::GFP::CAAX, myo-2p::GFP]</italic> kindly provided by M.

Quantification of EB1 recruitment at the wound site was performed by measuring the RawIntDen (sum of the pixel intensities) of a selected ROI of 256 µm<sup>2</sup> for EB1 centred at the wound site. Since EB1 brightness differed before wounding between worms, for each single wound, only pixels with values above a defined brightness threshold were considered, the threshold being set to the [mean + 3 x standard deviation] in the ROI before wounding.

Since SNF-12 was observed to move much slower than the other dynamic proteins studied, a substack with a time interval of 20 s was generated. SNF-12 quantifications were done for particles with a minimum displacement of 5 pixels within 120 s for before wounding and within either 210 or 420 s for after wounding. To analyse the directionality of EB1 movement, we developed a workflow using first available Image J/Fuji plugins to correct image drift (‘Image stabilizer’), crop movies to a standard size and number of frames (100*100 pixels *1000;”crop’ and ‘make substack’), subtract the stable background with a median temporal filter (‘median 3D’, treating the time series as a Z-stack, setting the filter at 31 (temporal), and then subtracting from each original image).

To first compare the recruitment of EB1 versus actin, the radial profile (plugin from Paul Baggethun) was calculated, after determination of the centroid of the wound for each time point by manually selecting the wound area. For each radial profile, we extracted the radius corresponding to the maximum intensity and plotted this radius versus time. To further quantify, we build kymographs by considering masks that corresponds to stripes oriented in the anterior-posterior (AP) direction and including the ablation region. We obtained one-dimensional profiles by averaging the signal intensity over the circumferential direction; to account for variations in signal intensity during time, we normalised each profile by its maximal value. These colour-coded profiles were concatenated to produce a kymograph.</p><p>To analyse the microtubule orientation, we obtained maps of the local orientation of microtubules of an ROI of 20 × 20 µm of confocal images of MAPH-1::GFP reporter strain using the ImageJ plugin OrientationJ and custom Matlab scripts (Source file plotorientation), which provide the direction of the largest eigenvector of a local intensity structure tensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rezakhaniha et al., 2012</xref>). We then estimated the angle θ between the local direction of microtubule bundle and the direction to a point of reference (the centre of the wound region); θ lies in the 0 to +90 sector since it measures the discrepancy between two directions. We then measured the averaged angle θ over three annular sectors labelled according to their distance to the centre of the wound: R1, R2, R3.

consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: William Bement (Reviewer #2); Andrew D Chisholm (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript establishes a new model for cellular wound healing, using laser induced cutting of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> epidermis. The authors characterize the cellular responses to wound healing and note a remarkable accumulation of the microtubule plus end binding protein Eb1 at the wound site. They further suggest that this regulates both subsequent actin accumulation and the enrichment of a transcription factor that mediates the immune response to wounding. These interesting observations link a novel microtubule-dependent wound response to a local immune response.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Organization of microtubules. The data on accumulation of Eb1 puncta at the wound site is very clear. However, neither the organization of their paths, nor a clear image of microtubule organization is presented. Further investigation of this will allow increased clarity of the model for microtubule function in wound healing.</p><p>2) Quantitation of data. This manuscript characterizes a new method for wounding and describes the dynamics of various cellular components during the healing process. To make it a more valuable resource for future research, increased quantitation of the data, showing both reproducibility over a number of cells, as well as showing the kinetics of various components relative to each other should be provided.</p><p>There were a number of points that were not entirely clear in the manuscript, such as how microtubules control SNF-12 localization (and further discussed in detail below). Changes to the text to clarify many of these confusions, listed in the reviews below, would strengthen the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript establishes a robust assay for wounding the <italic>C. elegans</italic> lateral epidermis. Using this assay, the authors characterize the membrane and cytoskeletal responses to wounding, which are similar to previously studies <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Xenopus</italic> models. They also show a remarkable increase in the microtubule end-binding protein Eb1, at the wound site. Functionally, they find that disrupting microtubule dynamics inhibits actin accumulation and the normal immune response. There are several really interesting observations in this paper, however, the conclusions at present could be strengthened by increased rigor throughout as different interpretations of the data exist.</p><p>1) As they are establishing a novel wounding methodology and characterizing the response, increased quantitation of the dynamics and extent of responses in Figures 1-3 are required. For all of these, it would be ideal to have (in addition to the videos shown) quantitations over several videos to see the reproducibility of the responses. This will also be helpful in laying out the temporal order of changes occurring. I find this to be especially important as the authors suggest that the microtubule response occurs before the actin accumulation, though this is not clear from the video presented.</p><p>2) Constriction of the F-actin at the wound. This is documented for a single wound in Figure 3H, but is not obvious in the videos provided. It is important to document whether this is a constriction or just a loss of F-actin over time. This is especially confusing as the Introduction states that healing hear is not driven by acto-myosin contraction, but rather by Arp2/3 mediate F-actin assembly.</p><p>3) The accumulation of tubulin at wound sites was dramatically less than Eb1. This is perhaps surprising and should be discussed. Along these lines, it was not clear whether the authors could track Eb1 puncta within the wound site due to density of puncta. Are all puncta motile and analyzable?</p><p>4) Epistasis of actin and microtubule accumulation. The authors state in the Discussion that Eb1 accumulates before actin. However, this is not clear from the videos provided. Functionally, there is a decrease in F-actin recruitment when tubulin genes are knocked down or microtubules disrupted. However, the timepoints here were late and don't address whether initial accumulation occurs but does not increase or whether it peaks and goes down, or never increases in the first place. An additional concern along these lines is that the F-actin as reported by LifeAct appears to be significantly disrupted in the unwounded tubulin mutant epidermis (S2B – to a similar extend as the Act2 mutant). This raises the caveat that it may not be a wound-induced effect, but a general effect on cytoskeletal organization.</p><p>5) Connection to the immune response. I felt that I needed more discussion of how the SNF-12 localization connected to the phenotype. Is the localization of the SNF-12 transcription factor at the wound site necessary for its transcriptional activity? How do you imagine this occurs. Are microtubules required for MAPK kinase activity or DCAR-1 signaling in any way? Authors should rule out the possibility that microtubules affect this signaling axis and that they work through localization of SNF-12. Along these lines, in the induction of AMP's in response to cuticle defects similarly dependent on tubulin genes?</p><p>6) SNF-12 clusters were significantly lower in unwounded epidermis of tubulin mutants compared to controls. One possibility is that microtubules are required for cluster formation and not localization of SNF-12.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>While not widely recognized, the response of single cells to damage is just as important as the response of tissues to damage. Not surprisingly then, a growing body of work suggests that cell damage elicits a conserved response that involves the mobilization of a variety of signaling, lipid, and cytoskeletal components. There are at least two biological consequences of this response: First, the hole in the cell is patched or otherwise closed, preventing the cell from simply lysing. Second, the damage material is cleaned up and removed, such that the wound site is eventually restored to its original state (Sonnemann and Bement, 2011). To a first approximation, these biological imperatives parallel those of damaged tissue, with clotting being responsible for plugging the hole and the action of immune system being responsible for the clean-up.</p><p>In the current paper, Taffoni et al. ask whether the single cell wound response is somehow linked to and coordinated with the immune response in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo. To accomplish this, they develop a laser wounding system that permits them to make relatively precise wounds in the embryonic syncytial epiderms. They first show that repair of these wounds has several characteristics in common with the repair response in other damaged cell types. They then identify a striking accumulation of EB1, a protein that binds to the plus ends of growing microtubules, around wounds, leading them to conclude that wounding elicits local microtubule reorganization around wounds. They report that they can block this response by depleting microtubule subunit proteins (i.e. alpha and beta tubulin) and that this manipulation not only impairs the immediate wound response, but also impairs the innate immune response as monitored by expression of an AMP reporter gene. They further link microtubules to recruitment of SNF-12-a protein involved in the innate immune response-to wound sites. Based on these results the authors conclude that the microtubule response is an important feature of both the basic (cell healing) wound response and the innate immune response.</p><p>Several features of this paper are very appealing: the question is of fundamental importance for those who seek to understand wound repair, the authors nicely make the link between the basics of cell damage repair as it occurs in their system and in other systems, and much of the imaging clearly illustrates the points the authors are making. Perhaps most importantly, the link between the microtubule response in a single cell (albeit a very big cell) and the mobilization of the innate immune response is an important one.</p><p>However, several points need to be addressed:</p><p>1) It is very difficult to tell what, exactly, is happening with the microtubules at the wound site because the different approaches seem to be suggesting different things. That is, in some cell types microtubules accumulate around wounds in a radial array such that many microtubules are focussed toward the wounds (e.g. Mandato and Bement, 2003). Such an arrangement would be consistent with the accumulation of the EB1-GFP fluorescence around wounds (but see below). However, it is not consistent with the movement of the EB1-GFP comets, which appear to move in all directions and in the absence of any obvious bias toward the wounds. The live imaging of the microtubules themselves (Figure 3C) is also inconsistent with a radial array. As with the movement of the comets, it seems to indicate that the microtubules are randomly oriented with respect to the wound. Now, one might be tempted to imagine that the intense EB1-GFP signal that accumulates around the edge of the wound is sufficient evidence of some kind of wound-localized array of microtubules but there are two problems with this notion. First, that signal is not obviously in comet form, rather, it just appears to be a uniform slathering of GFP on the plasma membrane. Second, EB1 only associates with growing microtubules plus ends; it does not associate with stable microtubule plus ends (e.g. Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2015). Thus, the apparently stable accumulation of EB1-GFP at the wound edge is rather mysterious. To settle this point the authors need to fix wounded embryos and stain for microtubules or find an alternative way to characterize the organization of microtubules around wounds.</p><p>2) This may reflect my ignorance, but it is not at all clear to me what links the transport of SNF-12 to wounds and the triggering of the innate wound response. Does something special happen to the SNF-12 at wound edges? I was under the impression that SNF-12 exerts its effects on transcriptional control of the response after entering the nucleus as previously reported by the authors (Dierking et al., 2011). While it is not incumbent on the authors to trace out all of the steps in the pathway that leads to an upregulation of the immune transcriptional response, it would be helpful to have a least a little bit of information on why recruitment to the wound is important.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Taffoni et al. examine the role of microtubule dynamics in epithelial wound responses in the epidermis of the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Microtubule dynamics have been implicated in several cell repair processes, and were implicated in <italic>C. elegans</italic> skin wound repair, but had not previously been examined directly. The authors use extensive live imaging of fluorescently tagged markers to show that MT dynamics are affected by wounding and link physical wound repair to innate immune response to damage via transport of the signalling molecule SNF-12. The authors provide extensive descriptions of the dynamics of various membrane and organelle markers after injury. Overall this is a thorough and careful study that advances our understanding of the cell biology of wound repair in vivo.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45047.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Organization of microtubules.

We have now better characterised EB1 and microtubule dynamics upon wounding. We have generated several new strains and combined imaging with advanced analysis techniques.</p><p>Detailed analysis of EB1 revealed 2 regimes. The first was analysed by tracking EB1 comets after wounding. It matches the typical speed of microtubule + tips. This tracking also revealed that EB1 comets were not associated with any directional bias toward the wound, but seem to stop at the wound en-passant. The second regime of EB1 starts when it accumulates at the wound in the form of a ring. Kymograph analyses of both EB1 and actin signals reveal that the EB1 ring closes at the same speed as the actin ring, while also confirming our previous observation that EB1 precedes actin, EB1 being found at the leading edge of actin while the ring closes.</p><p>We have complemented these observations with more detailed examination of MT by analysing several MT-binding protein reporters, like the dynactin protein DNC-2, known to bind MT + tips in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo (Barbosa et al., 2017), and MAPH-1, a MT associated protein MAP1, as well as more resolutive confocal analyses of the tubulin TBB-2 reporter. The observations with DNC-2 were fully consistent with what we had seen with EB1 and confirmed an accumulation of MT + tips at the wound at the same time as actin. Second, confocal analysis revealed MT growing and retracting at the wound just before and during actin accumulation. Third, quantification of MT orientation and tracking of EB1 comets, allow us to rule out a radial organisation of MT at the wound, consistent with the non-directional dynamics of EB1 comets. These data support a dynamic orthoradial organisation of the MT at the wound, and suggest that the microtubules reorganised to knit a web around the wound as the actin ring closes.</p><p>Reviewer #2 pointed out (see below), generally, “EB1 only associates with growing microtubules plus ends; it does not associate with stable microtubule plus ends (e.g. Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2015)”. To reconcile this model with our observations that EB1 stops at the wound site and then migrates inward with the actin as the wound closes, we propose as a working model that MT-associated EB1 binds to actin at the wound and then dissociates from MT during closure. The actin and MT cytoskeleton have long been known to be intimately linked, for example during the directional migration of axonal growth cones. Indeed the main molecular linkers connecting actin and microtubules belong to the microtubule plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs), including EB1 (Coles C. H. and Bradke F. 2015. Coordinating neuronal actin-microtubule dynamics. Curr. Biol.), and a direct association of EB1 with actin has been demonstrated in vitro (Alberico et al. 2016. Interactions between the Microtubule Binding Protein EB1 and F-Actin. J Mol Biol.). Recent studies also proposed a role of actin in the MT spindle formation during mitosis (Farina F. el al 2019. Local actin nucleation tunes centrosomal microtubule nucleation during passage through mitosis. EMBO J). Our results suggest a model where MT dynamics at the wound would permit the association of the +TIPs EB1 with actin that would then facilitate ring closure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Quantitation of data. This manuscript characterizes a new method for wounding and describes the dynamics of various cellular components during the healing process.

It has become our general control (after the calcium wave) that we use to adjust the 405 laser settings to obtain a normal wound response in control worms. And it has allow us to implement a new wounding platform on a confocal microscope, still using a 405 laser from a FRAP module, in addition to our previous setting on two different spinning disk microscopes. We have now generated several new strains combining the actin reporter with MT binding proteins, and added quantification for actin and EB1 recruitment as mentioned above. In addition to new videos, we now provide kymograph analysis. We also have added the number of worm analysed in the different figures and a detailed source data file reporting for all quantification we have made (Figure 2H, 3B, 3F, 4B, 4C, 4F, 4G, 4H, 5A, 5B, 5C, 6H, 6I, Figure 8—figure supplement 1). Finally, we have added a supplementary figure (Figure 8—figure supplement 1) with quantification of the onset of recruitment and a proposed timeline of events.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There were a number of points that were not entirely clear in the manuscript, such as how microtubules control SNF-12 localization (and further discussed in detail below).

The actin pattern is somewhat affected in young adults after <italic>tbb-2</italic> abrogation during the L4 larval stage. Between L4 and adult, worms molt. There is a major reorganisation of both actin and MT networks during molting (Costa et al., 1997; Lazetic et al., 2018); and the reorganisation of both networks seems to highly coordinated (NP unpublished). Altering MTs could therefore impact the organisation of the actin cytoskeleton. We now mention this briefly in the Discussion. We expect that the coordination of MT and actin networks upon molting or after wounding will use the same mechanisms, and this will be the subject of future studies.</p><p>Returning to the reviewer’s concern, within a population of <italic>tbb-2</italic>(RNAi)-treated worms, some worms have an almost normal actin network. If we analyse these worms, we can still observe the concentric wave of actin as in the control but less actin accumulates at the wound site and wound closure is less efficient (Figure 4). High resolution live imaging with a confocal microscope revealed that some MT at the wound site do pattern the growing actin patch (Figure 3C, Video 9). Together with the fact that EB1 is found at the leading edge of the actin ring during its formation and closure, this suggests that MT dynamics facilitate actin accumulation at the wound. We have modified the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Connection to the immune response.

We regret that we didn’t make clear that SNF-12 is an amino acid transporter that we believe is acting as a signalling protein. We have added to the Discussion “We speculate that this spatial regulation of signalling may contribute to restricting defence gene activation to the immediate vicinity of a wound or site of infection within the major epidermal syncytium.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are microtubules required for MAPK kinase activity or DCAR-1 signaling in any way?

DCAR-1 signalling is entirely dependent upon SNF-12, so yes, microtubules affect this signalling axis and they work through localization of SNF-12. We have changed the text in the Discussion to make it clearer. We know that DCAR-1 (the most upstream element of the MAPK pathway described so far) is not recruited to the wound site before SNF-12 but much later, one hour after wounding with a general increased expression. We believe that these observations go beyond the scope of the current paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Along these lines, in the induction of AMP's in response to cuticle defects similarly dependent on tubulin genes?</p></disp-quote><p>We previously reported that in furrow-less Dpy mutants there is a constitutive high expression of the <italic>nlp</italic> AMP genes (Dodd et al., 2018).

Further, we have increased the spatial resolution of our study by implementing the FRAP module for wounding on a confocal microscope, tracked EB1 comets and analysed EB1 and actin ring closure.

In our system, SNF-12 localisation could potentially affect its interaction with the Stat transcription factor STA-2.</p><p>Understanding this will be a challenge for the future. We have altered the Discussion to address the point explicitly: “The fact that overexpression in the epidermis of the MT severing protein Spastin caused a similar effect on SNF-12 dynamics as knocking down tubulin expression, supports a role for MT in positioning SNF-12-containing vesicles. […] We speculate that this spatial regulation of signalling may contribute to restricting defence gene activation to the immediate vicinity of a wound or site of infection within the major epidermal syncytium.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
