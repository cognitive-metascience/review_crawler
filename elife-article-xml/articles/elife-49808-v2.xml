proliferative capacity of basal progenitors (BPs), which is increased by extracellular matrix (ECM) components via integrin signaling. Here we show that the transcription factor Sox9 drives expression of ECM components and that laminin 211 increases BP proliferation in embryonic mouse neocortex. We show that Sox9 is expressed in human and ferret BPs and is required for BP proliferation in embryonic ferret neocortex. Conditional Sox9 expression in the mouse BP lineage, where it normally is not expressed, increases BP proliferation, reduces Tbr2 levels and induces Olig2 expression, indicative of premature gliogenesis. Conditional Sox9 expression also results in cell-non-autonomous stimulation of BP proliferation followed by increased upper-layer neuron production. Our findings demonstrate that Sox9 exerts concerted effects on transcription, BP proliferation, neuron production, and neurogenic vs. gliogenic BP cell fate, suggesting that Sox9 may have contributed to promote neocortical expansion.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>ferret</kwd><kwd>human</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 655</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huttner</surname><given-names>Wieland B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huttner</surname><given-names>Wieland B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>250197</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huttner</surname><given-names>Wieland B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transcription factor Sox9 has an important role in neocortex expansion, where its expression in basal progenitors increases proliferation, induces premature gliogenesis and promotes the expression of extracellular matrix components.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The expansion of the neocortex in the course of human evolution and its growth during the development of the human brain have become a central topic of molecularly and cellularly focused developmental neuroscience. Neocortical expansion is thought to constitute one of the bases for the unique cognitive abilities of humans. At the cellular level, the proliferative capacity and pool size of cortical neural progenitor cells (cNPCs) is regarded as a key parameter underlying neocortical expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borrell and Reillo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dehay et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernández et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fietz and Huttner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fish et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Florio and Huttner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kriegstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martynoga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Miller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mitchell and Silver, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Molnár et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Namba and Huttner, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rakic, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Silbereis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Uzquiano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Velasco et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>There are two major germinal zones in the developing neocortex, which harbor two principal classes of cNPCs that exhibit distinct features related to the apical-basal polarity of the cortical wall. The apical-most, and primary, germinal zone, the ventricular zone (VZ), harbors the cell bodies of cNPCs collectively referred to as apical progenitors, all of which contact the ventricle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Taverna et al., 2014</xref>). Among these, apical (or ventricular) radial glia (aRG), which arise by transition from neuroepithelial cells as the generation of neocortical neurons begins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Götz and Huttner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kriegstein and Götz, 2003</xref>) and which exhibit pronounced apical-basal cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Götz and Huttner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Reiner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Taverna et al., 2014</xref>), have been recognized as a major cNPC type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Namba and Huttner, 2017</xref>). The zone basal to the VZ, the subventricular zone (SVZ), constitutes a secondary germinal layer that harbors the cell bodies of cNPCs collectively referred to as basal progenitors (BPs), all of which lack contact with the ventricle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borrell and Reillo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dehay et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fietz and Huttner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pontious et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Taverna et al., 2014</xref>). There are two main types of BPs, (i) basal intermediate progenitors (bIPs), which lack apical-basal cell polarity and do not exhibit significant cell processes at mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attardo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haubensak et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Miyata et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Noctor et al., 2004</xref>), and (ii) basal (or outer) radial glia (bRG), which exhibit basal and/or apical cell polarity, extending one or more basal and/or apically directed cell processes throughout their cell cycle including mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betizeau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fietz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kalebic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pilz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Reillo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shitamukai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>For cell biological reasons related to their apical cell polarity, aRG mitoses are confined to the ventricular surface, a limited space, which poses a constraint with regard to maximizing their number and, consequently, to increasing aRG pool size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fietz and Huttner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fish et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Taverna et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, this constraint does not exist for BPs. By virtue of these cells having delaminated from the ventricular surface, BPs have an intrinsic advantage compared to aRG with regard to maximizing the number of their mitoses and hence to increasing their pool size, as they can undergo mitosis virtually anywhere along the radial axis of the SVZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betizeau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fietz and Huttner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fietz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fish et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Florio and Huttner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Reillo et al., 2011</xref>). Accordingly, neocortical expansion is thought to be linked to an increase in the proliferative capacity of BPs, resulting in their increased pool size and a thickening of the SVZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borrell and Reillo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dehay et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernández et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fietz and Huttner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Florio and Huttner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kriegstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lui et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, in mammals lacking neocortical expansion, such as mouse, BPs exhibit only low proliferative capacity, typically dividing only once to generate two post-mitotic neurons, and their pool size is relatively small and the SVZ comparably thin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Florio and Huttner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haubensak et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Miyata et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Noctor et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, in mammals showing neocortical expansion, notably human, BPs exhibit high proliferative capacity, resulting in an increased pool size and a thick SVZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betizeau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernández et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fietz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Florio and Huttner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pilz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Reillo et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Hence, the crucial question is: what underlies the differences in BP proliferative capacity across the various mammals? An important clue pointing to the differential expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) components as a key regulatory parameter has come from comparative analyses of the transcriptomes of mouse vs. human VZ and SVZ as well as specific cNPC subpopulations. Specifically, in embryonic mouse neocortex, BPs down-regulate the endogenous expression of ECM components in comparison with aRG, in line with the lower proliferative capacity of the former than the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arai et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with this, the expression of ECM components is down-regulated in the embryonic mouse SVZ compared to the VZ, whereas in fetal human neocortex this expression is maintained not only in the VZ, but also inner SVZ (ISVZ) and outer SVZ (OSVZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fietz et al., 2012</xref>). Accordingly, not only human aRG, but also human bRG show a characteristic expression of ECM components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Florio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pollen et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, when mimicking the physiological situation in the fetal human SVZ in an embryonic mouse model, the targeted activation of integrins, the canonical receptors for ECM components, specifically of integrin αvβ3, on mouse BPs promotes their proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stenzel et al., 2014</xref>). Conversely, inhibition of integrin αvβ3 in an <italic>ex vivo</italic> model of the developing neocortex of the ferret, which exhibits an expanded, folded cerebral cortex, reduces the BP pool size, in particular that of bRG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fietz et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, we have recently shown that BPs in species with an expanded neocortex, such as human and ferret, exhibit an increased number of cell processes; these are used to receive extrinsic pro-proliferative signals via integrin signaling, notably involving integrin β1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kalebic et al., 2019</xref>). Blocking of integrin β1 in fetal human neocortex thus resulted in a reduction of BP proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kalebic et al., 2019</xref>). Taken together, these findings have led to the general concept that an increased expression of ECM components by BPs contributes to generate a proliferative niche away from the ventricular surface and to promote BP proliferation via increased integrin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fietz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fietz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kalebic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Long and Huttner, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stenzel et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>This in turn leads to the key question: which transcriptional machinery governs the differential expression of ECM components in the neocortical SVZ of the various mammals? An <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of transcription factors expressed in embryonic mouse vs. fetal human germinal zones and predicted to bind to promoters of ECM genes has revealed Sox9 as a promising candidate to drive expression of ECM components in the human SVZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fietz et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we have studied the physiological expression of Sox9 in the VZ vs. SVZ of developing mouse, ferret and human neocortex and, based on the results obtained, examined the effects of conditional Sox9 expression in mouse BPs on their proliferative capacity and on driving the expression of ECM genes.</p><p>In this context, given the role of Sox9 in driving glia-specific gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klum et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Martini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Molofsky et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nagao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Selvaraj et al., 2017</xref>) and in the neurogenesis-to-gliogenesis switch in the developing spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Finzsch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Molofsky et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stolt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stolt and Wegner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wegner and Stolt, 2005</xref>), a related issue concerns the neuronal vs. glial fate diversity of neocortical SVZ progenitors across species. In the developing mouse neocortex, neurogenesis and gliogenesis take place sequentially, that is, after neurogenesis, SVZ progenitors of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes are being generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Merkle et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, in the SVZ of gyrencephalic species, such as human, macaque and ferret, neurogenic and gliogenic progenitors co-exist at later stages of neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Martínez-Cerdeño et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rash et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Reillo and Borrell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Reillo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zecevic et al., 2005</xref>). We therefore have also examined the effects of conditional Sox9 expression in mouse BPs on their neurogenic vs. gliogenic fate. Taken together, our data provide novel insight into the cell-autonomous vs. cell non-autonomous stimulation of BP proliferation, the consequences for neuron production, and the relationship between neurogenesis and gliogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sox9-expressing BPs occur in the SVZ of embryonic ferret and fetal human, but not embryonic mouse, neocortex</title><p>To gain an initial insight into Sox9 expression in developing neocortex, we analyzed the FPKM values for <italic>Sox9/SOX9</italic> mRNA in the germinal zones and in specific cNPC types of mouse and human neocortex at mid-neurogenesis, using two published transcriptome datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fietz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Florio et al., 2015</xref>).

Transfection of the conditional Sox9 expression construct alone led to the expression of GFP from a floxed cassette, but not of RFP, the expression of which depends on the removal of the floxed GFP cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, transfection of the conditional Sox9 expression construct in combination with the Cre-expressing construct resulted in the expression of RFP but not GFP, and all RFP-expressing cells were positive for Sox9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These observations provided a validation of the conditional Sox9 expression construct. It is worth noting that whereas in these transfected HEK293T cells the RFP was observed in the nucleoplasm, Sox9 immunoreactivity was also seen outside the nucleoplasm, likely reflecting the strong overexpression of Sox9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Next, we validated the conditional expression of Sox9 in mouse BP-genic aRG and their BP progeny using the <italic>Tis21</italic>-CreER<sup>T2</sup> line. We induced translocation of Cre to the nucleus by tamoxifen administration at E12.5 and E13.5, introduced either the control RFP-expressing construct (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) or the conditional Sox9 expression construct into neocortical aRG by <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation at E13.5, and performed immunofluorescence analyses at E14.5 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Upon electroporation of the control construct, we observed expression of RFP predominantly in the SVZ, whereas the expression of the endogenous Sox9 was confined to the VZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>), consistent with the data described above (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, upon electroporation of the conditional Sox9 expression construct, strong Sox9 immunoreactivity was observed not only in the VZ, but also in the SVZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Importantly, all of the strongly Sox9-positive, that is exogenous Sox9-expressing, cells co-expressed nuclear RFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>), demonstrating that RFP expression from the conditional Sox9 expression construct can be taken as an indicator of Sox9 expression. Furthermore, these data show that the use of the conditional Sox9 expression construct in tamoxifen-treated <italic>Tis21</italic>-CreER<sup>T2</sup> embryos is a means of eliciting Sox9 expression in mouse BPs.</p><p>We analyzed the distribution of the RFP-positive, that is Sox9-expressing, cells across the radial axis of the mouse cortical wall at E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>) and E15.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>).

For both conditions, all RFP-positive cells were confined to the germinal zones at E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>), whereas at E15.5 some RFP-positive cells were observed in the CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>), consistent with these cells being newly generated neurons.</p><p>These findings provided a basis to investigate the effects of conditional Sox9 expression in mouse BPs on their proliferative capacity. We first examined the expression of Ki67, a marker of cycling cells, upon electroporation of the mouse neocortex at E13.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Indeed, conditional Sox9 expression doubled the proportion of cells in the SVZ and intermediate zone (IZ) derived from the targeted cells (as revealed by RFP expression) that were cycling and hence were BPs, both upon analysis at E15.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,C’, D,D’, G</xref>) and at E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).</p><p>To corroborate the effect of conditional Sox9 expression on mouse BP proliferation, we analyzed the abundance of basal mitoses by performing immunofluorescence for phospho-histone H3 one day after electroporation at E13.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F,F’</xref>).

As at this developmental stage the majority of mouse bIPs are weakly Pax6-positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hutton and Pevny, 2011</xref>) and mouse bRG are also known to be Pax6-positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shitamukai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), we confined our quantification to those BPs that were truly Pax6-negative, in order to be sure to quantify only bIPs. This revealed that conditional Sox9 expression doubled the proportion of the targeted cell-derived (RFP+) mitotic (pVim+) BPs that were Pax6-negative, that is bIPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>We next investigated whether the increase in mouse BPs upon conditional Sox9 expression was accompanied by an increase in cell cycle re-entry.

Specifically, we performed immunofluorescence for NeuN at E17.5 of mouse neocortex electroporated at E13.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G and H</xref>), and found that the percentage of NeuN-positive nuclei in the CP was significantly increased upon conditional Sox9 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). (The finding that only about half of the nuclei in the CP were NeuN-positive in the control presumably reflects the fact that NeuN only labels mature neurons, but not neurons whose maturation process is not yet complete [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mullen et al., 1992</xref>]). Further examination of the NeuN-positive nuclei in the CP showed that conditional Sox9 expression in BPs resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of nuclei that were RFP-negative and NeuN-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>); there was also a slight increase in the percentage of RFP-positive nuclei that were NeuN-positive, which however was not statistically significant, possibly reflecting the already high (&gt;70%) percentage value in the control condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>).

On the one hand, conditional Sox9 expression in BPs resulted in a significant, more than two-fold increase in the number EdU-containing (EdU+) cells in the CP that were Satb2-positive and RFP-negative, that is progeny derived from of non-electroporated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7O</xref>). On the other hand, only a slight and not statistically significant increase in the proportion of EdU-containing (EdU+) RFP-positive (RFP+) cells that were Satb2-positive was observed upon conditional Sox9 expression in BPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7N</xref>). In contrast, the proportion of EdU-containing (EdU+) RFP-positive (RFP+) cells that were Tbr1-positive (Tbr1+) was found to be massively decreased upon conditional Sox9 expression in BPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We conclude that upon conditional Sox9 expression in mouse BPs the production of upper-layer neurons is increased and that this increase involves the non-targeted BPs whose proliferation is stimulated in a cell non-autonomous manner.</p><p>We complemented these data by investigating the distribution of RFP-positive cells across the CP at E18.5, with the CP divided into 10 bins of equal size, comparing control and conditionally Sox9-expressing mouse neocortex electroporated at E13.5. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Quantification of the percentage of RFP+ cells in each bin showed that upon conditional Sox9 expression in BPs, the relative distribution of the RFP+ cells was shifted towards the upper layers of the CP, with a significant decrease in the percentage of RFP+ cells in the lower layers of the CP (specifically bin number 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) and an increase in the percentage of RFP+ cells in the upper layers of the CP (specifically bin number 7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Consistent with these data and with the observed decrease in the proportion of EdU-containing RFP-positive cells that were Tbr1-positive at E17.5 upon conditional Sox9 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>), the proportion of all RFP+ cells in the CP that were Tbr1+ at E18.5 was significantly decreased upon conditional Sox9 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,C’, D,D’ and G</xref>).

Specifically, although the laminin α2 mRNA – because of its low FPKM values – was not included in our analysis of the protein-encoding genes upregulated upon conditional Sox9 expression, it did show a ≈two-fold increase upon conditional Sox9 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). In addition, the mRNAs for the beta and gamma chains required to form a functional laminin 211 heterotrimer, Lamb1 and Lamc1, were found to exhibit expression levels in both the control condition and upon conditional Sox nine expression in the mouse BP lineage that were consistent with the occurrence of laminin 211 in the embryonic mouse neocortex under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B,C</xref>). Taken together, these data suggested to us that it would be worthwhile to examine a potential role of laminin 211 in promoting mouse BP proliferation. In this context, we would like to emphasize that laminin α2 is of course not the only ECM target of conditional Sox9 expression, and that laminin 211 was primarily used here as a proof-of-principle experiment to support the concept: conditional Sox9 expression –&gt;increased expression of ECM components –&gt;BP proliferation.

The finding that Sox9 expression in BPs drives the expression of ECM components suggests an elegant explanation for the cell non-autonomous stimulation of BP proliferation by Sox9, as delineated below.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Sox9 promotes BP proliferation cell-autonomously and non-autonomously</title><p>Comparison of embryonic mouse, embryonic ferret and fetal human neocortex showed that Sox9 expression in the SVZ correlated with the occurrence of BPs endowed with proliferative capacity, being detected in the ferret and human but not mouse SVZ. Further evidence in support of a positive role of Sox9 in the proliferation of ferret and human BPs was provided by the observations that these BPs were cycling and capable of cell cycle re-entry, and that they largely lacked expression of Tbr2, a marker that is often expressed in those BPs that are committed to neuron production rather than proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Englund et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Florio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kowalczyk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sessa et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, essentially all of the human bRG, the BP cell type particularly implicated in neocortical expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fietz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Florio and Huttner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>), were found to express Sox9. These findings extend previous data on the role of Sox9 in apical progenitor proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Scott et al., 2010</xref>) and clearly suggest a possible involvement of Sox9 in BP proliferation.</p><p>Direct evidence for this notion came from two sets of experiments. First, the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated KO of Sox9 in embryonic ferret neocortex, which contains highly proliferative BPs, showed that Sox9 is actually required for BP proliferation in a gyrencephalic brain. Second, the conditional expression of Sox9 in mouse BPs, which normally have a low proliferative capacity, showed that Sox9 can promote BP proliferation also ectopically. The remarkable 70% reduction in Sox2+ cells in the ferret embryonic SVZ upon Sox9 KO further indicates a prominent role of Sox9 for the proliferative capacity of bRG, the key cell type involved in both the evolutionary expansion of the neocortex and the proper human neocortex development.</p><p>Strikingly, however, the BPs that showed increased proliferative capacity upon conditional Sox9 expression in embryonic mouse neocortex were not only the progeny of electroporated cells, but also the progeny of the non-electroporated cells. In other words, Sox9 promoted not only the proliferation of those mouse BPs in which it was expressed in a targeted manner, but also of neighboring BPs lacking Sox9 expression. Previous findings have implicated ECM components as stimulators of cNPC proliferation that act via integrin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fietz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fietz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Florio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hall et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Long et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stenzel et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, the present observations demonstrate that Sox9 expression in BPs induces the expression of ECM components, some of which (like laminin 211) can promote BP proliferation. It therefore seems likely that the cell non-autonomous stimulation of mouse BP proliferation upon conditional Sox9 expression is due to ECM components that have been secreted from Sox9-expressing BPs and then act on neighboring BPs that themselves have not been targeted to express Sox9. If so, this interplay reflects how well the Sox9 effects on transcription and BP proliferation are orchestrated.</p><p>We do not know which genes whose expression is increased upon conditional Sox9 expression in mouse BPs are responsible for the cell-autonomous stimulation of BP proliferation by Sox9. Presumably, Sox9 acts in concert with other cell-intrinsic factors, including Sox2 and transcription factors with which it can heterodimerize such as Sox8 and Sox10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2015</xref>). In this context, it is interesting to note that Sox8 shows a similar expression pattern with regard to the neocortical germinal zones as Sox9, being expressed in embryonic mouse neocortex essentially only in the VZ but in fetal human neocortex in the VZ, ISVZ and OSVZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fietz et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, if a heterodimerization or concerted action of Sox9 with Sox8 (or with other factors exhibiting similar expression patterns) underlies the stimulation of BP proliferation, such differential expression between species could explain why the effects of Sox9 KO in embryonic ferret neocortex appear to be stronger than those of conditional Sox9 expression in embryonic mouse neocortex. In addition, given that the cell non-autonomous stimulation of BP proliferation upon Sox9 expression likely involves ECM components secreted from Sox9-expressing BPs, it seems possible that the mechanism underlying the cell-autonomous stimulation of BP proliferation by Sox9 also involves ECM components secreted from the Sox9-expressing BPs and acting on them in an autocrine fashion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Sox9 increases production of upper-layer neurons</title><p>The effects of conditional Sox9 expression in mouse BPs on neuron production added yet a third line of evidence for the orchestrated effects of Sox9. An increase in upper-layer neuron production is considered to be one of the hallmarks of neocortical expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hutsler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Molnár et al., 2006</xref>). Accordingly, conditional Sox9 expression in mouse BPs resulted in this phenotype. Interestingly, however, whereas the Sox9-induced decrease in the production of deep-layer neurons was due to the effects of Sox9 in the Sox9-expressing BPs, the increase in the production of upper-layer neurons reflected an indirect effect via the BPs that themselves were not targeted to express Sox9. This illustrates how a synergistic effect (less deep-layer neurons, more upper-layer neurons) can be achieved via concerted direct and indirect effects of Sox9 on BPs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Sox9 switches BPs to gliogenesis</title><p>Finally, the quartet of harmonic impacts of Sox9 expression was completed by its effects on the fate of BPs. Specifically, not only did conditional Sox9 expression in mouse BPs reduce the proportion of Tbr2-positive BPs, consistent with the stimulation of BP proliferation by Sox9, but conditional Sox9 expression also induced Olig2 in a subset of BPs, indicative of switching them to gliogenesis. In the adult mouse brain, Sox9 has been reported to be expressed simultaneously by mature astrocytes and neurogenic SVZ progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Martini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nagao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nait-Oumesmar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sun et al., 2017</xref>).

In light of this, the effects of Sox9 expression highlight the concerted nature of its action on several key aspects of neocortex development and evolutionary expansion.

Cells from a non-electroporated brain were used as negative control and fluorescence for RFP+ electroporated cells was detected. Out of the live cells (see above), single dot-plots were created for FSC-H/PE-Texas Red-A (yellow/green laser, 561 nm) and two gates were created for low intensity (low RFP) and high intensity RFP (high RFP) fluorescence. For qPCR experiments, 12,000 cells each from RFP–, low RFP and high RFP populations were sorted into 350 μl of RLT lysis buffer (QIAGEN) with 2 μl of β-mercaptoethanol. For RNA-sequencing experiments, 5,000 cells each from low RFP and high RFP populations were sorted into 350 μl of RLT lysis buffer with 2 μl of β-mercaptoethanol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>qPCR</title><p>Total RNA from sorted cells was extracted using the QIAGEN RNeasy Micro kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA was synthesized with random hexamers and Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, #18080044). qPCR experiments were performed on Mx3000P system (Agilent Technologies) using Absolute qPCR SYBR Green mix (Thermo Scientific).

Purified cDNA was amplified with Advantage 2 DNA Polymerase in 12 cycles, and subjected to ultrasonic shearing with Covaris S2. Afterwards, standard Illumina fragment libraries were prepared using NEBnext chemistries (New England Biolabs). Library preparation consisted of fragment end-repair, A-tailing and ligation to indexed Illumina TruSeq adapters, followed by a universally primed PCR amplification of 15 cycles. Then, libraries were purified using XP beads (Beckman Coulter) and quantified by qPCR. Samples were subjected to Illumina 75 bp single end sequencing on an Illumina NextSeq platform.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Transcriptome analysis</title><p>Reads of the same sample on different sequencing lanes were combined and processed by adapter trimming using cutadapt. Alignment of the processed reads to a mouse reference genome (mm10) was performed by STAR.

The agarose on the sections was removed and slices were embedded in type Ia collagen (Cellmatrix, Nitta Gelatin) at a concentration of 1.5 mg/ml in DMEM and neutralizing buffer at room temperature, as described in the manufacturer’s protocol. Slices in the collagen mix were placed in 35 mm Petri dishes with a 14 mm microwell (MatTek Cooperation). Within a section the two hemispheres were separated, one hemisphere was embedded into type Ia collagen only as control, and the other was embedded into type Ia collagen mixed with either 0.1 mg/ml laminin 211 (Biolamina, human recombinant laminin LN211) or 0.1 mg/ml collagen IV (Abcam, Natural Human Collagen IV protein (FAM) ab123531). Petri dishes with embedded slices were kept at 37°C for 40 min to allow the collagen mix to set completely. Afterwards 2 ml of slice culture medium was added into each dish and the slices were cultured for 24 hr in a humidified incubation chamber supplied with 40% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 55% N<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Services and Facilities of the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics for their outstanding technical support, notably Jussi Helppi and his team of the Biomedical Services (BMS), Jan Peychl and his team of the Light Microscopy Facility, Mihail Sarov and his team of the Genome Editing Facility and Lena Hersemann from the team of Scientific Computing Facility.

The manuscript is generally well written, the rationale is very clear and easy to follow, the datasets and figures are generally very clear, and for the most part conclusions are well supported by the experimental results. However, there are a few points that must be considered before this manuscript is ready for publication, which the authors are perfectly capable of addressing.</p><p>1) There is no justification as to choice of ferret developmental stages for their experiments, and this needs clarifying. Likewise, there is no justification as to why several different stages are analyzed in each case, when they are very similar and in fact considered equivalent (i.e. P2 and P3 in Figure 2). Most importantly, the authors only analyze 1 animal or embryo of each age, which renders it of limited use for statistical analysis. This is true in all analyses on ferret and human tissue throughout the study. At least for ferret, 3 animals must be analyzed per stage and variable studied.</p><p>2) In Figure 3F, H, the authors count number of progenitor cells expressing the reporter protein per field of analysis. This is wrong because these experiments were done by <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation, and hence the abundance of cells expressing the reporter gene depends on the abundance of electroporated cells, which may vary quite significantly from embryo to embryo. These results should be eliminated from the study altogether.</p><p>3) The images shown in Figure 3N, O are useless for the purpose of demonstrating/illustrating the degree of marker co-expression. High magnification images must be provided, as in Figure 3C', D', J' and M.</p><p>4) The authors conclude that &quot;Sox9-induced increase in the proliferation of mouse BPs pertained primarily to bIPs&quot;, based on the absence of basal processes in phosphovimentin+ cells. While this interpretation is correct, one should never make strong statements based on the absence of evidence, in this case absence of a basal process. The authors must confirm this finding by analyzing Pax6 expression in these BPs. In mouse, bIPs are positive for Tbr2 and negative for Pax6, whereas bRGs (even if scarce in normal embryos) are Pax6+ and Tbr2-.</p><p>5) There is a typo where indicating the p value for significance: &quot;q&lt;0.01&quot;. Q should be changed by a P.</p><p>6) In Figure 6, when the authors study whether the effects of <italic>Sox9</italic> are cell-autonomous or not, they evaluate cells positive for NeuN (pan-neuronal marker) in the mouse Cortical Plate, where newborn neurons finish migration and start differentiation. Surprisingly, they find that in control embryos only 50% of CP cells are positive for NeuN, and 75% in <italic>Sox9</italic>-expressing embryos. What are the cells negative for NeuN? It is difficult to imagine such a high abundance of endothelial or other cell types, especially so early in development, prior to gliogenesis.</p><p>7) In the subsection “Conditional Sox9 expression induces cell non-autonomous BP proliferation resulting in increased neuron production, especially of upper-layer neurons”, the authors conclude that Sox9 expression in BPs results in increased neuron production from BPs in a cell non-autonomous manner. They reach this conclusion after showing that there is only an increase in neurons negative for the reporter protein (RFP), but not in RFP+ neurons. This conclusion seems correct based on the results in RFP- cells, but then why are RFP+ cells not affected? Why Sox9+ cells exert this influence on neighboring cells only if those are Sox9-, but not on those that are Sox9+? Shouldn't the non cell-autonomous effect be indifferent to Sox9 expression? Is there a mechanism for this effect to be restricted to Sox9- (RFP-) cells only? This needs a clarifying explanation.</p><p>8) According to the results in Figures 7 and 8, the authors find that the non cell-autonomous effect of Sox9-expressing cells only applies to the production of Satb2+ neurons, but then the influence on the production of Tbr1+ neurons is cell-autonomous. This is problematic and the authors offer no explanation, but rather stick to the non cell-autonomous model. Additional arguments and/or data must be provided to clarify this point of conflict.</p><p>9) In the statistical analysis of data in Figure 7B, did the authors perform multiple comparisons before t-test?</p><p>10) In Figure 7C, D, it is impossible to see co-expression of markers with the images provided. High magnifications must be added to illustrate this result, as already mentioned above for other figures. Related to these results, the authors must quantify density of Satb2+ neurons/field, and Satb2+/RFP- cells/field, as they do previously, to demonstrate increased abundance of this neuron type. Otherwise, their counts only show no difference in a cell-autonomous manner.</p><p>11) In Figure 8A, B, are the values of transcript abundance statistically different? Some of it is mentioned in the text, but needs to be indicated in the figure. Laminin α2 is said to not be expressed at significantly different levels in the RNAseq data, while Sox9 was very different. This contradicts the conclusion that the effects of Sox9 on cortical progenitors are via increased expression of laminin α2. On this regard, the authors' conclusion is quite weak and circumstantial, as there is no functional data demonstrating a link between the phenotypes produced by Sox9 overexpression and laminin α2 treatment, even if these are similar.</p><p>12) Images in Figure 8C must be replaced by better examples and cropped properly. In their current format there is excessive background, the apical surface of the VZ is barely visible (and thus also apical mitoses), and the field of view of the images is so excessively narrow that the control slice shows a complete absence of basal mitoses.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>While their findings are of potential interest, the manuscript has several weaknesses.</p><p>1) Loss-of-function evidence to support a role of SOX9 in neocortical expansion in gyrated mammalian brain is lacking. Knockdown or knockout SOX9 in ferret (or possibly human organoid) bRGs would be necessary to demonstrate the conclusions.</p><p>2) In their study, the authors forced SOX9 expression through <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation DNA construct into tamoxifen-treated E13.5 embryos of the <italic>Tis21</italic>-CreER<sup>T2</sup> mouse lines. Why wouldn't this lead to expression of SOX9 in derived neurons and glial cells as well as the BPs? (see Figure 3D). This may lead to artifacts, if more glia are generated between the dose of tamoxifen and harvest. i.e. What were the distributions of cell types that were harvested?</p><p>3) Which specific ECM genes were upregulated after forced SOX9 expression? From the RNA-seq result in Table 1, only LAMA3 and A4 are upregulated, while the genes expressing Laminin β and γ chains are not listed. Was LAM211 components increased upon SOX9 misexpression? Justification for LAM211 was missing.</p><p>4) Previous studies showed SOX9 functions in neural stem cell proliferation and gliogenesis (Kang et al., 2012; Scott et al., 2010), partially weakening the novelty of this study, but the connection to evolution is novel.</p><p>5) Readers will still be confused on the overall model. Does LAM211 produced by bRGs influencing the bRGs that surround them (paracrine) or some other mechanisms? Is this effect spatially restricted?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The paper is very interesting, in particular regarding a possible non-cell-autonomous action of Sox9 through extracellular matrix molecules, and the experiments are well conducted. However, some clarifications would be important.</p><p>1) The authors show that, interestingly, laminin 211 stimulates cell proliferation in slices. They also show that Sox9 stimulates the expression of Lama2, encoding a laminin. Would the expression of Lama2 by <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation have the same (or similar) effect of the expression of Sox9 on cell proliferation? (and perhaps gliogenesis)? This would much strengthen the evidence that laminins/ECM are important mediators of the function of Sox9 on progenitor cell proliferation (and perhaps gliogenesis), as interestingly suggested by the data. Even if the experiment did not work, the authors could still mention it and discuss it.</p><p>2) The proliferating cells in the SVZ of ferret and human express Sox9; however, they also coexpress other transcription factors, e.g. Sox2 (as also shown by the authors), typical of proliferating progenitors in general (in fact, both are also expressed in the VZ). So, one may argue that Sox2 (or another coexpressed Sox factor, or other factor) could also be (together with Sox9) a candidate for these functions of the SVZ cells, as part of a genetic program of proliferating cells which has been recruited to SVZ cells through evolution. These possibilities should be discussed more in depth. Also, the effects (or not) of the Sox9 knockouts on cell proliferation should be mentioned. Overall, although the observed effects of ectopic Sox9 expression are very interesting, they are not in my opinion sufficient to qualify Sox9 as a &quot;master regulator to promote neocortical expansion&quot; (Abstract) nor to state (Discussion) that &quot;The present study establishes Sox9 as a master regulator of BP proliferation and cell fate&quot;; I would moderate these statements a little.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Extracellular matrix-inducing Sox9 orchestrates basal progenitor proliferation and gliogenesis in developing neocortex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior/Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Joseph G Gleeson (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another. While the paper is much improved, there are remaining concerns, detailed below that need to be addressed before a final decision can be made.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript has been very nicely revised following the comments and concerns on its initial version. Unfortunately, there are still a handful of points that were not addressed properly:</p><p>Point 4:</p><p>It is very nice that the authors performed this analysis. However, it is very surprising and strange that in control electroporated cortex of mouse embryos more than 70% of RFP+pVim+ cells in SVZ-IZ are Pax6+ (less than 30% are Pax6-; new Figure 4—figure supplement 3). A large body of literature, including studies from the Huttner lab, demonstrates that the vast majority of mouse cortical BPs are bIPs, hence most mitotic cells in SVZ-IZ are Pax6-.</p><p>Point 9:</p><p>This is incorrect. Multiple comparisons tests must be performed (i.e. ANOVA) when comparing value distributions, and then only if this reveals a statistical difference one must perform t-tests bin by bin.</p><p>Point 11:</p><p>The argument of this reviewer is well understood, but the issue here is that of expression levels: direct overexpression of laminin 211 increases BP proliferation, similar to overexpression of Sox9. But is the increased expression level of Laminin α2 caused by Sox9 overexpression of sufficient magnitude to really mediate this effect? In other words, the authors' conclusions would be much stronger if they could rescue the effects of Sox9 overexpression by blockade of its effect on Laminin 211 expression levels.</p><p>Point 12:</p><p>The argument about background is acceptable, and the new high magnifications are nice, but the comment that apical mitoses are only partly visible was completely ignored. Although there is no change in apical mitosis abundance, these histological results must still be shown and demonstrated properly. The current format (same as in the previous manuscript version) is unacceptable.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The paper has been improved by the new experiments of Sox9 CRISPR-Cas9-mediated Sox9 KO in the ferret, which are very interesting. However, I maintain a major concern about the overemphasis given to Sox9 as a &quot;key regulator&quot; of cortical size increase during evolution, which is not, in my opinion, supported by the data (see below). The findings remain interesting, but overemphasis in interpretation is misleading, and should be avoided.</p><p>Sox9 activation in mouse BP leads to a statistically significant, but very moderate in absolute terms, increase of BP proliferation, starting from a very low background of spontaneous (i.e. not induced by transgene) BP proliferation. The authors should take this point into serious consideration in the Discussion and throughout the paper, and substantially attenuate their proposal that Sox9 expression in BP is a key element explaining the expansion of the cortex in evolution.</p><p>The important effects shown by the KO in the ferret (though see point 2 below, to be clarified), which are certainly a worthy addition to the paper, should be reconciled with the relative ineffectiveness of Sox9 overexpression in mouse; perhaps <italic>Sox9</italic> expression in BP in the ferret is accompanied by expression of other important factors, and it is the synergy of Sox9 with these other factors that matters in the expansion of the cortex.</p><p>In the new Figure 3 (Sox9 ko in ferret), the PCNA -mCherry/mCherry -positive cells within the VZ are reported to be numerically similar between Sox9-mutant and control ferrets (histograms in Figure 3B), however the intensity of PCNA staining in the Sox9-mutant VZ (Figure 3A) is much lower than in control. This makes one fear that the 50% reduction of PCNA-positive cells reported for the mutant OSVZ (Figure 4B) may be contributed to by a lower efficiency of the staining. This should be clarified, the image shown and the data in the histogram should be consistent.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49808.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were enthusiastic about the paper but felt that some major revisions were required. In particular:</p><p>1) Why was laminin 211 selected for study?</p></disp-quote><p>As explained in the revised manuscript, laminin 211 (laminin α2, β1, ɣ1) was chosen as a representative member of the laminin family of proteins, because laminin α2, laminin β1 and laminin ɣ1 have previously been shown to be expressed in the embryonic mouse and fetal human VZ and SVZ, notably the human OSVZ (Lathia et al., 2007; Fietz et al., 2012; Florio et al., 2015), because laminin α2 has recently been shown to promote progenitor proliferation in the developing brain (Ahmed et al., 2019), and because laminin α2 was found to be increased upon conditional Sox9 expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) How does laminin 211 work to increase proliferation?</p></disp-quote><p>The group of Charles Ffrench-Constant (Ahmed et al., 2019) recently showed that laminin 211 promotes midbrain progenitor proliferation via integrins. In exploring a role of extracellular matrix (ECM) components on progenitor proliferation in the developing brain, our group previously found that activation of the ECM receptor integrin αvβ3 on basal progenitors in embryonic mouse neocortex promotes their expansion (Stenzel et al., 2014). All these data are consistent with the notion that laminin 211 increases basal progenitor proliferation via integrin signaling, as is discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Can you demonstrate that Sox9 loss of function in gyrated cortex impacts BP proliferation or fate?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the new data on the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of Sox9 in embryonic ferret neocortex (new Figure 3) demonstrate that the Sox9 loss of function in this gyrated cortex results in a substantial reduction of BP proliferation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Many of the other changes should be relatively straight-forward. Please see the attached full reviews to guide you in revising the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed all points raised by the reviewers, as is described in our point-by-point response below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] There are a few points that must be considered before this manuscript is ready for publication, which the authors are perfectly capable of addressing.</p><p>1) There is no justification as to choice of ferret developmental stages for their experiments, and this needs clarifying. Likewise, there is no justification as to why several different stages are analyzed in each case, when they are very similar and in fact considered equivalent (i.e. P2 and P3 in Figure 2). Most importantly, the authors only analyze 1 animal or embryo of each age, which renders it of limited use for statistical analysis. This is true in all analyses on ferret and human tissue throughout the study. At least for ferret, 3 animals must be analyzed per stage and variable studied.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewer, we have now added a clarification regarding the choice of the developmental stages for ferret. Specifically, we chose the developmental stages of the ferret based on: (i) availability of the tissue in order to reduce animal use, (ii) the time of the peak of neurogenesis (Kalebic et al., 2018).</p><p>Also in line with the reviewer's comment regarding the analysis of only 1 ferret each – albeit for two equivalent developmental stages –, we have now pooled equivalent developmental stages for ferret (e.g., P2 and P3 in Figure 2) and show the mean of these data, with the two individual values indicated (Figure 2, revised panels B and C). The same type of revision has been carried out for E40-P1 (Figure 5—figure supplement 1, revised panels B and C). The text has been revised accordingly.</p><p>For the new data on the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated KO of Sox9 in developing ferret neocortex (new Figure 3), data are the mean of 4 embryos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 3F, H, the authors count number of progenitor cells expressing the reporter protein per field of analysis. This is wrong because these experiments were done by <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation, and hence the abundance of cells expressing the reporter gene depends on the abundance of electroporated cells, which may vary quite significantly from embryo to embryo. These results should be eliminated from the study altogether.</p></disp-quote><p>In our hands, the abundance of electroporated cells does not vary that much from embryo to embryo, as can also be deduced from the similarity of the results obtained when expressing the data per RFP+ cells (previous Figure 3, panels E and G) vs. per field (previous Figure 3, panels F and H). Nonetheless, as requested by the reviewer, we have eliminated the per field data shown in the previous Figure 3 (now Figure 4), panels F and H, and likewise those shown in the previous Figure 3, panel L, and in the previous Figure 4 (now Figure 5), panel D, from the study and revised the figure legends and the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The images shown in Figure 3N, O are useless for the purpose of demonstrating/illustrating the degree of marker co-expression. High magnification images must be provided, as in Figure 3C', D', J' and M.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewer, we have now added high magnification images for the cell cycle re-entry data (previous Figure 3, panels N and O, now Figure 4, panels K, K’, L, L’).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors conclude that &quot;Sox9-induced increase in the proliferation of mouse BPs pertained primarily to bIPs&quot;, based on the absence of basal processes in phosphovimentin+ cells. While this interpretation is correct, one should never make strong statements based on the absence of evidence, in this case absence of a basal process. The authors must confirm this finding by analyzing Pax6 expression in these BPs. In mouse, bIPs are positive for Tbr2 and negative for Pax6, whereas bRGs (even if scarce in normal embryos) are Pax6+ and Tbr2-.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewer, we have added an analysis of Pax6 expression in BPs (new Figure 4—figure supplement 3). This shows, as anticipated by the reviewer, that conditional Sox9 expression in embryonic mouse neocortex indeed increased the proportion of the targeted cell-derived (RFP+) mitotic (pVim+) BPs that were Pax6-negative, i.e. bIPs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) There is a typo where indicating the p value for significance: &quot;q&lt;0.01&quot;. Q should be changed by a P.</p></disp-quote><p>The q in &quot;q&lt;0.01&quot; was not a typo. The term 'q-value' is a valid expression and refers to an FDR adjusted p-value. This has now been clarified in the revised Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 6, when the authors study whether the effects of Sox9 are cell-autonomous or not, they evaluate cells positive for NeuN (pan-neuronal marker) in the mouse Cortical Plate, where newborn neurons finish migration and start differentiation. Surprisingly, they find that in control embryos only 50% of CP cells are positive for NeuN, and 75% in Sox9-expressing embryos. What are the cells negative for NeuN? It is difficult to imagine such a high abundance of endothelial or other cell types, especially so early in development, prior to gliogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>In answer to the reviewer's question, we believe that most of the NeuN-negative cells are neurons whose maturation process is not yet complete and has not yet resulted in NeuN expression to a level detectable by immunohistochemistry. We agree with the reviewer that it is unlikely that the NeuN-negative cells are non-neuronal cells. This has now been clarified in the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In the subsection “Conditional Sox9 expression induces cell non-autonomous BP proliferation resulting in increased neuron production, especially of upper-layer neurons”, the authors conclude that Sox9 expression in BPs results in increased neuron production from BPs in a cell non-autonomous manner. They reach this conclusion after showing that there is only an increase in neurons negative for the reporter protein (RFP), but not in RFP+ neurons. This conclusion seems correct based on the results in RFP- cells, but then why are RFP+ cells not affected? Why Sox9+ cells exert this influence on neighboring cells only if those are Sox9-, but not on those that are Sox9+? Shouldn't the non cell-autonomous effect be indifferent to Sox9 expression? Is there a mechanism for this effect to be restricted to Sox9- (RFP-) cells only? This needs a clarifying explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the most likely explanation is related to the relative proportion of cells that are NeuN-positive. As shown in panel J of Figure 7 (previous Figure 6), the proportion of RFP+ cells that are NeuN+ is already almost 80% in the control, so to detect a statistically significant increase in this proportion upon conditional Sox9 expression will be difficult. In contrast, as shown in panel K of Figure 7, the proportion of nuclei that are RFP– and NeuN+ is only around 30% in the control, so one can more readily detect a significant increase in this proportion upon conditional Sox9 expression. This has now been clarified in the revised text.</p><p>In addition, we show that a proportion of the RFP+ cells switch to gliogenesis upon conditional Sox9 expression (panel F of revised Figure 5 (previous Figure 4)), which reduces the probability of detecting an increase in the proportion of RFP+ cells that are NeuN+.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) According to the results in Figures 7 and 8, the authors find that the non cell-autonomous effect of Sox9-expressing cells only applies to the production of Satb2+ neurons, but then the influence on the production of Tbr1+ neurons is cell-autonomous. This is problematic and the authors offer no explanation, but rather stick to the non cell-autonomous model. Additional arguments and/or data must be provided to clarify this point of conflict.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we believe that the most likely explanation is related to the relative proportion of cells that are Satb2+ or Tbr1+, and whether there is an increase or a decrease in this proportion. Specifically, as shown in panel H of revised Figure 8 (previous Figure 7), the proportion of RFP+ cells that are Satb2+ is already &gt;70% in the control, and although there is an increase in this proportion to almost 90% upon conditional Sox9 expression, this increase is not statistically significant, which presumably reflects the already high starting value of the control. In contrast, as shown in panel G of revised Figure 8, the proportion of RFP+ cells that are Tbr1+ is only around 30% in the control, and this proportion is decreased upon conditional Sox9 expression, two parameters that contribute to rendering this effect of Sox9 expression statistically significant. This has now been clarified in the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In the statistical analysis of data in Figure 7B, did the authors perform multiple comparisons before t-test?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not perform multiple comparisons in the statistical analysis of the data shown in the previous Figure 7B (now Figure 8B). For each bin (of equal size), we performed a separate t-test, comparing the percentage of RFP-positive cells in the respective bin of the CP 5 days after electroporation with control construct with the respective bin of the CP 5 days after electroporation with conditional Sox9 expression construct. We have now added this information to the legend of Figure 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) In Figure 7C, D, it is impossible to see co-expression of markers with the images provided. High magnifications must be added to illustrate this result, as already mentioned above for other figures. Related to these results, the authors must quantify density of Satb2+ neurons/field, and Satb2+/RFP- cells/field, as they do previously, to demonstrate increased abundance of this neuron type. Otherwise, their counts only show no difference in a cell-autonomous manner.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewer, we have now added high magnifications of the images shown in the revised Figure 8 (previous Figure 7), panels C-F.</p><p>Furthermore, as requested, we have quantified the number of Satb2-positive neurons per field (revised Figure 8 (previous Figure 7), new panel J) and of Satb2-positive, RFP-negative neurons per field (revised Figure 8 (previous Figure 7), new panel I). These quantifications show that the number of Satb2-positive neurons increase in a cell non-autonomous manner upon conditional Sox9 expression, corroborating our previous findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) In Figure 8A, B, are the values of transcript abundance statistically different? Some of it is mentioned in the text, but needs to be indicated in the figure. Laminin α2 is said to not be expressed at significantly different levels in the RNAseq data, while Sox9 was very different. This contradicts the conclusion that the effects of Sox9 on cortical progenitors are via increased expression of laminin α2. On this regard, the authors' conclusion is quite weak and circumstantial, as there is no functional data demonstrating a link between the phenotypes produced by Sox9 overexpression and laminin α2 treatment, even if these are similar.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewer, we now indicate the statistical significance values in Figure 9A, D (previous Figure 8A, B) and the corresponding figure legend.</p><p>Regarding the relationship between laminin α2 and Sox9, there appears to be a misunderstanding. We do not say that &quot;Laminin α2 is not expressed at significantly different levels in the RNAseq data&quot;– in fact it is, as shown in Figure 9A – but that &quot;the laminin α2 mRNA was not among the list of the 870 upregulated genes&quot;. The reason for this is that genes with low mRNA FPKM values, like laminin α2, were excluded from the analysis of the genes with increased expression upon conditional Sox9 expression. Importantly, we do not mean to imply that the various effects of Sox9 on cortical progenitors are mediated <underline>exclusively</underline> via increased expression of laminin α2. However, in light of our findings that (i) conditional Sox9 expression does increase laminin α2 mRNA levels (Figure 9A) and (ii) laminin 211 increases basal progenitor proliferation, we find it likely that increased laminin expression contributes to the increase in basal progenitor proliferation observed upon conditional Sox9 expression. We have clarified this issue in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Images in Figure 8C must be replaced by better examples and cropped properly. In their current format there is excessive background, the apical surface of the VZ is barely visible (and thus also apical mitoses), and the field of view of the images is so excessively narrow that the control slice shows a complete absence of basal mitoses.</p></disp-quote><p>The background reflects the fact that the slices were embedded in collagen, and so there is little we can do about this. To present the basal mitoses in a more convincing manner, we have now added high magnification images (Figure 9 (previous Figure 8), new panel E'), which clearly show abventricular mitoses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>While their findings are of potential interest, the manuscript has several weaknesses.</p><p>1) Loss-of-function evidence to support a role of SOX9 in neocortical expansion in gyrated mammalian brain is lacking. Knockdown or knockout SOX9 in ferret (or possibly human organoid) bRGs would be necessary to demonstrate the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this very constructive comment. As suggested by the reviewer, we have now performed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-out of Sox9 in embryonic ferret neocortex and observed the following upon ablation of Sox9: (i) a marked reduction of proliferating, PCNA-positive BPs in the ISVZ and OSVZ (new Figure 3, panel B); (ii) a decrease in mitoses in the germinal zones as revealed by pVim immunofluorescence, which was particularly striking for the ISVZ and OSVZ, indicative of a massive reduction of mitotic BPs (new Figure 3, panel C); (iii) a strong reduction of Sox2-positive neural progenitor cells in the ISVZ and OSVZ (new Figure 3, panel D), which pertained mostly to bRG-like cells bearing radial processes (new Figure 3, panel E). Taken together, these new data provide the requested loss-of-function evidence in support of a role of Sox9 in neocortical expansion in a gyrated mammalian brain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In their study, the authors forced SOX9 expression through <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation DNA construct into tamoxifen-treated E13.5 embryos of the Tis21-CreER<sup>T2</sup> mouse lines. Why wouldn't this lead to expression of SOX9 in derived neurons and glial cells as well as the BPs? (see Figure 3D). This may lead to artifacts, if more glia are generated between the dose of tamoxifen and harvest. i.e. What were the distributions of cell types that were harvested?</p></disp-quote><p>As anticipated by the reviewer, our approach of conditional Sox9 expression in mouse BPs will presumably result in some Sox9 expression in the postmitotic neurons and glial cells derived from these BPs (see, for example, Figure 4D, which is two days after <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation). However, as our study in focused on the effects of conditional Sox9 expression on progenitor cells in the SVZ, we do not see why maintenance of Sox9 expression in the postmitotic neurons and glial cells derived therefrom should pose a problem. Specifically, in answer of the reviewer's question, we have compared the distribution of cells between neocortices electroporated with control and conditional Sox9 construct, and observed no significant difference. These data have now been added to Figure 4—figure supplement 2, new panels C-E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Which specific ECM genes were upregulated after forced SOX9 expression? From the RNA-seq result in Table 1, only LAMA3 and A4 are upregulated, while the genes expressing Laminin β and γ chains are not listed. Was LAM211 components increased upon SOX9 misexpression? Justification for LAM211 was missing.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in stating that in Supplementary file 1, only the laminin α3 and the laminin α4 mRNAs, but not laminin β and γ chain mRNAs, are listed as being upregulated upon conditional Sox9 expression. The reason why the laminin α2 mRNA was not listed in that table is that because of its low mRNA FPKM value, it was not included in the analysis of the genes with increased expression upon conditional Sox9 expression. However, as shown in the previous Figure 8A (now Figure 9A), the laminin α2 mRNA is significantly increased upon conditional Sox9 expression.</p><p>In light of these data, we felt it was legitimate to focus on laminin 211. The laminin β and γ chains required to form laminin 211 are lamb1 and lamc1, both of which are expressed in the germinal zones / progenitor cells of embryonic mouse neocortex (Fietz et al., 2012, Florio et al., 2015). Although these mRNAs were not differentially expressed upon conditional Sox9 expression (data now shown in panels B and C of Figure 9) and therefore not included in Supplementary file 1, their endogenous expression levels would be sufficient to form laminin 211 together with the differentially expressed lama2 α chain. This has now been clarified in the revised text.</p><p>In addition, in the new Supplementary file 3, we now list those of the genes up-regulated upon conditional Sox9 expression that showed the highest scores in the GO term enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses (previous Figure 5, now Figure 6), i.e. that are ECM-related.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Previous studies showed SOX9 functions in neural stem cell proliferation and gliogenesis (Kang et al., 2012; Scott et al., 2010), partially weakening the novelty of this study, but the connection to evolution is novel.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a fair point. One of the studies pointed out by the reviewer, from the Briscoe lab, indeed shows the influence of Sox9 on neural stem cell proliferation at E10.5 in mouse, at a stage when the neuroepithelial cells start generating aRGs. This demonstration of a role of Sox9 in <underline>apical</underline> progenitor proliferation clearly constitutes an important contribution. However, as pointed out by the reviewer, our study extends the previous work by showing a novel role of Sox9 in <underline>basal</underline> progenitor proliferation and fate choice that is essential and exclusive to gyrencephalic species such as ferret and human. The study from the Briscoe lab is now cited in the revised manuscript.</p><p>The other study pointed out by the reviewer (Kang et al., 2012), already cited and discussed in the previous version of our manuscript, focuses on the role of Sox9 in developing spinal cord and shows an elegant mechanism for Sox9 to exert its effects on gliogenic fate choice by partnering with another transcription factor, NFIA. Again extending this work, our study shows a significant role for Sox9 in the initiation of gliogenesis in the neocortex, which was not shown before.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Readers will still be confused on the overall model. Does LAM211 produced by bRGs influencing the bRGs that surround them (paracrine) or some other mechanisms? Is this effect spatially restricted?</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify matters, the revised manuscript now includes a model (Supplementary file 1) that summarizes the effects of conditional Sox9 expression on basal progenitor proliferation, fate choice, and neuron output from basal progenitors. This model illustrates the proposed roles of local ECM production. We do not know the spatial range of the effects of the locally produced ECM.</p><p>As to the underlying mechanism, the laminin α chain is known to bind integrins (Loulier et al., 2009), which in turn have been shown to promote bRG and bIP proliferation through the pERK pathway (Ahmed et al., 2019; Fietz et al., 2010; Hall et al., 2008; Radakovitz et al., 2009; Stenzel et al., 2014, Long et al., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The paper is very interesting, in particular regarding a possible non-cell-autonomous action of Sox9 through extracellular matrix molecules, and the experiments are well conducted. However, some clarifications would be important.</p><p>1) The authors show that, interestingly, laminin 211 stimulates cell proliferation in slices. They also show that Sox9 stimulates the expression of Lama2, encoding a laminin. Would the expression of Lama2 by <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation have the same (or similar) effect of the expression of Sox9 on cell proliferation? (and perhaps gliogenesis)? This would much strengthen the evidence that laminins/ECM are important mediators of the function of Sox9 on progenitor cell proliferation (and perhaps gliogenesis), as interestingly suggested by the data. Even if the experiment did not work, the authors could still mention it and discuss it.</p></disp-quote><p>The suggestion by the reviewer to study the effects of Lama2 expression by <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation is very interesting. We have seriously thought about this experiment, but also needed to consider the following. Laminins are large heterotrimeric multidomain proteins and are functional in form of trimers composed of α, β and γ chains. Lama2 could form a trimer with any laminin β and γ chain. For Lama2 expression by <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation to mimic the effects of laminin 211 in slice culture, Lama2 would need to form a complete laminin trimer with Lamb1 and Lamc1. Whilst these additional laminin chains are expressed in the developing mouse neocortex, their levels may not be high enough to form a significant level of laminin 211 with overexpressed Lama2. Another point to consider is that overexpression of any laminin chain by electroporation is extremely difficult (and seldom performed) due to the size of an individual laminin chain; the coding sequences are 9.3 kilobases, 5.3 kilobases and 4.8 kilobases for Lama2, Lamb1 and Lamc1 respectively. In light of these considerations, we – like other groups in the field – decided to not overexpress the Lama2 α chain but rather add recombinant laminin 211 trimers to study their function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The proliferating cells in the SVZ of ferret and human express Sox9; however, they also coexpress other transcription factors, e.g. Sox2 (as also shown by the authors), typical of proliferating progenitors in general (in fact, both are also expressed in the VZ). So, one may argue that Sox2 (or another coexpressed Sox factor, or other factor) could also be (together with Sox9) a candidate for these functions of the SVZ cells, as part of a genetic program of proliferating cells which has been recruited to SVZ cells through evolution. These possibilities should be discussed more in depth. Also, the effects (or not) of the Sox9 knockouts on cell proliferation should be mentioned. Overall, although the observed effects of ectopic Sox9 expression are very interesting, they are not in my opinion sufficient to qualify Sox9 as a &quot;master regulator to promote neocortical expansion&quot; (Abstract) nor to state (Discussion) that &quot;The present study establishes Sox9 as a master regulator of BP proliferation and cell fate&quot;; I would moderate these statements a little.</p></disp-quote><p>The scenario outlined by the reviewer is valid and now discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Importantly, the new data showing reduced BP proliferation upon CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of Sox9 in embryonic ferret neocortex substantially support the proposed role of Sox9 as a key regulator of BP proliferation. Nonetheless, we have moderated our statements as appropriate and deleted the term &quot;master regulator&quot;.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another. While the paper is much improved, there are remaining concerns, detailed below that need to be addressed before a final decision can be made.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The manuscript has been very nicely revised following the comments and concerns on its initial version. Unfortunately, there are still a handful of points that were not addressed properly:</p><p>Point 4:</p><p>It is very nice that the authors performed this analysis. However, it is very surprising and strange that in control electroporated cortex of mouse embryos more than 70% of RFP+pVim+ cells in SVZ-IZ are Pax6+ (less than 30% are Pax6-; new Figure 4—figure supplement 3). A large body of literature, including studies from the Huttner lab, demonstrates that the vast majority of mouse cortical BPs are bIPs, hence most mitotic cells in SVZ-IZ are Pax6-.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in stating that the &quot;vast majority of mouse cortical BPs are bIPs&quot;. However, while the expression of Pax6 is clearly down-regulated concomitant with the transition from apical radial glia to bIPs, the Pax6 level in bIPs is not exactly zero. Rather, low Pax6 levels have been detected in mouse bIPs, and the proportion of mouse bIPs with low Pax6 levels increases during the course of neurogenesis. Thus, Fish et al., 2008 reported that ≈30% of E12.5-13.5 mouse BPs are weakly Pax6-positive. Hutton and Pevny 2011 (Developmental Biology 352, 40–47) stated for E16.5 mouse dorsal telencephalon &quot;These data demonstrate that both SOX2 and PAX6 are maintained at high levels in RGCs, but at lower levels in TBR2-positive IPCs&quot;. An additional issue here is the sensitivity of Pax6 detection, which likely shows variability depending on the method used.</p><p>The reviewer had previously requested an analysis – using the marker Pax6 – of the effects of conditional Sox9 expression specifically on bIPs, which should be Pax6-negative. However, as some bIPs are weakly Pax6-positive (see above) and mouse basal radial glia in the subventricular zone are known to be Pax6-positive, we focused our analysis at E15.5 (Figure 4—figure supplement 3) on those BPs that were truly Pax6-negative, in order to be sure to quantify only bIPs. This issue has now been clarified in the re-revised manuscript, with addition of the above-mentioned Hutton and Pevny reference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 9:</p><p>This is incorrect. Multiple comparisons tests must be performed (i.e. ANOVA) when comparing value distributions, and then only if this reveals a statistical difference one must perform t-tests bin by bin.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. As requested by the reviewer, we have now also performed a one-way ANOVA test, which revealed a statistical difference. We have added this information to the legend of Figure 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 11:</p><p>The argument of this reviewer is well understood, but the issue here is that of expression levels: direct overexpression of laminin 211 increases BP proliferation, similar to overexpression of Sox9. But is the increased expression level of Laminin α2 caused by Sox9 overexpression of sufficient magnitude to really mediate this effect? In other words, the authors' conclusions would if they could rescue the effects of Sox9 overexpression by blockade of its effect on Laminin 211 expression levels.</p></disp-quote><p>As to this point raised by the reviewer, we would like to emphasize that we do not mean to imply that the increased expression level of laminin α2 mRNA caused by conditional Sox9 expression is necessarily of sufficient magnitude to alone mediate the increase in BP proliferation by laminin 211. Rather, we would like to stress that laminin α2 is not the only target of conditional Sox9 expression, and that laminin 211 was primarily used as a proof-of-principle experiment to support the concept: conditional Sox9 expression –&gt; increased expression of ECM components –&gt; BP proliferation. We have now clarified this in the re-revised manuscript.</p><p>Although we do not think that we should discuss this in the re-revised manuscript, it should be noted that a modest increase in laminin α2 could have a wider reaching effect than anticipated, as once it has formed a stable extracellular trimer, it can interact with multiple neighbouring cells for some time. In other words, a modest increase in laminin α2 expression does not automatically imply an only minor functional effect.</p><p>Regarding a possible reversal of the effect of conditional Sox9 expression on BP proliferation by blockade of its effect on laminin 211 expression, this would be an extremely difficult experiment to perform properly, as it would require to perform such a blockade selectively in the Tis21 lineage (please see Figure 4A, B). As an (admittedly) crude alternative, we have explored a blockade of laminin 211 function by using an integrin-blocking antibody, as the increase in BP proliferation by laminin 211 is mediated via integrin signaling. Specifically, we have exposed control- and Sox9-electroporated mouse neocortices to an integrin-blocking antibody for 24 hours in HERO culture, and analyzed proliferation in the SVZ by immunostaining for PCNA (n=1). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, this experiment suggested that the increase in proliferation in the SVZ of Sox9-electroporated neocortex can be partially reversed by blocking ECM-induced integrin signaling using an integrin-blocking antibody. The limitation of this experiment is that integrins have other ECM ligands in addition to laminin 211, and so the integrin-blocking antibody would most likely also affect integrin signaling induced by ECM components other than laminin 211.

However, I maintain a major concern about the overemphasis given to Sox9 as a &quot;key regulator&quot; of cortical size increase during evolution, which is not, in my opinion, supported by the data (see below). The findings remain interesting, but overemphasis in interpretation is misleading, and should be avoided.</p></disp-quote><p>In line with the concern raised by the reviewer, we have completely eliminated the term &quot;key regulator&quot; from the manuscript and toned down our conclusions regarding the role of Sox9 in the evolutionary expansion of the neocortex.</p><p>Specifically:</p><p>The final sentence of the Abstract, which previously read:</p><p>“Our findings demonstrate that Sox9 exerts concerted effects on transcription, BP proliferation, neuron production, and neurogenic vs. gliogenic BP cell fate, suggesting that Sox9 acts as key regulator in the subventricular zone to promote neocortical expansion”, now reads:</p><p>“Our findings demonstrate that Sox9 exerts concerted effects on transcription, BP proliferation, neuron production, and neurogenic vs. gliogenic BP cell fate, suggesting that Sox9 may have contributed to promote neocortical expansion.”</p><p>The first sentence of the Discussion, which previously read:</p><p>“The present study establishes Sox9 as a key regulator of BP proliferation and cell fate”, now reads:</p><p>“The present study establishes Sox9 as an important regulator of BP proliferation and cell fate.”</p><p>The final sentence of the Discussion, which previously read:</p><p>“Hence, when collectively considering the effects of Sox9 on transcription, BP proliferation and fate, and neuron production, this transcription factor shows all the hallmarks expected for a key regulator that acts in the SVZ to promote neocortical expansion”, now reads:</p><p>“Hence, when collectively considering its effects on transcription, BP proliferation and fate, and neuron production, Sox9 acting in the SVZ shows many of the hallmarks expected for a transcription factor contributing to promote neocortical expansion.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Sox9 activation in mouse BP leads to a statistically significant, but very moderate in absolute terms, increase of BP proliferation, starting from a very low background of spontaneous (i.e. not induced by transgene) BP proliferation.

In considering this possibility, we noticed that Sox8, with which Sox9 can heterodimerize, shows a similar expression pattern with regard to the neocortical germinal zones as Sox9, being expressed in embryonic mouse neocortex essentially only in the VZ but in fetal human neocortex in the VZ, ISVZ and OSVZ. Hence, if there is synergy of Sox9 with Sox8, such differential expression of the two transcription factors between species could explain why the effects of Sox9 KO in embryonic ferret neocortex appear to be stronger than those of conditional Sox9 expression in embryonic mouse neocortex. We have now added this scenario to the re-revised Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the new Figure 3 (Sox9 ko in ferret), the PCNA -mCherry/mCherry -positive cells within the VZ are reported to be numerically similar between Sox9-mutant and control ferrets (histograms in Figure 3B), however the intensity of PCNA staining in the Sox9-mutant VZ (Figure 3A) is much lower than in control. This makes one fear that the 50% reduction of PCNA-positive cells reported for the mutant OSVZ (Figure 4B) may be contributed to by a lower efficiency of the staining. This should be clarified, the image shown and the data in the histogram should be consistent.</p></disp-quote><p>The possibility raised by the Reviewer does not really apply to our data, for the following reasons.</p><p>First of all, and importantly, the intensity of the PCNA immunostaining was not taken into consideration for the quantification shown in Figure 3B. Rather, the cells were classified either as PCNA+, even if the PCNA immunoreactivity was low, or PCNA–, if really no PCNA immunoreactivity could be detected. In other words, the difference in PCNA immunostaining intensity did not affect the quantification shown in Figure 3B, because we counted even the only weakly PCNA-positive cells as PCNA+.</p><p>Second, it should be noted that in the two PCNA immunostainings shown in Figure 3A, the brightest cells are equally bright for both the control and the Sox9 KO. This is obvious when comparing, between the control and the Sox9 KO, (i) the PCNA<sup>+</sup> cells at the apical surface, and (ii) the brightest cells in the OSVZ. However, as noted by the reviewer, in the basal region of the VZ, which contains basal progenitors migrating to the SVZ and apical progenitors in S-phase, the staining of the PCNA<sup>+</sup> cells is less intense in the Sox9 KO than the control. We believe that this actually is a phenotype of the Sox9 KO, in particular when considering that many of the cells in the basal VZ are newborn basal progenitors that are migrating away from the VZ. This decrease in PCNA immunostaining intensity would be in accordance with the main finding of this figure, which is that the Sox9 KO causes a reduction in cycling basal progenitors. Please note that this conclusion can be reached independently of the PCNA immunostaining when considering the abundance of mitotic progenitors in the ISVZ and OSVZ as revealed by phospho-vimentin immunostaining (Figure 3C).</p><p>We have now clarified this issue in the legend to Figure 3.</p></body></sub-article></article>
