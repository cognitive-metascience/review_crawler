Dopamine neuron activity is altered in chronic stress-based models of depression, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that mice subject to chronic mild unpredictable stress (CMS) exhibit anxiety- and depressive-like behavior, which was associated with decreased VTA dopamine neuron firing in vivo and ex vivo. Dopamine neuron firing is governed by voltage-gated ion channels, in particular hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels. Following CMS, HCN-mediated currents were decreased in nucleus accumbens-projecting VTA dopamine neurons. Furthermore, shRNA-mediated HCN2 knockdown in the VTA was sufficient to recapitulate CMS-induced depressive- and anxiety-like behavior in stress-naïve mice, whereas VTA HCN2 overexpression largely prevented CMS-induced behavioral deficits. Together, these results reveal a critical role for HCN2 in regulating VTA dopamine neuronal activity and depressive-related behaviors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chronic mild stress (CMS)</kwd><kwd>dopamine neuron</kwd><kwd>action potential</kwd><kwd>anxiety</kwd><kwd>depression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30MH115536</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vickstrom</surname><given-names>Casey R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA035217</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Qing-song</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH101146</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Qing-song</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008980</institution-id><institution>Medical College of Wisconsin</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research and Education Initiative Fund, Advancing a Healthier Wisconsin (AWH)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Qing-song</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>HCN2 channels in the ventral tegmental area play an important role in the pathophysiology of chronic mild stress-induced behavioral deficits.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Depression is highly prevalent throughout the world population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kessler and Merikangas, 2004</xref>). Clinically available antidepressants share the same core mechanisms of blocking serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake in the brain. However, a significant number of patients with depression do not fully respond to serotonin and/or noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Harbi, 2012</xref>). There is an increasing appreciation for the role of dopamine in the pathophysiology of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nestler and Carlezon, 2006</xref>). Levels of dopamine metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid are reduced in depressive subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bowden et al., 1997</xref>). There is a high incidence (30–50%) of comorbid depression in patients with Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Burn, 2002</xref>), which is characterized by the degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberico et al., 2015</xref>). In patients with untreated Parkinson's disease, higher depression scores were associated with lower dopamine synthesis capacity in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Joutsa et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, in a double-blind clinical study, the dopamine receptor agonist pramipexole produced antidepressant effects in patients that failed to respond to standard antidepressant treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Franco-Chaves et al., 2013</xref>). Given the well-established role of dopamine in reward processing and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brischoux et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Morales and Margolis, 2017</xref>), and that anhedonia and lack of motivation are core symptoms of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nestler and Carlezon, 2006</xref>), it is thought that dysfunction of the dopamine reward system might contribute to anhedonia and the loss of motivation common in depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nestler and Carlezon, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Chronic mild unpredictable stress (CMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Willner, 2005</xref>) and chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Golden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Krishnan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Krishnan and Nestler, 2011</xref>) are well-established rodent models of depression. However, CMS and CSDS induce opposing changes in ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neuron activity: CMS reduced action potential (AP) firing in VTA dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chang and Grace, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Moreines et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tye et al., 2013</xref>), whereas susceptibility to CSDS was accompanied by an increase in AP firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chaudhury et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Krishnan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ku and Han, 2017</xref>). The behavioral effects of optogenetically activating or inhibiting VTA dopamine neurons also differ between mice subject to CMS or CSDS. In the CSDS model, optogenetic phasic stimulation of VTA neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) induced susceptibility to social defeat, whereas optogenetic inhibition of the VTA–NAc projection induced resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chaudhury et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, optogenetic phasic stimulation of VTA dopamine neurons reversed CMS-induced depressive-like behavior, while optogenetic inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons induced behavioral despair and decreased sucrose preference in stress-naïve mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tye et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, modulating VTA dopamine neuron firing can enhance or prevent the development of depression-like behavior, and potential factors that might explain these divergent results have been contemplated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hollon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lammel et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>AP firing in VTA dopamine neurons is governed by multiple voltage-dependent ionic conductances, including the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I<sub>h</sub>), which is generated by hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McDaid et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Okamoto et al., 2006</xref>). There are four subtypes of HCN (HCN1-4), which mainly form homotetramers with distinct properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wahl-Schott and Biel, 2009</xref>) and have different brain distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Notomi and Shigemoto, 2004</xref>). Although <italic>Hcn1-4</italic> mRNAs are expressed in the VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Monteggia et al., 2000</xref>), immunostaining for HCN protein has shown that HCN2 is the predominant HCN subunit expressed in the VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Notomi and Shigemoto, 2004</xref>). Tetratricopeptide repeat-containing Rab8b-interacting protein (TRIP8b) is an auxiliary subunit of HCN1-4 channels and is required for HCN trafficking and enrichment at dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Han et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lewis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lewis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Santoro et al., 2009</xref>). Global knockout of <italic>Hcn1</italic> or <italic>Trip8b</italic> reduced behavioral despair, but these mice did not display anxiolytic-like behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lewis et al., 2011</xref>), while lentivirus-mediated shRNA knockdown of HCN1 in the dorsal hippocampus promoted both anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). The antidepressant-like effects of global <italic>Trip8b</italic> knockout can be reversed by reinstating TRIP8b expression in the dorsal hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Han et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lyman et al., 2017</xref>). Apathetic (<italic>Hcn2<sup>ap/ap</sup></italic>) mice with a spontaneous null mutation in <italic>Hcn2</italic> show reduced behavioral despair in the tail suspension test, but these mice exhibit deficits in motor coordination and locomotion and cannot perform the forced swim test due to an inability to swim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lewis et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, HCN channels can be powerful regulators of depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors, and different HCN isoforms in different brain regions may play distinct roles in regulating rodent behavior.</p><p>The I<sub>h</sub> current generates pacemaker activity via permeability to cations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biel and Michalakis, 2009</xref>), and enhancing I<sub>h</sub> current increases AP firing in VTA dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Friedman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McDaid et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Okamoto et al., 2006</xref>). CSDS leads to an increase in I<sub>h</sub> current in VTA dopamine neurons in susceptible mice, and an even further increase in I<sub>h</sub> current in resilient mice, but normal AP firing is achieved in resilient mice via homeostatic upregulation of voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Friedman et al., 2014</xref>). Overexpression of HCN2 in VTA dopamine neurons or intra-VTA infusion of an I<sub>h</sub> potentiator in susceptible animals produced a reversal of social avoidance behavior, likely by a homeostatic upregulation of K<sup>+</sup> current and the subsequent normalization of AP firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Friedman et al., 2014</xref>). However, given that CMS and CSDS induce distinct neuroadaptations in VTA dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chaudhury et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hollon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lammel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tye et al., 2013</xref>), in particular the observation that CMS leads to decreased VTA dopamine neuron firing, it is of interest to investigate whether CMS alters I<sub>h</sub> current in VTA dopamine neurons, and if so, whether the alteration of I<sub>h</sub> current contributes to the development of depressive-like behaviors.</p><p>VTA dopamine neurons are heterogeneous in their projection targets and HCN expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gantz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Morales and Margolis, 2017</xref>). In mice, neurons that project to the lateral shell of the NAc display large I<sub>h</sub> current, whereas those that project to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), medial shell of the NAc, or basolateral amygdala exhibit minimal I<sub>h</sub> current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baimel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lammel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lammel et al., 2011</xref>). Dopamine neurons projecting to the lateral shell of the NAc are thought to signal primary reward and salience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lammel et al., 2011</xref>), and optogenetic stimulation of an excitatory input to dopamine neurons projecting to the NAc lateral shell elicits reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lammel et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, in the present study, we investigated how CMS affects I<sub>h</sub> current in VTA dopamine neurons that project to the lateral shell of the NAc. Furthermore, we determined whether virus-mediated knockdown or overexpression of HCN2 in the VTA affects depression- and anxiety-like behaviors. We provide evidence that CMS led to a decrease in I<sub>h</sub> current in NAc lateral shell-projecting VTA dopamine neurons, and that manipulating HCN2 expression in the VTA can powerfully regulate depressive- and anxiety-like behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CMS induced depressive and anxiety-like behavior</title><p>About equal numbers of C57BL/6J and DAT-tdTomato reporter mice (generated by crossing <italic>Slc6a3<sup>Cre+/−</sup></italic> mice with Ai9 mice; see Materials and methods) were exposed to a variety of mild stressors in an unpredictable manner for 5 weeks (CMS group), while age-matched, stress-naïve C57BL/6J and DAT-tdTomato littermates served as corresponding control groups, and did not receive any special treatments except normal handling and behavioral tests. We have previously shown that mice exposed to CMS for 5 weeks exhibit depressive-like behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhong et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhong et al., 2014b</xref>), which can be reversed by chronic treatments with the antidepressant fluoxetine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). C57BL/6J mice and DAT-tdTomato mice are on the same genetic background, and because there were no significant differences between these groups in the various behavioral tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), the results were pooled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

We then examined whether CMS leads to depressive- and anxiety-like behavior. First, to assess whether CMS-exposed mice exhibit anxiety-related behavior or altered locomotor activity, we used the open field test (OFT). Mice tend to avoid open spaces, and reduced time spent in the center of an open field has been correlated with anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">El Yacoubi et al., 2003</xref>). There was no significant difference between control and CMS groups in the total distance travelled (<italic>t</italic><sub>24</sub> = 0.5, p=0.615; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>); in contrast, the time spent in the center square of the open field was significantly decreased in the CMS group (<italic>t</italic><sub>24</sub> = 2.9, p=0.007; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Second, the sucrose preference test (SPT) was performed to assess anhedonia, a core symptom of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duman, 2007</xref>). CMS significantly decreased sucrose preference compared with control mice (<italic>t</italic><sub>24</sub> = 4.6, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Third, the elevated plus maze (EPM) test was carried out.

Fourth, to assess depressive- and anxiety-like behavior, we used the novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Santarelli et al., 2003</xref>). An increase in the latency to feed on food in the center of a novel open field is indicative of anxiety- and depressive-like behavior.

Thus, the CMS-induced increase in the latency to feed in the novel environment cannot be explained by possible changes in appetite. Finally, the forced swim test (FST) was carried out.

Here, we have identified a putative mechanism linking CMS to decreased VTA dopamine neuron firing and the resulting behavioral deficits. We show in mice that following CMS, depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors and decreased VTA dopamine neuron firing are associated with reduced I<sub>h</sub> current and a hyperpolarizing shift in I<sub>h</sub> current in VTA dopamine neurons. Importantly, this decrease in I<sub>h</sub> current is behaviorally relevant, as shRNA knockdown of HCN2 in the VTA was sufficient to recapitulate depressive- and anxiety-like behavior, while VTA HCN2 overexpression prevented the CMS-induced development of depressive-like behavior. Thus, the downregulation of HCN2 channels in VTA dopamine neurons may be a primary contributor to the CMS-induced development of depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors.</p><p>CMS or other homotypic chronic stressors typically cause decreases in population activity, tonic and burst firing in VTA dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chang and Grace, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Moore et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Moreines et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tye et al., 2013</xref>). We showed that the population activity, as well as the frequency of tonic and burst firing in VTA dopamine neurons were decreased in CMS-exposed mice. Importantly, our in vivo recordings targeted the lateral PBP, which is a more lateral subdivision of the VTA where dopamine neurons predominantly project to the lateral shell of the NAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lammel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lammel et al., 2011</xref>) and play a primary role in reward and motivated behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lammel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lammel et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, CMS leads to decreased population activity in medial and central regions of the VTA but does not significantly alter population activity in the lateral VTA in the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Moreines et al., 2017</xref>). Further, no change in firing rate or burst firing was found in any VTA region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Moreines et al., 2017</xref>), consistent with their previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chang and Grace, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Moore et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast, our study and a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tye et al., 2013</xref>) found significant reductions in firing rate and burst firing following CMS, and we found decreased population activity in lateral VTA dopamine neurons. We suspect this discrepancy is due to differences in CMS paradigms and animal species, as the former studies applied 3–4 stressors/week over 4 weeks in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chang and Grace, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Moreines et al., 2017</xref>), whereas our study applied 14 stressors/week over 5 weeks in mice, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tye et al.

CSDS, in contrast to CMS, increases tonic and burst firing in mice susceptible to CSDS, but not in resilient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anstrom et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chaudhury et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Friedman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Krishnan et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, optogenetic phasic stimulation of NAc-projecting VTA neurons induced susceptibility to subthreshold social defeat stress, whereas optogenetic inhibition of the VTA–NAc projection induced resilience to CSDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chaudhury et al., 2013</xref>). However, optogenetic phasic stimulation of VTA dopamine neurons reversed the CMS-induced decrease in sucrose preference and increase in immobility in the tail suspension test (TST) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tye et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, in non-stressed mice, optogenetic inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons was sufficient to reduce sucrose preference and increase immobility in the TST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tye et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, these two models do not produce unitary effects on dopamine neuronal activity, and optogenetic manipulations of dopamine neuronal activity produce divergent behavioral changes, depending on the animal model used. Perhaps manipulations that <italic>normalize</italic> disruptions in AP firing induced by CMS or CSDS can produce antidepressant-like or resilient phenotypes.</p><p>In VTA dopamine neurons, I<sub>h</sub> current generates pacemaker activity together with other voltage-dependent ion channels. Pharmacological manipulations that increase I<sub>h</sub> current in VTA dopamine neurons lead to increased AP firing frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Friedman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wanat et al., 2008</xref>), whereas the I<sub>h</sub> blocker ZD7288 reduces spontaneous AP firing in VTA dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McDaid et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Okamoto et al., 2006</xref>). We therefore investigated whether CMS altered I<sub>h</sub> current in VTA dopamine neurons, as this may contribute to the CMS-induced reduction in AP firing. VTA dopamine neurons are heterogeneous in their afferent and efferent connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brischoux et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Morales and Margolis, 2017</xref>) and electrophysiological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gantz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lammel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lammel et al., 2011</xref>). Dopamine neurons in the lateral VTA typically fire with low-frequency (&lt;10 Hz), project to the NAc lateral shell, and exhibit a large I<sub>h</sub> current, and both rewarding and aversive stimuli modify synapses onto these dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lammel et al., 2011</xref>). CSDS increases I<sub>h</sub> current in NAc-projecting VTA neurons but not in mPFC-projecting VTA neurons in susceptible mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Friedman et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, the amplitude of I<sub>h</sub> current in NAc-projecting VTA neurons is further increased in resilient mice, but normal AP firing in these mice is made possible via homeostatic upregulation of voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Friedman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Krishnan et al., 2007</xref>).

CMS also led to a significant hyperpolarizing shift (~−5 mV) of V<sub>1/2</sub>, which can reduce I<sub>h</sub> activation to hyperpolarizing stimuli. The mechanisms for this hyperpolarizing shift remain to be investigated. Additionally, we found that AP firing in VTA dopamine neurons ex vivo was significantly decreased in CMS-exposed mice. Unlike in vivo, the burst firing activity of VTA dopamine neurons is lacking ex vivo, likely due to the severing of synaptic inputs during slice cutting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McDaid et al., 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, we isolated the cell-autonomous effect of I<sub>h</sub> current on AP firing by performing cell-attached recordings in the presence of the glutamate receptor and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonists. We found that AP firing was decreased in CMS slices, and that the I<sub>h</sub> blocker ZD7288 produced a greater decrease in the firing rate in control slices than in CMS slices. Together, these studies indicate that CMS induced a decrease in I<sub>h</sub> current in VTA dopamine neurons, likely leading to the decrease in AP firing in vivo following CMS.</p><p>HCN channels contribute to resting membrane potential and conductance in neuronal cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banks et al., 1993</xref>), dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tsay et al., 2007</xref>), and presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huang and Trussell, 2011</xref>). Consistent with this, we found that knockdown of HCN2 led to a significant decrease in resting membrane conductance, as derived from the instantaneous inward currents present immediately after hyperpolarizing voltage steps from a holding potential of −60 mV. Additionally, CMS led to a non-significant trend towards reduced resting conductance. These results together suggest that HCN2 channels modestly contribute to overall resting membrane conductance.</p><p>HCN1, HCN2 and the auxiliary subunit TRIP8b have previously been shown to regulate behavioral despair. <italic>Hcn1</italic> or <italic>Trip8b</italic> knockout leads to reduced immobility in the tail suspension test and forced swim test, and <italic>Hcn2<sup>ap/ap</sup></italic> mice show reduced immobility in the tail-suspension test, but these mice exhibit deficits in motor coordination and locomotion and cannot swim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lewis et al., 2011</xref>).

Interestingly, depolarizing current injections elicited significantly more action potentials following HCN1 knockdown, knockout, and I<sub>h</sub> blockade in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lewis et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McDaid et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Okamoto et al., 2006</xref>), we found that an HCN blocker or knockdown of HCN2 decreases AP firing in VTA dopamine neurons. Thus, it seems that the functional role of HCN channels depends on several factors, including the cellular location of HCN expression (e.g. distal dendrite vs. cell soma), the HCN isoform, the cell type in which HCN channels are expressed, and likely other factors. In VTA dopamine neurons, our results support a ‘pro-excitability’ role for HCN2, likely by generating a pacemaker current to support repetitive AP firing. It is possible that the differing neurophysiological functions of HCN channels in the dorsal hippocampus compared with VTA dopamine neurons may account for the opposing behavioral effects of HCN inhibition or activation in these structures.</p><p>Overexpression of HCN2 in VTA dopamine neurons, or intra-VTA infusion of the I<sub>h</sub> potentiator lamotrigine, produces the resilient phenotype in mice subjected to CSDS by activating a homeostatic mechanism leading to an upregulation of voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels and normalization of AP firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Friedman et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, intra-VTA infusion of an I<sub>h</sub> inhibitor can also promote the resilient phenotype following CSDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cao et al., 2010</xref>). How might an I<sub>h</sub> inhibitor lead to the same behavioral effect as I<sub>h</sub> potentiation? Whereas the I<sub>h</sub> inhibitor was applied acutely to CSDS-susceptible mice and presumably decreased abnormally elevated dopamine neuron firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cao et al., 2010</xref>), lamotrigine was administered repeatedly for five days and HCN2 was allowed to overexpress for four days before behavioral assessments were carried out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Friedman et al., 2014</xref>). I<sub>h</sub> potentiation led to an upregulation of K<sup>+</sup> currents in each scenario, leading to a reduction in otherwise abnormally elevated dopamine neuron excitability. In our study, CMS- or shRNA-mediated suppression of I<sub>h</sub> current leads to abnormally decreased dopamine neuron firing, and results in depressive- and anxiety-like behavior. Altogether, these findings support the notion that abnormal dopamine neuron firing is a unifying contributor to the development of depressive-like behavior.</p><p>Although shRNA-mediated HCN2 knockdown recapitulated the behavioral effects of CMS, it did not affect body weight. As body weight was measured 3 weeks after HCN2 knockdown, whereas the CMS-induced decrease in body weight was observed after 5 weeks of CMS, it is possible that body weight perturbations induced by HCN2 knockdown require additional time to manifest. Alternatively, HCN2 knockdown may not recapitulate all effects of CMS. Importantly, although the HCN2 knockdown was not cell type-specific, VTA dopamine neurons should be predominantly affected by the knockdown, as VTA GABA and glutamate neurons in mice exhibit little to no I<sub>h</sub> current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chieng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hnasko et al., 2012</xref>). Further, VTA dopamine neurons projecting to the mPFC, NAc medial shell, or basolateral amygdala exhibit minimal I<sub>h</sub> current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baimel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lammel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lammel et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, NAc lateral shell-projecting VTA dopamine neurons should be the predominant VTA population affected by the knockdown.</p><p>Additionally, overexpression of HCN2 in the VTA prevented the majority of CMS-induced behavioral deficits and produced antidepressant-like effects. In the CSDS model, HCN2 overexpression selectively in NAc-projecting VTA neurons, but not in mPFC-projecting VTA neurons, normalizes social interaction deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Friedman et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, it is likely that enhancing I<sub>h</sub> current promotes the resilient phenotype in CSDS via effects on the VTA-NAc pathway. A limitation of our study is that although HCN2 overexpression is VTA-specific, it is not cell type- or projection-specific. As the VTA is heterogeneous with regard to cell type, connectivity, and behavioral function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Morales and Margolis, 2017</xref>), future studies employing more sophisticated viral tools for cell- and projection-specific overexpression of HCN2 will likely be necessary to parse out the contributions of individual VTA circuits to CMS-induced behavioral deficits. Nevertheless, a salient commonality between these studies is that I<sub>h</sub> potentiation is capable of producing antidepressant-like phenotypes in both models, despite the fact that CSDS and CMS induced distinct neuroadaptations in VTA dopamine neuron activity and I<sub>h</sub> current.</p><p>HCN channels have been implicated in a variety of brain disorders, including epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benarroch, 2013</xref>), Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chan et al., 2011</xref>), neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">DiFrancesco and DiFrancesco, 2015</xref>), tinnitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 2015</xref>), and Neurofibromatosis type 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Omrani et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, the rewarding effects of ethanol are believed to arise in part from activating HCN channels in VTA dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Okamoto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tateno and Robinson, 2011</xref>). Consistent with this idea, overexpression of HCN2 in the VTA increases ethanol reward and consumption in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rivera-Meza et al., 2014</xref>), perhaps through an increased ethanol-induced activation of I<sub>h</sub> current and AP firing in dopamine neurons. Further, chronic ethanol exposure can reduce I<sub>h</sub> current in VTA dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Okamoto et al., 2006</xref>). Given that alcohol use disorder (AUD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are frequently comorbid in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yoon et al., 2015</xref>), and that AUD can prospectively predict future MDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boschloo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brière et al., 2014</xref>), a speculative mechanistic explanation is that chronic alcohol use leads to downregulation of HCN2 in VTA dopamine neurons, which may directly contribute to the development of depressive behavior. Given the widespread distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Notomi and Shigemoto, 2004</xref>) and functional diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Santoro and Baram, 2003</xref>) of HCN channels in the brain, it is likely that HCN channels play important roles in a wide variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes.</p><p>Clinical and animal studies suggest that VTA dopamine neurons and their major projection target, the NAc, play a critical role in the pathophysiology of depression. Depression and anxiety occur in 40–50% of patients with Parkinson's disease and these symptoms sometimes precede the appearance of motor dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Burn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dooneief et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Taylor et al., 1986</xref>). The dopamine agonist pramipexole produces antidepressant effects in patients who failed to respond to standard antidepressant treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Franco-Chaves et al., 2013</xref>). Different molecular changes in the VTA to NAc pathway confer vulnerability or resilience to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Francis and Lobo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Krishnan et al., 2007</xref>), though relatively few studies have been conducted to study CMS-induced neuroadaptations in the mesolimbic dopamine system. The present study reveals that CMS is associated with a decrease in both AP firing and I<sub>h</sub> current in VTA dopamine neurons that project to the NAc. Additionally, HCN2 knockdown in the VTA was sufficient to induce depressive- and anxiety-like behavior in non-stressed mice, whereas HCN2 overexpression prevented the CMS-induced development of depressive-like behavior. Thus, HCN2 channels in the VTA play a critical role in regulating depressive- and anxiety-like behavior in both unstressed and chronically stressed mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The brain was trimmed and embedded in 3% low-melting-point agarose, and horizontal midbrain slices (200 μm thick) were cut using a vibrating slicer (Leica VT1200s, Nussloch, Germany), as described in our recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tong et al., 2017</xref>). Slices were prepared in a choline-based solution containing (in mM): 110 choline chloride, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 7 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 glucose, 11.6 sodium ascorbate, and 3.1 sodium pyruvate at room temperature. The VTA slices were cut in the midline to produce two individual slices from each section. The slices were incubated for 30 min in sucrose-based solution containing (in mM): 78 NaCl, 68 sucrose, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 25 glucose. Then, the slices were allowed to recover for at least 30 min in the artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM): 119 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 10 glucose. All solutions were saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Whole-cell and cell-attached patch-clamp recordings were made as described in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhong et al., 2015</xref>). Recordings were made using patch-clamp amplifiers (Multiclamp 700B) under infrared differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using DigiData 1440A and 1550B digitizers and the analysis software pClamp 10.3 (Molecular Devices). Signals were filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz. I<sub>h</sub> current was measured by inducing 1.5 s hyperpolarizing steps from −60 mV to −130 mV with −10 mV steps. Junction potentials between the patch pipette and bath ACSF were nullified prior to obtaining a seal. For the generation of I<sub>h</sub> activation curves, 1.5 s hyperpolarizing steps to various potentials (−60 to −130 mV) were applied from a holding potential of −60 mV and tail currents were measured at −130 mV. Tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA-Cl, 10 mM) was included in the ACSF to block non-inactivating voltage-dependent K<sup>+</sup> conductance and osmolality was maintained by equimolar reduction of NaCl from the ACSF. Tail current amplitudes at −130 mV, after subtraction of the current following no hyperpolarizing step, were plotted as a function of test potentials. The I<sub>h</sub> activation curve was fitted with a Boltzmann function <italic>I</italic> = <italic>I</italic><sub>max</sub>/exp[(<italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> – <italic>V</italic><sub>1/2</sub>)/s], where <italic>I</italic><sub>max</sub> is the maximal tail current amplitude, <italic>V</italic> is the test potential, <italic>V</italic><sub>1/2</sub> is the half-activation potential, and <italic>s</italic> is the slope factor. Resting membrane conductance was approximated from voltage clamp recordings in a manner similar to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kimura et al., 1988</xref>). Hyperpolarizing voltage steps from a resting holding potential of −60 mV to −130 mV in 10 mV steps generated instantaneous inward currents (I<sub>ins</sub>). I<sub>ins</sub> was plotted against the hyperpolarizing voltage steps. The slope of these I-V curves provides an approximation of the resting membrane conductance (G<sub>resting</sub>). Membrane capacitance was measured by Clampex software (Molecular Devices) using small amplitude hyperpolarizing and depolarizing steps (±5 mV). Firing rate was recorded in the cell-attached configuration in the presence of CNQX (10 µM), D-AP5 (20 µM) and picrotoxin (50 µM) to block excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. Glass pipettes (3–5 MΩ) were filled with an internal solution containing (in mM): 140 K-gluconate, 10 KCl, 10 HEPES, 0.2 EGTA, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na<sub>2</sub>GTP (pH 7.2 with KOH). Series resistance (10–20 MΩ) was monitored throughout all recordings, and data were discarded if the resistance changed by more than 20%. All recordings were performed at 32 ± 1°C by using an automatic temperature controller (Warner Instruments, Inc.).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunofluorescence staining</title><p>Mice were anaesthetized by ketamine (90 mg/kg, i.p.) and xylazine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and transcardially perfused with 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 4% sucrose-PBS (pH 7.4). After perfusion, the brain was removed and post-fixed in the same fixative for 4 hr at 4°C, and was then dehydrated in increasing concentrations of sucrose (20% and 30%) in 0.1 M PBS at 4°C and frozen on dry ice. Coronal VTA sections (20 µm) were cut with a Leica cryostat. VTA sections were incubated with antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, mouse, 1:300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and/or NeuN (rabbit, 1:400; Millipore) at 4°C for 48 hr. VTA sections were then incubated with anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated (goat, 1:300; Cell Signaling) and anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated (goat, 1:100; Invitrogen) or anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated (goat, 1:300; Cell Signaling) secondary antibodies for 4 hr at room temperature in the dark. To reveal labeled cells using the juxtacellular method, VTA sections were first incubated with Texas Red avidin D (1:100; Vector Laboratories) to retrieve the labeled cell bodies. Then, the selected tissue sections were incubated with anti-TH (rabbit, 1:300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 48 hr) and anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated (goat, 1:500; Cell Signaling; 4 hr).

The authors use a combination of behavior, electrophysiology, and RNA knock-down/overexpression to investigate changes in HCN current after CMS, and the effect of manipulating HCN channels on animals' behavior. The authors present a number of important findings. First, they report that CMS causes anxiety- or depressive-like behavior, which is associated with reduced DA neuron activity in the VTA. Then, they report that CMS also causes reduced synaptic excitation of VTA DA neurons, as well as reduced HCN current. They went on to preform behavioral experiments to demonstrate that knock-down of HCN2 in the VTA is sufficient to induce depressive-like behavior in mice and that over-expression of HCN2 in the VTA is sufficient to prevent depressive-like behavior in response to CMS. This is an interesting paper with several important findings, but there are several unclear parts at this point</p><p>One unclear part with the study is a lack of mechanistic understanding of how modulation of HCN channels regulates DA neuron activity, in particular regarding the relationship between the observed changes in synaptic and intrinsic excitability. The authors show effects in minis and AMPA/NMDA ratio, but these findings are not followed up and are not put in the context of HCN channels. HCN channels can have effects on synaptic and intrinsic excitability (input resistance, resting membrane potential, etc.) but this is neither addressed or discussed</p><p>As a result, as it is currently presented, the synaptic excitation data is out of place and it is confusing how it is related, if at all, to the main finding regarding changes in HCN channels. There is only a very brief discussion mentioning that changes in synaptic input, as well as changes in HCN, may work together to underlie behavioral output.</p><p>The writing is also confusing: are the authors after the intrinsic and synaptic properties mediating the changes in the excitability of VTA neurons or are the after the role of H channels. The Intro was confusing in this regard too, as it does not prepare the reader as to what to expect</p><p>One other unclear point is whether the authors intend to focus on VTA DA neuron activity as a whole population, or specifically the population of neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Because the experiments here target various neuron populations in the VTA, this complicates the understanding and the interpretation of results in the context of a heterogeneous population of VTA DA neurons.</p><p>The VTA contains a heterogeneous population of DA neurons with respect their projection targets and HCN channel expression. Specifically, neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) exhibit large HCN currents, whereas those that project to the prefrontal cortex do not. However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, and 8, the authors seemingly record from the entire VTA population, while in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, and 6, they specifically target the NAc-projecting population, which exhibit large HCN currents. (Note: in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> legend, it states that the recordings are from NAc-projecting neurons, but this is not discussed in the text describing these experiments.) Therefore, the rationale for this experimental design is unclear.</p><p>This confusion does not allow for a clear understanding and assessment of the novelty of this work, especially in relationship to the paper by Friedman et al., 2014, which also deals with Ih and VTA neuronal excitability in another stress paradigm. This paper shows several different and similar results to this paper. Although the authors mention this paper several times, the rationale for their experimental design (cell types etc.) and the discussion of their results is not clear; therefore, I was unable to form a clear picture on the role of VTA HCN channels in behavioral responses to chronic stress.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript examines the regulation of dopamine neurons that project to a specific area of the nucleus accumbens in control and following treatment of animals with manipulations that induce chronic stress. The results show that the animals show signs of stress induce depression, the activity of dopamine neurons is decreased and there is a reduction in I-h. Decreasing I-h with sh-RNA results in depressive like behaviors and expressing I-h prevents the depressive like behaviors.</p><p>1) This is careful work looking at dopamine neurons using appropriate models and the inclusion of projection specific neurons.</p><p>2) There are a few details that should be included in the manuscript. One easy and important addition is the inclusion of the resting conductance of the neurons. Those results are surely available. The reason for this request is based on the figures illustrating the differences in I-h. The conductance of the cells illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are very different. Likewise there is a huge difference in the conductance of the cells illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. These may just be bad examples but having a table of the conductance’s would be very helpful.</p><p>3)The capacitance of the dopamine cells (50 pS) is about twice that which is often reported. How was the capacitance of the cells measured? What were the setting for the acquisition and filtering frequencies?</p><p>4) The Results section measuring the sag of membrane potential are really not necessary and should be removed.</p><p>5) There is a considerable amount of discussion in the results that is repeated in the discussion. The Results section could be edited to remove most of that and the manuscript would be more readable.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this study Zhong and colleagues examine the biophysical mechanisms underlying CMS-induced depressive phenotype in mice. This is a potentially important study. Hence, it provides the first clear demonstration of a critical role of HCN2 in dynamically shaping NAc-projecting VTA DA AP firing activity in CMS mouse model by combining in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiology, and virus-mediated knockdown/overexpression of HCN2 in the lateral VTA. The manuscript is well-organized, clearly and thoroughly written, and the level of technical detail is appropriate.</p><p>I have a couple of concerns and suggestions listed below.</p><p>First, based on their findings the authors suggest that a reduced excitatory tone might contribute to the decreased DA AP firing in vivo. However, a reduction in both frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs together with a decreased AMPA/NMDA ratio is not as convincing as they state, since it is suggestive of other postsynaptic mechanisms to be involved rather than HCN2 solely. A paired pulse protocol and a measure of CV might add potential insights for the identification of this mouse phenotype.</p><p>Second, since the Authors found a reduced population activity they should cite the article by Moreines et al., (2017) where the same effect is observed in a CMS model but only in a subpopulation of VTA DA cells. Additionally, because of the &quot;laterality&quot; issue raised by Moreines et al. they should also discuss the location of their recorded DA cells (both ex vivo and in vivo). Finally, they could add a figure (or a table/panel) with their recording sites. This will add critical value to the study especially in light of the heterogeneity of VTA DA cells. Specie-specific effects might be also taken into account and discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32420.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In their current state, the experiments studying synaptic parameters (i.e. minis, AMPA/NMDA ratio…) are: (1) per se not sufficient to provide mechanistic insights (2) rather confusing (see reviewers' comments) (3) not sufficiently discussed.

Given that HCN current is the focus of our present study, our in vivo and ex vivo recordings targeted the lateral parabrachial pigmented area (PBP) of the VTA, where dopamine neurons exhibit large HCN currents, predominantly project to the lateral shell of the NAc and play a primary role in reward and motivated behavior. Our ex vivo recordings were made from NAc lateral shell-projecting DA neurons labelled with retrobeads, which were predominantly located in the lateral PBP of the VTA, consistent with Lammel et al., (2008, 2011). We also made efforts to target DA neurons in the lateral PBP in our in vivo recordings. The coordinates used for in vivo recordings (AP -2.9 to -3.3 mm, ML 0.6 to 1.1 mm, DV -3.9 to -4.5 mm) correspond to the PBP (mainly lateral PBP) but not in midline nuclei such as the interfascicular nucleus and the rostral linear nucleus, nor A10 DA neurons in the supramammillary nucleus. The location of some neurons was confirmed by juxtacellular labeling with neurobiotin and TH staining, with one neuron labeled in each mouse. To clarify the location of recorded DA neurons, we have revised the manuscript to more explicitly state that recordings were targeted to the lateral PBP.</p><p>Additionally, we provide a clearer rationale for targeting the lateral PBP and NAc lateral shell-projecting DA neurons, and better discuss our results in the context of VTA DA neuron heterogeneity. We specifically addressed the “laterality” issue raised in the Moreines et al. study. We suspect that differences in CMS paradigms and animal species might explain why Moreines et al. did not observe alterations in lateral VTA dopamine neuron firing. In addition, we have further discussed our results in the context of Friedman et al., 2014. In particular, we discuss effects on I<sub>h</sub> current in DA neurons that project to different targets, and discuss the circuit-specific effects on HCN overexpression on depressive-like behavior. Further, we make clear the limitations of our viral knockdown and overexpression approaches, and discuss opportunities for future investigation into cell- and circuit-specific contributions of HCN2 channels in depressive- and anxiety-like behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The revised version must include the following technical details:</p><p>-The resting conductance of the neurons must be provided in a table. The conductance of the cells illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> are very different.</p></disp-quote><p>We analyzed the instantaneous current (I<sub>ins</sub>) in traces of I<sub>h</sub> current in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, and plotted this current against the hyperpolarizing voltage steps. The slope of these I-V curves provides an approximation of the resting membrane conductance (G<sub>resting</sub>) (the measurement of G<sub>resting</sub> has been shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We find that there was not a significant effect of CMS on resting membrane conductance compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). However, HCN2 knockdown with shRNA reduced resting membrane conductance compared to scramble-shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). We have replaced traces for I<sub>h</sub> current in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> that better represent the averaged data. We have described the design and interpretation of the resting membrane conductance in the Materials and methods, Results and Discussion sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-The capacitance of the dopamine cells (50 pS) is about twice that which is often reported. How was the capacitance of the cells measured? What were the setting for the acquisition and filtering frequencies?</p></disp-quote><p>VTA dopamine neurons have a relatively large cell body compared with many other cell types. We performed a literature search to determine what previous studies have measured for the capacitance of VTA dopamine neurons in mice. We find that the capacitance we recorded (control, ~51 pF; CMS, ~45 pF) is consistent with published studies (Chung et al., 2017, PMID: 28894175; Baimel et al., 2017, PMID: 28178514; Zhang et al., 2010, PMID: 20600174). Chung et al., (2017) reported the capacitance for VTA dopamine neurons to be ~50-60 pF. Baimel et al., (2017) reported differences in VTA dopamine neuron capacitance for different projection-defined dopamine neurons. Consistent with our result, the average capacitance for NAc lateral shell-projecting DA neurons was 57 pF. Although other populations had lower capacitances (24 pF for NAc medial shell-projecting; 38 pF for BLA-projecting), our recordings focused on NAc lateral shell-projecting neurons. In a third study, Zhang et al., (2010) report a capacitance of 79 pF for VTA DA neurons in the lateral VTA and 54 pF in the medial VTA. Thus, our result does not differ substantially from published studies. Membrane capacitance was measured by Clampex software using small amplitude hyperpolarizing and depolarizing steps ( ± 5 mV). As mentioned in the Materials and methods section, signals were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-In the figure legends, the statements of the number of n per group are not clear.
