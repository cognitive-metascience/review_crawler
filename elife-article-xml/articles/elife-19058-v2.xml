specific subtypes of retinal neurons. Sdks mediate cell-cell adhesion with homophilic specificity that underlies their neuronal targeting function. Here we report crystal structures of Sdk1 and Sdk2 ectodomain regions, revealing similar homodimers mediated by the four N-terminal immunoglobulin domains (Ig1–4), arranged in a horseshoe conformation. These Ig1–4 horseshoes interact in a novel back-to-back orientation in both homodimers through Ig1:Ig2, Ig1:Ig1 and Ig3:Ig4 interactions. Structure-guided mutagenesis results show that this canonical dimer is required for both Sdk-mediated cell aggregation (via <italic>trans</italic> interactions) and Sdk clustering in isolated cells (via <italic>cis</italic> interactions). Sdk1/Sdk2 recognition specificity is encoded across Ig1–4, with Ig1–2 conferring the majority of binding affinity and differential specificity. We suggest that competition between <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> interactions provides a novel mechanism to sharpen the specificity of cell-cell interactions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19058.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19058.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cell adhesion</kwd><kwd>crystal structure</kwd><kwd>homophilic specificity</kwd><kwd>neural patterning</kwd><kwd>synaptic targeting</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Xiangshu</given-names></name><name><surname>Katsamba</surname><given-names>Phinikoula S</given-names></name><name><surname>Ahlsén</surname><given-names>Göran</given-names></name><name><surname>Sergeeva</surname><given-names>Alina P</given-names></name><name><surname>Honig</surname><given-names>Barry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS029169</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanes</surname><given-names>Joshua R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY022073</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanes</surname><given-names>Joshua R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM062270</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shapiro</surname><given-names>Lawrence</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Crystal structures of synaptic recognition molecules Sidekick-1 and -2 reveal a single homodimer interaction mode responsible for both cell-cell recognition and cis-clustering, suggesting that competition between cis and trans interactions may be critical to specificity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the vertebrate retina, light-sensitive photoreceptors synapse on interneurons; these interneurons process the information and pass it to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which send it to the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Masland, 2012</xref>). Highly stereotyped patterns of connectivity between the ~70 types of interneurons and ~30 types of RGCs render the latter sensitive to specific visual features such as motion or edges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sanes and Masland, 2015</xref>). Synapses between these interneurons and RGCs form in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the retina, with arbors of each specific neuronal subtype confined to one, or a few, of the approximately 10 sublaminae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roska and Werblin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sanes and Zipursky, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Some aspects of this specific connectivity appear to be mediated by recognition molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF). Studies in chicks and mice have revealed that defined interneuron and RGC subtypes express one or more of 10 closely related IgSF members: Sdk1, Sdk2, Dscam, DscamL1, and Contactins 1–6 (CNTNs 1–6) in largely non-overlapping patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamagata et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yamagata and Sanes, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuerst et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shekhar et al., 2016</xref>). In chick, Sdk, Dscam and CNTN family proteins are present as interneuron-RGC synapses form, and both knockdown and over-expression experiments show that they are necessary and sufficient for directing neural processes to particular sublaminae in the IPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamagata et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yamagata and Sanes, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">2012a</xref>). In mice, Sdk1, Sdk2, Dscam, DscamL1 and CNTN5 mutants each exhibit specific defects in arborization and connectivity within the IPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuerst et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krishnaswamy et al., 2015</xref>; Peng et al., unpublished). In one case, the specific connectivity of an interneuron type (vesicular glutamate transporter 3-positive amacrine cells or VG3-ACs) to a specific RGC type (W3B-RGCs) depends upon expression of Sdk2 in both cell types: transmission from VG3-ACs to W3B-RGCs fails in Sdk2 mutants and the RGCs no longer respond to their canonical visual feature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krishnaswamy et al., 2015</xref>). These results have led to the hypothesis that IgSF-mediated homophilic interactions bias synaptic connectivity in favor of appropriate partners, thus generating information processing circuits in the retina. Since all 10 of these IgSF molecules are also expressed by neuronal subsets throughout the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yamakawa et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agarwala et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shimoda and Watanabe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stoeckli, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yamagata and Sanes, 2012a</xref>), similar interactions may mediate connectivity in multiple brain regions.</p><p>Sdk1 has also been shown to be involved in the pathology of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and HIV-associated neuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaufman et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2010</xref>). Inappropriate up-regulation of Sdk1 expression by podocytes has been linked to their dedifferentiation and loss of proper foot-process architecture, leading to collapsed glomeruli and neuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaufman et al., 2007</xref>). Sdk1 is normally expressed at high levels during kidney development, with very low expression afterwards. Sdk1-associated kidney pathologies are thought to reflect a reversion of podocytes to the early developmental state, caused by inappropriate Sdk1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaufman et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2010</xref>).</p><p>Sdk1 and Sdk2 are single-pass transmembrane proteins, with extracellular regions composed of 6 N-terminal immunoglobulin (Ig) domains followed by 13 fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains, and a relatively short intracellular domain terminating in a Postsynaptic density/Discs Large/ZO-1 (PDZ) binding motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nguyen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamagata et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yamagata and Sanes, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaufman et al., 2010</xref>).

These four domains adopt a horseshoe conformation, like many other IgSF cell-cell recognition proteins, but they interact in a unique back-to-back anti-parallel manner not previously observed. Mutagenesis studies both in vitro, with analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) readouts, and in situ with a cell aggregation assay readout, demonstrate that the crystallographic dimer is present in solution and is required for Sdk-mediated cell aggregation. Interestingly, this same dimer is also required for <italic>cis</italic>-clustering of Sdk-molecules in isolated cells. Structures of multiple crystal forms of Sdk1 and Sdk2 revealed an unexpected flexibility in the dimer arrangement: The antiparallel contacts between Ig1–2 regions from each protomer were maintained in all structures, however the degree of contact between the Ig3–4 regions was highly variable. Consistent with this observation, mutagenesis studies showed that the Ig1–2:Ig1–2 interaction was necessary for dimerization, whereas mutations that interfered with the Ig3–4:Ig3–4 interaction had only a modest effect on dimer affinity. Overall, our data suggest a model in which Sdks form <italic>cis</italic> dimers on isolated cell surfaces, which dissociate to form <italic>trans</italic> dimers through the same interface when contact is made to a cell surface expressing the cognate Sdk. Competition between these <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> dimers may provide a mechanism to enhance the homophilic specificity of Sdk-mediated interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The adhesive Sidekick dimer is mediated by Ig1–4</title><p>Consistent with their role in defining neuronal contacts, both Sdk1 and Sdk2 mediate homophilic adhesion when applied to beads or transfected into cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamagata et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yamagata and Sanes, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). A chimeric construct (SdkD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) comprising Ig1–5 and part of Ig6 from Sdk2 and the remainder of the molecule from Sdk1 could mediate adhesion to Sdk2 but not Sdk1 in a mixed cell aggregation assay, using either L cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>) or N-cadherin deficient HEK-293 cells (data not shown), indicating that it is the Ig domain region that mediates cell-cell recognition in common with other IgSF proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gouveia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haspel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wojtowicz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sawaya et al., 2008</xref>). We also asked whether the cytoplasmic domain is required for cell-cell adhesion. To this end, we replaced the cytoplasmic domains of Sdk1 and Sdk2 with fluorescent proteins. Adhesion was unperturbed by this replacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus Sdk-mediated cell-cell adhesion requires the extracellular but not the intracellular domains of the proteins, with key determinants of homophilic specificity in Ig1–6.</p><p>To further define and measure the adhesive interaction for mouse Sdk1 and Sdk2, we produced soluble Ig1–4, Ig1–5 and Ig1–6 constructs in HEK-293 cells. Sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) measurements showed that Sdk1 and Sdk2 Ig1–4, Ig1–5, and Ig1–6 were each dimers in solution with low-micromolar affinities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) with the Sdk2 dimer exhibiting ~5-fold stronger affinity than the Sdk1 dimer for each truncation construct tested. These affinities are similar to other cell-cell recognition proteins, such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dscam1 isoforms (1–2 µM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2012</xref>) and classical cadherins (8–130 µM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vendome et al., 2014</xref>). Ig1–4 is therefore sufficient for dimerization in solution for both Sdks. We further note that the Ig1–6 constructs for both Sdk1 and Sdk2 gave 4–5-fold stronger dimerization affinities than the Ig1–4 constructs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), However, the addition or deletion of domains that do not participate in the interface frequently lead to small changes in binding energy, and this does not always reflect the presence of additional interactions. For example, we previously observed human VE-cadherin EC1–5 to have ~4-fold stronger dimerization affinity than the EC1–2 fragment (1.03 vs. 4.38 µM), even though the entire dimerization interface is contained within EC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brasch et al., 2011</xref>). The effect of additional domains on the binding affinities may be due in part to entropic differences in the unbound state whereby crowding effects may affect the conformational freedom for the longer constructs.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19058.003</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation of Sdk fragments.

Two non-overlapping interfaces hold the horseshoe together: a conserved and relatively rigid Ig1:Ig4 interface and a more flexible and varied Ig2:Ig3 interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). These intramolecular interactions bury extensive combined intramolecular surface areas of 2620 Å<sup>2</sup> in Sdk1, 2459 Å<sup>2</sup> in Sdk2 and 2567 Å<sup>2</sup> in the Sdk2<sub>Ig1–2</sub>/Sdk1<sub>Ig3–4</sub> chimera, implying that the horseshoe should be a stable element in all of these molecules. In this conformation, Ig1 and Ig2 are arranged in tandem with a ~40° bend between them; Ig3 and Ig4 are also arranged in tandem with a ~30° inter-domain bend (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). Horseshoe conformations are also found for the N-terminal four Ig domains of a number of other IgSF molecules including all members of the deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC), CNTN, L1, Dscam, cell adhesion associated oncogene regulated (CDON), MAM domain–containing glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors (MDGA), and activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>).

Comparison between each of these structures and Sdk reveals the horseshoe conformation is similar overall (RMSDs from 2.8 to 6.2 Å; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>) despite sequence identities with Sdk1 of only 20–26%.</p><p>The internal Ig1:Ig4 interface in both Sdk1 and Sdk2 includes conserved ‘horseshoe motif’ hydrogen bonds, identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al. (2013)</xref> from their analysis of a number of horseshoe proteins. These occur between the side chains of Ig4 residues D325 (from Ig4 C strand WXXN/D motif) and Q359 (from Ig4 F strand ΦY/F/LQC motif) and the main chain of Ig1 residues A79 and L81 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Despite the presence of these motifs and the requisite long Ig2–Ig3 linker, Chen et al., who surveyed the presence of IgSF horseshoe motifs through sequence analysis, did not identify Sdks as horseshoe motif-containing molecules. This is because Sdks’ lack an internal disulfide in Ig2, which Chen et al. used to define the Ig2–Ig3 linker length in their bioinformatics search. The internal Ig2:Ig3 interface appears to lack conserved features amongst IgSF horseshoe proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). In Sdk1 and Sdk2 the Ig2:Ig3 interaction is mediated by the main chain to side chain hydrogen bonds between Sdk-conserved residues (S137<sub>Ig2</sub>:R247<sub>Ig3</sub>, I142<sub>Ig2</sub>:R248<sub>Ig3</sub>, and L144<sub>Ig2</sub>:E216<sub>Ig3</sub>), alongside van-der-Waals interactions among hydrophobic residues (L144<sub>Ig2</sub>, V149<sub>Ig2</sub>, L151<sub>Ig2</sub>, V/I198<sub>Ig3</sub>, V/I199<sub>Ig3</sub>, and V218<sub>Ig3</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Remarkably, the Sdk2<sub>Ig1–2</sub>/Sdk1<sub>Ig3–4</sub> chimera structure features the same set of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions that mediate both Ig1:Ig4 and Ig2:Ig3 interfaces.</p><p>The Sdk1<sub>Ig1–5</sub> structure showed that Ig5 extends laterally from the horseshoe with a 54° deviation from linearity with Ig4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This angle is maintained in both independent Ig1–5 chains observed in the crystal structure. The linker between Ig4 and Ig5 is only one amino acid (N379) and there is a small Ig4:Ig5 interface with a buried surface area (BSA) over both domains of ~370 Å<sup>2</sup>. This interface—involving the linker region, the Ig4 AB loop and the Ig5 BC loop—likely provides rigidity to the Ig4–Ig5 junction. In Sdk2 the Ig4–Ig5 linker is the same length as in Sdk1, although the linker residue is serine rather than asparagine, and the Ig4:Ig5 interfacial residues are mostly conserved between Sdk1 and Sdk2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), except key Ig4 AB loop residue 302 which is a methionine in Sdk2 rather than a valine. The arrangement of Ig4 and Ig5 in Sdk2 is therefore likely to be similar to that observed in Sdk1. However the surface of the Ig4–Ig5 linker region in Sdk1 is highly acidic, whilst that of Sdk2 is comparably neutral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We were unable to obtain crystals of an Sdk1 or Sdk2 construct containing Ig6 that diffracted to sufficient resolution for structure determination. The Ig5–Ig6 linker is ~2–4 amino acids long for both Sdk1 and Sdk2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), which could potentially accommodate a range of Ig5–Ig6 bend angles. The positioning of Ig6 is therefore unknown, however, since Ig5 projects away from the dimer interface it is unlikely Ig6 would be able to contribute to the dimer observed in the crystal structures, which is described in detail below.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The Sidekick dimer is mediated by a flexible back-to-back interaction between horseshoes</title><p>Consistent with the AUC results of the wild-type Sdk1 and Sdk2, the crystal structures show a dimeric arrangement of molecules, consisting of symmetrical back-to-back interactions (convex-face to convex-face) between the Ig1–4 horseshoe regions of the individual protomers, with Ig5 making no contacts in the Sdk1<sub>Ig1–5</sub> dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

This results in differing levels of interaction between the Ig3–4 regions in the Sdk1 and Sdk2 dimers in the different crystal forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The Ig3–4:Ig3–4 interaction varies from the Ig3–4 domains forming a considerable additional interface—as in Sdk1<sub>Ig1–4</sub> crystal form 2 (915 Å<sup>2</sup> BSA) and Sdk2<sub>Ig1–4</sub> crystal form 1 (1294 Å<sup>2</sup> BSA)—to being splayed 14 Å apart, as in the Sdk1<sub>Ig1–4</sub> crystal form 1 structure (0 Å<sup>2</sup> BSA). These differences indicate that there is flexibility in the interaction between the horseshoes in solution, with different conformations being trapped in the crystals. These observations raise questions about how much the Ig3–4:Ig3–4 interfaces contribute to dimer stability and whether in cells this flexibility allows the accommodation of an as yet unidentified molecule in the Ig3–4:Ig3–4 clefts.</p><p>Analysis of the Ig3–4:Ig3–4 interface regions in the Sdk1<sub>Ig1–4</sub> crystal form 2 and Sdk2<sub>Ig1–4</sub> crystal form 1 structures, which show the most extensive Ig3–4:Ig3–4 contacts, reveals predominantly hydrophilic surfaces with hydrogen bonds between N253<sub>Ig3</sub> and P287<sub>Ig4</sub> in both structures, S240 <sub>Ig3</sub> and T291<sub>Ig4</sub> in Sdk1, and T255<sub>Ig3</sub> and E286<sub>Ig4</sub> in Sdk2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A and B</xref>).

However, there are three Ig3–4:Ig3–4 interfacial residues that show non-conservative differences between Sdk1 and Sdk2 that are mostly conserved amongst vertebrate orthologs (H/S243<sub>Ig3</sub>, Y/Q289<sub>Ig4</sub> and S/R296<sub>Ig4</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These differences result in the Sdk2 interface containing a π-stacking interaction between Y245<sub>Ig3</sub> and R296<sub>Ig4</sub>, which is absent from Sdk1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A and B</xref>). Similarly, the Sdk1 interface contains an H243<sub>Ig3</sub>:E293<sub>Ig4</sub> interaction, which is absent from Sdk2, although the contribution of this interaction is likely small since the side chains are still 4.4 Å apart in the Sdk1 crystal structure with the most extensive Ig3–4:Ig3–4 interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>In addition to these major interfacial regions, the Sdk1<sub>Ig1–4</sub> crystal form 2 also shows a small contact region between Ig1 residues E11 and R83 and Ig3 residue E212 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) towards the center of the horseshoe dimer.

Mutating residues in the central Ig1:Ig1 interface (N22R in Sdk1 and N22R, N22S and H18R/N22S in Sdk2) resulted in the loss of dimerization for both Sdk1 and Sdk2 in AUC experiments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

The crystal structure of this chimera did not show an interaction between Ig3–4 regions in the dimer, although given the variability observed in the conformations of the dimers in the different Sdk1 and Sdk2 crystal structures, the Ig3–4 regions may interact in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B and 3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The Ig1–4 dimer is required for Sdk1-mediated cell adhesion</title><p>To determine whether the crystallographic dimer is the adhesive Sdk dimer, we tested the N22R mutation in the context of full length Sdk1 to see whether it would prevent Sdk-mediated cell adhesion in a cell aggregation assay.

The Ig1–2 interface mutants (Sdk1 N22R and Sdk2 H18R/N22S) showed a loss of both homophilic and heterophilic binding revealing that the heterophilic interaction observed here is mediated by the same interface as the homophilic interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Consistent with the AUC results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), the Ig3–4 interface mutants (Sdk1 N253E and Sdk2 N253E) showed slightly reduced binding relative to the wild-type homophilic binding. However, these mutations had no impact on heterophilic binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>To further define the basis of Sdk specificity, we generated a series of chimeric constructs converting Sdk1 to Sdk2 one Ig domain at a time in the Ig1–6 context for biophysical analysis and the full length context for cell aggregation assays. However, we were unable to produce these Ig1–6 chimeras at high enough solubility for accurate biophysical analysis, suggesting that the chimeras may not have fully native conformations. As noted above, a Sdk2<sub>Ig1–2</sub>/Sdk1<sub>Ig3–4</sub> chimera was well behaved and formed a strong dimer in solution with comparable affinity to Sdk1<sub>Ig1–4</sub> and Sdk2<sub>Ig1–4</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Sdk2<sub>Ig1–2</sub>/Sdk1<sub>Ig3–4</sub> behaved more like Sdk2 than Sdk1 in the SPR assay: It bound to the Sdk1<sub>Ig1–6</sub> surface similarly to Sdk2<sub>Ig1–4</sub>, and more tightly to the Sdk2<sub>Ig1–6</sub> surface than Sdk1<sub>Ig1–4</sub> although not to the same level as Sdk2<sub>Ig1–4</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These results suggest that the majority of the Sdk1/Sdk2 specificity is localized to Ig1–2, but that Ig3–4 may also contribute to specificity. However, given the poor behavior of the other Sdk chimeras we made, we cannot rule out the possibility that the small differences in behavior between the Sdk2<sub>Ig1–2</sub>/Sdk1<sub>Ig3–4</sub> chimera and Sdk2<sub>Ig1–4</sub> are due to slight imperfections in the chimeric molecule.</p><p>Analysis of the crystal structures revealed that there are two Ig1–2:Ig1–2 interfacial residues that interact with one another and show conserved differences between Sdk1 and Sdk2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These residues—29<sub>Ig1</sub> and 168<sub>Ig2</sub>—therefore seem good candidates for being involved in specificity. In Sdk1, L29 interacts with the aliphatic portion of the E168 side chain, with the charged carboxylate group extending away from the hydrophobic leucine. In Sdk2 the M29 side chain interacts with D168, again with the carboxylate extending away (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Although these are not normally favorable residue pairs, in both cases the interactions are primarily between carbon atoms so there may be some hydrophobic contribution to affinity from this interaction. Mutation of these residues showed that the Sdk2 M29/D168 interaction is more favorable (or possibly less unfavorable) than the Sdk1 L29/E168 interaction, since the Sdk1<sub>Ig1–4</sub> L29M/E168D double mutant has a greater dimerization affinity than wild-type Sdk1<sub>Ig1–4</sub> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Similar to wild-type, the double mutant also mediates cell-cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>Not only did the Sdk1<sub>Ig1–4</sub> L29M/E168D mutant shift the homodimerization affinity of Sdk1 towards that of Sdk2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), it also modified the specificity of Sdk1 to more closely mimic that of Sdk2. Specifically, this mutant showed weaker binding to the Sdk1<sub>Ig1–6</sub> surface relative to wild-type Sdk1<sub>Ig1–4</sub> and stronger binding to the Sdk2<sub>Ig1–6</sub> surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). However the Sdk1<sub>Ig1–4</sub> L29M/E168D mutant did not bind to the Sdk2<sub>Ig1–6</sub> surface as strongly as the Sdk2<sub>Ig1–2</sub>/Sdk1<sub>Ig3–4</sub> chimera or wild type Sdk2 <sub>Ig1–4</sub>, indicating that additional Ig1–2 residues also contribute to the observed specificity, alongside the putative Ig3–4 contribution. As already noted above, there are three additional Ig1–2 interfacial residues that show conserved differences between Sdk1 and Sdk2 (I/V17, K/R55, I/P135), which may contribute to specificity. Moreover, non-interfacial residues and interdomain flexibility have also been shown to play a role in determining specificity between related molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vendome et al., 2014</xref>). Although we have shown here that residues at positions 29 and 168 contribute to the differences between Sdk1 and Sdk2, there are clearly many other factors that can contribute. Teasing out individual contributions as we did for N- and E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vendome et al., 2014</xref>) will require additional work.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The cell adhesion molecules Sdk1 and Sdk2, like Dscams and CNTNs, provide molecular cues that determine the specificity of particular synaptic connections in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yamagata and Sanes, 2008</xref>). Here, we have presented multiple crystal structures of the Sdk1 and Sdk2 Ig-domain mediated homodimers that are required for Sdk-mediated cell-cell adhesion. The dimers are formed by interaction between the Ig1–4 horseshoe regions of the Sdks. The dimers are primarily mediated by anti-parallel interactions between the Ig1–2 portions of the horseshoes, and mutagenesis studies demonstrated that this interaction was necessary for Sdk dimerization in solution and Sdk-mediated cell-cell adhesion. The Ig3–4 halves of the horseshoes, which interact in an anti-parallel manner in some but not all of the Sdk1 and Sdk2 crystal structures, only contribute a small amount to the binding energy.

(2005)</xref> sought to demonstrate the involvement of this beta strand by deletion of these residues, which would dramatically affect the fold of Ig2, explaining the loss of cell-cell adhesion they observed in cell expressing this mutant.</p><p>The horseshoe-motif mediated Sdk dimers presented here are very different from the horseshoe-motif mediated homodimers of Dscam1, neurofascin, and CNTN, for which there are published crystal structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The human neurofascin and human CNTN2 horseshoe-motif dimers are both primarily mediated by anti-parallel interactions between the Ig2 G strands, with limited involvement from Ig1 and none from Ig3 and Ig4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mörtl et al., 2007</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dscam1 dimer is mediated by horseshoe-motif domains Ig2 and Ig3, alongside Ig7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wojtowicz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sawaya et al., 2008</xref>). The horseshoe portion of this interaction involves Ig2:Ig2 and Ig3:Ig3 interactions, and is not sufficient for dimerization alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meijers et al., 2007</xref>), with the Ig7:Ig7 interaction also required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wojtowicz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sawaya et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, different IgSF members utilize different horseshoe-motif surfaces to mediate homophilic interactions, highlighting the versatility of the motif. Heterophilic interactions have also been reported for horseshoe-motif proteins, including binding of CNTNs 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 to receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase gamma (PTPγ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouyain and Watkins, 2010</xref>). The crystal structure of CNTN4 with the carbonic anhydrase-like domain from PTPγ shows that horseshoe domains Ig2 and Ig3 mediate this interaction, utilizing the same face for interaction as the Dscam1 homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouyain and Watkins, 2010</xref>). To date no heterophilic interactions have been reported for the Ig domain regions of Sdk, however the opening of the Ig3–4 regions in the Sdk dimers could in principle accommodate interaction with another molecule, or potentially the FNIII portion of the Sdk extracellular region. Indeed, the flexibility of the Sdk dimer interaction that we have observed in our Sdk1 and Sdk2 crystal structures is surprising and could be explained by the need to accommodate an additional interaction.</p><p>As discussed above, studies in cells reveal that Sdk1 forms large <italic>cis</italic> clusters independent of contacts with other cells. Disrupting Sdk1 Ig1–4-mediated dimerization by mutation of a key interfacial residue (N22R) resulted in a loss of this Sdk clustering in isolated cells. Instead the Sdk1 N22R mutant showed a more diffuse expression across the whole cell surface, with only small clusters evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). This indicates that the Sdk1 Ig1–4-mediated dimer is required for Sdk clustering in large aggregates. For some cell surface molecules such as classical cadherins, binding <italic>in cis</italic> through the cell-cell recognition interface is geometrically unfavorable due to the rigidity of the interacting molecules. However, since in Sdks there are 13 FNIII domains and two additional Ig domains separating the horseshoe ‘dimerization’ region from the membrane, the molecules are sufficiently flexible such that there should be no geometric constraints preventing the formation of a <italic>cis</italic> dimer. The observed Ig1–4-dimer-dependent <italic>cis</italic>-clusters are clearly larger assemblies than dimers. Moreover, Sdks still cluster after replacing their native cytoplasmic domain with YFP or RFP, demonstrating that intracellular sequences are dispensable. Therefore, additional interactions involving the FNIII, or Ig domain regions are also likely to contribute to their formation. In addition the presence of small aggregates in the N22R mutant cells could indicate that such additional <italic>cis</italic> interactions may form independent of the horseshoe-mediated dimer. However, the nature of these interactions has not yet been identified.</p><p>When we mixed Sdk1 and Sdk2 expressing cells in our cell assays, we observed few mixed aggregates. In contrast, in solution Sdk Ig1–4 proteins dimerize both homophilically and heterophilically although the homophilic interactions are significantly stronger. We suggest three possible explanations for this apparent discrepancy. First, cell aggregation depends on the affinities of adhesion molecules; so strong homophilic interactions will lead to the formation of separate aggregates even when weaker heterophilic interactions can also occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Katsamba et al., 2009</xref>). Second, we cannot exclude the possibility that determinants proximal to Ig1–4 enhance homophilic or attenuate heterophilic interactions. Third, and most interesting, competition between <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> interactions could sharpen specificity. The Sdk Ig1–4-mediated dimer is required for both Sdk <italic>cis</italic>-clustering in isolated cells and Sdk-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Since both interactions are mediated by the same interface, <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> dimers are likely to be mutually exclusive. Thus, <italic>cis</italic>-dimers formed between Sdks on the same cell surface would need to dissociate in order for Sdk dimers to form <italic>in trans</italic> between molecules on adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Since homophilic interactions are stronger than heterophilic interactions, heterophilic <italic>trans</italic> interactions would not be able to outcompete homophilic <italic>cis</italic> interactions, ensuring that no adhesion will be observed between cells containing different Sdks. An analogous logic is used to enhance binding specificity in classical cadherins which dimerize through a strand swapping mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vendome et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vendome et al., 2014</xref>)<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19058.018</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Sdk specificity could be accentuated by competition between <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> interactions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of two neighboring cells expressing Sdk1 showing the competition between homophilic Ig1–4-mediated dimer interactions <italic>in cis</italic> and <italic>in trans</italic>.

Briefly, after incubating live cells with MS1-7, the paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were treated with 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/PBS for 30 min at room temperature, blocked with 5% (w/v) skimmed milk (BioRad)/PBS for 30 min, incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:1000 dilution in 0.5% BSA/PBS) for 2 hr, rinsed with PBS, and developed with o-phenylenediamine/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Cell aggregation assay</title><p>Confluent stably-transfected L cells or transiently-transfected 293T cells were trypsinized in the presence of 1 mM EDTA at 37°C as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yamagata and Sanes, 2008</xref>). In some experiments, cells were labeled with green or red Cell Trackers (Invitrogen). The reaction was stopped by adding the same volume of 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (T6522, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and 10 µg/ml deoxyribonuclease I (DN25, Sigma) in HBSS supplemented with 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. All the cell aggregation assays were carried out in 24-well non-tissue culture plasticwares that had been precoated with 0.5% BSA/HBSS. In each well, dissociated cells were mixed with 1 ml of HBSS containing 0.5% (w/v) BSA, 1 µg/ml deoxyribonuclease I, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and rotated at room temperature for 30–60 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde/PBS, and observed under fluorescent microscopes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Accession numbers</title><p>The atomic coordinates and structure factors for the reported crystal structures are deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession codes PDB: 5K6U, 5K6V, 5K6W, 5K6X, 5K6Y, 5K6Z, and 5K70.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank John Schwanof and Randy Abramowitz at Brookhaven National Lab XSLS X4A/C beamlines and Igor Kourinov, Surajit Banerjee, and Narayanasami Sukumar at NE-CAT Advanced Photon Source 24-ID-C/E beamlines, Argonne National Laboratory (NIH grant P41 GM103403) for their support with synchrotron data collection.

Previous studies have shown that Sdk1 and Sdk2 exhibit preferential homophilic binding. That is, heterophilic binding occurs but homophilic binding is stronger. The role of these two paralogs has been characterized best in the context of layer-specific connections in the chick and mouse inner plexiform layer of the retina. Here Sdk1 and Sdk2 act with other Ig superfamily proteins, Dscam and DscamL1, and various contactins to regulate layer-specific connectivity. In this paper, Goodman et al. describe the molecular basis of Sdk-mediated cell adhesion. The paper includes several crystal structures, biophysical studies using analytical ultracentrifugation and Biocore to assess binding quantitatively and cell adhesion experiments to explore the interaction of the proteins in the context of living cells.</p><p>The ectodomains of Sdk1 and Sdk2 comprise, from the N-terminus, 6 Ig domains and 13 FNIII repeats. Several crystal structures were determined for N-terminal fragments including Ig1-4 from Sdk1 and Sdk2, Ig1-5 for Sdk2, and a chimera which includes the Ig1,2 from Sdk1 and Ig3,4 from Sdk2. All formed horseshoe-like structures with Ig1 and 2 aligned in a linear fashion followed by a short loop between Ig2 and Ig3, as the ectodomains flip back with alignment of Ig3 and Ig4 in parallel with Ig1 and Ig2. Contacts between Ig1 and Ig4 and between Ig2 and Ig3 stabilize the horseshoe. Remarkably, although other Ig superfamily homophilic adhesion molecules also form this characteristic horseshoe structure, the contacts between monomers underlying dimer formation are very different re-emphasizing how uncanny this three-dimensional structure is in generating different recognition strategies. A set of binding studies on mutant proteins provides strong support for the biological significance of the crystal structures. All of the experiments are well designed and executed to yield clear answers to a series of logically constructed questions. The combined data allow the authors to propose an insightful model for the mechanism of action of Sdk1 and Sdk2 which will be of substantial interest to neurobiologists and structural biologists alike. The hypothesis that the strength of the homophilic cis interactions serves to deter heterophilic, and hence favour homophilic, trans interactions is salient. In sum, the work is a strong candidate for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Both for Sdk1 and Sdk2, the homo-dimer affinity of Ig1-6 is about 5 times stronger than Ig1-4. However, the data presented in the manuscript argue against any roles of Ig5-6 in both molecules. The 5-fold affinity difference is likely to be significant. The authors need to address/discuss this point in their revision.</p><p>2) The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> address the origin of the specificity of homophilic vs. heterophilic interactions. The data is good. However, the interpretation can be argued. The authors argue that the L29/E168 interaction is favored in Sdk1 and the M29/D168 interaction is favored in Sdk2. It seems that both pairs of the interactions are not that favorable. It is just that the swapped heterophilic interactions are more unfavorable. While the final outcome is more or less the same, but the interpretation may be confusing to readers from outside the structural biology field.</p><p>3) Related to the point above, the authors present evidence that two amino acids play a role in regulating the specific of Sdk1 and Sdk2 preferential homophilic binding. I think these studies could be further explored. As there are only 5 interfacial residues different at the Ig1-2 interface, it would be interesting to assess whether changing all would lead to clean swap in specificity. It will be preferred if the authors have additional data on this. If not, the authors may want to discuss this point. Another possibility is to adjust the text in the sections dealing with homophilic vs. heterophilic interactions by covering alternative interpretations/possible weaknesses for the data available.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: Although it is clear that the clustering of WT Sdk1 and N22R Sdk1 have difference, but the difference is not as great as the authors have stated. There are clear clustering puncta for the mutant (in the cell peripheries in particular). The authors perhaps should use line-scanning to quantify the distribution differences. Also for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, the figure looks convincing, whether the authors have a way of comparing cell surface expression levels for wt and mutant. It could be argued that very different expression levels could lead to differing outcomes? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, the authors should clarify whether the puncta are surface features, some comment on this could be reassuring? Finally, the figure legend does not seem to match the figure presented. The panel also missing a scale bar.</p><p>5) The authors use clustering of Sdks on isolated cells as a read out for cis dimer formation. The clusters, of course, are much larger aggregates and as such the dimers are necessary to form higher order structures. What parts of the molecule promote this interaction? For instance, Sdks may well form cis dimers independent of the horseshoe structure and oligomerization may then occur through interactions between horseshoes. Alternatively, cis interactions between the horseshoes may induce structural alterations which then allow for cis interactions between dimers through different domains. Some discussions on this point would add value to the paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19058.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Both for Sdk1 and Sdk2, the homo-dimer affinity of Ig1-6 is about 5 times stronger than Ig1-4.

There is precedent for the effects on binding affinity of domains that do not interact directly. Specifically, we cite the example of human VE-cadherin, in which EC1–5 has a ~4-fold greater dimerization affinity than EC1–2 (1.03 vs. 4.38 µM), even though the entire dimerization interface is contained within EC1 (Brasch et al., 2011 doi:10.1016/j.jmb.2011.01.031). We speculate that the effect may be due to entropic loss in the unbound state due to greater non-specific steric interactions. This in turn would drive the dimerization equilibrium towards the bound state.</p><p><italic>2) The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> address the origin of the specificity of homophilic vs. heterophilic interactions.

Although further mutagenesis might be illuminating, it would require several months for a complete analysis. This is because we know from our previous work that teasing out individual contributions to affinity can be quite challenging. We have now discussed alternative possibilities and provided a more precise description of the role of the two amino acids in question.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: Although it is clear that the clustering of WT Sdk1 and N22R Sdk1 have difference, but the difference is not as great as the authors have stated.

The panel also missing a scale bar.</italic> </p><p>We have conducted additional experiments to address these points, and have added a new supplementary figure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, to illustrate our results. Part A shows that wild type Sdk1 forms <italic>cis</italic>-clusters in isolated L-cells, independent of expression level, while the mutant only shows much smaller clusters. Part B presents line scans of immunofluorescence in these cells requested by the Reviewers, which show the distinct nature of wild-type and mutant localization patterns. Part C quantifies the difference in cluster size between wild-type and mutants. Part D shows cells immunostained live, confirming that the clusters are localized to the cell surface. Part E shows results of an ELISA-type assay performed on live-stained cells to demonstrate that similar levels of wild-type and mutant Sdk1 are present on the cell surface. Finally, Part F shows cells cotransfected with wild-type and mutant Sdk1, fused to YFP and RFP, respectively. These cells provide perhaps the most convincing evidence that the two proteins are differentially distributed within a single cell. (A small population occasionally colocalizes at the cell peripheries.) We have noted these new experiments in the main text.</p><p>We agree with the Reviewers that the mutant Sdk1 does sometimes aggregate at cell peripheries. We have no explanation, but speculate that the distinct cytoskeletal and adhesive structures present in these regions are responsible. We have therefore focused our attention on the central regions of cells, in which wild type Sdk1 forms clusters but mutant Sdk1 does not.</p><p>We also thank the Reviewers for noting the mistake in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, which we have now corrected.</p><p><italic>5) The authors use clustering of Sdks on isolated cells as a read out for cis dimer formation. The clusters, of course, are much larger aggregates and as such the dimers are necessary to form higher order structures. What parts of the molecule promote this interaction? For instance, Sdks may well form cis dimers independent of the horseshoe structure and oligomerization may then occur through interactions between horseshoes. Alternatively, cis interactions between the horseshoes may induce structural alterations which then allow for cis interactions between dimers through different domains. Some discussions on this point would add value to the paper.</italic> </p><p>The large cell surface <italic>cis</italic>-clusters we observe in isolated cells are dependent on the Sdk-horseshoe dimer observed crystallographically, since disruption of the dimer interface with the N22R mutation results in a loss of <italic>cis</italic>-clustering. Given that a single <italic>cis</italic>-dimer is small, this interaction alone would be insufficient to underlie the large <italic>cis</italic> clusters observed. Therefore, we have inferred the existence of other interaction(s). However, the localization of interacting regions remains unknown. Until more data is obtained, we would prefer not to speculate further on the nature of this putative interaction, and its possible roles in Sdk function.</p></body></sub-article></article>
