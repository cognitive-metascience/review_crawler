They are found in most organisms and even in cultured tissues and cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balsalobre et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yoo et al., 2004</xref>). In mammals, these clocks are organized in a network controlled by a master pacemaker in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dibner et al., 2010</xref>). Physiological processes such as energy metabolism, locomotion, hormone secretion, and cognitive functions are subject to circadian regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bass and Takahashi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerstner and Yin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Panda, 2016</xref>). The influence of circadian rhythmicity is highlighted by the fact that in each tissue ~10% of the transcriptome is under the control of the circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) and that disruption of circadian rhythms is tied to the development of various diseases including metabolic disorders and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bedrosian et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Musiek and Holtzman, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The molecular circadian oscillator consists of interlinked positive and negative feedback elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reppert and Weaver, 2002</xref>). Positive components are the heterodimers of CLOCK (circadian locomotor output cycles kaput) and BMAL1 (brain and muscle ARNT-like protein 1) that bind to <italic>E-box</italic> promoter elements of <italic>Per1-3</italic> (<italic>Period</italic>), <italic>Cry1/2</italic> (<italic>Cryptochome</italic>) and <italic>Rev-ErbAα/β</italic> (<italic>Nr1d1/2</italic>; nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, members 1 and 2) that encode repressor proteins PER, CRY and NR1D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Takahashi, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Genome-wide analysis of core circadian regulators revealed temporally restricted chromatin associations of circadian activators and repressors in the course of the circadian day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koike et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Menet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rey et al., 2011</xref>). It is proposed that at the onset of the circadian cycle repressor CRY1 is part of the chromatin-bound CLOCK-BMAL1-complex located near transcriptionally silent RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Upon degradation of CRY1, coactivators such as CBP/p300 are recruited followed by <italic>Per</italic> and <italic>Cry</italic> transcription. During the repression phase of the circadian cycle, newly synthesized CRY2 and PER proteins associate with CLOCK-BMAL1, thereby shutting down their own transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koike et al., 2012</xref>). Recruitment of CRY to the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer is facilitated by acetylation of BMAL1 at lysine 538 by the acetyltransferase activity attributed to CLOCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirayama et al., 2007</xref>). BMAL1 acetylation peaks during the repression phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirayama et al., 2007</xref>), although data by Nakakata and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakahata et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakahata et al., 2009</xref>) suggest that the presence of acetylated BMAL1 extends into the activation phase.</p><p>An important issue that the above feedback mechanisms leave unresolved concerns the binding of CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimers to <italic>E-box</italic> promoter elements that initiates Pol II-mediated transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koike et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stratmann et al., 2012</xref>). Well-recognized, rate-limiting steps that regulate transcription are the recruitment of Pol II to promoters and Pol II release from promoter-proximal pause sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jonkers and Lis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Pause release of Pol II and the transition to productive elongation requires the activity of the P-TEFb (positive transcription elongation factor b) complex, composed of T-type cyclins and CDK9 (cyclin-dependent kinase 9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jonkers and Lis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). P-TEFb is recruited to promoters through interaction with specific transcription factors and other proteins like BRD4 (bromodomain-containing protein 4) and SEC (super elongation complex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jonkers and Lis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Luo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shi and Vakoc, 2014</xref>). After such recruitment, P-TEFb phosphorylates the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II at Ser2 and additionally phosphorylates the pausing factors NELF (negative elongation factor) and DSIF (DRB sensitivity inducing factor). Upon phosphorylation, NELF is evicted from Pol II and DSIF becomes a positive elongation factor. Pol II pausing serves as a checkpoint allowing for rapid and synchronous expression of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boettiger and Levine, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilchrist et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lagha et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>BRD4 is a member of the bromo-domain and extra terminal domain (BET) protein family which bind through their bromo-domains to acetylated lysines of histones and of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shi and Vakoc, 2014</xref>). Bound BRD4 recruits P-TEFb to promoter proximal paused Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jonkers and Lis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Small molecule inhibitors that block BRD4 (e.g. JQ1) from binding to acetylated lysines prevent productive elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shi and Vakoc, 2014</xref>). Thus BRD4 protein is a key player in the regulation of productive transcription elongation. Therefore, acetyltransferases that acetylate BRD4 binding partners would play an important role in regulating Pol II pause release. The lysine acetyltransferase TIP60 (60 kDa Tat-interactive protein) is recruited to active promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ravens et al., 2015</xref>) and plays a role in early steps of transcription elongation in mammals and flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kusch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ravens et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shi et al., 2014</xref>). TIP60 is an essential protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Here we provide evidence that TIP60 is a critical component of the circadian clock. During the activation phase of the circadian cycle, TIP60 acetylates BMAL1, which triggers recruitment of the BRD4-P-TEFb complex to <italic>E-box</italic>-containing circadian promoters leading to Pol II pause release and productive elongation of circadian transcripts. These findings suggest that pause release is a critical regulatory step in the transcription of circadian clock regulated genes and that TIP60 plays a central role in this process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inhibition of CDK9 and BRD4 abolishes circadian oscillations</title><p>Synchronized fibroblasts stably expressing the clock-driven luciferase reporter <italic>Bmal1-LUC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nagoshi et al., 2004</xref>) show sustained reporter expression with a period of ~26 hr. In the presence of flavopiridol (FP), a potent inhibitor of the CDK9 subunit of P-TEFb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rahl et al., 2010</xref>), the amplitude of luciferase activity rhythms was suppressed in a dose dependent manner concomitant with an increased period length until, at high doses, the rhythm was fully lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Treatment of fibroblasts with FP also strongly reduced endogenous mRNA expression levels of <italic>Dbp</italic> (D-site albumin promoter binding protein), <italic>Per1</italic>, and <italic>Nr1d1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) that are direct CLOCK-BMAL1 targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stratmann et al., 2012</xref>). These findings suggest that circadian clock gene regulation not only occurs at the initiation of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Le Martelot et al., 2012</xref>) but also at the level of Pol II pause release and productive elongation. Triazolothienodiazepine (JQ1) is a potent and selective inhibitor of BRD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shi and Vakoc, 2014</xref>). JQ1 treatment of <italic>Bmal1-LUC</italic> reporter fibroblasts dampened luciferase activity rhythms in a dose-dependent manner and evoked a lengthening of the period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). JQ1 also resulted in a strong dampening of the rhythm of endogenous <italic>Dbp</italic> expression in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In the presence of JQ1, enrichment of BRD4 and CDK9 at the transcription start site (TSS) of <italic>Dbp</italic> was markedly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Ser2 phosphorylation of Pol II, at the 3’-end of <italic>Dbp</italic>, was strongly diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) suggesting that Pol II pause release had been suppressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harlen and Churchman, 2017</xref>). Reduced <italic>Dbp</italic> expression could be due to lower levels of BMAL1. To show that this is not the case, we constitutively expressed ectopic <italic>CMV</italic> promoter-driven <italic>Bmal1-myc</italic>. BRD4 inhibition by JQ1 strongly reduced endogenous expression levels of <italic>Dbp</italic> mRNA but had no effect on mRNA or protein levels of <italic>Bmal1-myc</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Furthermore, BRD4 inhibition neither affected endogenous mRNA nor protein levels of <italic>Bmal1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>) in <italic>Bmal1-LUC</italic> fibroblasts at 24 hr after Dex synchronization. Finally, the binding of BMAL1 and of acetylated BMAL1 (AcBMAL1) to the <italic>Dbp</italic> promoter was not affected by BRD4 inhibition in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Together, our JQ1 inhibitor studies suggest that BRD4-P-TEFb is recruited to the <italic>E-box</italic>-containing clock-controlled gene <italic>Dbp</italic> which subsequently allows Pol II pause release and transcription elongation. Thus, for this circadian clock-controlled gene, Pol II pause release may serve as an important regulatory step of its transcription.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43235.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>BRD4 controls clock gene expression.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Bioluminescence recordings of dexamethasone (Dex) synchronized <italic>Bmal1-LUC</italic> fibroblasts treated with increasing concentrations of flavoperidol (<bold>A</bold>) or JQ1 (<bold>B</bold>) (n = 4). (<bold>C</bold>) <italic>Dbp</italic> mRNA dampening in Dex-synchronized fibroblasts by 500 nM JQ1 (n = 3; two-way ANOVA, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

TIP60-mediated BMAL1 acetylation leads to the recruitment of BRD4 and of the pause release factor P-TEFb to clock gene TSSs. This, in turn, allows productive elongation of CLOCK-BMAL1-controlled genes. This positive limb of the circadian cycle is counteracted by a negative feedback. This balance between positive and negative regulation, characteristic for the circadian cycle, should also be seen in temporal occupancy profiles of pause release factors at the promoters of <italic>E-box</italic>-controlled clock genes.

In this complex Pol II is bound to the clock gene promoters but is not competent to drive RNA synthesis. At this time in the circadian cycle Pol II is phosphorylated at Ser5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koike et al., 2012</xref>), which is indicative for promoter-proximal pausing and recruitment of the mRNA capping complex to Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harlen and Churchman, 2017</xref>). Evidence for Pol II pausing to occur at this time at circadian promoters can also be found in global run-on experiments measuring transcriptionally engaged Pol II during the circadian cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fang et al., 2014</xref>). Strong enrichment of Pol II at the TSS of the <italic>Nr1d1</italic> gene was observed at the onset of the circadian cycle, suggesting that Pol II is in a paused state. Genome-wide and circadian time-resolved quantitative analysis of Pol II abundance at TSSs and gene bodies show a peak of Pol II binding at TSSs, but not the gene bodies of clock genes, at the onset of the circadian cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). A circadian control of promoter proximal pausing and also of Pol II pause release would provide mechanisms capable to accurately time circadian transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jonkers and Lis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the present work, we have addressed the mechanism of the circadian regulation of Pol II pause release with a focus on proteins that are known to mediate this process. We propose that pause release involves a TIP60-mediated on-chromatin acetylation of Lys538 of BMAL1. BMAL1 acetylation allows the recruitment of the co-activator BRD4 to AcBMAL1. BRD4, in turn, recruits the pause release factor P-TEFb, whose kinase subunit CDK9 then phosphorylates Ser2 of Pol II leading to a release of Pol II from the paused state enabling productive elongation of <italic>E-box</italic>-containing circadian genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In TIP60-deficient cells, Lys538 acetylation of BMAL1 was strongly diminished, BRD4-P-TEFb recruitment was reduced, and the expression of <italic>Dbp</italic>, <italic>Per1</italic>, and <italic>Nr1d1</italic> genes was dampened. If acetylation of BMAL at Lys538 was prevented by a Lys to Arg substitution (BMAL1<sup>K538R</sup>), this mutant protein still interacted with TIP60, but recruitment of BRD4 and P-TEFb to the complex was reduced and Pol II pause release and productive elongation were diminished. The dysregulation of the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity in the mouse and perturbation of circadian gene expression in the SCN and in MEFs provide strong genetic evidence for a key role of TIP60 in the circadian clock. Our studies of TIP60-deficient MEFs suggest that rhythmic control of Pol II pause release may be a main process in which TIP60 is involved. Our studies thus implicate Pol II pause release as an additional regulatory step that contributes to the temporal control of the mammalian circadian clock. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the loss of TIP60 could affect post-initiation event other than Pol II pause release and thereby control RNA processing or RNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Core and Adelman, 2019</xref>). Kinetic analysis of all steps of the transcription cycle could address this issue.</p><p>TIP60 is evolutionarily highly conserved and is involved in the regulation of a series of cellular processes (see Introduction). Thereby, TIP60 has the role of an enzymatically active cofactor in larger multiprotein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jacquet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Judes et al., 2015</xref>). Our studies suggest a similar function of TIP60 within the circadian clock.</p><p>Our studies are based on three robustly rhythmic and clock phase-specific genes that harbor multiple CLOCK-BMAL1 binding sites such as the tandem <italic>E-box</italic> motif (E1-E2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Paquet et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rey et al., 2011</xref>). There are many other strongly rhythmic, phase specific CLOCK-BMAL1-target genes that also harbor multiple <italic>E-boxes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shimomura et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests that regulation by Pol II pause release could extend to the entire class of <italic>E-box</italic> controlled clock genes. These genes are synchronously expressed and would benefit from a precisely timed Pol II pause release process. It is not clear, however, whether BRD4-P-TEFb mediated Pol II pause release applies for other types of clock-controlled genes. Temporal analyses of Pol II pause release at the transcriptome-wide scale can address these issues.</p><p>We found that in fibroblasts, but also in the SCN, deletion of TIP60 resulted in a nearly complete loss of rhythmic expression of numerous circadian genes suggesting that in these tissues and for these genes TIP60 function is non-redundant with CBP/p300 acetyltransferase that also binds to circadian promoters. The strongest argument for BMAL1 being a substrate of TIP60 is that recombinant TIP60 directly acetylates recombinant BMAL1. Although p300 can acetylate BMAL1 it does so at lysine 500 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weinert et al., 2018</xref>). The abundance of BRD4 at clock gene promoters was drastically reduced in BMAL1<sup>K538R</sup> cells, but it is likely that there are other acetylated substrates, such as histones H3 and H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Etchegaray et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koike et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ripperger and Schibler, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vollmers et al., 2012</xref>), to which BRD4 could also be recruited and affect the circadian clock.</p><p>It is proposed that CLOCK acetylates its heterodimeric partner BMAL1 at lysine 538. This leads to recruitment of CRY protein and, thus, initiates the repression phase of the circadian cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirayama et al., 2007</xref>). We found that TIP60-mediated acetylation of BMAL1 occurs during the activation phase of the cycle, which is consistent with the data of Nakahata and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakahata et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakahata et al., 2009</xref>). Our finding of strong acetylation of Lys538 of BMAL1 in CLOCK-deficient fibroblasts and the absence of an effect on the BMAL1 acetylation status in a reaction with a catalytically inactive CLOCK mutant protein raises some doubt about the efficiency of CLOCK as an acetyltransferase for BMAL1. It is noteworthy that CLOCK acetylates argininosuccinate synthase in the cytosol of U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2017</xref>). Since our experiments aimed at transcriptional regulation of the clock, they were carried out with nuclear extracts, they do not address cytosolic acetyltransferase activity of CLOCK.</p><p>TIP60 acetylates BMAL1 during the activation phase, but it is not clear by which mechanism BMAL1 is deacetylated during the repression phase. One possibility is a SIRT1-dependent deacetylation of BMAL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakahata et al., 2008</xref>). Alternatively, recruitment of histone deacetylases by PER to the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2014</xref>) would lead to deacetylation of BMAL1. Another possibility is that promoter-associated acetylated BMAL1 could be subject to rapid proteolytic turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stratmann et al., 2012</xref>) obviating the need for a specific deacetylase.</p><p>Taken together, our study provides evidence that the positive limb of the circadian clock requires TIP60-mediated acetylation of BMAL1, at least for the genes studied here. This could allow a precise and synchronous expression of <italic>E-box</italic>-containing clock genes and in this way also contribute to robustness and precision of the circadian clock.

Input DNA samples were ethanol precipitated and washed with 70% ethanol. DNA pellets were dissolved in 100 µl 10% Chelex 100 suspension and boiled for 10 min. Samples were Proteinase K treated and boiled for 10 min. Supernatant was transferred to a new tube and used for qPCR analysis.</p><p>Primer pair that targets an unbound region was used as internal control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duong et al., 2011</xref>) and fold enrichment was calculated using the 2^(-ΔΔCT) method. Experiments were performed with biological independent triplicates and data normalized to the mean value obtained from the locus with the strongest enrichment.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Acetylation of BMAL1 by TIP60 controls BRD4-P-TEFb recruitment to circadian promoters&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being evaluated by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation is being overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The points that need to be addressed are given in the reviews below. A very important one to address is the conflict with what was previously known for BMAL1 acetylation of K538 by CLOCK leading to repression (Sassone-Corsi and co-workers) in comparison to the rather unconvincing effect of Tip60 KO on BMAL1 acetylation and interaction with Brd4 (IP-WB). Further, the way the data- analysis is presented, it is not possible to know how the ChIPs were calculated/normalized, unless this information has been missed.To reiterate, the authors would really need to address the weakness of their biochemical data. One supplementary data set arguing that CLOCK does not acetylate BMAL1 is not compelling to revise earlier reports.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This interesting study presents data supporting a role of Tip60-dependant acetylation of BMAL1 to allow expression of circadian regulated genes. The acetylation of a previously identified single lysine on BMAL1 is argued to be at the center of a mechanism controlling Brd4/P-TEFb recruitment, allowing RNAPII pause release and productive transcription elongation. A large amount of data is presented to support the conclusions and endogenous acetylation site mutant of BMAL1 (K538R) is characterized after CRISPR-mediated genome editing.</p><p>While the model presented appears well supported by the data, it is very strange that it is not put in the context of known important literature directly linked to what is studied here. For example, BMAL1 acetylation on K537 (mouse, K538 in human) was published in Nature 2007 (Sassone-Corsi lab), shown to be done by CLOCK lysine acetyltransferase activity (BMAL1 heterodimer partner) and oscillates during the circadian cycle, peaking with the repression phase. It was argued that BMAL1 acetylation on K537 leads to repression of circadian regulated genes, through recruitment of CRY1. Ectopic expression of BMAL1 K537R mutant was shown to disrupt circadian rhythm. This is very different to what is proposed here.</p><p>Related to that, the authors state that they tested Tip60 as the KAT for BMAL1 because it was previously shown to co-IP with CLOCK/BMAL1 (Sassone-Corsi lab, Cell 2006). Well, that report also showed co-IP with 2 other major KATs, CBP and PCAF, all acetyltransferases previously shown to be present on E-box promoters in vivo… In fact Tip60 and PCAF histone acetyltransferase complexes are well-known co-factors (through their common TRRAP subunit) of Myc transcription factor that binds the same E-box sequences as CLOCK/BMAL1. Interestingly, elevated Myc expression was shown to disrupt the circadian clock (Cell Metabolism 2015).</p><p>Tip60/KAT5 is known to prefer the &quot;GGK&quot; sequence as substrate and this is what is found for K538 (BMAL1 sequence &quot;GGKKI&quot;). So modification in vitro with recombinant proteins (or through joint over-expression in transient transfection) makes sense but does not prove per se in vivo physiological relevance (see below).</p><p>Specific points about the data:</p><p>– Figure 2A:</p><p>The effect of K538R on co-IP of CDK9/Brd4 is difficult to judge since there seems to be less BMAL1 signal in the input and the BMAL1 WB signal is saturated.

The data presented here raise some questions as there seems to be higher and more constant acBMAL1 signal in the CLOCK KO cells. From the band patterns on the CLOCK KO membrane it seems that the same membrane was used for both total BMAL1 and acBMAL1. Is it possible that the acBMAL1 signal is, in fact, residual total BMAL1 signal after stripping the membrane?

Or PCR replicates?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting paper that explores mechanisms that contribute to circadian regulation of clock gene transcription, using experiments performed in cultured cells and mutant mice</p><p>In the first section of the paper, the authors show that periodic expression of a BMAL1-driven luciferase reporter and of several endogenous clock-regulated genes is inhibited by the Cdk9 inhibitor flavopiridol and by JQ1, a BET inhibitor that preferentially targets BRD4, which contributes to P-TEFb recruitment to genes. Consistent with these observations, JQ1 treatment also leads to loss of BRD4 and Cdk9 at the clock gene Dbp and to a decreased in phosphorylation of the Pol II CTD on Ser2. Based on these observations, the authors propose that BRD4-dependent P-TEFb recruitment is a rate limiting step in Dbp regulation. In further experiments, they present evidence that (i) BRD4 (and Cdk9) bind BMAL1 acetylated at lysine 538; (ii) Tip60 acetylates BMAL1 at K538; (iii) occupancy of BRD4, Cdk9, and Ser2P-phosphorylated Pol II at clock genes is reduced in cells expressing BMAL K538R, as is expression of Dbp mRNA and a BMAL1 luciferase reporter; (iv) Tip60 deficiency gives rise to a circadian phenotype in mice, dampening or disruption of cyclic clock gene expression in SCN and in fibroblasts, (v) Tip60 deficiency also leads to decreased BMAL1 acetylation, BRD4, Cdk9, and Ser2P-phosphorylated Pol II at clock genes.</p><p>Overall, the data are consistent with the authors' model that the histone acetyl transferase TIP60 contributes to circadian gene regulation by acetylating BMAL1, which in turn leads to recruitment of BRD4 and Cdk9/P-TEFb and release of promoter proximally paused Pol II into productive elongation of several circadian transcripts. I do, however, have a number of minor comments.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>1) Relevant to Figure 1 and supplemental figures: It would perhaps be more surprising if blocking P-TEFb/Cdk9 or BRD4 activity didn't interfere with clock gene regulation than that it does since they have very widespread roles in gene regulation.</p><p>2) The authors used the ratio of Ser2P Pol II/total Pol II as a measure of release from promoter-proximal pausing into productive elongation, but they don't show effects of drug treatments or BMAL1 / Tip60 mutations on total Pol II distribution. I think it would be better to show not only the ratio of these two ChIP signals but also each of them individually so the reader can assess the degree to which the mutations alter Pol II distribution vs Pol II CTD phosphorylation.</p><p>3) The authors conclude that BMAL or Tip60 mutation doesn't affect initiation based on evidence that the mutations don't lead to changes in TFIIE occupancy measured by ChIP. Strictly speaking, this is consistent with idea that PIC assembly is unlikely to be affected but doesn't rule out changes in initiation rate.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43235.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] While the model presented appears well supported by the data, it is very strange that it is not put in the context of known important literature directly linked to what is studied here.

Nakahata et al., 2008, show that BMAL1 acetylation peaks ~18 h post serum shock (Figure 2A) which is the time when the BMAL1 direct target gene Dbp (for a discussion about direct targets see the Schibler lab paper by Stratmann et al., 2008) shows peak expression (Figure 2B).

The experiment goes as follows. BMAL1 is transfected into HEK293 cells and after 2 days of culture the extent of acetylation of BMAL1 is determined by quantitative chemiluminescence. This defines base-line Lys538 acetylation levels of BMAL1. In parallel, BMAL1 and CLOCK or CLOCK-mutA are co-transfected (CLOCK-mutA is a catalytically inactive CLOCK that was obtained from the Sassone-Corsi lab and was re-sequenced by us for verification). If CLOCK acetylates BMAL1 the level of acetylated BMAL1 should increase, while CLOCK-mutA should not have this effect. Lastly, we will co-transfect TIP60 with BMAL1 and CLOCK or CLOCK-mutA.

It should be recalled how this experiment is carried out. First, fibroblasts are grown to confluence at which time they stop proliferation. AdCre or AdGFP is added which will then lead to the excision of the floxed TIP60 with the first vector. Eventually, TIP60 protein will also disappear. At day 3 cells are synchronized by dexamethasone treatment and lysed 24 h later. Then the acetylation status of BMAL1 is checked. This is a standard protocol, but it does not “remove” all TIP60 protein. In fact, Figure 5A shows that with this protocol there is residual TIP60 (18%).

This is reflected in the early embryonic lethality of <italic>Tip60</italic>-deficient flies or mice. The challenge we were facing was to set up experiments in which we could study a specific TIP60 function. We did this by studying postmitotic cells (neurons of the SCN [using the CRE-LoxP system] and growth-arrested fibroblasts) and we focused on a single substrate – BMAL1 – that is part of the circadian pacemaker. Our “bias” for BMAL1 and the clock was due to the fact, that our genetic experiments revealed a strong impairment of the circadian clock (and nothing else). Hence it makes sense to look for substrates of TIP60 among the clock proteins. Three major additional pieces of information prompted us to follow this path. First, Sassone-Corsi and associates showed that BMAL1 was acetylated and that such acetylation was functionally important. Second, we had some doubts about the possibility that CLOCK acetylates BMAL1 at lysine 538, since in CLOCK-deficient fibroblasts that particular lysine was still acetylated. Nonetheless, even in this situation there could be additional TIP60 substrates that contribute to the circadian phenotype such as hypoacetylation of certain histones.
