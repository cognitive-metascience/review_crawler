ventral tegmental area use glutamate as a cotransmitter. To elucidate the behavioral role of the cotransmission, we targeted the glutamate-recycling enzyme glutaminase (gene <italic>Gls1</italic>). In mice with a dopamine transporter (<italic>Slc6a3</italic>)-driven conditional heterozygous (cHET) reduction of <italic>Gls1</italic> in their dopamine neurons, dopamine neuron survival and transmission were unaffected, while glutamate cotransmission at phasic firing frequencies was reduced, enabling a selective focus on the cotransmission. The mice showed normal emotional and motor behaviors, and an unaffected response to acute amphetamine. Strikingly, amphetamine sensitization was reduced and latent inhibition potentiated. These behavioral effects, also seen in global GLS1 HETs with a schizophrenia resilience phenotype, were not seen in mice with an <italic>Emx1</italic>-driven forebrain reduction affecting most brain glutamatergic neurons. Thus, a reduction in dopamine neuron glutamate cotransmission appears to mediate significant components of the GLS1 HET schizophrenia resilience phenotype, and glutamate cotransmission appears to be important in attribution of motivational salience.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.27566.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27566.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27566.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A small cluster of neurons found in the midbrain use dopamine to send signals to neurons involved in many processes including motivation and attention. Drugs of abuse such as amphetamine co-opt motivation by increasing dopamine signaling. When used excessively, the drugs can engender delusional thinking, as is seen in schizophrenia. In contrast, the drugs used to treat schizophrenia block excess dopamine signaling. Recently it has been shown that dopamine neurons in the middle part of the midbrain release both dopamine and glutamate. The exact role of this dopamine neuron glutamate signaling has been difficult to find out.</p><p>Previous experiments involved genetically modifying dopamine neurons so that they would not release glutamate. However, this affected how the neurons develop, making it difficult to discern the effects of glutamate signaling. Now, in genetically modified mice that have less glutaminase in their dopamine neurons than normal, Mingote et al. find that glutamate signaling is reduced just when dopamine neurons fire more rapidly. This did not change how dopamine neurons develop or how they use dopamine to signal.</p><p>This reduction in dopamine neuron glutamate signaling affects two behaviors that are driven by the activity of dopamine neurons. First, it reduces the effects of a process called amphetamine sensitization, in which repeated doses of amphetamine increase dopamine neuron signaling so that events associated with drug use take up more attention than they normally would. Second, the modified mice were better able to ignore familiar, irrelevant sounds in their environment; the mice continued to pay less attention to a familiar sound, even when it was paired with a shock and came to predict an unpleasant event – a process known as potentiation of latent inhibition. The effects on both of these processes suggest that dopamine neuron glutamate signaling helps animals decide which features of their environment are most important.</p><p>This result suggests a new way of treating schizophrenia. When humans take amphetamine repeatedly, which produces sensitization, they can develop psychosis, a principal symptom of schizophrenia. During a period of psychosis, thoughts and perceptions are disturbed, making it difficult to distinguish between relevant or irrelevant things in the environment. By reducing amphetamine sensitization and potentiating latent inhibition, blocking dopamine neuron glutamate signaling might help to treat the symptoms of schizophrenia.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.27566.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27566.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>glutaminase</kwd><kwd>amphetamine sensitization</kwd><kwd>latent inhibition</kwd><kwd>motivational salience</kwd><kwd>resilience model</kwd><kwd>schizophrenia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH087758</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rayport</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA017978</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rayport</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009670</institution-id><institution>National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Young Investigator Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mingote</surname><given-names>Susana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH086404</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>Holly</given-names></name><name><surname>Rayport</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The conditional reduction of glutaminase in mouse dopamine neurons selectively attenuates glutamate cotransmission at phasic frequencies, revealing the role of dopamine neuron glutamate cotransmission in the attribution of motivational salience.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dopamine (DA) neurons regulate several aspects of motivated behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Salamone and Correa, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schultz, 2013</xref>), and are involved in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders ranging from drug dependence to schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Robinson and Berridge, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Winton-Brown et al., 2014</xref>). Like most CNS neurons, DA neurons release multiple neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Trudeau et al., 2014</xref>). They release DA with both slower modulatory actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tritsch and Sabatini, 2012</xref>), as well as faster signaling actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ford et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chuhma et al., 2014</xref>). They variously release glutamate (GLU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hnasko and Edwards, 2012</xref>) and GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tritsch et al., 2016</xref>) as cotransmitters, conferring both greater dynamic signaling range and heterogeneity in their synaptic actions, as well as differential susceptibility to endogenous and exogenous modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chuhma et al., 2017</xref>). Discerning the behavioral role of DA neuron GLU cotransmission has been challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Morales and Margolis, 2017</xref>).</p><p>DA neuron GLU cotransmission has a crucial neurodevelopmental role. The abrogation of GLU cotransmission via a DA transporter (DAT)-driven conditional knockout (cKO) of vesicular GLU transporter 2 (VGLUT2, encoded by <italic>Slc17a6</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hnasko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stuber et al., 2010</xref>) impairs survival and axonal arborization of DA neurons in vitro, and compromises the development of the mesostriatal DA system in vivo leading to a 20% decrease in the number of DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fortin et al., 2012</xref>). GLU cotransmission also plays an important role in modulating DA release by enhancing packing of DA into vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hnasko et al., 2010</xref>) via vesicular synergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">El Mestikawy et al., 2011</xref>). Functionally, DAT VGLUT2 cKO show about a 25% reduction in electrically-evoked DA release and about a 35% reduction in DA content in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hnasko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fortin et al., 2012</xref>). Behaviorally, DAT VGLUT2 cKO show modest deficits in emotional and motor behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birgner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fortin et al., 2012</xref>), normal reinforcement learning drive by DA neuron activation but decreased response vigor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), a blunted response to psychostimulants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birgner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hnasko et al., 2010</xref>), and a paradoxical increase in sucrose and cocaine seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alsiö et al., 2011</xref>). Whether the behavioral phenotypes of DAT VGLUT2 cKO mice are due to the impact of the VGLUT2 deficit on DA neuron development, DA transmission, or GLU synaptic actions is not clear.</p><p>Phasic activity of DA neurons projecting to the NAc encodes the incentive salience of reward-predicting cues and invigorates cue-induced motivated behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Flagel et al., 2011</xref>). At the synaptic level in the striatum, DA neurons make the strongest GLU connections in the NAc shell to cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chuhma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mingote et al., 2015</xref>). When DA neurons are driven at burst firing frequencies — mimicking their in vivo phasic firing — their GLU postsynaptic actions drive synchronized burst-pause sequences in ChIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chuhma et al., 2014</xref>) that are likely to be important in salience encoding.</p><p>Dysregulated DA neuron firing is thought to disrupt salience processing leading to the development of psychotic symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kapur, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Winton-Brown et al., 2014</xref>). The hyperdopaminergic state associated with positive symptoms of schizophrenia is modeled in rodents by amphetamine sensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Peleg-Raibstein et al., 2008</xref>), which enhances the motivational salience of drug-associated stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Robinson et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, amphetamine sensitization as well as gestational MAM treatment, a validated rodent model of schizophrenia, selectively enhance activity of VTA neurons projecting to NAc shell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lodge and Grace, 2012</xref>), a key brain region associated with motivational salience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ikemoto, 2007</xref>), where DA neurons make the strongest GLU connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mingote et al., 2015</xref>). Dysregulation in salience processing is also thought to underlie the disruption of latent inhibition (LI) seen in schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Weiner, 2003</xref>). Disruption of LI is replicated in rodents by amphetamine-induced increases in DA neuron activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Young et al., 2005</xref>), in particular increases in DA neuron phasic firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Covey et al., 2016</xref>). Although DA neuron GLU signals at burst frequencies control NAc shell activity, it remains to be established whether GLU cotransmission is necessary for the expression of behaviors dependent on salience attribution and associated with schizophrenia.</p><p>So we sought to temper GLU release at the higher firing frequency of bursts, independent of DA release. For this we targeted phosphate-activated glutaminase (PAG), encoded by <italic>Gls1,</italic> in order to reduce presynaptic glutamate synthesis modestly without affecting DA neuron vesicular dynamics, as well as minimizing effects on DA neuron development. Most presynaptic GLU arises from the action of PAG; once released, GLU is taken up by neighboring astrocytes, metabolized to glutamine, and transferred back to presynaptic terminals where it is converted to GLU by PAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marx et al., 2015</xref>). This GLU–glutamine cycle is particularly important in sustaining GLU release with higher frequency firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billups et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tani et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Masson et al., 2006</xref>) or heterozygous reduction of <italic>Gls1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gaisler-Salomon et al., 2009b</xref>) decreases GLU neurotransmission at higher firing frequencies selectively. The global heterozygous <italic>Gls1</italic> reduction impacts several DA dependent behaviors that underpin a schizophrenia resilience phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gaisler-Salomon et al., 2009b</xref>), characterized by an attenuated response to psychostimulant challenge, potentiated latent inhibition, procognitive effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hazan and Gaisler-Salomon, 2014</xref>), together with CA1 hippocampal hypoactivity inverse to the CA1 hyperactivity seen in patients with schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gaisler-Salomon et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schobel et al., 2009</xref>). Genetic mutations engendering resilience carry strong therapeutic valence as they directly identify therapeutic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mihali et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here we show in DAT GLS1 conditional heterozygous (cHET) mice — with a DAT (<italic>Slc6a3)</italic>-driven <italic>Gls1</italic> reduction — that DA neuron GLU cotransmission is reduced in a frequency dependent manner, without affecting DA neuron development or DA release, and that behaviors that rely on the motivational salience-encoding function of DA neurons are selectively affected, with implications of DA neuron GLU cotransmission for schizophrenia pharmacotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression of PAG in DA neurons</title><p>DA neurons immunoreactive for PAG are found in both the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) in rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaneko et al., 1990</xref>), but this has not been examined in mouse. Moreover, the expression of PAG in DA neurons has never been addressed stereologically.

To determine the number of DA neurons expressing both VGLUT2 and PAG mRNA, we performed a single cell reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis in P25-37 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Since DA neurons also corelease GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tritsch et al., 2016</xref>), which could derive in part from glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) metabolism of GLU (produced by PAG), we also examined the expression of GAD67 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We found that VGLUT2 mRNA was highly concentrated in VTA DA neurons but rarely expressed in SNc DA neurons. Importantly, TH<sup>+</sup> / VGLUT2<sup>+</sup> neurons preferentially expressed PAG (9 out of 11 TH<sup>+</sup> / VGLUT2<sup>+</sup> cells coexpressed PAG; <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> =3.6, p=0.035), further supporting the role of PAG in GLU cotransmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). GAD67 was not found in TH<sup>+</sup> / PAG<sup>+</sup> neurons; while a few DA neurons expressed GAD67 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2015</xref> supplemental information), a larger sample would be required to assess the role of PAG in GABA cotransmission. Yet, some TH<sup>—</sup> / PAG<sup>+</sup> neurons in both the VTA (2/6 cells) and SN (6/13 cells) were GAD<sup>+</sup>, identifying them as GABA neurons and suggesting that PAG contributes to GABA synthesis in those neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). We also found TH<sup>—</sup> / PAG<sup>+</sup> VTA neurons that coexpress VGLUT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>), identifying them as GLU neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hnasko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yamaguchi et al., 2015</xref>).

The number of PAG<sup>+</sup> / TH<sup>+</sup> neurons in both the VTA and SNc increased modestly with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Although DA neurons throughout the ventral midbrain express PAG, only medial DA neurons that also express VGLUT2 are capable of GLU cotransmission, so the impact of a PAG reduction on GLU cotransmission should be further restricted to VGLUT2-expressing DA neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Conditional <italic>Gls1</italic> reduction in DA neurons</title><p>To address the specific function of DA neuron GLU cotransmission, we bred DAT<sup>IRES<italic>cre</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bäckman et al., 2006</xref>) with <italic>floxGls1</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mingote et al., 2016</xref>) to reduce <italic>Gls1</italic> coexpression selectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

The burst photostimulation was chosen to mimic in vivo phasic firing of DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Paladini and Roeper, 2014</xref>). Single photostimulation-evoked EPSCs in both ChIs and SPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) were blocked by the AMPA-kainate receptor antagonist CNQX, confirming GLU mediation (n = 4 ChIs per genotype; n = 3 SPNs per genotype). As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chuhma et al., 2014</xref>), the amplitude of EPSCs in ChIs (CTRL 51 ± 6.0 pA) was greater than in SPNs (CTRL 21.5 ± 2.2 pA). The amplitude of single-evoked EPSCs was unaffected in cHET mice (ChIs 66.1 ± 6.7 pA; SPNs 21.2 ± 2.3 pA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), as were EPSC rise and decay time constants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F,G</xref>). Burst-induced EPSCs in ChIs and SPNs showed short-term depression in both genotypes that was significantly greater in cHETs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This was particularly evident when EPSC amplitudes were normalized to the first EPSC in the burst, which showed no genotypic difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, graphs). In CTRL mice, EPSCs in ChIs decreased to 48 ± 6.0% with the second pulse and to 23 ± 4.2% with the fifth, while in cHET mice EPSCs decreased to 20 ± 6.3% with the second and to 14 ± 3.3% with the fifth. The rundown was apparently faster in SPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, bottom traces and graph); in CTRL mice, EPSCs decreased to 48 ± 6.0% with the second pulse and to 24 ± 6.4% with the fifth, while in cHET mice EPSC amplitude decreased to 25 ± 4.9% with the second, and to 16 ± 1% with the fifth, which was close to baseline. Observing a more rapid frequency-dependent EPSC depression in cHETs in both ChIs and SPNs, and no differences in their intrinsic properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B,C,D,E</xref>), is consistent with a presynaptic reduction in PAG. The average amplitude and frequency of spontaneous EPSCs, measured in both the SPNs and ChIs, showed no genotypic difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2H,I</xref>), indicating that GLU inputs mostly from forebrain regions, as well as signaling through postsynaptic GLU receptors, was unaffected in DAT GLS1 cHETs.</p><p>At the striatal circuit level, DA neuron control of ChI firing in the medial NAc shell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chuhma et al., 2014</xref>) was attenuated in cHET mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We quantified this using the firing ratio, the firing frequency during train photostimulation (0–0.5 s from the onset of train) divided by the preceding 2 s of baseline firing. There were no genotypic differences in baseline firing frequencies (CTRL 4.7 ± 1.1 Hz; cHET 3.9 ± 0.6 Hz; ANOVA, F<sub>(1,33)</sub>= 0.60, p=0.444). The firing ratio in CTRL mice was 4.3 ± 0.7 compared to 2.1 ± 0.2 in cHET mice, which was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, right). In the subsequent half-second window, the firing ratio reversed to below baseline in CTRL (0.6 ± 0.08) and cHETs (0.7 ± 0.11), which did not differ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, right). This reduction in firing is mainly mediated by activity-dependent components, and less so by DA D2-mediated inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chuhma et al., 2014</xref>). Color-coded tables with a 50 msec window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) clearly show greater burst firing in CTRL than in cHET, but little difference in the post-burst period. Dividing the 0.5 to 1 s interval into 250 ms windows revealed no significant differences (one-way ANOVA: 0.5–0.75 period, CTRL 0.6 ± 0.12 vs. cHET 0.8 ± 0.12, F<sub>(1,34)</sub>= 1.98, p=0.168; 0.75–1 period, CTRL 0.5 ± 0.08 vs. cHET 0.8 ± 0.1, F<sub>(1,34)</sub>= 3.510, p=0.070). Thus, PAG plays an important role in sustaining DA neuron GLU cotransmission at higher firing frequencies and determines their ability to drive Chls to fire in bursts.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Normal DA transmission in DAT GLS1 cHETs</title><p>To evaluate the specificity of the reduction in GLU cotransmission in DAT GLS1 cHET mice further, we counted DA neurons by unbiased stereology, at P110 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We found no reduction in the number of DA neurons in the VTA (unilateral counts: CTRL 7548 ± 418, cHET 7310 ± 450) or SNc (CTRL 6595 ± 373, cHET 6781 ± 518). DA neurons in cHET mice showed no differences in their intrinsic electrophysiological properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Presynaptic DA content and turnover, in the NAc and dStr of adult mice (P71-P110), did not significantly differ between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We performed fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) in DAT GLS1 cHET::ChR2 mice (P71-P85) to determine whether DA release dynamics were affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We compared DA release evoked by single or burst photostimulation in the NAc medial shell. To challenge DA neuron synapses further, single pulse stimulation was repeated twice followed by a burst, and burst stimulation was repeated twice followed by a single. There were no genotypic differences in DA release with either stimulation pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The decay time constant of DA responses did not differ significantly between genotypes with single (CTRL 409 ± 30 ms; cHET 362 ± 26 ms; ANOVA,F<sub>(1,23)</sub>=1.42, p=0.245) or burst photostimulation (CTRL 540 ± 28 ms; cHET 482 ± 25 ms; ANOVA, F<sub>(1,22)</sub>= 2.12, p=0.160). Thus, the conditional <italic>Gls1</italic> reduction does not affect DA neuron DA release in the NAc medial shell, where GLU cotransmission is strongest. Evoked DA release was not affected in the NAc core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A,B,C</xref>) nor in the dStr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D,E,F</xref>), indicating that DA storage and release dynamics throughout the striatum are normal in DAT GLS1 cHETs. The effect sizes for all non-significant F values were small to negligible (partial η<sup>2</sup>: Stereology = 0.014; DA content = 0.004; DA release: range 0.0002 to 0.011).

The activity of DA neurons projecting to the NAc shell, the majority of which are capable of GLU cotransmission, play a crucial role in both amphetamine sensitization and LI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ikemoto, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nelson et al., 2011</xref>), so we asked whether DAT GLS1 cHETs display similar behavioral phenotypes.</p><p>We tested DAT GLS1 cHET mice (P90-P120) for amphetamine sensitization, following the protocol schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>. Two cohorts were tested, since there was no difference between the cohorts (ANOVA cohort effect: CTRL veh, F<sub>(1,17)</sub> = 0.37, p=0.872; cHET Veh, F<sub>(1,15)</sub> = 0.49, p=0.494; CTRL Amph, F<sub>(1,19)</sub> = 0.94, p=0.346; cHET Amph, F<sub>(1,19)</sub> = 3.752, p=0.068) they were combined. With daily amphetamine injections (2.5 mg/kg) over 5 days, CTRL mice showed an increase in drug-induced hyperlocomotion, characteristic of a sensitized response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), while cHET mice showed no increase in hyperlocomotion. Ten days later, all mice were tested, first with a vehicle challenge (Day 18) and then with amphetamine (2.5 mg/kg; Day 19). The vehicle challenge revealed a modest but significant conditioned response in the Amph-treated groups. During the amphetamine challenge, amphetamine-treated CTRL mice showed a significant sensitized response, while amphetamine-treated cHET mice showed a significant but smaller sensitized response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, gray area). Further comparison of the locomotor response during the 90 min post-amphetamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) showed no difference between vehicle-treated cHET and CTRL mice, but a significantly smaller sensitized response in amphetamine-treated cHET mice compared to amphetamine-treated CTRL mice. Thus attenuating phasic GLU cotransmission blocks the induction of amphetamine sensitization and reduces the expression of sensitization, after a withdrawal period.</p><p>LI is characterized by an attenuated response to a conditioned stimulus (CS) presented without reinforcement prior to being paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Weiner, 2003</xref>). LI is potentiated by neurotoxin-induced loss of DA neurons projecting to the NAc shell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Joseph et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nelson et al., 2011</xref>), which would affect GLU cotransmission. We asked whether DAT GLS1 cHETs show potentiated LI, using the protocol schematized in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>.</bold> On Day 1, mice (P90-120) were assigned either to a preexposure (PE) group that received 20 tone exposures prior to tone (CS) - shock (US) pairing, or to a non-preexposure (NPE) group that received only the CS-US pairing. The number of CS pre-exposures was limited so as not to elicit LI in the PE group, enabling detection of potentiated LI. On Day 2, freezing to context was tested in the same chamber; there was no genotypic difference between the NPE and PE groups (CTRL NPE = 20 ± 4.5 s; cHET NPE = 35 ± 5.4 s; CTRL PE = 39.9 ± 5.9 s; cHET PE = 36.8 ± 5.7 s; two-way ANOVA; genotype factor, F<sub>(1,32)</sub> = 1.00, p=0.323; preexposure factor, F<sub>(1,32)</sub> = 3.46, p=0.074; interaction, F<sub>(1,32)</sub> = 2.358, p=0.134). On Day 3, mice were put in a different context and presented with the CS. Less freezing during CS presentation in PE compared to NPE groups reflects potentiation of LI. During the 3 min before CS presentation, both CTRL and cHET mice showed less than 20% freezing, and there was no difference between the NPE and PE groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). During CS presentation, CTRL mice showed increased freezing with no difference between the NPE and PE groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, left graph), revealing the learned tone-fear association and no LI. In contrast, the cHET PE group showed less freezing in comparison to the NPE group, revealing potentiated LI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, right graph). Importantly, when analyzing the total freezing during the CS presentation and comparing responses between genotypes directly, the cHET NPE group did not differ from the CTRL NPE group, showing that aversive associative learning per se was not affected in cHETs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), replicating previous findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

EMX1 GLS1 cHETs (P85-107) did not differ from CTRL mice in their novelty-induced locomotion in the open field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>) and amphetamine sensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). The effect size for the nonsignificant drug treatment X time X genotype interaction was negligible (partial η<sup>2</sup>: 0.005). EMX1 GLS1 cHETs (P80-96) did not show potentiation of LI (ES for nonsignificant PE X genotype interaction = 0.016) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). To confirm in EMX1 GLS1 cHETs that the limited number of pre-exposures did not elicit LI and yet was sufficient to reveal potentiation of LI, we tested for clozapine-induced potentiation of LI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gaisler-Salomon et al., 2009b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5A</xref>). In both CTRL and EMX1 GLS1 cHETs, clozapine treatment on Day 1, potentiated LI in the PE groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5B</xref>), but had no effect in the NPE groups showing that it did not affect learning. Similar clozapine effects were seen in ΔGLS1 HET and DAT GLS1 cHET mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5C</xref>). The lack of further potentiation of LI in ΔGLS1 HET and DAT GLS1 cHET mice suggests that clozapine treatment and <italic>Gls1</italic> deficiency in DA neurons each either induce maximal potentiation of LI, or involve shared mechanisms so that <italic>Gls1</italic> deficiency occludes clozapine-induced potentiation of LI. In summary, our results argue that reducing <italic>Gls1</italic> in DA neurons is not only sufficient but also necessary for the reduction of amphetamine sensitization and potentiation of LI.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we show that a conditional heterozygous reduction of <italic>Gls1</italic> in DA neurons selectively attenuates GLU cotransmission at phasic firing frequencies without directly affecting DA transmission, enabling a focus on the role of DA neuron GLU cotransmission.

The function of PAG in SNc DA neurons incapable of GLU cotransmission is still uncertain, although we show that a minor reduction of PAG expression in those neurons had no impact on their survival or intrinsic physiology, nor did it affect DA transmission in the dStr or motor behaviors controlled by the dStr. In contrast, DA neurons capable of GLU cotransmission (TH<sup>+</sup> / VGLUT2<sup>+</sup> cells) preferentially express PAG, and a reduction of PAG in those VTA DA neurons was sufficient to attenuate phasic GLU cotransmission in the NAc shell and impact behaviors controlled by the NAc, revealing the important role of PAG in DA neuron GLU cotransmission.</p><p>The reduction in PAG activity of about 20% seen in stopGLS1 HET brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">El Hage et al., 2012</xref>) is associated with about a 15% reduction in GLU content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gaisler-Salomon et al., 2009b</xref>) that presumably reflects a presynaptic diminution, since the highest concentrations of GLU are intracellular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Danbolt, 2001</xref>).

The fact that a heterozygous GLS1 reduction in DA neurons is sufficient to decrease synaptic efficacy indicates that PAG levels are not only lower but rate limiting. Single cell RT-PCR studies show that DA neurons also have low VGLUT2 mRNA copy numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Trudeau et al., 2014</xref>). Lower VGLUT2 expression would place further demands on the GLU-glutamine cycle to sustain synaptic transmission during periods of high activity, given that vesicular loading depends both on cytosolic GLU concentration and vesicular transporter number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wilson et al., 2005</xref>). This indicates that the DA neuron GLU cotransmission in DAT GLS1 cHETS is highly dependent on PAG activity, and suggests that the global reduction in PAG activity in global GLS1 HETs affects DA neuron GLU cotransmission preferentially.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Role of DA neuron glutamate cotransmission</title><p>Discerning the behavioral role of DA neuron GLU cotransmission has been challenging because of the impact of knocking out VGLUT2 in DA neurons on DA function. In DAT VGLUT2 cKOs, DA neuron function is affected profoundly due to the developmental role of VGLUT2 in DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fortin et al., 2012</xref>). In DAT GLS1 cHETs, DA neuron DA functions appear normal; <italic>Gls1</italic> reduction affects neither the survival of DA neurons nor their intrinsic electrophysiological properties. VGLUT2 also plays an important role in vesicular DA uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hnasko et al., 2010</xref>), but there was no impact of <italic>Gls1</italic> deficiency on DA content or release, even when DA terminals were stimulated repeatedly to increase the demand on DA release. Since DAT GLS1 cHET DA neurons show normal GLU cotransmission with low-frequency activity, our results suggest that modestly reduced presynaptic GLU is sufficient for the maintenance of normal vesicular DA dynamics in adulthood. Alternately, DA neuron GLU release may arise from segregated release sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), so reduced vesicular GLU filling would not affect DA release. In the absence of a direct effect on synaptic DA transmission, finding that GLU signaling with high-frequency activity was affected selectively in DAT GLS1 cHETs allowed us to focus on the function of GLU cotransmission.</p><p>DAT GLS1 cHET mice do not show several behavioral phenotypes of DAT VGLUT2 cKOs, such as decreased novelty-induced locomotion, motor deficits on the rotarod, an anxiety phenotype, or blunted responses to psychostimulants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birgner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hnasko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fortin et al., 2012</xref>). Presumably the behaviors not affected by a mild disruption in GLU cotransmission, are sensitive to manipulations that affect both DA and GLU transmission, such as in DAT VGLUT2 cKO mice. Strikingly, the subtle activity-dependent reduction in DA neuron GLU cotransmission in DAT GLS1 cHETs had major effects on amphetamine sensitization and LI, arguing that DA neuron GLU cotransmission is a key regulator of these behaviors. DA signaling increases with psychostimulant sensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vezina, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bocklisch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Covey et al., 2014</xref>). While DA neuron DA signaling was not affected in DAT GLS1 cHETs, changes in DA signaling with repeated psychostimulant administration are likely, although attenuated due to reduced DA neuron GLU cotransmission. DA neuron excitatory connections to SPNs in the NAc core are modestly but significantly increased weeks after chronic psychostimulant administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ishikawa et al., 2013</xref>); psychostimulant-induced plasticity may be even stronger at DA neuron excitatory connections to ChIs in the NAc shell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chuhma et al., 2014</xref>). At the VTA-NAc circuit level, reducing GLU cotransmission may attenuate increases in DA neuron activity associated with sensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bocklisch et al., 2013</xref>). While subsequent circuit effects impacted by reduced GLU cotransmission involve DA signaling, we show here for the first time that the attenuation of GLU cotransmission in the absence of developmental alterations and direct effects on DA transmission has strong and selective behavioral effects, revealing a new mechanism through which DA neurons control behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications for salience and schizophrenia-resilience</title><p>DA neuron activity mediates both amphetamine sensitization and LI by encoding motivational salience of relevant events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Young et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Robinson et al., 2016</xref>). Our results suggest that DA neuron GLU signaling plays a key role in salience attribution. In amphetamine sensitization, increases in DA neuron firing are restricted to medial VTA DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lodge and Grace, 2012</xref>), the majority of which are capable of GLU cotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yamaguchi et al., 2015</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that all abused drugs increase DA neuron activity to strengthen the motivational salience of drug exposure or associated events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Covey et al., 2014</xref>). DAT GLS1 cHET mice do not show sensitization to amphetamine with repeated administration, and after a withdrawal period show reduced expression of sensitization. Similar results were found in mice with a conditional NR1 deletion in their DA neurons that resulted in a dramatic reduction in phasic firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zweifel et al., 2009</xref>). While the development of sensitization was unaffected in DAT NR1 cKO mice, the mice showed reduced expression of sensitization weeks after withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zweifel et al., 2008</xref>). Taken together, several lines of evidence suggest that phasic DA neuron GLU signals facilitate sensitization by determining how rapidly and efficiently pathological levels of salience are attributed to drug exposure. In contrast, DAT NR1 cKO showed a reduction in conditioned responses to context not seen in the present study, suggesting that the abrogation of both DA and GLU phasic transmission must be affected to impact the development of drug-induced conditioned responses.</p><p>In LI, it is thought that the activity of DA neurons in the NAc updates the salience of a preexposed stimulus during the conditioning phase by integrating previous with current behavioral experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Young et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, the potentiation of LI seen in DAT GLS1 cHET mice represents a failure of DA neurons to increase the salience of the inconsequential preexposed stimulus under changed reinforcement contingencies during conditioning. The temporal precision of the DA neuron GLU signal makes it particularly suitable for updating salience. In the NAc medial shell, a structure known to regulate motivational salience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ikemoto, 2007</xref>), DA neuron GLU connections to ChIs drive them to fire in bursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chuhma et al., 2014</xref>). Direct optogenetic excitation of ChIs in the NAc shell — as would result from DA neuron GLU actions — does not drive reinforcement learning on its own but instead modulates learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). It has been recently shown that GLU cotransmission is not required for self-administration reinforced by DA neuron activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together with our behavioral results, this suggests that DA neuron GLU signals modulate learning by regulating the attribution of motivational salience to relevant events via their direct control of ChI activity.</p><p>In the context of schizophrenia, the behaviors affected in DAT GLS1 cHETs align with the schizophrenia resilience phenotype of stopGLS1 HET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gaisler-Salomon et al., 2009b</xref>), as well as ΔGLS1 HET mice, both with a global GLS1 heterozygous reduction. Several other phenotypes of GLS1 HETs, a blunted locomotor response to novelty, diminished sensitivity to acute amphetamine or reduced contextual fear conditioning were not seen in DAT GLS1 cHETs and so apparently do not depend on GLU cotransmission. Furthermore, none of these behavioral deficits were recapitulated in EMX1 GLS1 cHETs, with a forebrain-restricted GLS1 reduction, demonstrating that PAG in DA neurons is necessary for amphetamine sensitization and potentiation of LI, and reinforcing the likelihood that DA neuron GLU cotransmission is particularly sensitive to PAG reduction.</p><p>Modeling resilience in mice using transgenic approaches offers a direct path to intervention, as resilience mutations point directly to therapeutic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mihali et al., 2012</xref>). Supported by the recent demonstration of VGLUT2 expression — and thus of GLU cotransmission — in primate DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Root et al., 2016</xref>), the therapeutic potential of PAG inhibition as a pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mingote et al., 2016</xref>) may involve tempering DA neuron GLU cotransmission. Finally, our findings put forward the possibility that an increase in GLU cotransmission in the NAc may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, in particular to aberrant salience leading to psychosis. Increased activity in the midbrain and NAc has been associated with aberrant salience attribution to irrelevant stimuli in patients with psychosis or individuals at high risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Romaniuk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roiser et al., 2013</xref>), while increased NAc activity does not correlate with increased dopamine synthesis capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roiser et al., 2013</xref>). This inconsistency would be reconciled if increased activity in the VTA and NAc in SCZ is associated with a greater pathological increase in GLU cotransmission than in DA transmission.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental animals</title><p>We used stopGLS1 (JIMSR Cat# JAX:017956, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:017956">IMSR_JAX:017956</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gaisler-Salomon et al., 2009b</xref>) and floxGLS1 mice (IMSR Cat# JAX:017894, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:017894">IMSR_JAX:017894</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mingote et al., 2016</xref>), both on a 129SVE-F background, and DAT<sup>IREScre</sup> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:006660">IMSR_JAX:006660</ext-link>), EMX1<sup>IREScre</sup> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:005628">IMSR_JAX:005628</ext-link>) and Rosa26<sup>creERT2</sup> mice (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:008463">IMSR_JAX:008463</ext-link>) on a C57BL/6 background.

DA release was evoked by photostimulation (blue high-power LED) and measured using carbon fiber electrodes, calibrated to 1 µM DA, post-experiment. A triangle wave (−450 to +800 mV at 312.5 V/sec vs. Ag/AgCl) was applied to the electrode at 10 Hz. Fibers were conditioned in the brain slice by cycling the fiber for 20–30 min or until the current stabilized. Current was recorded using an Axopatch 200B filtered at 10 kHz with a 4-pole Bessel filter, digitized at 25 kHz (ITC-18) using Igor Pro 6 (WaveMetrics) and analyzed with MATLAB R2014b (MathWorks). The apparent DA oxidation peak in response to the applied triangle wave in cyclic voltammetry is determined by the pipette offset of the amplifier, which is used to correct for resistance between the ground and carbon fiber electrodes. In this study, we made no pipette offset adjustment, which decreased the instances that the current signal overloaded the amplifier. However, the DA oxidation peak, which is normally reported at ~+600 mV with a typical offset of ~+150 mV, was left shifted and occurred at ~+400 mV without an offset. We found in calibrations that the absence of pipette offset did not affect the peak amplitude of the DA response.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>DA and DOPAC content</title><p>To measure tissue DA and DOPAC content, mice underwent cervical dislocation; brains were removed rapidly and flash frozen in isopentane. Tissue samples were obtained from 1 mm circular punches from approximately 1 mm thick coronal sections, weighed, placed in 200 µl of HeGA preservative solution (0.1 M Acetic Acid, 0.105% EDTA, 0.12% Glutathione, pH 3.7), homogenized (150 VT Ultrasonic homogenizer; Homogenizers.net), centrifuged and supernatant frozen at −80°C pending analysis. Samples were separated by HPLC coupled to an electrochemical detector. DA and DOPAC were separated with a reverse phase C18 column (ChromSep SS 100 × 3.0 mm, Inertsil 3 ODS-3; Varian, Palo Alto, CA) and a mobile phase containing: 75 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 mM citric acid, 25 µM EDTA, 100 µl/L tetraethylamine, 2.2 mM octanesulfonic acid sodium salt, 10% acetonitrile, 2% methanol, pH 3.5. DA was oxidized with a coulometric electrode (Model 5014; ESA, Chelmsford, MA), with conditioning cell set to a potential of −150 to −200 mV and the analytical cell set to a potential of 350 mV. The concentration of DA and its metabolites was quantified using an external standard curve from standards prepared in the same aCSF/preservative mixture as the brain dialysates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>PAG protein determination</title><p>Protein analysis was performed using the Simon Simple Western assay (ProteinSimple). Hippocampal tissue samples were dissected and homogenized in 100 µL lysis solution. Lysis solution was prepared by mixing 1 mL of 1x lysis buffer (Cell Signalling Technology, 9803) containing 1 µl calyculin A and 0.5 µl okadaic acid (protein phosphatase inhibitors from Sigma-Aldrich, C5552 and 08010 respectively) and 5 µl of protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, P8340). After homogenization, the lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was transferred to new tubes and frozen at −80°C pending subsequent analysis. Tissue samples were diluted to a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL in ProteinSimple sample buffer. A master mix containing 10x sample buffer, 1M DTT, and 10x fluorescent standard was added to the samples, which were then loaded in the first row of a ProteinSimple cassette. A mixture of two rabbit polyclonal antibodies was loaded in the second row: PAG antiserum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Curthoys et al., 1976</xref>) diluted 1:200 and GAPDH (14C10) (Cell Signalling Technology, 2118S; AB Registry ID: AB_2107301) diluted 1:25. The luminol-S/peroxide chemiluminescent detection mixture was loaded in the third row. Size-based separation, immunoprobing, washing, and detection were done automatically by the Simon, which in an automated sequence drew up the sample mixture, the antibodies, and then the detection reagent into a capillary array. Chemiluminescence was measured along the length of the capillary over time, and analyzed using ProteinSimple Compass software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Behavior</title><sec id="s4-11-1"><title>Motor performance</title><p>A rotarod apparatus (accelerating model; Ugo Basile, Varese, Italy) was used to measure motor learning and coordination. Mice were trained in the accelerating speed mode at 0–20 (Day 1), 0–30 (Day 2), and 0–40 (Day 3) rpm, received three trials per day, and performance was expressed as the time to the first fall.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-2"><title>Novelty-induced locomotion, amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion and sensitization</title><p>Novelty-induced exploration and reactivity to amphetamine were assessed in the open field (Plexiglas activity chambers, 40.6 cm long ×40.6 cm wide × 38.1 cm high; SmartFrame Open Field System, Kinder Scientific, Poway, CA) equipped with infrared detectors to track animal movement. Testing took place under bright ambient light conditions. Novelty-induced activity was recorded for 60 min, after which mice received an i.p. injection of d-amphetamine hemisulfate (Sigma-Aldrich, A5880) or vehicle (saline) and were returned to the open field for 90 min. This protocol was repeated for the amphetamine sensitization studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-3"><title>Anxiety</title><p>Anxiety was measured in an elevated plus maze with two open arms and two closed arms linked by a central platform. Two different size mazes were used, a smaller one with shorter arms (28 cm) and 31 cm above the floor, and a larger one with longer arms (45 cm) and 50 cm above the floor. Mice were put in the center of the maze and allowed to explore for 5 min. Behavior was recorded with a video camera located above the maze. In the smaller maze, the time spent in the open arms was scored using TopScan (CleverSys, Reston, VA). In the larger maze, the time spent in the proximal and distal open arms, and the number of entries into the open arms was scored using AnyMaze (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-4"><title>Fear conditioning</title><p>Fear conditioning was assessed in rodent test chambers (20 cm length x 16 cm width x 20.5 cm height; Med Associates, Fairfax, VT), equipped with a ceiling and wall light, a speaker and a grid floor through which mild electrical shocks were delivered. FreezeFrame video tracker (Coulbourn Instruments, Holliston, MA) was used to measure freezing during the 3 phases of the procedure: conditioning (Day 1), tone test (Day 2), and context test (Day 3). The same context was used for Day 1 and 3 (lemon scent, grid floor and metal hall exposed, ceiling light on and wall light off), while a different context was use on Day 2 (cinnamon scent, colored plastic sheets covered the floor and halls, ceiling light off and wall light on). On Day 1, mice received 3 pairings of a tone (CS; 20 s, 80 dB) and shock (US; 1 s, 0.5 mA). On Day 2, the tone CS was delivered twice (for 20 s at 120 and 200 s after the start of the session) during a 4 min session in a different context, without the contextual cues associated with the shock US. On Day 3, mice were tested for conditioned fear to the training context during a 4 min session, without the tone CS or shock US. Sessions (4 min) were scored for freezing behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-5"><title>Latent inhibition</title><p>Latent inhibition was assessed in the same test chambers used for fear conditioning. Freezing was monitored during the four phases of the paradigm: pre-exposure and conditioning (Day 1), context test (Day 2) and tone test (Day 3). The preexposure stimulus/conditioned stimulus was an 80 dB tone and the unconditioned stimulus was a 1 s, 0.70 mA shock. Mice were randomly assigned to a non-pre-exposed group (NPE; received 3 CS/US pairings on Day 1) and a pre-exposed group (PE; received 20 CS followed by 3 CS/US pairings on Day 1). On Day 1, 30 min before the behavioral test, mice received clozapine (Sigma-Aldrich C6305, 1.5 mg/kg i.p., dissolved in a mixture of 1.5% DMSO and saline) or vehicle. Clozapine is used as a positive control to demonstrate that the limited number of pre-exposures does not elicit LI and yet are sufficient to reveal potentiation of LI, thereby maximizing the dynamic range of the potentiation. On Day 3, mice were put in a different context to measured freezing to the tone, which was presented for 8 min. The same context was used for Days 1 and 2 (lemon scent, grid floor and metal hall exposed, ceiling light on and wall light off), while a different context was use on Day 3 (anise scent, colored plastic sheets covered the floor and halls, ceiling light off and wall light on). The scent was delivered to the chambers by placing a paper towel dabbed with the scent solution under the chamber floor.</p><p>The LI procedure was conducted over three days:</p><p><italic>Day 1: Preexposure/Conditioning -</italic> Preexposed (PE) mice received 20 presentations of a 30 s tone CS at a variable interstimulus interval of 30 s; while the non-preexposed (NPE) mice were confined to the chamber for an identical period of time without receiving the CS. Conditioning began immediately upon completion of the PE in the same chamber, and comprised 3 tone-shock CS-US pairings, given 3 min apart. Each trial began with the 30 s tone CS; a foot shock immediately followed tone termination. Mice were observed for freezing. After the last pairing, mice remained in the chamber for an additional 5 min.</p><p><italic>Day 2: Context Test</italic> - Mice were tested for conditioned fear of the training context. Mice were placed in the experiment chamber for 8 min and presented with neither tone nor shock and observed for freezing.</p><p><italic>Day 3: Tone Test -</italic> Mice were tested for conditioned fear induced by the tone presentation in absence of the contextual cues associated with shock. Each mouse was placed in the chamber for 12 min. After an acclimatization period of 3 min, the tone CS was delivered for 8 min (no shocks were administered), and mice observed for freezing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Sample size estimation</title><p>Sample size estimates were made using G*Power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Faul et al., 2007</xref>). Sample sizes were calculated using a power of 0.80 and an α of 0.05, as we assumed that a 4:1 ratio between type 1 and type 2 errors was appropriate for all our experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Keppel, 1991</xref> p. 75). The predicted effects sizes were different for the behavioral, electrophysiology/voltammetry, and stereology experiments. Since we were assessing the effects of a conditional heterozygous manipulation, for the behavioral studies we predicted a medium effect size of 0.06 (partial η<sup>2</sup>), which resulted in an estimated sample size range between 17 to 51 mice per group (rotarod = 17; elevated plus maze short arms = 51; novelty-induced locomotion = 22; amphetamine sensitization = 21). After running these first experiments in sequence using samples sizes within the estimated range, we obtained significant F values with effects sizes ranging from 0.06 to 0.15 and a better than predicted power of 0.9, which led us to use smaller samples size in subsequent experiments (elevated plus maze longer arms, acute amphetamine, fear conditioning, latent inhibition). For the electrophysiology and voltammetry studies, which measured the direct effects of the conditional heterozygous manipulation on synaptic release, we predicted an effect size of 0.1, which resulted in an estimated sample size of 12 per group. For the stereology experiments, we estimated a larger effect size of 0.2 based on previous experiments and pilot studies, for a sample size of 4 per group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the stereological estimate of the number of TH<sup>+</sup> only, PAG<sup>+</sup> only and TH<sup>+</sup> / PAG<sup>+</sup> cells in the VTA and SNc of juvenile wild-type mice was analyzed using a 3 (cell type) X 2 (brain region) ANOVA. For the comparison between the relative number of TH<sup>+</sup> / PAG<sup>+</sup> cells in juvenile (P25) and adult (P60) mice, a 2 (age) X 2 (brain region) ANOVA was used. For the single cell RT-PCR data, the Chi-Square test was used to determine whether TH<sup>+</sup> / VGLUT2<sup>+</sup> neurons preferentially expressed PAG.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, comparison of response amplitudes to single photostimulation was analyzed using a 2 (genotype) X 2 (cell type) ANOVA. Comparison between genotypes of first response amplitude to burst photostimulation was done for each cell type separately using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test, since samples were not normally distributed. For the analysis of the amplitude of EPSCs induced by repeated burst photostimulation, data was converted to percent of the first response amplitude and analyzed for each cell type separately using a 2 (genotype) X 4 (pulses, repeated measures factor) ANOVA. Only the results obtained from ChIs revealed a significant genotype X pulses interaction, which led us to conduct further analysis of simple effects involving the non-repeated measures factor (genotype) to detect the source of the interaction. To control for increased family-wise type 2 errors due to multiple comparisons, we applied the Bonferroni correction for simple effects and using α = 0.0125. Finally, the analysis of the ratio of firing during burst (0–0.5 s from onset of train) and just after burst photostimulation (0.5–1 s from onset) was done using a one-way ANOVA.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, genotypic differences in numbers of TH<sup>+</sup> neurons, DA content and DOPAC/DA ratio values were evaluated with one-way ANOVAs. For voltammetry data, the peak amplitude of DA release evoked by consecutive bursts of photostimulation followed by a single, or consecutive single pulses followed by burst, was analyzed using a 2 (genotype) x 4 (pulses, repeated measures factor) ANOVA.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the latency to fall from the rotarod was analyzed using a 2 (genotype) x 9 (trials, repeated measures factor) ANOVA. Locomotor counts in the open field were analyzed using a 2 (genotype) x 6 (time, bins of 10 mins, repeated measures factor) ANOVA. Behavior in the elevated plus maze and fear conditioning chambers was analyzed using a one-way ANOVA to evaluate genotypic effects. Dose effects in amphetamine-induced locomotion were analyzed using a 2 (genotype) x 3 (dose) ANOVA.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, for the sensitization experiment, locomotor activity during the first 2 habituation days (vehicle injections) was analyzed separately using a 2 (genotype) x 2 (drug treatment) x 2 (days, repeated measure factor) ANOVA. Locomotor activity during the subsequent 5 test days (vehicle or amphetamine injections) was analyzed using a 2 (genotype) x 2 (drug treatment) x 5 (days, repeated measure factor) ANOVA. A significant three-way interaction was further analyzed for simple effects. Within each drug treatment, a 2 (genotype) x 5 (days, repeated measure factor) ANOVA was used. Only within the amphetamine-treated groups was there a significant genotype X day interaction, which allowed us to conduct a further analysis of simple effects involving the non-repeated measures factor (genotype). Comparisons during the last 3 days of injections were corrected by a Bonferroni adjustment (α = 0.016). The data from the challenge day were analyzed separately using a 2 (genotype) X 2 (drug treatment) ANOVA. In addition, data obtained during the 90 min following injections was analyzed separately for each amphetamine- and vehicle-treated group using a 2 (genotype) x 9 (time, bins of 10 min, repeated measure factor) ANOVA.</p><p>For the latent inhibition experiment (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), freezing before CS presentation was analyzed separately for each genotype using a 2 (preexposure treatment) X 2 (time, bins of 1 min, repeated measure factor) ANOVA. After CS presentation data were analyzed using a 2 (preexposure treatment) X 8 (time, bins of 1 min, repeated measure factor) ANOVA. A significant preexposure X time interaction was found for DAT GLS1 cHET mice, allowing us to examine simple effects. The multiple comparisons for each 1 min time bin after CS presentation were corrected by a Bonferroni adjustment (α = 0.006). The data for total amount of freezing during the CS were analyzed using a 2 (genotype) X 2 (preexposure treatment) ANOVA. We found a significant genotype X preexposure interaction, allowing us to explore further the source of the interaction within each genotype using one-way ANOVAs.</p><p>A few mice were removed from experiments because of procedural errors (mice were put in the wrong treatment group, or tested in the wrong operant box).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Shannon Wolfman, Celia Gellman, Benjamin Inbar, Lauren Rosko, Karin Krueger, Leora Boussi and Sophia Tepler for technical assistance, Eugene Mosharov, Se Joon Choi, Hadassah Tamir, Benjamin Klein and David Hirschberg for advice, Norman Curthoys for glutaminase antisera, and Theresa Swayne in The Confocal and Specialized Microscopy Shared Resource of the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center at Columbia University, supported by NIH grant P30 CA013696.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Sacha B Nelson, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Veronica Alvarez (Reviewer).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors address the role of glutamatergic cotransmission in dopamine (DA) neurons using an elegant genetic approach that minimizes developmental effects and compensation and primarily affects transmission at high rates (DATcre driven deletion of the glutamate recycling enzyme Gls1). This manipulation does not affect DA neuron function or DA neuron dependent behaviors in multiple assays, but does affect amphetamine sensitization and latent inhibition; two behavioral phenotypes linked to human psychosis and animal models of schizophrenia. Strikingly, deletion of this enzyme in forebrain glutamatergic neurons does not produce either phenotype. Although a prior paper from this group showed some of the behavioral effects demonstrated here in a global manipulation of Gls1, the present results are especially significant as they provide a potential pathophysiological unification of dopaminergic and glutamatergic theories of schizophrenia.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers agreed that the paper would be improved if the impact of the genetic manipulation on co-transmission were assessed at an intermediate frequency (between 0.1 and 20 Hz) that more closely resembles the tonic firing of DA neurons in vivo (e.g. 2-5 Hz). However, after discussion, the reviewers agreed that this point could potentially be handled by softening the conclusion that it is burst and not tonic firing that is responsible and increasing discussion of this point. However, it was felt that including these data would be strengthen the paper even if the result were somewhat intermediate between effects at 0.1 and 20 Hz (especially given the vagaries of relating frequencies of optogenetic stimulation in vitro to firing frequencies in vivo).</p><p>2) One of the reviewers was concerned that subtle changes in DA release, perhaps occurring only during sensitization, would not have been detected and could contribute to the observed behavioral results. Further discussion between the reviewers suggested that effectively ruling out this possibility experimentally would be difficult, but that it should be discussed.</p><p>3) The reviewers raised a number of additional concerns and desires for clarification which are not strictly &quot;minor&quot; but which should require only textual changes in the manuscript. These are listed below.</p><p>Additional points:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The Discussion would benefit from a few additional sentences about the significance of the findings for theories of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia aimed at the general reader, particularly as they result to prior studies on Gls1 loss of function and to the relationship between theories emphasizing the roles of dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems in schizophrenia.</p><p>&quot;schizophrenia resilience phenotype&quot; is a rather specialized term that should be explained for the general reader earlier in the manuscript.</p><p>&quot;cHET&quot; should be defined the first time (or two) it is used – even though HET is clearly defined.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>1) Is the pause in Chl firing reduced in duration in DAT GLS1 HET mice? Can this be quantified? It seems like it in the example and I wonder whether this is a consequence of less excitation or less DA mediated inhibition. The study later shows no difference in evoked DA transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) which might say it is not due to changes in DA mediated signaling but it could be confirmed if there is reduction in the duration.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. The example voltammogram shows that the oxidation current peaks at 400 mV, however, the dopamine oxidation peak is near 600 mV. Is this an issue of electrode offset?</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-B</xref>. In the amphetamine sensitization figure, the data on the vehicle day before the challenge is mentioned in the text but it is not shown in the figure. It is the only data missing and it would be important to display it in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> to emphasize that the contextual conditioned response.

However, after discussion, the reviewers agreed that this point could potentially be handled by softening the conclusion that it is burst and not tonic firing that is responsible and increasing discussion of this point. However, it was felt that including these data would be strengthen the paper even if the result were somewhat intermediate between effects at 0.1 and 20 Hz (especially given the vagaries of relating frequencies of optogenetic stimulation in vitro to firing frequencies in vivo).</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for making this important point. We agree that examining the effects of an intermediate stimulation frequency to support the conclusion of a selective effect on phasic, and not on tonic, firing would be informative. However, this would introduce a considerable delay, as it would require breeding a new cohort of mice (minimum 10 of each genotype) and then comparing directly 5 Hz stimulation with 20 Hz stimulation. The comparison between 0.1 and 20 Hz made in the current manuscript, highlights the frequency dependence of GLS1 effects, in agreement with previous reports that PAG plays a crucial role in recycling glutamate during sustained activity (Billups et al., 2013; Gaisler-Salomon et al., 2009; Masson et al., 2006; Tani et al., 2014). For this reason, we have modified the manuscript to soften the argument that the effect was selective to phasic firing and emphasize the frequency-dependent effect of the PAG reduction. We have taken “phasic” out of the title. These alterations do not affect the main conclusion or implications of our findings regarding the function of dopamine neuron GLU cotransmission and schizophrenia, but do leave the determination of the specific role of phasic GLU cotransmission for future study.</p><p><italic>2) One of the reviewers was concerned that subtle changes in DA release, perhaps occurring only during sensitization, would not have been detected and could contribute to the observed behavioral results. Further discussion between the reviewers suggested that effectively ruling out this possibility experimentally would be difficult, but that it should be discussed.</italic></p><p>We appreciate this important point. Our data indicate that DA neuron DA signaling is unaffected in DAT GLS1 cHETS, at baseline, prior to amphetamine administration. Changes in DA signaling are likely to parallel the more modest sensitization seen in the DAT GLS1 cHETS, and in future studies this would be very interesting to examine. To make this point clearer, we have included the following Discussion:</p><p>“DA signaling increases with psychostimulant sensitization {Vezina, 2004, 827-39; Bocklisch, 2013, 1521-1525; Covey, 2014, 200-210}. […] While subsequent circuit effects impacted by reduced GLU cotransmission involve DA signaling, we show here for the first time that the attenuation of GLU cotransmission in the absence of developmental alterations and direct effects on DA transmission has strong and selective behavioral effects, revealing a new mechanism through which DA neurons control behavior.”</p><p><italic>3) The reviewers raised a number of additional concerns and desires for clarification which are not strictly &quot;minor&quot; but which should require only textual changes in the manuscript. These are listed below.</italic></p><p><italic>Additional points:</italic></p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>The Discussion would benefit from a few additional sentences about the significance of the findings for theories of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia aimed at the general reader, particularly as they result to prior studies on Gls1 loss of function and to the relationship between theories emphasizing the roles of dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems in schizophrenia.</italic></p><p>We have extended the Discussion on the significance of our findings for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia:</p><p>“In the context of schizophrenia, the behaviors affected in DAT GLS1 cHETs align with the schizophrenia resilience phenotype of stopGLS1 HET {Gaisler-Salomon, 2009, 2305-2322}, as well as ΔGLS1 HET mice, both with a global GLS1 heterozygous reduction. […] This inconsistency would be reconciled if increased activity in the VTA and NAc in SCZ is associated with a pathological increase in GLU cotransmission with less of an increase in DA transmission.”.</p><p><italic>&quot;schizophrenia resilience phenotype&quot; is a rather specialized term that should be explained for the general reader earlier in the manuscript.</italic></p><p>We added the following to the Introduction:</p><p>“The global heterozygous <italic>GLS1</italic> reduction impacts several DA dependent behaviors that underpin a schizophrenia resilience phenotype {Gaisler-Salomon, 2009, 2305-2322}, characterized by an attenuated response to psychostimulant challenge, potentiated latent inhibition, procognitive effects {Hazan, 2014, 1916-1924}, together with CA1 hippocampal hypoactivity inverse to the CA1 hyperactivity seen in patients with schizophrenia {Schobel, 2009, 938-946; Gaisler-Salomon, 2009, 1037-1044}. Genetic mutations engendering resilience carry strong therapeutic valence as they directly identify therapeutic targets {Mihali, 2012, 785-799}.”</p><p><italic>&quot;cHET&quot; should be defined the first time (or two) it is used – even though HET is clearly defined.</italic></p><p>cHET is now clearly defined in the Introduction:</p><p>“Here we show in DAT GLS1 conditional heterozygous (cHET) mice – with a DAT-driven- GLS1 reduction – that DA neuron GLU cotransmission is reduced in a frequency dependent manner, without affecting DA neuron development or DA release, and that behaviors that rely on the motivational salience-encoding function of DA neurons are selectively affected, with implications of DA neuron GLU cotransmission for schizophrenia pharmacotherapy.”</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Is the pause in Chl firing reduced in duration in DAT GLS1 HET mice? Can this be quantified? It seems like it in the example and I wonder whether this is a consequence of less excitation or less DA mediated inhibition. The study later shows no difference in evoked DA transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) which might say it is not due to changes in DA mediated signaling but it could be confirmed if there is reduction in the duration.</italic></p><p>In agreement with our previous report (Chuhma et al., 2014), we found that train photostimulation of DA terminals induces burst firing of ChIs followed by a reduction or pause in firing. To show the effect of the GLS1 reduction on the post-burst reduction in firing frequency, we added a color-table to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> showing all the responses, confirming the lack of genotypic effect during the post-burst interval. The updated Results now read:</p><p>“In the subsequent half-second window, the firing ratio reversed to below baseline in CTRL (0.6 ± 0.08) and cHETs (0.7 ± 0.11), which did not differ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, right). […] Thus, PAG plays an important role in sustaining DA neuron GLU cotransmission at higher firing frequencies and determines their ability to drive Chls to fire in bursts.”</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. The example voltammogram shows that the oxidation current peaks at 400 mV, however, the dopamine oxidation peak is near 600 mV. Is this an issue of electrode offset?</italic></p><p>Yes, and we added a sentence to the methods FSCV section to clarify this issue:</p><p>&quot;The apparent DA oxidation peak in response to the applied triangle wave in cyclic voltammetry is determined by the pipette offset of the amplifier, which is used to correct for resistance between the ground and carbon fiber electrodes. In this study, we made no pipette offset adjustment, which decreased the instances that the current signal overloaded the amplifier. However, the DA oxidation peak, which is normally reported at ~+600 mV with a typical offset of ~+150 mV, was left shifted and occurred at ~+400 mV without an offset. We found in calibrations that the absence of pipette offset did not affect the peak amplitude of the DA response.&quot;</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-B</xref>. In the amphetamine sensitization figure, the data on the vehicle day before the challenge is mentioned in the text but it is not shown in the figure. It is the only data missing and it would be important to display it in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> to emphasize that the contextual conditioned response. On that note, the locomotor counts double in the control mice so it seems unfair to describe the context response as &quot;very small&quot;.</italic></p><p>When we mentioned that it was a “very small” response, this was in comparison to the amphetamine challenge response. This effect is probably due to the fact that drug-induced conditioned responses tend to be smaller when mice are tested in a familiar context (Crombag et al., 2001). Mice were exposed to the open field for 2 days (3 hours per day) for the two initial vehicle injections prior to the start of the amphetamine injections, so the novelty of the open field was dramatically reduced and consequently the strength of the conditioned response. To show this data, we have added the vehicle challenge data to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, both for the DAT GLS1 cHET mice and EMX1 GLS1 cHET mice, and changed the Results to include:</p><p>“The vehicle challenge revealed a modest but significant conditioned response in the Amph-treated groups.”</p><p>The statistical analysis is now reported in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> caption.</p><p><italic>4) On that same topic of the context conditioned response, the stats show no interaction or effect of genotype but the response to the amphetamine paired context seems also smaller in the HET in proportion to the vehicle treated group of each genotype. I wonder how the comparison would result if performed like in 6C but with a graph for each genotype comparing the locomotor response in the vehicle day for vehicle- and amphetamine-pretreated mice. If not significant different for the HET mice, a poor context-conditioned response can account in part for the difference seen in the amphetamine challenge day.</italic></p><p>We analyzed the vehicle challenge day as was done for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>. A repeated measures ANOVA for the Veh-treated mice show no main effect of genotype (F<sub>(1,34)</sub>=0.454, p=0.51) or significant interaction (F<sub>(4.5,320)</sub>=1.578, p=0.176), but a main effect of time (F<sub>(4.5,320)</sub>=13.358, p&lt;0.001). For the Amph-treated mice, we found similar results, no main effect of genotype (F<sub>(1,40)</sub>=0.052, p=0.82) or significant interaction (F<sub>(3.2,320)</sub>=2.058, p=0.103), but a main effect of time (F<sub>(3.2,320)</sub>=34.44, p&lt;0.001). So, cHET did develop a conditioned response after repeated Amph treatment to the same extent as seen in CTRL mice.</p><p><italic>5) It appears like the effect of clozapine on the latent inhibition is occluded in DAT-GLS1 HET mice, or max-up as indicated in the results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>). I would suggest using the term occlusion and also reviewing that sentence because there is an extra misplaced word there. These findings are to the possible mechanism underlying the response of DAt-GLS1 HET mice so I would suggest moving this to the main figure. Also, please add label somewhere to make clear these data are after clozapine injection and it can be helpful to use different symbols to mark the statistical difference or lack of between the panel A and B.</italic></p><p>We have changed the text in the Results regarding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>:</p><p>“To confirm in EMX1 GLS1 cHETs that the limited number of pre-exposures did not elicit LI and yet was sufficient to reveal potentiation of LI, we tested for clozapine-induced potentiation of LI {Gaisler-Salomon, 2009, 2305-2322} (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5A</xref>). […] The lack of further potentiation of LI in ΔGLS1 HET and DAT GLS1 cHET mice suggests that clozapine treatment and GLS1 deficiency in DA neurons each either induce maximal potentiation of LI, or involve shared mechanisms so that GLS1 deficiency occludes clozapine-induced potentiation of LI.”</p><p>We also added a schematic of the latent inhibition protocol in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref> to show the time of administration of the single clozapine dose on Day 1 before the start of the procedure. We prefer to keep this figure as a supplement since the clozapine experiment was done as a positive control to show that EMX1 GLS1 cHET mice given the same number of tone preexposues as the other HET genotypes would show LI potentiation. For both the ΔGLS1 HET and DAT GLS1 cHET mice, the GLS1 deficiency occluded the clozapine effect. It would be challenging to explore the implications of this result further since clozapine acts on multiple receptors and several mechanism could be responsible for the absence of a pharmacological effect. Moreover, the simplest explanation is that there was a floor effect on LI potentiation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>The interpretation that glutamate released during burst firing contributes to amphetamine sensitization is somewhat inconsistent with past work. Several past studies have shown that knockout of NMDA receptors leads to a dramatic reduction in burst firing, but has no effect on cocaine sensitization.</italic></p><p>In relation to the NR1 cKO study of Zweifel et al. (2008), it is interesting that they also reported a reduction in the expression of sensitization very similar to what we observed in DAT GLS1 cHET mice. We now discuss this paper in the Discussion:</p><p>“DAT GLS1 cHET mice do not show sensitization to amphetamine with repeated administration, and after a withdrawal period show reduced expression of sensitization. […] In contrast, DAT NR1 cKO showed a reduction in conditioned responses to context not seen in the present study, suggesting that the abrogation of both DA and GLU phasic transmission must be affected to impact the development of drug-induced conditioned responses.”</p><p><italic>Second, a very recent study tested intracranial self-stimulation in cKOs of VGluT2 in dopamine neurons over many days/sessions and found only very small reduction in self-stimulation enforced place preference (Wang et al., 2017). Please discuss this.</italic></p><p>The Wang et al. (2017) results do not contradict our findings, since we do not think that GLU cotransmission drives reinforcement learning. In relation to this article we have added the following to the Discussion:</p><p>“The temporal precision of the DA neuron GLU signal makes it particularly suitable for updating salience. […] Instead, our behavioral results suggest that DA neuron GLU signals modulate learning by regulating the attribution of motivational salience to relevant events via their direct control over ChI activity.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
