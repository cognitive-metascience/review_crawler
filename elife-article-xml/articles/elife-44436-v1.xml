immunocompetent, small animal model. HCV replication in non-permissive species may be limited by incompatibilities between the viral replication machinery and orthologs of essential host factors, like cyclophilin A (CypA). We thus compared the ability of CypA from mouse, tree shrew, and seven non-human primate species to support HCV replication, finding that murine CypA only partially rescued viral replication in Huh7.5-shRNA CypA cells. We determined the specific amino acid differences responsible and generated mutants able to fully rescue replication. We expressed these mutants in engineered murine hepatoma cells and although we observed increases in HCV replication following infection, they remained far lower than those in highly permissive human hepatoma cells, and minimal infectious particle release was observed. Together, these data suggest additional co-factors remain unidentified. Future work to determine such factors will be critical for developing an immunocompetent mouse model supporting HCV replication.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44436.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Hepatitis C is a life-long disease that begins when a virus infects the cells of the liver. Although the infection is curable, it is expensive to treat, and there is not yet a vaccine to prevent the disease. This is largely because the virus that causes hepatitis C, also known as HCV, naturally only infects humans and chimpanzees, which has made it difficult to generate an effective animal model for developing a vaccine.</p><p>Mice are frequently used as a model for studying disease and can be genetically altered to allow HCV to enter their liver cells. However, once HCV enters mouse cells, it struggles to replicate. As a result, an infection does not develop, and the immune system’s response to the virus cannot be fully explored. Replication of HCV in humans relies on a protein called cyclophilin A, or CypA for short. Now, Gaska et al. have set out to improve current animal models for HCV by investigating whether HCV can also use CypA from other species, including mice, to replicate.</p><p>Gaska et al. showed that the mouse form of CypA could help HCV replicate in human liver cells with lower than normal levels of CypA, but only very poorly. Editing the mouse gene for CypA to be more like the human version resulted in higher HCV replication. Putting variants of CypA into the liver cells of mice, which do not normally replicate HCV at high levels, led to an increase in HCV replication. However, replication of HCV in mice was still far lower than in human liver cells, suggesting that the mouse model system could be improved by learning more about which proteins interact with CypA.</p><p>Injection drug use – one of the main ways hepatitis C spreads – is becoming increasingly common because of the growing opioid epidemic in many countries. A clinically relevant animal model that supports hepatitis C virus infection would be an important milestone towards a vaccine that could prevent the continued spread of this disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Hepatitis C virus</kwd><kwd>species tropism</kwd><kwd>animal model</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Training grant 4T32GM007388-40</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gaska</surname><given-names>Jenna M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>State of New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>New Jersey Commission on Cancer Research DHFS16PPC007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ding</surname><given-names>Qiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI107301</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ploss</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RSG-15-048-01-MPC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ploss</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101539</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ploss</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cancer Institute of New Jersey Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Support Grant P30CA072720</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ploss</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Incompatibilities between the viral replication machinery and orthologs of the essential host factor cyclophilin A (CypA) contribute to the narrow host range of hepatitis C virus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Every year, an estimated 3–4 million individuals become newly infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Westbrook and Dusheiko, 2014</xref>), with 60–80% going on to join the population of approximately 71.1 million who are chronically infected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blach et al., 2017</xref>). A hepatotropic virus, HCV has only been shown to robustly infect in vivo human and chimpanzee hepatocytes. This limited host tropism has proven problematic in developing an animal model that is not only ethically and financially sound but also immunocompetent. Such a model would allow the study of the underlying immunopathogenesis of HCV infection as well as the development and testing of vaccine candidates. Most efforts to generate such an in vivo model have focused on mice, which are amenable to genetic manipulation and have many well-established research tools built around their use.</p><p>Overcoming the natural imperviousness of murine hepatocytes to HCV has required adjustments at multiple stages of the virus life cycle. Barriers at the level of entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McCaffrey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Park et al., 2009</xref>) in murine cells could not be overcome until the identification of the four canonical HCV human entry factors – claudin-1 (CLDN1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Evans et al., 2007</xref>), occludin (OCLN; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ploss et al., 2009</xref>), CD81 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pileri et al., 1998</xref>) and scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SCARB1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Scarselli et al., 2002</xref>). Of these, human CD81 and human OCLN were the minimal factors needed for viral entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ploss et al., 2009</xref>). Alternatively, infecting with HCV adapted to utilize murine CD81 could also successfully overcome this initial obstacle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bitzegeio et al., 2010</xref>). Once inside murine cells, HCV faces another block at the level of replication, which initial studies circumvented through the use of selectable subgenomic HCV replicons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McCaffrey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Park et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Uprichard et al., 2006</xref>). Murine cells did appear to support assembly and release of infectious particles, albeit at low levels, once NS2 and the structural HCV proteins were provided in trans and the murine or human ortholog of the apolipoprotein ApoE was overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Long et al., 2011</xref>). Further efforts to improve HCV replication in a murine context have relied on disruption of innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aly et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anggakusuma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Frentzen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nandakumar et al., 2013</xref>), with robust replication and completion of the HCV life cycle proving difficult following infection unless a selectable genome is used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vogt et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>These poor levels of replication could be due to the lower compatibility of murine orthologs of vital replication host factors with the viral replication machinery or the absence of proteins that normally facilitate these interactions in human cells. Although numerous intracellular host factors have been implicated in HCV replication, extensive experimental evidence has only been provided for three host factors: cyclophilin A (CypA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kaul et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yang et al., 2008a</xref>), phosphatidylinositol four kinase IIIα (PI4KA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Borawski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reiss et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Trotard et al., 2009</xref>) and microRNA-122 (miR-122) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jopling et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lanford et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Machlin et al., 2011</xref>). miR-122 is highly conserved between humans and other species, including mice, making its expression alone unlikely to explain the weak replication of HCV in murine cells. In an effort to systemically dissect the impact of such replication co-factors during infection, we focused in this study on CypA and how it may contribute to the restricted host range of HCV.</p><p>CypA is a cytosolic 18 kDa peptidyl-prolyl <italic>cis-trans</italic> isomerase (PPIase) and a part of the biologically ubiquitous cyclophilin enzyme family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fischer et al., 1989</xref>), the members of which were first characterized in mammals by their common ability to bind the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA) and their shared cyclophilin-like domain (CLD) which catalyzes the <italic>cis-trans</italic> isomerization of proline residues (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marks, 1996</xref>). CypA overexpression has been implicated in a wide variety of human diseases, ranging from cancer to atherosclerosis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nigro et al., 2013</xref>), and it has a demonstrated role in the life cycles of multiple viruses besides HCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Wilde et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Frausto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Phillips et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">von Hahn and Ciesek, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Watashi and Shimotohno, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>). Early work showed that CsA had an inhibitory effect on HCV in chronically infected chimpanzees, but it was not until subsequent in vitro CypA knockdown experiments and dose-response assays with CsA derivatives that CypA was specifically recognized as critical to HCV replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chatterji et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ciesek et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coelmont et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kaul et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yang et al., 2008b</xref>).</p><p>These studies showed that CypA’s relevance to HCV replication was intimately linked to its PPIase activity, as the introduction of point mutations in the PPIase active site led to impaired viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chatterji et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kaul et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2009b</xref>). Individuals exhibiting an HCV non-permissive phenotype were shown to express a rare homozygosity at any of three SNP sites in the coding region of CypA – but not in the enzymatic active site – that subsequent in vitro work showed resulted in markedly decreased levels of intracellular CypA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">von Hahn et al., 2012</xref>). Despite its known importance, the exact mechanism by which CypA facilitates HCV replication remains poorly characterized. Interactions between CypA and several HCV proteins have been demonstrated, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) NS5B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chatterji et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fernandes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Robida et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yang et al., 2008b</xref>), NS5A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Coelmont et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Foster et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grisé et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hanoulle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nag et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Verdegem et al., 2011</xref>) and NS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ciesek et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kaul et al., 2009</xref>), but how CypA’s binding, PPIase activity and the viral polyprotein are precisely intertwined remains to be understood. The specific impact that cross-species differences in CypA might have on HCV replication and the restricted host tropism of this virus remains an open question and one the present study sought to address. Here, we examined the ability of CypA from diverse species, some of which could serve as feasible small animal models for HCV, to facilitate HCV replication. We found that murine CypA, relative to human CypA, is less proficient at facilitating HCV replication due to differences at the amino acid level and that overexpression of human CypA can increase replication in an engineered murine hepatoma line.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ability of diverse CypA orthologs to facilitate HCV replication</title><p>Knowing the critical role of human CypA in facilitating HCV replication, we first examined the conservation of CypA at the amino acid level across diverse species, focusing on those with promise to serve as biomedical research models and/or closely related to humans. As observed in mice, previous in vivo studies have suggested that several non-human primate (NHP) species – including cynomolgus, Japanese, and rhesus macaque; African green monkey; and Chacma and doguera baboons – appear resistant to HCV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bukh et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast, more recent work in vitro demonstrated that primary hepatocytes from rhesus macaques (PRMH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Scull et al., 2015</xref>) as well as hepatocyte-like cells derived from pigtailed macaque induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) could support the HCV life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sourisseau et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, pharmacological-mediated suppression of innate immune responses via Jak inhibition enhanced viral replication in PRMH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Scull et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, albeit with limited evidence, tree shrews have also been demonstrated as a potential platform for studying HCV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amako et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Xie et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xu et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Thus, in the present study we compared the amino acid similarity of CypA from great apes (human, chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, orangutan), Old World monkeys (rhesus macaque, pigtailed macaque, olive baboon), a New World monkey (squirrel monkey), tree shrew, and mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

Cells were transduced with a bicistronic lentivirus to express the CypA ortholog and a GFP-ubiquitin-neomycin resistance (GUN) fusion protein. The bicistronically expressed GFP provides a straightforward means to monitor protein expression indirectly. We deliberately chose not to add an epitope tag onto the different CypA variants to avoid impacting function. The percentage of GFP+ cells as determined by flow cytometry indicated &gt;60% transduction efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). We also assessed protein expression by western blot using two different antibodies with different CypA antigen specificities – commercial antibodies with listed reactivity for human and mouse CypA were available but not for any of the other species under examination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). All the orthologs were readily detected at the expected size of ~17 kDa except for squirrel monkey CypA, the signal for which was &lt;2 times that of the background levels in the nontransduced Huh7.5-shRNA CypA cells, and pigtailed macaque CypA. In the latter case, the TRIM5-CypA fusion protein was expected at ~51 kDa but no signal was observed with either antibody. The transduced cells were subsequently infected with the HCV reporter virus Jc1-Gluc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marukian et al., 2008</xref>) at an MOI of 0.1. Levels of <italic>Gaussia</italic> luciferase in the culture supernatants were thus used as a proxy for assessing HCV replication to compare the rescue efficiencies of the CypA orthologs. As expected, expression of human CypA in Huh7.5-shRNA CypA cells increased HCV replication by more than two logs relative to the non-rescued cells at five days post-infection (dpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Of the orthologs tested, only orangutan CypA, which differs from human CypA by a single amino acid, was capable of rescuing HCV replication at levels similar to human. Compared to human CypA (normalized to 100%), mouse CypA could still facilitate HCV replication but at levels ~3–4% of those observed for human, that is ca. 30-fold decrease. Tupaia CypA, which was well expressed by western blot, did not significantly increase HCV replication above the levels observed in the parental Huh7.5-shRNA CypA cells. It remains possible that the lack of HCV replication in cells transduced with squirrel monkey and pigtailed macaque CypA is due to these proteins not being properly expressed. However, as the transduction efficiency of our constructs expressing pigtailed macaque and squirrel monkey CypA was robust and we were able to detect all other CypA variants utilized in this study by western blot, it is more likely that the antibody reactivity for these two specific orthologs is weaker.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identifying the amino acid basis for the decreased ability of mouse CypA to facilitate HCV replication</title><p>As known blocks in the viral life cycle at the level of entry have been well characterized in murine hepatocytes, we aimed to further understand how murine CypA might affect viral replication. Thus, still in a human context, we sought to determine how the six amino acid differences between murine and human CypA contributed to the decreased ability of murine CypA to facilitate HCV replication in Huh7.5-shRNA CypA cells. ‘Murinized’ human CypA and ‘humanized’ murine CypA mutants were generated whereby each of the six differing amino acids were changed one at a time to their murine or their human counterpart, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), and transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) as well as CypA expression confirmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). None of these differences fell in the CsA-binding site of CypA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Human CypA was more sensitive to changes in the amino acid sequence, with significant decreases in rescue efficiency for all single residue changes tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Mouse CypA demonstrated a greater ability to facilitate HCV replication, at least in a human cell context, when either residues 12, 14, 52 or 76 were altered, with levels of replication comparable to those observed in the presence of human CypA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). As three of the residues that differ between mouse and human CypA are clustered together (residues 11, 12 and 14), we also constructed and tested mutants triply ‘humanized’ or ‘murinized’ at these positions. Indeed, we observed a striking reversal of phenotype for both constructs, with ‘humanized’ murine CypA able to rescue HCV replication at levels comparable to human and vice versa for ‘murinized’ human CypA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44436.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Characterizing the amino acid basis for the differing efficiencies of murine and human CypA in HCV replication.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic depicting the humanized murine CypA and murinized human CypA constructs tested.

In the United States alone over the past decade, there has been a more than 133% increase in acute HCV incidence, which is strongly associated with the domestic opioid epidemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zibbell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zibbell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zibbell et al., 2015</xref>). Even with treatment, which has its own financial and logistical limitations, reinfection can still occur and is likely among high-risk individuals such as injection drug users and HIV-positive men who have sex with men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Falade-Nwulia and Sulkowski, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hill et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Salazar-Vizcaya et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, HCV research is still greatly needed and immunocompetent models necessary more than ever for vaccine development.</p><p>Due to the limited host range of HCV, research has focused on finding an immunocompetent small animal model without the financial and ethical restrictions associated with chimpanzees. At the heart of such research is understanding the basic virology and host restrictions of HCV, chipping away at the known barriers to the viral life cycle in a murine context such as at the level of entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ding et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dorner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ploss et al., 2009</xref>) and viral particle assembly and release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Frentzen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Long et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vogt et al., 2013</xref>). Viral replication in murine cells has consistently been low, and increasing replication has relied on selectable subgenomic replicons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Long et al., 2011</xref>) or disrupting cell-intrinsic antiviral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aly et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anggakusuma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Frentzen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Long et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nandakumar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vogt et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, to observe even low levels of HCV replication in vivo using transgenic mouse models, blunting of innate immune signaling is also needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dorner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vogt et al., 2013</xref>). Although the entire HCV life cycle can be completed with robust replication in xenorecipient mice engrafted with human or stem cell-derived hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bissig et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Jong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kosaka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mercer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Meuleman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tesfaye et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Washburn et al., 2011</xref>), the immunocompromised nature of these mice precludes studying immune responses.</p><p>It may not be possible to completely close this gap between levels of HCV replication in human versus other small animal model hepatocytes, but we sought to determine how species-specific differences in CypA – one of the few host factors experimentally validated as essential for viral replication – might contribute to these observed differences. We argue that such work has an impact on the development of an immunocompetent small animal model for studying HCV infection, which remains a critical need.</p><p>In the present study, we assessed the ability of CypA orthologs from a variety of species to support HCV replication in a human context. Besides chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, olive baboon and rhesus macaque, which are 100% identical to human CypA at the amino acid level, all the remaining orthologs tested varied from hCypA by no more than six amino acids. Recent work has shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms in the hCypA gene can abrogate HCV infection in primary human hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">von Hahn et al., 2012</xref>). The ability of these single missense mutations in the hCypA coding sequence to dramatically reduce HCV replication lent credence to the possibility that the small number of amino acid differences that differentiate hCypA from the orthologs we tested might have important functional significance in the context of HCV replication. In our system, the only other unique CypA ortholog able to rescue HCV replication during infection with Jc1-Gluc to the same extent as human was orangutan, which differs by only one amino acid.</p><p>Tree shrew, pigtailed macaque and squirrel monkey CypA did not significantly increase replication compared to the non-transduced Huh7.5-shRNA CypA cells. Although we were not able to robustly detect squirrel monkey CypA and observed no signal for the pigtailed macaque TRIM5-CypA fusion protein by western blot, these two orthologs could still be expressed as commercial antibodies with confirmed specificity for these two orthologs are not available. This is especially pertinent as the antibodies we used had listed specificity for human and/or mouse. Compared to CypA from these two species, the pigtailed macaque and squirrel monkey orthologs differed by multiple residues that could impact antibody binding. Tree shrew CypA was readily detected with either of the two antibodies tested, so its failure to rescue HCV replication is more conclusive. It is important to underscore that our observations for tree shrew (and for squirrel monkey and pigtailed macaque if they are in fact expressed) do not mean that this species could not support HCV replication if its CypA ortholog was expressed in its native cellular environment. The amino acid differences in CypA might be best suited for interaction with species-specific factors for which the human ortholog is not an apt replacement. Indeed, recent work has demonstrated that HCV can replicate efficiently in pigtailed macaque stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells after overcoming the CD81- and OCLN-related barriers to viral entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sourisseau et al., 2013</xref>), although whether the TRIM5-CypA fusion tested here was expressed in these particular cells is unknown. Likewise, rhesus macaque primary hepatocytes were also shown to support HCV infection in vitro and in vivo, albeit only at low levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Scull et al., 2015</xref>). Of course, it is still possible that a given CypA ortholog, even in its native context, would fail to properly interact directly with the necessary HCV proteins to facilitate replication. For example, the T73I difference between human and squirrel monkey CypA (if indeed expressed) could have a meaningful impact on such interactions as it is adjacent to G72, one of the CsA-binding residues.</p><p>In contrast, murine CypA was the only other ortholog that demonstrated some ability to rescue HCV replication. This was especially striking as mouse was the most evolutionarily distant species we examined and the murine CypA ortholog had the most differences in amino acid sequence compared to human. As we tested, this was not due to a dominant negative effect of murine CypA on replication as HCV could still replicate efficiently in the presence of both human and murine CypA. Thus, we created a series of mutants where we interchanged the six differing residues between human and mouse CypA. We were able to confirm expression of these mutants by western blot with at least one of the antibodies we tested. We cannot adequately control for the varying antibody reactivity, so comparing the expression of different CypA constructs with each other is difficult as lower <italic>detected</italic> expression could indicate lower antibody reactivity. This is highlighted by the differences between the two antibodies we tested, with one indicating a more than 100-fold higher expression for a CypA variant compared to the non-transduced Huh7.5-shRNA CypA cells while the other antibody reached only 20-fold. Since we could detect all of the CypA mutants by western blot, expressed them all in the same backbone construct, and observed high transduction efficiency, conceivably all the transduced cells would be able to express at least some level of the CypA variant.</p><p>Of the six amino acids differing between the two orthologs, single ‘humanization’ of mCypA residues 12, 14, 52, and 76 had the greatest impact, resulting in increased rescue. Conversely, ‘murinization’ of hCypA residues led to significant decreases in rescue ability across all residues tested. Strikingly, simultaneously altering the three residues clustered together that differed between human and mouse (positions 11, 12 and 14) resulted in a gain-of-function phenotype for murine CypA and a loss-of-function phenotype for human CypA. The gain-of-function phenotype was not further exacerbated in the triply humanized murine CypA by introducing the S52C mutation as well, which as a single mutant had shown rescue efficiency similar to the individual mutants at positions 12 and 14. None of the differences between human and mouse CypA, or indeed for any of the CypA orthologs, overlapped with residues of the active site/CsA-binding site of CypA, which as further described below has been characterized as important for interaction with HCV proteins. This raises the intriguing possibility that this cluster of three residues plays a role in maintaining these interactions with the HCV replication machinery and/or associating with host factors that help facilitate such interactions. The location of the three residues on the face of the protein opposite the CsA-binding/active site makes it unclear whether changing these residues leads to a loss of PPIase activity that would explain the accompanying change in phenotype. Identifying these potential conformational changes and/or host factors would provide novel insights into the still unclear mechanism of action by which CypA promotes HCV replication.</p><p>Furthermore, we tested in our system the impact of mouse, human or triply humanized mouse CypA on infectious particle production and viral spread over time. Even though spread over time was not detectable by NS5A staining in the murine CypA rescue cells, the more sensitive luminometry assay still demonstrated infectious particles were being released into the supernatant. Thus, in our system, the HCV life cycle is still being completed and the virus able to propagate beyond the cells initially infected with the inoculum.</p><p>Although informative, these findings were all in the context of a human cell and thus whether or not this ‘humanization’ of mCypA would have the same effect in murine cells was unclear. In the same vein, it was not known if exogenous expression of human CypA in a murine context would boost HCV replication. As briefly alluded to above, there have been numerous efforts to engineer murine cells for studying HCV. Previous efforts using subgenomic replicons indicated replication could occur in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) at least to some extent and could be enhanced with the addition of miR-122 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jopling et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin et al., 2010</xref>) and deletion of IRF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin et al., 2010</xref>). Hep56.1D cells also support replication of subgenomic replicons and infectious particle release was achieved by using a selectable replicon with HCV core, E1, E2, p7 and NS2 provided in trans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Long et al., 2011</xref>). The low levels of infectious particle release initially observed could be further increased by expressing either murine or human ApoE (endogenous expression in Hep56.1D cells is low). However, in this same study, replication of transfected full-length genomes (selectable or non-selectable) was poor. Replication of subgenomic replicons was also enhanced in murine liver tumor (MLT) cells with the addition of miR-122 and disruption of IFN receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anggakusuma et al., 2015</xref>) or in MEFs with blunted innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nandakumar et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, replication of full-length HCV RNA following transfection in primary murine hepatocytes remained low unless MAVS, IRF1 or IFNAR — all important players in cell-intrinsic antiviral responses — were knocked out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aly et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nandakumar et al., 2013</xref>). Transfecting full-length genomes into MAVS<sup>-/-</sup> MLT cells expressing miR-122 and the human HCV entry factors resulted in robust replication and infectious particle production; however, in performing infections, replication declined and infectious particle release fell below background levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Frentzen et al., 2014</xref>). The only instance of viral infection in murine cells where strong replication and particle production were demonstrated relied on the use of a blasticidin-selectable genome (Jc1-bsd) in immortalized Stat1 knockout MEFs (iMEFs) expressing the human HCV entry factors, miR-122 and mApoE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vogt et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Unlike these previous efforts, we wanted to focus on the replication of a non-selectable, full-length genome during infection without exogenous disruption of cellular immune responses as this is most immediately relevant and critical for generating a successful HCV animal model. Towards this aim, we engineered murine Hep56.1D hepatoma cells to express a variety of factors to overcome the various blocks at the level of entry and replication. These so-called Clone 8 cells demonstrated sustained de novo replication compared to the parental Hep56.1D cells, regardless of whether mApoE was present. Addition of murine CypA resulted in a further increase in replication that was even greater for human CypA. The phenotypes of the triple mutants in this murine context were the reverse of those observed in Huh7.5-shRNA CypA cells, suggesting that the mechanism by which these mutants function could depend to some extent on the species specificity of the cellular environment, which will be an interesting area for future study.</p><p>In spite of the elevated replication and presence of mApoE in our Clone 8 cells, infectious particle production was not even a log greater than the parental Hep56.1D cells. This is similar to previous observations that when infecting humanized, MAVS<sup>-/-</sup> MLTs with full-length genomes, infectious particle release is negligible and viral replication lower compared to transfecting in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Frentzen et al., 2014</xref>). This raises the question of whether viral replication must be enhanced further in order to achieve greater viral release and/or packaging or whether factors directly important to these final steps of the viral life cycle are still missing. The evidence that infection with selectable HCVcc, so that the population is made up of cells containing HCV genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vogt et al., 2013</xref>), results in efficient particle release as does transfecting in RNA to ‘hit’ more cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Frentzen et al., 2014</xref>) suggests the former. However, in both of these cases, it is unclear how much blunting the innate immune response additionally contributed to these observations. Furthermore, if there is (a) murine factor(s) that is having an inhibitory effect on particle release, as observed for murine tetherin’s block of HIV-1 particle release due to its resistance to Vpu-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McNatt et al., 2009</xref>), more viral replication may be required to overcome this. The luciferase assay we used is extremely sensitive, capturing even low levels of replication that may simply be insufficient for robust infectious particle production. To enhance replication, other (co-)factors/adaptors may be necessary to facilitate the interactions of CypA and are simply missing in murine cells or are incompatible orthologs of such factors. As observed for PI4KA, it is also possible that the effects of CypA we observe in the hepatoma lines tested may differ in a primary hepatocyte context and/or with the use of patient HCV isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Harak et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Understanding the mechanistic basis for the differences we observed in the respective rescue abilities of the CypA orthologs and mutants we tested remains an important area for future research. Indeed, these mutants may prove useful for delineating both the direct and indirect interactions necessary for robust HCV replication. Extensive study of human CypA has determined interactions with multiple HCV proteins. A connection between CypA and the HCV RdRp is evidenced by mutations in NS5B linked to CsA resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fernandes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Robida et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yang et al., 2008a</xref>) and indications that NS5B can bind at the CypA active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chatterji et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yang et al., 2008a</xref>), which might enhance the viral protein's RNA-binding capcacity as a result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nag et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The interaction of CypA with the HCV phosphoprotein NS5A is far better characterized. Mutations specifically in domain 2 of NS5A were linked to CsA treatment resistance among patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Goto et al., 2009</xref>). CypA stably binds NS5A and this interaction is dependent on the protein’s PPIase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chatterji et al., 2010b</xref>), which promotes the isomerization of multiple conserved proline residues in domains II and III of NS5A, contributing to the protein’s proper folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coelmont et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Foster et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grisé et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hanoulle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Verdegem et al., 2011</xref>). As with NS5B, CypA is also believed to promote the RNA-binding capacity of NS5A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nag et al., 2012</xref>). Upon inhibition of CypA activity, lipid and protein trafficking patterns associated with the formation of lipid droplets and the VLDL synthesis pathway are altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2011</xref>). This has led to the hypothesis that CypA might facilitate the trafficking and assembly function of NS5A, which is known to localize to lipid droplets during the assembly of progeny virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nag et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, whether CypA expression or just its PPIase activity is inhibited, formation of double membrane vesicles (DMVs) – a prevalent component of the membranous web derived from the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) which serves as scaffolding for viral genome replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Paul et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Romero-Brey et al., 2012</xref>) – is abrogated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chatterji et al., 2015</xref>). A portion of host CypA is already localized to ER compartments, which could be advantageous for later HCV replication complex formation in these same regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chatterji et al., 2010a</xref>). Within these DMVs, HCV replication complexes can then more safely assemble outside of the purview of host nucleic acid sensors and other defenses. Indeed, treatment of infected cells with cyclophilin inhibitors leads to changes in the ER that temporarily prevent re-infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chatterji et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, an interaction between CypA and the viral assembly factor and protease NS2 has also been suggested, perhaps impacting the cleavage of NS2 from NS3 by the NS2-NS3 protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ciesek et al., 2009</xref>) and/or the overall proteolytic processing of the HCV polyprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kaul et al., 2009</xref>). It will be important to determine if the mutants and orthologs we examined here maintain or disrupt these known interactions or instead participate in novel, undocumented interactions.</p><p>In this study, we focused on the contribution of CypA to the host restriction of HCV, but undertaking these same experiments with the other well-described HCV replication factor PI4KA is also of great interest. The percent amino acid similarity between human PI4KA and its orthologs in the species we examined in this study is lower compared to CypA, ranging from 83.8% (chimpanzee) to 99.5% (rhesus macaque) for PI4KA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) versus 97–100% for CypA. However, assessing the PI4KA orthologs for all of these species is challenging, as a strong candidate for a PI4KA ortholog is either absent for a given species (i.e. tree shrew) or is a possible ortholog by our own sequence homology search but not formally annotated (i.e. gorilla and bonobo). Some annotations for a predicted PI4KA ortholog are also more than 100 amino acids shorter than that of human, which is 2102 amino acids. Thus, determining the ‘true’ PI4KA ortholog for a given species requires additional corroboration.</p><p>The engineered murine hepatoma line we have generated will serve as a ready platform for testing the potential of additional human factors or humanized murine factors to increase the replication capacity of HCV in these cells. If augmentation of viral replication is seen in vitro, genetic engineering approaches could be utilized to generate mice expressing these human orthologs or ‘humanized’ alleles . Such genetic humanization approaches would finally create the possibility to study HCV infection and pathogenesis in an immunocompetent small animal model, informing future vaccine development and testing.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

RNA was electroporated into Huh7.5.1 cells The pellet was resuspended in the appropriate volume of cold DPBS to achieve a concentration of 1.5E7 cells/mL. 6E6 cells were then electroporated in a 2 mm path length electroporation cuvette (BTX Harvard Apparatus; Holliston, MA) with 5 µg of viral RNA using an ECM 830 Square Wave Electroporation System (BTX) at the following settings: five pulses, 99 µs per pulse, 1.1 s pulse intervals, 860V. Following a ten-minute incubation at room temperature, the electroporated cells were seeded into p150s and maintained in 5% FBS DMEM. Media was changed one day post-electroporation, and supernatants were collected daily for six days and stored at 4°C. The pooled supernatants were passed through a 0.22 µm vacuum filter and subsequently concentrated to ~100 mL in an EMD Millipore Stirred Cell (Cole-Parmer). The TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reed and Muench, 1938</xref>) of concentrated virus was determined after one freeze-thaw by limiting dilution assay.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Analysis of HCV infection by NS5A staining and luminometry</title><p>HCV infections of Clone 8 cells and CypA rescue experiments were conducted in a 24 well format with 3E4 cells seeded per well 12 hr pre-infection.

Shown here are the membranes after exposure to different combinations of antibodies, with the column on the left all images of one membrane and the column on the right images of the second. Whether the bands observed in a given set of membranes originated from the goat, mouse or both secondary antibodies is delineated at the left of each row. The proteins represented by the bands are also labeled, with ‘(M)’ and ‘(R)’ indicating signal from anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary, respectively. The blots shown in (A) were incubated with the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-GFP (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technologies #2956S), mouse anti-β-actin (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technologies, #3700), and rabbit anti-CypA (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technologies #2175S). These blots were stripped and re-probed in (B) with the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-GFP (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technolgoies #2956S), rabbit anti-β-actin (1:1000, 4970S), and mouse anti-CypA (1:1000, AbCam, Ab58144). Note that for more accurate quantification, the β-actin and CypA antibodies used in (B) were raised in different host species from those in (A) so that the residual signal left on the membrane from the first probing could be distinguished. For (A), the signal from the anti-rabbit secondary was used to quantify the CypA bands and that from the anti-mouse secondary for β-actin. For (B), the signal from the anti-mouse secondary was used to quantify the CypA bands and that from the anti-rabbit secondary for β-actin. The quantifications for these bands are shown in the respective Figure Supplements for the experiments where each construct was used. The source of the protein lysate run in each lane and size of the expected bands is listed in (C) in accordance with the numbers listed at the top of each membrane.</p></caption><media

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers including Frank Kirchhoff as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Dr. Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Shirit Einav (Reviewer #2) and Philippe Gallay (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Gaska and colleagues analyzed the role of the virus-dependency factor cyclophilin A (CypA) in the narrow host range of Hepatitis C virus (HCV). They show that CypA orthologs from most species investigated including mice only partially (30%) rescued Jc1-Gluc HCV replication in human CypA-knockdown Huh7.5-shRNA CypA cells compared to human CypA (100%). They further show that humanizing&quot; murine CypA, by substituting three of six residues that differ between human and murine CypA orthologues rescue HCV replication at levels comparable to that of human CypA. They also found that the co-presence of human and murine CypA does not influence HCV replication, suggesting that murine CypA does not exhibit a dominant negative impact on viral replication. Finally, they generated a mouse-derived cell line expressing several human factors involved in the HCV life cycle and further transduced it with either human CypA, murine CypA or triply &quot;humanized&quot; murine CypA. After Jc1-Gluc HCV exposure, the authors found that the &quot;humanized&quot; murine CypA partially restored virion production of the &quot;humanized&quot; murine hepatoma cell line. However, viral production was still much lower compared to human Huh7 cells suggesting that additional species-specific restriction or viral dependency factors remain to be discovered.</p><p>The study addresses an important issue since an immunocompetent small animal model for HCV would be highly valuable for basic and clinical research. For most part, the manuscript is well written, experiments well controlled und the data are clearly presented and convincing. Limitations are that the rescue effect of humanized CypA on HCV replication is modest. In addition, the mechanism(s) underlying the species-specific differences of CypA to promote HCV replication remain unknown. Nonetheless, the findings are of significant interest. As outlined below some experiments require additional controls to warrant definitive conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1: Expression levels of the different CypA orthologues and mutants should be determined. Otherwise the specificity of functional differences is difficult to assess.</p><p>2) Figure 2B. It will be helpful to indicate not only the residues of the CypA ligand binding site but also those of the catalytic site (from my reading: H54, R55, F60, Q111, F113, and H126). Figures 2C-E: The authors tested the effect of overexpression of a triply murinized/humanized CypA on HCV RNA replication. Nevertheless, the three mutated residues were adjacent to each other, suggesting that they all may facilitate a similar role and thus their combination is less likely to result in a synergistic effect. To increase the likelihood of synergy, it will be important to combine the G52S mutation with 1 or 3 of the triple mutant and repeat these experiments. This may also help to see a phenotype in the murine cell line. The authors used an unpaired t test for statistical analysis in these panels. However, since multiple groups are being compared, ANOVA followed by a multiple comparison test should be used.</p><p>3) Figure 5: If the combination of the G52S mutant with one or three of the triple mutations is found to increase rescue in Huh7.5 cells (see Figure 2 above), it will be important to also test its rescue effect in Clone 8. As in Figure 2, ANOVA followed by a multiple comparison test should be used here.</p><p>4) Secreted Gaussia luciferase was used as indicator for HCV replication. This readout has the advantage that it is convenient and highly sensitive. However, the results are difficult to assess. Do the authors indeed measure replication (i.e. spreading infection) or just Gaussia expressed by initial infection? This should be discussed and, if feasible, key results should be verified by measuring infectious HCV yield. Infectivity data of the released particles from the &quot;humanized&quot; murine hepatoma cell line will also clarify whether or not there is a direct correlation between levels of virus production and levels of infectivity of de novo particles.</p><p>5) The function(s) of CypA in the HCV life cycle should be better presented. For example, to better describe the putative role(s) of CypA in the early steps of HCV replication (i.e., double membrane vesicle formation for efficient viral genome production and safety) as well as in the late steps of HCV replication, although a CypA role in the late stages of viral production remains controversial.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Differences across cyclophilin A orthologs contribute to the host range restriction of hepatitis C virus&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor, and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Our first point of the essential revisions was &quot;Figure 1: Expression levels of the different CypA orthologues and mutants should be determined. Otherwise the specificity of functional differences is difficult to assess.&quot; In brief, you reply that you used &quot;bicistronic constructs with CypA variants followed by an IRES-regulated GFP-ubiquitin-neomycin resistance fusion (in the case of the competition experiments where cells were dually transduced with both human and mouse CypA, the human CypA had a C-terminal 3x FLAG tag). We routinely assessed the CypA transduction efficiencies by flow cytometry prior to HCV infection, determining the percentage of eGFP+ (or FLAG+) cells […]&quot; While your approach allows to assess the transduction efficiencies it does not provide definitive information on the expression levels of the different CypA orthologues and mutants and some might be unstable. To clarify whether the observed functional differences are specific you should determine the protein expression levels. It this is not feasible explain why and critically discuss this limitation. Notably, the first option is much preferred.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44436.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1: Expression levels of the different CypA orthologues and mutants should be determined.

This readout has the advantage that it is convenient and highly sensitive. However, the results are difficult to assess. Do the authors indeed measure replication (i.e. spreading infection) or just Gaussia expressed by initial infection? This should be discussed and, if feasible, key results should be verified by measuring infectious HCV yield.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for this insightful comment. We performed additional experiments to answer this question, resulting in a new Figure 5 (Results subsection “Triply humanized murine CypA supports HCV spread and release of infectious particles as efficiently as human CypA”). We assessed spread by both NS5A staining over time in select CypA rescue lines (new Figure 5B) and also by using supernatants collected from these infected cells at two different time points to subsequently infect naïve Huh7.5 cells to determine infectious particle release by analyzing Gluc activity in the supernatants of these cells (Figure 5C).</p><p><italic>Infectivity data of the released particles from the &quot;humanized&quot; murine hepatoma cell line will also clarify whether or not there is a direct correlation between levels of virus production and levels of infectivity of</italic> de novo <italic>particles.</italic> </p><p>Similar to the experiments depicted in our Figure 4, we followed the reviewers’ recommendation to also look at infectious particle production from our Clone 8 lines. We took supernatants from infected Clone 8 cultures and used them to once more infect naïve Huh7.5 cells, which we then collected supernatants from for analyzing Gluc activity. As shown in the new panel of our previous Figure 4, now Figure 7C, particle production was very low with viral replication at 6 dpi (as represented by Gluc activity) not even a log above background.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The function(s) of CypA in the HCV life cycle should be better presented.

We appreciate the reviewers’ identification of this weakness and have substantially expanded the Discussion to give a far more detailed overview concerning CypA and the HCV life cycle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Differences across cyclophilin A orthologs contribute to the host range restriction of hepatitis C virus&quot; for further consideration at eLife. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor, and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Our first point of the essential revisions was &quot;Figure 1: Expression levels of the different CypA orthologues and mutants should be determined. Otherwise the specificity of functional differences is difficult to assess.&quot; In brief, you reply that you used &quot;bicistronic constructs with CypA variants followed by an IRES-regulated GFP-ubiquitin-neomycin resistance fusion (in the case of the competition experiments where cells were dually transduced with both human and mouse CypA, the human CypA had a C-terminal 3x FLAG tag). We routinely assessed the CypA transduction efficiencies by flow cytometry prior to HCV infection, determining the percentage of eGFP+ (or FLAG+) cells…&quot; While your approach allows to assess the transduction efficiencies it does not provide definitive information on the expression levels of the different CypA orthologues and mutants and some might be unstable. To clarify whether the observed functional differences are specific you should determine the protein expression levels. It this is not feasible explain why and critically discuss this limitation. Notably, the first option is much preferred.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the added clarification and the opportunity to add this to our manuscript. For all the CypA variants studied in our paper, we performed western blots to assess protein expression. Knowing that we were dealing with CypA variants of diverse sequence, we used two different primary antibodies with differing confirmed species reactivates. The only confirmed species covered by the two antibodies were human, mouse, rat, and African green monkey (which is 100% identical to human CypA at the amino acid level), and we were not able to find other antibodies listed as detecting squirrel monkey, pigtailed macaque or tree shrew. The western blots for all the CypA constructs contained in our paper can now be found in Supplementary file 1. We quantified the bands and show these data graphically in the appropriate figure supplements for the different sets of constructs (i.e. orthologs, murinized human CypA and humanized murine CypA single mutants, etc.).</p><p>It was clear that the reactivity of the antibodies we tested varied widely in their ability to detect the same construct, highlighting the difficulty to make precise comparisons in expression levels between transduced lines (i.e. 40-fold higher expression of construct A compared to the non-transduced Huh7.5 shRNA CypA is not necessarily equal to what is detected as 40-fold higher expression of construct B). We are comparing different constructs in the same line versus the same construct in different cell lines, so even if we had antibodies to specifically target each construct, these comparisons would remain problematic. This was one reason why we perceived a benefit in using a bicistronic system, so we could determine on a single cell basis how many cells theoretically contained our construct of interest.</p><p>In the end, of the 25 constructs tested, we were only unable to detect the pigtailed macaque TRIM5-CypA fusion and only weakly detected squirrel monkey CypA. We have discussed the ambiguity of our results for these two orthologs in both the Results and Discussion sections so that readers are clearly informed about the caveats. We also included broader discussion, much as written above, concerning the antibody reactivity issue that is unavoidable when working with such an array of constructs.</p></body></sub-article></article>
