Related S1-S4 domains have been identified in voltage-sensitive phosphatases and voltage-activated proton channels, both of which lack associated pore domains. hTMEM266 is a protein of unknown function that is predicted to contain an S1-S4 domain, along with partially structured cytoplasmic termini. Here we show that hTMEM266 forms oligomers, undergoes both rapid (µs) and slow (ms) structural rearrangements in response to changes in voltage, and contains a Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding site that can regulate the slow conformational transition. Our results demonstrate that the S1-S4 domain in hTMEM266 is a functional voltage sensor, motivating future studies to identify cellular processes that may be regulated by the protein. The ability of hTMEM266 to respond to voltage on the µs timescale may be advantageous for designing new genetically encoded voltage indicators.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>S1-S4 domain</kwd><kwd>voltage-sensing domain</kwd><kwd>divalent cations</kwd><kwd>fluorescence</kwd><kwd>fluorimetry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008530</institution-id><institution>European Regional Development Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Papp</surname><given-names>Ferenc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS002945</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Swartz</surname><given-names>Kenton Jon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transmembrane protein 266 contains a functional S1-S4 voltage-sensing domain that is regulated by extracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Electrical signaling is a widespread mechanism of cellular communication that is essential for multicellular organisms. In eukaryotes, the orchestrated activity of voltage-activated cation channels gives rise to action potentials that are used to trigger both excitation-secretion and excitation-contraction coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hille, 2001</xref>). The voltage-activated K<sup>+</sup> (Kv), Na<sup>+</sup> (Nav) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Cav) channels that are required for these forms of electrical signaling all contain S1-S4 domains capable of sensing changes in membrane voltage and triggering opening or closing of a coupled ion selective pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Swartz, 2008</xref>). A growing number of X-ray and cryo-EM structures have provided a foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms of voltage sensing in voltage-activated ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hite and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hite et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Long et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Payandeh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Payandeh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sun and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Whicher and MacKinnon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), and it has been established that movements of the Arg-rich S4 helices drive voltage-sensor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bezanilla, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Swartz, 2008</xref>). S1-S4 voltage-sensing domains have also been identified in voltage-sensitive phosphatases (VSPs), where membrane voltage can regulate the catalytic activity of a cytoplasmic lipid phosphatase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grimm and Isacoff, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kohout et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kohout et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Murata et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Okamura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sakata et al., 2016</xref>). Subsequent studies showed that voltage-activated proton (Hv1) channels contain an S1-S4 domain that also forms the permeation pathway for protons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berger and Isacoff, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mony et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ramsey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sasaki et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we investigated hTMEM266 (formally known as C15orf27), a membrane protein of unknown function that contains an identifiable S1-S4 domain. Although the sequence of the S1-S4 domain of hTMEM266 is similar to Hv1, it was previously reported to not form functional voltage-activated proton channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Musset et al., 2011</xref>). Here we explore whether the S1-S4 domain in hTMEM266 can sense changes in membrane voltage. We demonstrate that its S4 helix can support voltage-dependent opening when transplanted into either Hv1 or Shaker Kv channels. Using voltage-clamp fluorimetry, we establish that hTMEM266 undergoes distinct conformational rearrangements in response to changes in membrane voltage, and we show that extracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions regulate these conformational dynamics. We conclude that hTMEM266 contains a functional voltage sensor with properties that distinguish it from conventional S1-S4 voltage-sensing domains.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sequence and architecture of hTMEM266</title><p>The hTMEM266 protein can be identified in BLAST searches using the Hv1 channel as a query (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Musset et al., 2011</xref>). The hTMEM266 sequence is 531 amino acids long and is predicted to contain four transmembrane (TM) helices that are flanked by an N-terminus containing approximately 100 residues and a C-terminus containing about 310 residues. The four TMs are clearly related to the S1-S4 voltage-sensing domains found in Hv1, VSPs and voltage-activated cation channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and see below). Among proteins that contain S1-S4 voltage-sensing domains, TMEM266 has the most restricted distribution among species, with orthologous sequences restricted to the genomes of vertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

(Note that the Hv1 structure 3WKV is of a chimeric construct, and thus our homology model should be interpreted cautiously.) Secondary structure predictions suggest that the N-terminus of hTMEM266 contains two short helices that may form a compact domain and that the initial part of the C-terminus forms a helical extension of the S4 helix that is likely to form a coiled-coil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), similar to the C-terminal coiled-coil domain of Hv1 that serves to assemble Hv1 into dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Qiu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tombola et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tombola et al., 2010</xref>). Whereas the Hv1 sequence terminates at the coiled-coil, hTMEM266 family members have ~250 additional residues following the coiled-coil that is predicted by multiple secondary structure prediction programs to be structurally disordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). (See Materials and methods).</p><p>The S1-S4 domain of hTMEM266 has key features that are common to other S1-S4 voltage-sensing domains. Like Hv1, the S4 helix of hTMEM266 contains three Arg residues (R208, R211 and R214) positioned according to the RXXRXXR motif common to the S4 helix of all voltage-sensing domains, where X is typically a hydrophobic residue. The S1-S4 domain of hTMEM266 also has a triad of residues (F149 and E152 in the S2 helix, as well as D174 in the S3 helix) that in other S1-S4 domains has been termed the ‘charge-transfer center’ because they facilitate movement of the positively charged residues in S4 across the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tao et al., 2010</xref>). In the homology model, all three Arg residues on the S4 helix face in towards the domain core with the middle Arg positioned closest to F149 within the charge transfer center, leaving the first Arg external to F149, and the third Arg internal to F149 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Like other S1-S4 domains, hTMEM266 also contains acidic and/or polar residues positioned above (E118 on the S1 helix and S142 on the S2 helix) and below (E152 on the S2 helix and both E171 and D174 on the S3 helix) the charge transfer center that could potentially stabilize the positively charged S4 Arg residues within the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Long et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Papazian et al., 1995</xref>). Finally, hTMEM266 appears to share a Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding site with Hv1. In Hv1, four residues (E115 and D119 in S1, H136 in S2 and H189 in S4; numbering for mHv1) have been implicated in coordinating Zn<sup>2+</sup>, a metal ion that inhibits the proton channel by stabilizing a closed state of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ramsey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Takeshita et al., 2014</xref>). Three of these four Zn<sup>2+</sup>-coordinating residues are conserved in hTMEM266 (E118 and D122 in S1 and H139 in S2), while a Ser (S196 in S4) is present at the equivalent position of H189 in Hv1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Taken together, examination of the sequence of the S1-S4 domain in hTMEM266 reveals that it contains many of the most critical residues found within the S1-S4 voltage-sensing domains in other proteins, raising the possibility that it may function as a voltage sensor.</p><p>The S1-S4 sequence of hTMEM266 also has several features that appear unique. Although the ‘X’ amino acids in the RXXRXXR motif in the S4 helix are generally non-polar, hTMEM266 contains an additional Lys residue (K213) just before the third Arg residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>). In our homology model, K213 projects out from the domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), raising the possibility that it may be involved in oligomerization (see below). The S4 helix of hTMEM266 also contains an acidic residue (D217) following and in register with the S4 Arg residues, a feature also seen in the S4 helices of EAG and ERG Kv channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Whicher and MacKinnon, 2016</xref>), but that is otherwise uncommon in voltage-sensing domains. Finally, hTMEM266 has non-polar residues (V111 in S1 and M185 in S3) in the core of the 4TM bundle that are typically charged or polar in other voltage-sensing domains, leading to a larger cluster of hydrophobic residues external to the charge transfer center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The S4 helix of hTMEM266 can support voltage-dependent gating in Hv1 and Kv channels</title><p>Because the Hv1 proton channel is the closest relative of TMEM266, we began by confirming that hTMEM266 does not form functional proton channels when expressed in HEK cells and studied using whole-cell patch clamp recordings with solutions optimized for recording proton currents. We could readily measure robust proton currents in response to membrane depolarization for cells expressing hHv1, but observed only small leak currents for cells expressing hTMEM266 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>) even though a C-terminally GFP-tagged construct of hTMEM266 traffics efficiently to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since hTMEM266 is predicted to contain a coiled-coil domain that is similar to the coiled-coil that mediates dimerization in Hv1, we also tested the possibility that hTMEM266 might be able to oligomerize with Hv1. Disruption of dimerization of Hv1 alters the gating properties of the channel, producing a pronounced speeding of channel deactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tombola et al., 2008</xref>). We therefore tested whether hTMEM266 might be able to oligomerize with Hv1 and alter its gating properties. However, when hHv1 and hTMEM266 were expressed together, we measured voltage-activated proton currents that were indistinguishable from Hv1 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>).

These perturbations in the energetics of voltage-dependent gating are relatively modest when considering how many residues differ between the transferred regions of hTMEM266 and either hHv1 or Shaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and indicate that the S4 helix of hTMEM266 can support voltage-dependent gating in the context of two distinct voltage-activated ion channels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>hTMEM266 can form oligomers</title><p>Functional and biochemical experiments have established that the Hv1 channel forms dimers and that the C-terminal coiled-coil extension of the S4 helix mediates dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gonzalez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tombola et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tombola et al., 2010</xref>). Because hTMEM266 is also predicted to contain a C-terminal coiled-coil extension of S4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we tested whether the protein forms oligomers when expressed in HEK 293 cells. Exposure of cells expressing hTMEM266 to disuccinimidyl substerate (DSS), a bifunctional membrane permeable primary amine crosslinking reagent, resulted in formation of a higher molecular weight band in Western blots of PAGE gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,C</xref>), consistent with dimer formation. Because the C-terminal coiled-coil of hTMEM266 contains a Cys residue (C252) that is conserved in Hv1 where it can form a disulfide bond in the coiled-coil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fujiwara et al., 2013</xref>), we expressed the coiled-coil of hTMEM266 alone (residues 224–289) and tested whether the purified domain could form dimers.

We also observed the presence of a higher molecular weight band in Western blots of hTMEM266 under non-reducing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>), suggesting that disulfide-mediated dimers of hTMEM266 can form. Finally, we also co-expressed N-terminally GFP-tagged and C-terminally Strep-tagged constructs of hTMEM266 and observed that the GFP-tagged construct could be pulled down along with the Strep-tagged construct when it was purified using Streptactin beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E,F</xref>). In this context, deletion of the coiled-coil containing C-terminus of hTMEM266 from the GFP-tagged construct prevented pulldown along with the Strep-tagged protein, indicating that the C-terminus of hTMEM266 mediates dimerization.

As described above, for two of the eight attachment positions (P194C and W198C) depolarization caused both a rapid initial change in fluorescence followed by a slower secondary response, suggesting that the protein can undergo two distinct conformational changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These two components can be most easily distinguished for P194C, where the initial rapid fluorescence increase (i.e. dequenching) was followed by a second, slower decrease (i.e. quenching) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Furthermore, after returning to the holding potential at the end of the depolarizing pulse, the fluorescence overshot (i.e. ‘tail fluorescence’) before rising back to its initial value as the protein returned to its resting conformation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, the amplitude of the slower component, ΔF<sub>slow</sub>, can be characterized by the difference between fluorescence levels at the beginning (ΔF<sub>i</sub>) and end (ΔF<sub>e</sub>) of the voltage step.

This hypothesis is also consistent with the ‘tail fluorescence’ of the example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, in which the fluorescence quenching fraction is at a minimum immediately after repolarizing to −100 mV. Collectively, the results presented thus far are consistent with hTMEM266 undergoing two conformational rearrangements in response to changes in membrane voltage. The first occurs rapidly and results in an enhanced accessibility of the fluorophore to collisional quenchers. The second occurs on the timescale of milliseconds and reduces TAMRA fluorescence attached at P194C. This second quenching component is not observed below 0 mV but becomes increasingly apparent as the voltage becomes more depolarized.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Modulation of slow fluorescence responses by Zn<sup>2+</sup></title><p>The Hv1 voltage-activated proton channel is inhibited by micromolar concentrations of Zn<sup>2+</sup> and mutagenesis experiments have implicated two His residues (H136 near S2 and H189 near S4) in forming the Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cherny and DeCoursey, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Musset et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ramsey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sasaki et al., 2006</xref>). The Hv1 crystal structure is compatible with these His residues contributing to the Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding site, but also reveals the likely involvement of two acidic residues (E115 and D119) near the external end of S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Takeshita et al., 2014</xref>). Because three of the four residues implicated in coordinating Zn<sup>2+</sup> in Hv1 are conserved in hTMEM266 (E118 and D122 in S1 and H139 in S2), we investigated whether extracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup> could modulate the fluorescence signals from TAMRA-labeled constructs. The effects of extracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup> application are shown for TAMRA-labeled uninjected oocytes and for two examples of labeled cells expressing hTMEM266 P194C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>). For uninjected oocytes, 100 µM Zn<sup>2+</sup> produced only very small decreases in fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) that was constant at all voltages examined. Even at millimolar concentrations, Zn<sup>2+</sup> has no measurable effect on TAMRA-MTS fluorescence in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), and therefore we think the small decreases in fluorescence represent bleaching of the fluorophore that occurred between the control recording and that after application of Zn<sup>2+</sup>. In contrast, for P194C labeled hTMEM266-expressing cells, Zn<sup>2+</sup> produced a dramatic decrease in the fluorescence intensity at the holding voltage of −100 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In addition, although the relative amplitude of the initial fast (ΔF<sub>i</sub>) and second slower (ΔF<sub>slow</sub>) voltage-dependent changes in fluorescence intensity varied between oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), the addition of Zn<sup>2+</sup> greatly enhanced the fast fluorescence change after a depolarization while the slow component decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). We also explored the effects of Zn<sup>2+</sup> on the rapid dequenching of fluorescence observed for other labeled positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Zn<sup>2+</sup> produced relatively modest decreases in fluorescence for each of the other labeled positions, and for A191C, G193C, S196C and P197C produced a modest increase in the steepness of ΔF/F<sub>h</sub> relations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that Zn<sup>2+</sup> binds to hTMEM266 and modulates fluorescence signals in a site-specific fashion, with the effects on P194C standing out as the most robust.</p><p>To explore the mechanism by which Zn<sup>2+</sup> modulates fluorescence signals for TAMRA-MTS labeling of P194C, we first titrated the effects of Zn<sup>2+</sup> and found that its binding site in hTMEM266 has low micromolar affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,D</xref>), somewhat lower affinity than measured in Hv1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ramsey et al., 2006</xref>), consistent with the fact that hTMEM266 contains three of the four residues implicated in Hv1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Takeshita et al., 2014</xref>). Because His is a quencher of TAMRA fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2010a</xref>), we hypothesized that H139 at the outer end of TM2 in hTMEM266 may be involved in forming the Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding site and that the binding of Zn<sup>2+</sup> might modulate His quenching of TAMRA fluorescence at P194C. We mutated H139 to Ala in the P194C background and observed only small fluorescence changes with membrane depolarization for TAMRA-MTS labeled cells, consistent with that residue playing a role in both the rapid dequenching and slow quenching responses observed at P194C. In addition, extracellular application of Zn<sup>2+</sup> at concentrations as high as 1 mM produced only small decreases in fluorescence for that construct, without altering the slope of the ΔF/F relation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,E</xref>). We also mutated H139 to Trp since Trp is also a strong quencher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2010a</xref>) and observed that the initial rapid fluorescence increase after depolarization was followed by a further slow increase during the voltage step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), in marked contrast to the slow fluorescence decrease observed when the native His was present at position 139. Addition of extracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup> also inhibited the slow dequenching component, and the affinity of Zn<sup>2+</sup> appeared to be lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F–I</xref>). Taken together, these results lead us to conclude that H139 contributes to forming the Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding site and to both the fast and slow fluorescence responses observed when P194C is labeled with TAMRA-MTS. The effects of Zn<sup>2+</sup> on P194C for both H139A and H139W constructs suggest that Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding modulates the interactions between quenching residues and the fluorophore.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42372.018</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Contribution of H139 to Zn<sup>2+</sup>sensitivity of hTMEM266 labeled with TAMRA-MTS at P194C.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Fluorescence intensity during voltage steps from −100 mV to ±200 mV for oocytes expressing hTEME266 P194C (<bold>A</bold>), the double mutant H139A/P194C (<bold>B</bold>), and the double mutant H139W/P194C (<bold>C</bold>) for control and zinc-containing solutions.

The slow quenching component was approximately a factor of 10 slower in the hTMEM266-EGFP construct when compared to that seen in TAMRA-MTS labeled P194C construct, which may be related to the deletion of the C-terminus or the addition of the bulky EGFP protein.

The goal of the present study was to determine whether the S1-S4 domain found in hTMEM266 can sense membrane voltage. We generated functional voltage-activated H<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels by transplantation of the S4 helix from hTMEM266 into the Hv1 and Shaker Kv channels, respectively, demonstrating that the S4 helix of hTMEM266 is capable of sensing membrane voltage within the context of the S1-S4 domains of those channels. The fluorescence responses we observed when introducing Cys residues between the external ends of S3 and S4 and labeling with TAMRA were unusual, requiring extensive characterization to understand the underlying mechanism. For all the positions where we could label the protein, we observed increases in fluorescence with membrane depolarization that were as rapid as the speed of our voltage clamp; in the case of G193C where we used the cut-open configuration to optimize the clamp speed, the increase in fluorescence with membrane depolarization occurred with a time constant of 130 µs. In addition, for most of the positions studied we observed nearly linear ΔF/F-V relationships over a ± 200 mV range of membrane voltages. The rapid kinetics and nearly linear ΔF/F-V relationships raise the possibility that the fluorescence increases have an electrochromic origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Asamoah et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klymchenko and Demchenko, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Klymchenko et al., 2006</xref>). However, we are unaware of any reports of electrochromic signals recorded using TAMRA-MTS, which has no net charge, and only small electrochromic signals have been reported for the related cysteine-reactive fluorophore, tetramethylrhodamine maleimide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dekel et al., 2012</xref>).

For P194C labeled with TAMRA-MTS, external Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions quenched the rapid fluorescence signals at all voltages, inhibited the slow quenching component and steepened the ΔF/F relation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Although these effects of the metal ion are complex, our results show that H139 in S2 is a quenching residue that is largely responsible for the fluorescence signals measured when labeling P194C with TAMRA-MTS, and that H139 also participates in forming the Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding site, leading us to conclude that Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding modifies the interactions between H139 and TAMRA. Interestingly, mutation of H139 to Trp, another strong quencher of TAMRA fluorescence, altered the slow component of fluorescence change from quenching to dequenching in P194C labeled with TAMRA-MTS. One explanation for this observation is that the H139W mutant alters the position of the quenching residues relative to the fluorophore, effectively altering the state in which quenching is maximal. Interestingly, the effects of Zn<sup>2+</sup> on TAMRA-MTS labeled P194C and the hTMEM266-EGFP constructs were clearly distinct. In hTMEM266-EGFP the metal ion augmented the slow quenching component observed at positive membrane voltages and appeared to shift the component to more negative voltages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Since Zn<sup>2+</sup> binds on the external side of the protein and GFP was inserted into the intracellular C-terminus of the protein, these results indicate that Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding modulates voltage-dependent transitions in hTMEM266.</p><p>Our observations of voltage-dependent fluorescence and quencher accessibility of TAMRA attached to residues at the external ends of S3 and S4, as well as the voltage-dependent fluorescence from a GFP grafted on to the intracellular end of the S4 helix are both consistent with the conventional voltage-sensing mechanism in which the S4 helix and its positively-charged arginine residues move in response to changes in membrane voltage. However, two issues limit the mechanistic interpretation of these fluorescence measurements. First, because fluorescence is sensitive to the local fluorophore environment, a fluorescence change does not require movement of the residue to which the fluorophore is attached and can instead result from movement of other residues within its vicinity. Secondly, because hTMEM266 undergoes multiple conformational transitions, the charge movement per voltage-sensing domain cannot be reliably inferred from the voltage-dependence of the fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bezanilla and Villalba-Galea, 2013</xref>). Indeed, relatively linear ΔF/F relations have been reported for a variety of genetically encoded voltage indicators engineered from the voltage-sensing domains from voltage-activated ion channels or voltage-sensitive phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelfattah et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barnett et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blunck et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">St-Pierre et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, our results collectively demonstrate that hTMEM266 contains a functional voltage-sensing domain that is capable of both rapid (µs) and slow (ms) structural rearrangements in response to changes in membrane voltage.</p><p>hTMEM266 has been reported to localize on the post-synaptic side of glutamatergic mossy fibers and granule cells in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2014</xref>), and having established that hTMEM266 is a functional voltage sensor it will be exciting to explore whether hTMEM266 can specifically interact with intracellular signaling pathways to provide voltage-dependent regulation. In addition, the ability of hTMEM266 to respond rapidly to changes in membrane voltage offers the exciting possibility that it may be useful for designing new genetically encodable voltage indicators with particularly rapid responses. Indeed, the rapid fluorescence responses observed here are faster than what has been observed in the voltage sensors used to create the fastest available voltage indicators that are based on fluorescent proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang and St-Pierre, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bioinformatic analysis of hTMEM266 and creation of a homology model</title><p>Homologs of TMEM266 were extensively searched with BLASTp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Altschul et al., 1990</xref>), PSI-BLAST (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Altschul et al., 1997</xref>) and HHBlits (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/#/tools/hhblits">https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/#/tools/hhblits</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Alva et al., 2016</xref>).

The use of the cut-open clamp used in fluorescence experiments should facilitate these experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>These are both excellent suggestions. We have included a paragraph in the Discussion (below) describing how the fluorescence signals fit with a conventional voltage-sensing mechanism, as well as the difficulty of uniquely assigning a mechanism from these fluorescence signals alone. We have not included a detailed kinetic analysis because the fluorescence signals can be readily described by multiple kinetic models.</p><p>The revised Discussion now reads:</p><p>“Our observations of voltage-dependent fluorescence and quencher accessibility of TAMRA attached to residues at the external ends of S3 and S4, as well as the voltage-dependent fluorescence from a GFP grafted on to the intracellular end of the S4 helix are both consistent with the conventional voltage-sensing mechanism in which the S4 helix and its positively-charged arginine residues move in response to changes in membrane voltage. […] Nevertheless, our results collectively demonstrate that hTMEM266 contains a functional voltage-sensing domain that is capable of both rapid (µs) and slow (ms) structural rearrangements in response to changes in membrane voltage.”</p><p>We have also included a paragraph in the Results section and a new supplementary figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 2) describing our efforts to measure sensing currents. We spent quite a bit of time trying to measure sensing currents, but even using the cut-open voltage clamp we could not unambiguously distinguish non-linear sensing currents from oocytes expressing hTMEM266. We did observe a significant increase in the apparent capacitance over un-injected oocytes, and we openly discuss its possible origin.</p><p>The Results section now reads:</p><p>“We also examined these current recordings for any signs of charge movement due to changes in the conformation of the protein. […] This apparent increase in membrane capacitance suggests either that hTMEM266 contains mobile charges, or that expression of hTMEM266 somehow changes the properties of the plasma membrane, such as its area, thickness or polarizability.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
