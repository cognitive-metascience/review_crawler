Here, we explore how SNARE regulators operate on discrete zippering states. The formation of a metastable trans-complex, catalyzed by HOPS and its SM subunit Vps33, is followed by subsequent zippering transitions that increase the probability of fusion. Operating independently of Sec18 (NSF) catalysis, Sec17 (α-SNAP) either inhibits or stimulates SNARE-mediated fusion. If HOPS or Vps33 are absent, Sec17 inhibits fusion at an early stage. Thus, Vps33/HOPS promotes productive SNARE assembly in the presence of otherwise inhibitory Sec17. Once SNAREs are partially zipped, Sec17 promotes fusion in either the presence or absence of HOPS, but with faster kinetics when HOPS is absent, suggesting that ejection of the SM is a rate-limiting step.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Sec1/Munc18</kwd><kwd>Vps33</kwd><kwd>HOPS</kwd><kwd>Rab</kwd><kwd>AP-3</kwd><kwd>lysosome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM077349</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Merz</surname><given-names>Alexey J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM07270</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwartz</surname><given-names>Matthew L</given-names></name><name><surname>Lobingier</surname><given-names>Braden T</given-names></name><name><surname>Angers</surname><given-names>Cortney G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM023377</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zick</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sec17 is shown to have divergent effects on pre-fusion SNARE complex activity, depending on the state of SNARE zippering and HOPS, an SM-tether complex, controls the outcome of Sec17-SNARE engagement.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic cells partition biosynthetic, catabolic, and information processing activities into specialized organelles. To move materials among organelles while maintaining compartmental identity, specific cargos are picked and packaged into vesicular carriers. These carriers must accurately dock at and fuse with target organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angers and Merz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker and Hughson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Südhof and Rothman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wickner and Schekman, 2008</xref>). Most intracellular fusion events are driven by the concerted folding and oligomerization — zippering — of SNARE proteins embedded in trans on the two apposed membranes. SNAREs confer inherent compartmental selectivity. Among the many possible permutations of SNARE complexes, only a subset assemble into kinetically stable complexes; among these, only a further subset efficiently initiate fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Izawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McNew et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Trans-SNARE zippering, membrane fusion, and cis-SNARE disassembly together constitute the SNARE cycle. The folded portion of a SNARE complex is a parallel bundle of four α-helical SNARE domains (Qa, Qb, Qc, and R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fasshauer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Poirier et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sutton et al., 1998</xref>). N-to-C zippering of the trans-SNARE complex generates mechanical tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Min et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zorman et al., 2014</xref>), driving the SNARE C-termini and their associated membranes together to initiate lipid mixing and fusion. After fusion, the SNARE complex membrane anchors lie in cis, adjacent and parallel within the membrane. Cis-complexes are then disassembled to recycle and energize the SNAREs for subsequent fusion reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mayer et al., 1996</xref>). Disassembly requires the Sec18 ATPase and Sec17, an adapter that docks Sec18 onto the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mayer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Söllner et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). In mammals, Sec18 and Sec17 are named NSF and α-SNAP. Here, we use the yeast nomenclature.</p><p>Assembly of the pre-fusion trans-SNARE complex is precisely choreographed by tethering and docking factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angers and Merz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker and Hughson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wickner and Schekman, 2008</xref>). Diverse factors operate at specific compartments, but all SNARE-mediated fusion events that have been closely examined require cofactors of the Sec1/Mammalian UNC-18 (SM) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker and Hughson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carr and Rizo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Südhof and Rothman, 2009</xref>). In vitro, SM proteins increase the rate of fusion several-fold above the basal rate catalyzed by SNAREs alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furukawa and Mima, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shen et al., 2007</xref>). In vivo, however, SM deletion annihilates fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carr and Rizo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Südhof and Rothman, 2009</xref>). It has been unclear whether SM proteins increase the rate or precision of SNARE assembly, make already-formed trans-complexes more fusogenic, or both.</p><p>Here, we examine SM function in the context of the HOPS tethering complex, which controls endolysosomal docking and fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rieder and Emr, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seals et al., 2000</xref>). Importantly, the HOPS SM subunit Vps33 is both necessary and sufficient for HOPS interaction with SNARE domains and SNARE complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dulubova et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krämer and Ungermann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lobingier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lobingier and Merz, 2012</xref>). A pair of breakthrough crystal structures seems to reveal how the Qa- and R-SNARE interact with Vps33 in a pre-fusion state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2015</xref>). These structures strongly support the hypothesis that Vps33 nucleates and guides assembly of the partially zipped trans-SNARE complex. The same mechanism may be common to all SMs.</p><p>The disassembly adapter Sec17 interacts not only with post-fusion SNARE complexes, but also with pre-fusion SNARE complexes as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barszczewski et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schwartz and Merz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Song et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zick et al., 2015</xref>). In an apparent paradox, Sec17 has been reported to both inhibit and stimulate fusion. The fusion-augmenting activity of Sec17 was first observed in cell-free assays with intact native yeast vacuoles bearing stalled, partially zipped SNARE complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schwartz and Merz, 2009</xref>). To explain these unexpected results, we proposed that binding of Sec17 to trans-SNARE complexes stabilizes the folded state of the trans-SNARE complex’s membrane-proximal C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schwartz and Merz, 2009</xref>). More recently, single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments provided direct evidence for this zipper-clamp mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). Experiments with proteoliposomes demonstrated that Sec18, either with or without ATP hydrolysis, further enhances the Sec17 stimulation of fusion. Moreover, membrane penetration by a hydrophobic loop near the Sec17 N-terminus may contribute to Sec17’s fusogenic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Song et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zick et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In reconstitution experiments, SM activity becomes essential in the presence of molecular crowding agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furukawa and Mima, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yu et al., 2015</xref>) or in the presence of Sec17 and Sec18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mima et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Starai et al., 2008</xref>). Sec17 and SMs can physically associate with one another on quaternary SNARE complexes, and SNARE-bound Golgi or vacuole SM proteins directly impede Sec18-mediated SNARE disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lobingier et al., 2014</xref>), conferring resistance to Sec18-mediated trans-complex disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). However, the functional interplay among Sec17, SMs, and the zippering trans complex has not been fully explored. The apparent paradox that Sec17 both inhibits and stimulates fusion is unresolved, and the ability of Sec17 to augment the fusion activity of trans-SNARE complexes has not been tested in vivo.</p><p>Here, we report parallel experiments in three systems: in vitro assays, with either synthetic chemically defined reconstituted proteoliposomes (RPLs) or with intact vacuolar lysosomes, and in vivo genetic tests in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. We find that SNARE zippering can be precisely manipulated to yield on-pathway trans-complexes that exhibit a range of fusogenic activities. We demonstrate that Sec17 functionally interacts with SNARE complexes before as well as after fusion, and we show that the functional consequences of Sec17-SNARE interactions are in turn regulated by HOPS and Vps33. In parallel studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Song et al., 2017</xref>), we used the synthetic RPL system to demonstrate that Sec18 can augment Sec17 and trans<italic>-</italic>SNARE complex function, in the complete absence of Sec18 ATP hydrolysis or SNARE disassembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Qc zippering beyond layer +5 drives fusion in vivo</title><p>The Qc-SNARE Vam7 is essential for fusion of yeast lysosomal vacuoles.

Consistent with previous in vitro experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schwartz and Merz, 2009</xref>), Qc-wt or Qc-7∆ knock-in cells had morphologically normal vacuoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), while Qc-1∆, Qc-3∆, Qc-5∆ knock-in cells had fragmented vacuoles and were phenotypically indistinguishable from the <italic>vam7</italic>∆ null mutant.

We monitored two pathways using representative cargo proteins. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) traffics directly from Golgi to vacuole, while carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) traffics from the Golgi to the vacuole via late endosomes. Both ALP and CPY traffic as inactive proenzymes that are cleaved and activated upon arrival at the vacuole. Fusion defects cause slow-migrating pro-forms (pALP and pCPY) to accumulate.

When docking and fusion at the vacuole are impaired, AP-3 vesicles accumulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angers and Merz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rehling et al., 1999</xref>). In wild-type cells overproducing Qc-5∆, the median number of AP-3 vesicles nearly doubled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). Qualitatively similar accumulations of AP-3 vesicles were observed in Qc-3∆ overproducers. Moreover, in Qc-5∆-overproducer cells, AP-3 puncta were observed in clumps at the vacuole-limiting membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, arrow), rather than dispersed throughout the cytoplasm as in <italic>vam7∆</italic> cells (lacking the vacuolar Qc). This suggests a defect in fusion but not docking.

Force spectroscopy studies show that in a ‘half-zipped’ state the neuronal R-SNARE is structured to approximately layer +2, and the t/Q-SNARE complex is structured to layer +4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Min et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zorman et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, our findings with yeast vacuoles agree remarkably well with the force-spectroscopy results. With a stalled trans-complex zipped to Qc layer +3 or +4, the docked membranes should be separated by 8–10 nm, fully hydrated and unable to initiate lipid mixing. The propensity of the partially zipped trans-complex to initiate fusion increases abruptly, either when Sec17 is added or by extending Qc-4∆ a single α-helical turn, from +4 to+5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,E</xref>). Fusion is maximal when the Qc is extended to layer +7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schwartz and Merz, 2009</xref>). Our results again are consistent with force spectroscopy experiments, where a transition barrier between the partially zipped state and C-terminal domain trans<italic>-</italic>complex zippering is traversed as R-SNARE assembly proceeds through layer +3,+4, or +5, depending on the specific complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Min et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zorman et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The sharply increased in vitro fusion activity of Qc-5∆ versus Qc-4∆ prompted closer examination of the layer +5 region. Vam7 (Qc-wt) contains two arginyl (R) residues between layers + 4 and+5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The second residue is conserved in many Qc-SNAREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fasshauer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sutton et al., 1998</xref>). In gain-of-function ‘bypass’ reactions lacking ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), mutation of the non-conserved first Arg to Ala (AR) slightly increased fusion versus ‘wild-type’(RR) Qc-5∆. Mutation of the second, conserved Arg (RA) decreased fusion. Mutation of both residues (AA) further impaired fusion. In competition assays containing ATP, where fusion is driven by native Qc-wt, the abilities of the variants to dominantly impair fusion mirrored their activities in the gain-of function assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; compare to 3E). Hence, these mutants are true partial agonists of fusion. In both assay configurations, the apparent K<sub>M</sub> (EC<sub>50</sub>) values for the mutant Qc-5∆s (AR, RA, AA) were indistinguishable from ‘wild-type’ Qc-5∆ (RR). Thus, the ability of these Qc-5∆ mutants to assemble into pre-fusion complexes was unaltered, even as their capacity to drive fusion diverged. Moreover, added Sec17 allowed all Qc-5∆ variants to drive fusion with similar efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). These findings, and results from other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fasshauer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mohrmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sakaba et al., 2005</xref>) indicate that Qc layer +5 has a pivotal role in fusion, probably driving C-terminal zippering beyond the ‘half-zipped’ metastable state and through the transition barrier separating partially zipped and C-terminally zipped trans<italic>-</italic>complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Min et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zorman et al., 2014</xref>).

First, Sec17 rescue of partially zipped SNARE complexes can occur in the total absence of Sec18. This is consistent with our original vacuole experiments, where Sec17 rescued Qc-3∆ in the absence of ATP, even in the presence of inhibitory Sec18 antibodies or when a Sec17 mutant defective for Sec18 interaction was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schwartz and Merz, 2009</xref>). In parallel work, we demonstrated that rigor-locked Sec18-ATP can augment the Sec17 rescue of Qc-3∆ without any requirement for ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Song et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, when present, Sec18 need not disassemble SNARE complexes to facilitate Sec17-mediated triggering of fusion. Second, full-length Vam7 (Qc-wt) might be available in residual quantities on intact vacuoles, but it is not present in the chemically defined Qc-∆ RPL reactions. Thus, Sec17 supports Qc-∆–mediated fusion in the total absence of full-length Qc-wt. Third, no additional vacuolar proteins are needed for Sec17 stimulation of fusion. Importantly, Sec17 stimulation of fusion is observed both with native vacuole membranes and with RPLs, even at physiological or below-physiological SNARE, Rab, and HOPS concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schwartz and Merz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Song et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zick et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Sec17 requirements for stimulation and inhibition of fusion</title><p>In addition to the canonical role of Sec17 in cis-SNARE complex disassembly, and its ability to augment the fusion capacity of SNARE complexes, Sec17/α-SNAP has also been reported to inhibit fusion of yeast vacuoles and dense core secretory vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2000</xref>). To separate these divergent functions of Sec17, we analyzed a panel of Sec17 mutants. Sec17 interacts with SNARE proteins through a large concave binding surface, it interacts with Sec18 through its C-terminal domain, and it interacts with membranes through an N-terminal hydrophobic loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barnard et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lauer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schwartz and Merz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Winter et al., 2009</xref>).

K159 and K163 sit on adjacent α–helices with side chains separated by ~8 Å, yet charge substitutions at these positions have completely different effects.

Together, the data show that the apolar loop of Sec17, and hence Sec17 interaction with the membrane, has a large effect on the ability of Sec17 to both inhibit and stimulate fusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Sec17 augments Qc-∆ SNARE function in vivo</title><p>In vitro, Sec17 addition allows Qc-3∆, −4∆, or −5∆ to fuse vacuoles and RPLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>).

There is, however, an important difference between the conditions in vivo and in vitro. In vivo, the vacuole-associated kinase Yck3 negatively regulates fusion by phosphorylating HOPS and the Rab GEF Mon1. These phosphorylation events impair both Ypt7 Rab activation and HOPS-membrane association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brett et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">LaGrassa and Ungermann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lawrence et al., 2014</xref>). Our Qc-∆/Sec17 rescue experiments with purified yeast vacuoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) are done under ‘bypass’ conditions in the absence of ATP, resulting in Yck3 loss-of-function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brett et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">LaGrassa and Ungermann, 2005</xref>), and Yck3 is not present in the synthetic RPL reactions. Hence, we tested Qc-∆ function in <italic>yck3</italic>∆ mutant cells. In <italic>yck3</italic>∆ cells expressing either Qc-3∆ or Qc-5∆, vacuoles were uniformly fragmented, indicating that elevated HOPS activity does not by itself restore Qc-∆ function. However, overproduction of either Sec17, or Sec17 and Sec18 together, rescued Qc-5∆ vacuole morphology with ~20% penetrance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>). The partial rescue of Qc-5∆ rescue makes sense. In cell-free assays of homotypic vacuole fusion, Sec17 augments Qc-∆ activity only over a narrow range of Sec17 concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Because the copy number of yeast 2µ plasmids varies from cell to cell, partial rescue probably reflects variation in Sec17 expression. Qc-3∆ mutants exhibited severe defects in vivo under all conditions, consistent with the generally lower fusion activity of Qc-3∆ in vitro, with both vacuoles and RPLs. Sec17 overproduction alone had no influence on cis-SNARE complex abundance, and Sec18 overproduction alone did not rescue Qc-5∆ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>). Overproduction of Sec17-FSMS failed to rescue vacuole morphology in <italic>yck3∆ Qc-5</italic>∆ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>), indicating that the Sec17 hydrophobic loop is needed to augment Qc-∆ function in vivo as it is in vitro. Neither the rate of cis-SNARE complex disassembly, nor the steady-state availability of unpaired SNAREs, can explain why Sec17 augments Qc-5∆ function in vivo. The most likely remaining explanation is that Sec17 augments the fusion activity of partially zipped trans-complexes in vivo, just as it does in vitro.</p><p>Since <italic>SEC17</italic> is an essential gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Novick et al., 1981</xref>), we tested the ability of several Sec17 mutants to support viability.

These results indicate that the Sec17-Sec18 interaction is essential for viability, but also demonstrate that the Sec17-Sec18 system is sufficiently robust that even relatively severe losses of Sec17 activity are tolerated in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Sec17 triggers fusion after trans-SNARE complex assembly</title><p>In the forward docking and fusion pathway, where does Sec17 act to stimulate fusion? To address this question, we set up staging experiments with intact vacuoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Two reaction protocols were compared. In control reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), vacuoles were allowed to tether for 25 min. Trans-SNARE complex formation and fusion were then initiated by adding full-length Qc-wt. At various times before or after Qc-wt addition, inhibitors were added to the reactions. At all times up to −1 min before Qc addition (red dashed line), antibodies against the Rab, the SM, or the Qa-SNARE still partially or completely inhibited fusion. After Qc-wt addition, the reactions became resistant to these inhibitors within a couple of minutes. In a second set of reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), vacuoles were allowed to tether for 10 min. Qc-3∆ was then added and the reactions were incubated a further 15 min to allow trans-SNARE complex assembly. Finally, fusion was triggered by the addition of Sec17 (defined as t = 0). Before Qc-3∆ addition, antibodies against the Rab, the SM, or the Qa-SNARE largely or completely inhibited fusion. However, by −1 min before Sec17 addition (vertical red dashed line), and at subsequent time points, the reactions were insensitive to antibodies against the Rab, the HOPS SM subunit Vps33, and the Qa-SNARE Vam3. Qc-3∆ addition therefore drives the vacuoles into an operationally docked state. In this state, partially zipped trans-SNARE complexes have assembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schwartz and Merz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xu et al., 2010</xref>), and Sec17 efficiently triggers fusion even when inhibitors of the Rab, the SM, or the Qa-SNARE are present. We conclude that once the SNAREs are partially zipped, the Rab, the SM, and the Qa-SNARE either are no longer required, or they are in a state that is efficiently shielded from inhibitory antibodies. The docked, trans-SNARE paired vacuoles could still be prevented from fusing, however, by a peptide inhibitor of fusion, the MARCKS effector domain (MED), up to the moment of Sec17 triggering.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27396.013</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Staging of Sec17 rescue in cell-free assays of vacuole fusion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Master vacuole fusion reactions were assembled under no-ATP ‘bypass’ conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), and pre-incubated for 25 min at 27°C.

The vacuoles, now bearing partially zipped Qc-3∆ complexes, were then triggered by Sec17 addition, incubated for an additional 5 min, dissolved in nonionic detergent, and subjected to immunoprecipitation to retrieve Vps33-GFP and any associated proteins. As expected, Vps33 associated with Vps41, another HOPS subunit, under all conditions tested. Upon Qc-3∆ addition, Vps33/HOPS bound to the Qa- and R-SNAREs (compare lanes 1 and 2). In previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schwartz and Merz, 2009</xref>), we demonstrated that inhibition of the Ypt7 Rab by GDI prevents Qc-3–driven trans-SNARE complex assembly. Here, GDI addition 1 min prior to Qc-3∆ addition prevented association of the Qa, Qc, and R-SNAREs with Vps33 (lane 3). In contrast, addition of GDI after Qc-3∆ addition and trans-SNARE assembly did not cause the SNAREs to dissociate from Vps33/HOPS (lane 4). Thus, the Rab is needed both for Vps33/HOPS association with the SNARE proteins, and for assembly of the partially zipped trans-SNARE complex. Triggering of fusion by Sec17 addition (lane 5) caused ejection of Vps33/HOPS from the SNARE complex. This experiment cannot distinguish whether Vps33/HOPS dissociation from the SNAREs occurs prior to, during, or after the fusion event itself. However, structural studies of Vps33 suggest that Vps33 facilitates N-to-C zippering trans<italic>-</italic>SNARE complexes until they are in a partially zipped state, and imply that Vps33 must then dissociate for the completion of SNARE zippering and fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2015</xref>). Such a model is corroborated by laser tweezers experiments with Munc-18 and neuronal SNAREs the absence of membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ma et al., 2015</xref>). This model predicts that Vps33 should bind to quaternary SNARE complexes in solution more readily if the Qa and R-SNAREs have splayed C-terminal domains. To test this prediction, we assembled quaternary complexes of vacuolar SNARE cytoplasmic domains with either Qc-wt or Qc-5∆, and tested their ability to bind purified monomeric Vps33.

Moreover, the data imply, but do not prove, that Sec17 might be able to trigger fusion by binding to partially zipped SNARE complexes in the complete absence of HOPS and Vps33.

In reactions where the Qc-∆3 and Sec17 were added together at the beginning of the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>), Sec17 stimulated Qc-3∆-driven fusion in the presence of HOPS, and far less efficiently without HOPS.

Once a partially zipped trans<italic>-</italic>SNARE complex has assembled, however, HOPS (and its SM subunit Vps33) are dispensable. Sec17 therefore can augment the fusion activity of a trans-SNARE complex in the total absence of an SM or other tethering factors.

These portals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>) would allow SNARE residues spanning the partially-zipped helical bundle and the transmembrane anchors to pass cleanly between pairs of adjacent Sec17 subunits.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27396.016</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Working model.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Sec17/α-SNAP on quaternary SNARE complex (renderings based on PDB 3J96; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). In B, note the tapered overall shape of the SNARE-Sec17 complex, which forms a roughly triangular structure that could fit between two docked membranes bearing partially zipped SNARE complexes. The hydrophobic loop is magenta. The yellow ellipse shows one of four portals between adjacent Sec17 molecules, through which unstructured SNARE juxta-membrane regions could pass when SNAREs are complexed in the trans configuration. In C, one of four Sec17 molecules is omitted to reveal the Qc packing layers. The portal openings begin at approximately layer +6. Sec17 partially contacts the SNAREs to layer +7 or +8. (<bold>C</bold>) Interplay of Sec17 and SM-tethering complex on the forward fusion pathway. The early inhibitory function of Sec17 is likely to involve sequestration of SNAREs or SNARE complexes prior to the onset of trans-SNARE interactions. This early inhibition is suppressed by the SM (in our experiments, HOPS-Vps33). The late, stimulatory function of Sec17 can occur in either the absence or presence of HOPS/Vps33. When HOPS-Vps33 is present, Vps33 (SM) ejection from the SNARE complex is a prerequisite for completion of C-terminal SNARE zippering and fusion.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-27396-fig11-v2"/></fig><p>How does Sec17 promote fusion? Experiments with both vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schwartz and Merz, 2009</xref>) and RPLs (AJM, unpublished results) indicate that in Qc-∆ reactions, Sec17 addition triggers initiation of lipid mixing rather than the resolution of pre-formed hemifusion intermediates. Moreover, oligomerization of Sec17 on the SNARE complex is probably needed for augmentation of fusion. This suggestion is supported by two observations. First, Sec17 rescue of stalled Qc-∆ complexes is highly cooperative, with an apparent Hill coefficient ≥4 for Sec17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schwartz and Merz, 2009</xref>). Second, rigor-locked, ATPγS-bound Sec18 further enhances the ability of Sec17 to promote SNARE-mediated fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Song et al., 2017</xref>), likely by securing multiple copies of Sec17 on the SNARE complex.</p><p>Sec17 oligomers could increase SNARE-mediated fusion through any of several mechanisms. First, Sec17 could stabilize the C-terminal domain of the partially zipped SNARE complex in its folded state. Evidence for this force-clamp mechanism has grown considerably since it was originally proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schwartz and Merz, 2009</xref>). As shown in recent cryo-EM structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>), α-SNAP (mammalian Sec17) contacts the Qc up to layer +5 or +6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, in force spectroscopy experiments, α-SNAP binding increases the mechanical energy derived from C-terminal zippering by ~4 k<sub>B</sub>T, through conformational capture of thermally fluctuating, C-terminally zipped complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). In other words, Sec17 operates as a component of a SNARE-based Brownian ratchet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peskin et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>In a second mechanism, bulky residues on the Sec17 hydrophobic loop might drive into the membrane as a ‘wedge,’ increasing membrane bending energy at the incipient fusion site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sheetz and Singer, 1974</xref>). There is mixed evidence in support of this mechanism. In experiments with RPLs, Sec17 fused to a SNARE transmembrane domain stimulated fusion. The membrane-tethered form of Sec17-FSMS stimulated fusion with Qc-wt but not with Qc-3∆ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Song et al., 2017</xref>). A limitation of these experiments is that only a single concentration of the membrane-anchored forms of Sec17 was tested. In the present study, we tested the wedge model using a different approach. If hydrophobic residues in the Sec17 loop locally expand the area of the outer bilayer leaflet, we might predict that the two aromatic residues in the Sec17 loop should be of special importance. However, these residues seem to be more important for Sec17 membrane affinity than for augmentation of fusion per se, as at higher concentrations, a mutant lacking aromatic residues in the loop still allowed Qc-3∆ to drive substantial fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Taken together, our findings here and in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Song et al., 2017</xref> suggest that the Sec17 hydrophobic loop increases Sec17 affinity, but that a ‘wedge’ function may not be not strictly required for Sec17 augmentation of fusion.</p><p>In a third possible mechanism, the SM (HOPS/Vps33) is displaced when Sec17 is added to reactions with partially-zipped trans-complexes. As discussed above it is likely that SM displacement is essential for (and perhaps normally driven by) the completion of C-terminal zippering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). We previously demonstrated that three Sec17 molecules and one SM (Vps33 or Sly1) can bind to a single SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lobingier et al., 2014</xref>). On the partially zipped trans-complex, a fourth Sec17 molecule might competitively displace the SM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collins et al., 2005</xref>), facilitating the completion of SNARE zippering. However, while Sec17 may augment fusion <italic>in part</italic> by promoting SM ejection, we found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) that Sec17 can stimulate fusion in the complete absence of an SM (Vps33), and indeed, that Sec17-triggered fusion occurs with faster kinetics when HOPS/Vps33 is absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). An important challenge is to delineate the precise order of events that leads to SM ejection.</p><p>Our experiments here and in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Song et al., 2017</xref> further reveal that Sec17 residue K159 contributes to Sec17 augmentation of fusion. In α-SNAP, the homologous Lys residue interacts with the SNARE complex ionic 0 layer and contributes to disassembly of cis-SNARE complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). However, the K159E mutation had no detectable effect on the inhibitory function of Sec17, and Sec17-K159E is sufficient to support cellular viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Intriguingly, while K159 is highly conserved among Sec17, α-SNAP, and β-SNAP orthologs, the same position is K-to-E charge-reversed in γ-SNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bitto et al., 2008</xref>). This raises the intriguing possibility that the pro-fusion activity of the Sec17/α-SNAP sub-family is not shared by γ-SNAP. We speculate that γ-SNAP is expressed in cellular contexts where regulated exocytosis occurs, and where expression of α- or β-SNAP alone might increase the frequency of aberrant spontaneous exocytosis events.</p><p>Loss of SM function in vivo usually causes an absolute fusion defect. Hence, SMs have been considered to be part of the core SNARE fusion machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carr and Rizo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Südhof and Rothman, 2009</xref>). However, the mechanisms through which SMs promote fusion have been controversial. It is clear that some SMs stimulate SNARE-mediated fusion in vitro by several-fold in the absence of Sec17 and Sec18, but this activity is probably not sufficient to account for the all-or-nothing SM requirements consistently observed in vivo. Moreover, not all basal SNARE-mediated fusion reactions that might be predicted to be stimulated by a given SM are actually stimulated, when tested in minimal fusion systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furukawa and Mima, 2014</xref>). One explanation for this is a requirement for molecular crowding, supported by experiments with synthetic crowding agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furukawa and Mima, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). In the presence of Sec17 and Sec18, however, SM activity becomes indispensable for fusion, both in vitro in the absence of crowding agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mima et al., 2008</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lobingier et al., 2014</xref>). Our experiments and others indicate that in the absence of the SM, Sec17 can stimulate fusion once trans-SNARE complexes are partially zippered, but that prior to trans-SNARE assembly, Sec17 (alone or in combination with Sec18) is inhibitory. In the <italic>presence</italic> of the SM, the early inhibitory effect of Sec17 is at least partially obscured.</p><p>Thus, it is increasingly evident that SM proteins have the properties of true enzymes. In our working model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>), SM proteins take R- and Q-SNAREs as substrates and promote assembly of the trans-SNARE complex to its metastable half-zipped state. At the same time, the SMs prevent non-productive off-pathway reactions, including early inhibition of fusion by Sec17. In addition, the SNARE-bound SM directly impedes trans-SNARE complex disassembly by Sec18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lobingier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). The SM probably inspects the composition and shape of the incipient trans<italic>-</italic>SNARE complex; if the SM fails to bind, or if the SM dissociates prematurely, the inhibitory activities of Sec17 and Sec18 are unrestrained: fusion is blocked by Sec17 and the complex is then disassembled by Sec18. Tests in vivo support key predictions of this scheme. First, Sec17 overproduction rescues fusion driven by Qc-5∆ in vivo. Second, this rescue occurs only when HOPS/SM activity is augmented. These results suggest that the basal level of in vivo HOPS activity is insufficient to overcome Sec17 inhibition of early docking when Sec17 is overproduced. Third, wild-type cells show no overt defects when Sec17 is overproduced, but Sec17 overproduction causes trafficking defects and toxicity in cells with partial SM deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lobingier et al., 2014</xref>). The overall picture that emerges is one where SM proteins can functionally interact with SNAREs and Sec17 during docking, and SMs in turn dictate the functional outcomes of Sec17, Sec18, and SNARE interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and yeast strains</title><p>Yeast culture and genetic manipulations were done using standard methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amberg et al., 2005</xref>).

Cells were pelleted and resuspended in synthetic media supplemented with 5 µM FM4-64 (Life Technologies), then incubated ≥20 min at 30°C. Labeled cells were rinsed once in synthetic media before resuspension in synthetic complete or dropout media and shaking at 30°C for 30 to 60 min. Cells were maintained in logarithmic growth phase (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.3 to 0.8) until observation by microscopy.

Cells were retrieved by centrifugation, suspended in 100 µL 1 × SDS loading buffer with 100-µL glass beads, heated to 95°C for 10 min, and vortexed for 5 min to disrupt the cell wall and cell membrane. Cell extracts were separated from glass beads by centrifugation at 1000 × g, and then insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g. Samples were analyzed by SDS‐PAGE and western blotting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunoprecipitation</title><p>For SNARE immunoprecipitations, affinity-purified Vam3 antibodies were covalently coupled to Protein A agarose beads using dimethyl pimelimidate (DMP; Pierce) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harlow and Lane, 1999</xref>). Logarithmic phase cultures were harvested and spheroplasted. Briefly, 20 OD<sub>600</sub>·mL of cells were sedimented then resuspended in 2 mL 0.1 M Tris·Cl pH 9.4, 10 mM DTT for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were sedimented and resuspended in 4 mL spheroplasting buffer (yeast nitrogen base, 2% w/v glucose, 0.05% w/v casamino acids, 1M sorbitol, 50 mM Na·HEPES pH 7.4), then incubated with lyticase (re-purified Zymolyase 20T; Sekigaku USA, Jersey City, New Jersey, USA) at 30°C for 30 min. Spheroplasts were sedimented once in spheroplasting buffer and resuspended in 2 mL ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mM Na·HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 20% w/v glycerol, 2 mM EDTA, 1 µg/mL aprotinin, 1 µg/mL leupeptin, 1 µg/mL pepstatin, 0.1 mM Pefabloc-SC, 1 mM PMSF, and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA)), and lysed by ~30 strokes with an ice-cold dounce homogenizer. Cell lysates were supplemented with 1% (v/v) Anapoe X-100 (Anatrace, Moumee, Ohio, USA) and nutated at 4°C for 15 min. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Clarified lysate was mixed with anti-Vam3-protein A beads and nutated for 30 min at 4°C. Beads were recovered by low-speed centrifugation and rinsed four times in lysis buffer containing 0.5% (v/v) Anapoe X-100. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laemmli, 1970</xref>). Unbound proteins remaining in the cell lysates were precipitated by addition of 1/10 vol. 0.15% deoxycholate and 1/10 vol of 100% TCA. The precipitates rinsed twice in acetone and resuspended in sample buffer (40 µL per OD<sub>600</sub> × mL equivalent). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted to nitrocellulose, probed with primary antibodies as indicated in the figures and secondary antibodies as recommended by the manufacturer (LiCor), and analyzed on a LiCor Odyssey imaging system. For Vps33-GFP, anti-GFP immunoprecipitations were conducted as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collins et al.

Extracts were clarified at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. Extracts were incubated for 3 hr with affinity resins and eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. The fusion capacity of the vacuole preparations used for the immunoprecipitations was verified in parallel cell-free fusion reactions containing both BJ2168‐Vps33‐GFP reporter and DKY6281 acceptor vacuoles.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>In vitro fusion assays</title><p>Vacuole fusion assays were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schwartz and Merz, 2009</xref>). Dose-activity curves were fitted with the Hill single-site model with adjustable slope, using the nonlinear least-squares method (GraphPad Prism). Dose-inhibition curves for Sec17 were fit with the same model but with the slopes locked to unity, after determining that an adjustable slope parameter did not improve the fits. RPLs were formed by dialysis from β-octylglucoside proteolipid mixed micelles as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zick et al.

A defined lipid composition similar to that of the yeast vacuole was employed (vacuolar membrane lipids, (VML; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zick et al., 2014</xref>). The protein:lipid ratios were 1:1000 for Qa, Qb, and R SNAREs, and 1:2000 for Ypt7. The RPL fusion assays were set up as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zick et al., 2015</xref>) but that bovine serum albumin was omitted from all RPL reactions except those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C,D</xref>. 100% fusion was defined as complete association of the FRET probes encapsulated within the two vesicle populations, as determined in control reactions. 0% fusion was defined by control reactions with no added Qc-SNARE.

There are two substantial areas where this paper complements Wickner's paper: (1) testing of different truncation mutants of Vam7 with native vacuoles. Similar to what is reported in Wickner's paper using synthetic proteoliposomes, deletion of three layers (Qc-3∆) causes a defect. If an additional layer is truncated (Qc-2∆), Sec17 does not rescue, but if fewer layers are omitted (Qc-4∆), Sec17 rescues the effect of the truncation mutants similar to what is reported in Wickner's paper. (2) Sec17 has both inhibitory and fusion-promoting effects depending if it is acting before or after HOPS is included.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As the reviewers also suggested for the related paper, in the context of Figures 3 and 8, it would be interesting to also probe the interactions found by Zhao et al., (2015) that affect the interaction between aSNAP and the SNARE complex, in particular mutations that interact with SNARE residues near the ionic layer and that disrupt disassembly function (Figure 6 in Zhao et al., 2015). Such an experiment would support the proposed notion that it is the interaction between Sec17 and the SNARE complex that compensates for the deletion of the C-terminal residues of Vam7 (Figure 3), and if the inhibitory activity of Sec17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) also depends on this interaction.</p><p>2) Throughout the manuscript it is suggested that Sec17 promotes fusion. However, an alternative explanation could be that this is an indirect effect caused by the interaction of Sec17 with the SNARE complex, i.e. Sec17 would make the SNARE complex more fusogenic, similar to the role of HOPS as proposed by Zick &amp; Wickner, (2014), and see also Baker et al., 2015. Another possibility would be that the hydrophobic loops play a role in recruitment of Sec17 to the membrane. Finally, the loops could perturb the membrane, and indeed play a more direct role in fusion. It would be desirable to discuss such an alternative explanation and perhaps tone down the wording related &quot;fusion&quot; in several places in the manuscript.</p><p>3) The manuscript is poorly written, not in terms of grammar but with regard to logical flow and inclusion of sufficient explanations of the experiments that were performed. Often the figure legends do not contain enough details to understand what is shown and just give a conclusion. The experimental section also needs a lot more detail.</p><p>4) The related paper by Wickner et al., is only briefly mentioned in a few places. Considering the partial overlap and complementarity between these papers, the key findings of the Wickner et al., paper should be introduced and summarized in the Introduction and then discussed again in the conclusions.</p><p>5) One of the key results is the synergy observed between Sec17 and Sec18 in Figure 4. However, this synergy is pretty much ignored in the main conclusions of the paper, including the title, the abstract and the discussion. This is particularly worrisome because the paper is co-submitted with another paper that also makes a strong point on this synergy. And most problematic of all is the fact that it is not clear if the experiments were performed in the presence of Mg-ATP. This is critical, because the results would be very interesting if Mg-ATP were not present, as they would suggest roles in fusion for both Sec17 and Sec18. However, if Mg-ATP were present, the results are expected because Sec18 and Sec17 can synergize in disassembling unproductive t-SNARE complexes (which has been very well documented by the Wickner lab).</p><p>6) The title and several parts of the manuscript suggest that the authors are bringing key insights into the function of SM proteins and why are they so essential. However, it is not so clear what are the new insights and the discussion is particularly confusing in this respect. The data of Figure 8 show some very interesting differences in the need for HOPS depending on the way the experiments are staged, but the implications of the results are not clearly explained-discussed. Note also that this aspect of the paper was limited to including only the Qc-3∆ complex. Data obtained with other Qc-∆ complexes as in Figure 4 would strengthen the story and the potential conclusions that can be drawn.</p><p>7) Discussion section. Please note that Zhao et al., 2015 also reported a 20S complex with only two aSNAPs bound (Figure 7 in that paper, involving VAMP-7). The experiments reported here suggest that if there were only two Sec17 molecules bound to the vacuolar SNARE complex, then they should interaction with the Qc &quot;face&quot; of the SNARE complex in order to stabilize the truncated cis-SNARE complex. This would allow one SM molecule bind to the face that is not occupied by Sec17 molecules. This possibility should be discussed.</p><p>8) Figure 6B shows a significant decrease in the rate of membrane fusion when the wild-type Sec17 is present in a high concentration, which is not seen in Figure 4. Is the decrease caused by inhibition of initial SNARE zippering by Sec17?</p><p>9) Figure 7A is difficult to understand and does not well compare to Figure 7B. Does Figure 7A indicate that Rab and SM are not important to nucleate SNARE zippering?</p><p>10) Please clarify the statement in the Introduction: &quot;Reconstitution experiments suggested that the SM requirement is fully realized only in the presence of Sec17 and Sec18&quot; and similar arguments in the Introduction. In the absence of Sec17 and Sec18, Munc18-1 is shown to enhance the rate of SNARE-mediated membrane fusion by ~10 fold (Yu et al., 2015; Shen 2007), which is as much as in the presence of Sec17 and Sec18.</p><p>11) In subsection “Sec17 interacts with partially-zipped SNAREs to control fusion”, it is stated that &quot;We further propose that this state corresponds to metastable, partially-zipped SNARE conformations observed in force spectroscopy studies (Liu et al., 2006; Min et al., 2013; Zorman et al., 2014). In the &quot;half-zipped&quot; state, the neuronal t/Q-SNARE complex is structured to layer +4 (Ma et al., 2016), a result in precise agreement with the present experiments.&quot; The citations here are not so accurate. Liu et al., did not observe a half-zippered state as in other references cited here. The work of Ma et al., 2016, did not reveal any structure partially zippered to +4. Another work of Ma et al., 2015 revealed two partially-zippered states, one between layers -1 and 0 and the other between layers 2 and 3, but not layer +4, because the VAMP2 mutation at this layer decreased zippering of the C-terminal domain, but not other domains.</p><p>12) Figure 8D-E: The observation that SM proteins attenuate SNARE CTD zippering was previously reported for Munc18-1 in Ma et al., 2015. This finding is counter-intuitive, but is also consistent with the template model proposed by Baker et al.</p><p>13) Discussion section: &quot;Fifth, Sec17 and SM proteins can simultaneously and cooperatively bind quaternary SNARE bundles, with the bound SM opposing Sec18-mediated SNARE disassembly&quot;. It may be confusing to emphasize this point, because the authors stated earlier that SM proteins should be displaced for SNAREs to fully zipper. It is understandable that SM proteins protect the functionally important partially-zippered SNARE complex from pre-mature disassembly by Sec17 and Sec18. What's the biological function for SM proteins to protect the assembled helix bundle?</p><p>14) Discussion section: &quot;First, Sec17 could stabilize the partially-zipped SNARE complex&quot;. This sentence may be confusing. Stabilizing the partially-zippered SNARE complex would either promote initial SNARE zippering (relative to unzipped state) or hinder CTD zippering (relative to the folded four-helix bundle state), which contradicts the model shown in Figure 9. It seems that Sec17 stabilizes the folded four-helix bundle state.</p><p>15). In subsection “HOPS selects the outcome of Sec17–SNARE interactions”, the authors write 'Sec17 triggered fusion by pre-formed Qc-3∆ complexes in PEG reactions just as efficiently as in the HOPS reactions', but the data in Figure 8D suggest that the HOPS reaction is actually quite slower. This could be an important result. What does it mean?</p><p>16) When discussing the observation that Sec17 can inhibit fusion, the authors should consider the possibility that such inhibition arises because of binding of Sec17 to non-productive t-SNARE complexes, thus stabilizing these complexes and preventing SNARE complex assembly.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Sec17 (α-SNAP) and an SM-tethering complex regulate the outcome of SNARE zippering <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor), and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The last sentence of the abstract and also the last one of the introduction suggest that they authors are uncovering the reason for the essential nature of SM proteins. However, the major concepts underlying this essential nature (the orchestration of SNARE complex assembly while protecting against disassembly by Sec18-Sec17) were already shown a long time ago by the Wickner lab. The authors do add another layer by providing evidence that HOPS prevents the inhibitory function of Sec17, which is interesting, but cannot be considered 'the observation' that makes SM proteins essential. In this context, the importance of Wickner's work is also ignored in the third paragraph of the introduction. The authors should rephrase all these parts of the manuscript accordingly.</p><p>In the Results section and particularly in the Discussion section, the authors argue against the idea that the N-terminal hydrophobic loop of Sec17 acts as a wedge to induce membrane fusion, but the argument is quite weak because it is based on the data acquired with one mutant (with the RSKSR sequence in the loop) that needs to be added at high concentrations to support fusion.</p><p>The authors previously published that Sec17 enhances SM protein binding to the SNARE complex, while now they propose that Sec17 dissociates the SM protein. This apparent contradiction was previously pointed out and was not properly addressed in the rebuttal letter or in the manuscript.</p><p>There is no legend for Figures 7D, E.</p><p>The title of Figure 9 is too strong as the conclusion is not really demonstrated by the data.</p><p>The error bars in Figure 4 are plotted in a weird asymmetrical way as if the data are poorly fit. I would suggest a symmetric way to plot the error (mean with + and – std or sem).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27396.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This manuscript is related to Wickner et al., which is currently under revision at eLife.

Such an experiment would support the proposed notion that it is the interaction between Sec17 and the SNARE complex that compensates for the deletion of the C-terminal residues of Vam7 (Figure 3), and if the inhibitory activity of Sec17 (Figure 8) also depends on this interaction.</p></disp-quote><p>This was a great idea. We constructed and purified three Sec17 mutants: K159E, K163E, and a mutant containing both substitutions (“KEKE”). RPL fusion and binding experiments with the Sec17-KEKE mutant are reported in Song et al. Vacuole fusion experiments and in vivo functional tests are reported for all three mutants in this study. In addition, we now characterize four new mutations in the Sec17 hydrophobic loop, in vacuole fusion assays (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). The ionic layer interaction mutants and the loop mutants have dramatically divergent properties.</p><p>In new experiments testing the ability of the mutants to rescue fusion with partially-zipped (Qc-3∆) SNARE complexes (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), the Sec17 K159E mutant exhibits a ~1-log rightward shift in the Sec17 dose-response curve, as well as a decreased total fusion response. Sec17 K163E, on the adjacent α-helix, acts like the wild type, while the KEKE double mutant acts like the K159E single mutant – affirming the importance of the zero layer-interacting residue K159. In addition, all five hydrophobic loop mutants (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) are severely compromised in their ability to trigger fusion with Qc-3∆ SNARE complexes. We conclude that both the Sec17 hydrophobic loop and Sec17 interaction with the SNARE complex near layer 0 are important for Sec17 augmentation of fusion.</p><p>In a second set of additional experiments (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) we tested the inhibitory effects of the substitutions. The charge reversal mutations at positions 159 and 163 had no detectable effect on the dose-response of inhibition. In dramatic contrast, mutants in the N-terminal hydrophobic loop were inhibitory only at concentrations 40-200 times higher than the wild type. We conclude that Sec17 position K159 is important for maximal SNARE disassembly and for efficient rescue of partially zipped (Qc-3∆) SNARE complexes, but that K159 has no obvious role in the inhibition of fusion by Sec17. This in turn implies that membrane interaction, but not SNARE ionic layer interaction, is important for Sec17-mediated inhibition of fusion – just as the referee seems to have surmised. These new experiments have been integrated into the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Throughout the manuscript it is suggested that Sec17 promotes fusion. However, an alternative explanation could be that this is an indirect effect caused by the interaction of Sec17 with the SNARE complex, i.e., Sec17 would make the SNARE complex more fusogenic, similar to the role of HOPS as proposed by Zick &amp; Wickner, (2014), and see also Baker et al., 2015. Another possibility would be that the hydrophobic loops play a role in recruitment of Sec17 to the membrane. Finally, the loops could perturb the membrane, and indeed play a more direct role in fusion. It would be desirable to discuss such an alternative explanation and perhaps tone down the wording related &quot;fusion&quot; in several places in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the referees’ interpretation here, and indeed we explicitly proposed possible alternative mechanisms similar to those suggested by the referee in our original Discussion. Here is the relevant text:</p><p><italic><underline>How does Sec17 promote lipid mixing? First</underline>, Sec17 could stabilize the partially-zipped SNARE complex. α-SNAP (mammalian Sec17) Sec17 contacts the Qc up to layer +5 or +6 (Figure 9C; Zhao et al., 2015), and single molecule experiments with partially-zipped SNARE complexes reveal that α-SNAP stabilizes C-terminal zippering by ~4 k<sub>B</sub>T, through “conformational capture” of thermally fluctuating, partially-zipped complexes. In other words Sec17 may operate as part of a SNARE-based Brownian ratchet (Peskin et al., 1993). <underline>Second</underline>, Sec17 bound to the trans-SNARE complex may operate as a wedge that increases local membrane bending energy at the fusion site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). <underline>Third</underline>, the hydrophobic residues in Sec17 may locally perturb the outer bilayer leaflet, as proposed for synaptotagmin in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggering of synchronous neurotransmitter release. Indeed, Sec17 and synaptotagmin compete for binding to SNARE complexes (Sollner et al., 1993), suggesting that Sec17 and synaptotagmin may be alternative factors that execute analogous triggering functions. <underline>Fourth</underline>, we have previously shown that three Sec17 molecules and one SM can bind to a single SNARE complex (Lobingier et al., 2014). A fourth Sec17 molecule might competitively displace the SM (Collins et al., 2005), facilitating the completion of SNARE zippering. Consistent with this idea, Sec17 rescue of stalled Qc-∆ complexes is highly cooperative, with an apparent Hill coefficient ≥4 (Schwartz and Merz, 2009). The idea that Sec17 oligomerization is needed for Sec17’s fusogenic function is further supported by the finding that rigor-locked, ATPγS-bound Sec18 augments the fusogenic activity of Sec17 (Wickner et al.). [Emphasis added]</italic></p><p>We did not intend to assert that Sec17 directly catalyzes fusion but rather that in the presence of Sec17, SNARE-mediated fusion is stimulated or augmented. In the revised manuscript we take greater care to be precise on this point, and we’ve avoided using the word “fusogenic” when referring to Sec17.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The manuscript is poorly written, not in terms of grammar but with regard to logical flow and inclusion of sufficient explanations of the experiments that were performed. Often the figure legends do not contain enough details to understand what is shown and just give a conclusion. The experimental section also needs a lot more detail.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the overly telegraphic style. We have revised the Results section, Materials and methods section and Legends to add (or emphasize) critical experimental details.

Considering the partial overlap and complementarity between these papers, the key findings of the Wickner et al., paper should be introduced and summarized in the Introduction and then discussed again in the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>In the previous submission, the manuscript by Wickner et al., (now Song et al., 2017) was referenced no fewer than ten separate times in the Introduction, Results section and Discussion section. With the Song et al., paper now revised and published, we present further comparisons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) One of the key results is the synergy observed between Sec17 and Sec18 in Figure 4. However, this synergy is pretty much ignored in the main conclusions of the paper, including the title, the abstract and the discussion. This is particularly worrisome because the paper is co-submitted with another paper that also makes a strong point on this synergy. And most problematic of all is the fact that it is not clear if the experiments were performed in the presence of Mg-ATP. This is critical, because the results would be very interesting if Mg-ATP were not present, as they would suggest roles in fusion for both Sec17 and Sec18. However, if Mg-ATP were present, the results are expected because Sec18 and Sec17 can synergize in disassembling unproductive t-SNARE complexes (which has been very well documented by the Wickner lab).</p></disp-quote><p>We did not dwell on the synergy with Sec18 because an exploration of that synergy is a central focus of Song et al., (2017). All treatments in our were indeed done in the presence of 1 mM Mg•ATP (not ATPγS); that was indicated directly in earlier drafts and accidentally omitted. We apologize for the oversight. We agree with the referee’s interpretation that one function of Sec18 is to recycle unproductive SNARE complexes so that they get additional chances to catalyze fusion. Indeed, a mutant breaking the Sec17-Sec18 interaction (<italic>SEC17-LALA</italic>) is one of the few directed mutations in Sec17 that renders cells inviable (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). When overproduced, Sec17-LALA protein is dominant-negative (our unpublished results). This implies that Sec18-mediated SNARE disassembly is, as most would expect, the core and essential function of Sec17. The key point here, however, is that even in the absence of Sec18 or Sec18 activity, Sec17 augments the fusion capacity of SNARE truncation mutants or (as we have shown in Zick et al., 2015 and Song et al., 2017) full-length SNARES. We reiterate that we first reported that Sec17 can augment fusion without Sec18 in Schwartz and Merz (JCB 2009). In that paper we demonstrated Sec17 stimulation of fusion with Qc-3∆ and native vacuoles in the presence of inhibitory anti-Sec18 antibodies and in the absence of ATP or ATPγS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The title and several parts of the manuscript suggest that the authors are bringing key insights into the function of SM proteins and why are they so essential. However, it is not so clear what are the new insights and the discussion is particularly confusing in this respect.</p></disp-quote><p>The core of our argument is that Sec17, in addition to its canonical functions in post-fusion SNARE disassembly, has <italic>both</italic> inhibitory and stimulatory effects on the forward docking and fusion pathway. We show that the effects of Sec17 are different before and after trans-SNARE complex assembly to a partially-zipped intermediate, and we demonstrate that one function of the SM is to help its cognate SNAREs “choose” which modes of Sec17 action will predominate: specifically, the SM allows the reaction to bypass the early inhibitory action of Sec17. For these reasons, Sec17 comes before the SM in the paper’s title.</p><p>It’s also critical to note that nearly all published data on the roles of Sec17 in docking and fusion has been derived from in vitro systems. When this paper was submitted, there was only one other study we’re aware of (Lobingier et al., 2014) that begins to tie together the multiple functions of Sec17, and the interplay between Sec17 and SMs, in parallel experiments conducted both in vitro and in vivo. (Another, very interesting in vivo paper on Munc18, NSF, and priming was published about a week ago; He … Verhage, 2017). We want to know how the biochemistry plays out in life. This manuscript and our previous studies represent steps toward that broader, longer-term goal. We have revised our discussion to clarify what we know about SM function in vivo vs. in vitro.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The data of Figure 8 show some very interesting differences in the need for HOPS depending on the way the experiments are staged, but the implications of the results are not clearly explained-discussed. Note also that this aspect of the paper was limited to including only the Qc-3∆ complex. Data obtained with other Qc-∆ complexes as in Figure 4 would strengthen the story and the potential conclusions that can be drawn.</p></disp-quote><p>Because the Qc-4∆ and Qc-3∆ complexes exhibit indistinguishable behavior in our assays, it wasn’t clear what hypotheses would be tested by this comparison. However, we analyzed a new series of Sec17 mutations in both the SNARE 0-layer binding region (3 mutants) and in the Sec17 apolar loop (5 mutants). The resulting new data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> of the revised manuscript, and as summarized in the Results section and in our reply to Query #1, the results were highly informative. We’ve made every effort to more clearly spell out the implications of the experiment in the former Figure 8 (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), and we’ve added a key experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, showing ejection of Vps33/HOPS from the SNAREs when Sec17 is added to trigger fusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Discussion section. Please note that Zhao et al., 2015 also reported a 20S complex with only two aSNAPs bound (Figure 7 in that paper, involving VAMP-7). The experiments reported here suggest that if there were only two Sec17 molecules bound to the vacuolar SNARE complex, then they should interaction with the Qc &quot;face&quot; of the SNARE complex in order to stabilize the truncated cis-SNARE complex. This would allow one SM molecule bind to the face that is not occupied by Sec17 molecules. This possibility should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>As we wrote in the Discussion section of the original submission (emphasis added):</p><p>Recent structures of mammalian SNARE-Sec17-Sec18 particles <underline>(Zhao et al., 2015)</underline>(Zhou et al., 2015) reveal a Sec17 geometry precisely optimized for interaction with both cis- and partially-zipped trans-complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). <italic>Up to four Sec17 molecules</italic> bind each SNARE complex […] we have previously shown that three Sec17 molecules and one SM can bind to a single SNARE complex (Lobingier et al., 2014). A fourth Sec17 molecule might competitively displace the SM (Collins et al., 2005), facilitating the completion of SNARE zippering. Consistent with this idea, Sec17 rescue of stalled Qc-∆ complexes is highly cooperative, with an apparent Hill coefficient ≥4 (Schwartz and Merz, 2009). The idea that Sec17 oligomerization is needed for Sec17’s fusogenic function is further supported by the finding that rigor-locked, ATPγS-bound Sec18 augments the fusogenic activity of Sec17 (Wickner et al.,).</p><p>In other words, we think we’re in agreement with the Referee on this point. We have modified the text to be sure that readers understand the point that 0-4 Sec17 molecules can bind the SNARE complex. In addition, we have now tested a key prediction of the model. In the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> we show that HOPS/Vps33 associates with the Qc-3∆ SNARE complex in a docking reaction that depends on the Ypt7 Rab; HOPS/Vps33 then dissociates from the SNAREs when fusion is triggered by Sec17 addition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 6B shows a significant decrease in the rate of membrane fusion when the wild-type Sec17 is present in a high concentration, which is not seen in Figure 4. Is the decrease caused by inhibition of initial SNARE zippering by Sec17?</p></disp-quote><p>We infer that at higher Sec17 concentrations, the reduced rescue of Qc-∆ SNARE complexes is due to inhibition at an early, pre-zippering stage – probably cis-capture of SNAREs, as originally suggested by Wang et al., (2004). We use reaction conditions like those of Wang et al., in our newly-added evaluation of inhibition by Sec17 and its mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Jahn’s lab has proposed an alternative inhibitory mechanism of α-SNAP; in those experiments, the inhibition seems to occur after zippering has initiated (Park et al., 2014). Both the kinetic and staging data in this manuscript, and the earlier vacuole work by Wang et al., are consistent with inhibition before rather than after trans-SNARE complex formation.</p><p>In this context it may be useful to note that results with RPLs and vacuoles are broadly consistent. The two Sec17 concentrations chosen for our RPL experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (100 and 600 nM) correspond to Sec17 concentrations that resulted in ~10% rescue and near-maximal Qc-3∆ or Qc-4∆ rescue, in experiments with vacuoles in vitro (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In the Song et al., companion study, no dose-response curves were presented, and only a single Sec17 concentration (660 nM) was evaluated, for both WT and mutant forms of Sec17. Similarly, only a single Sec18 concentration, 334 nM, was tested in the Song et al., study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 7A is difficult to understand and does not well compare to Figure 7B. Does Figure 7A indicate that Rab and SM are not important to nucleate SNARE zippering?</p></disp-quote><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> (formerly 7A), the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, and published results (e.g. Ungermann et al., 1998; Collins and Wickner, 2007; Schwartz and Merz, 2009) all indicate that the Rab and SM are critical for nucleation of SNARE zippering with either full-length Qc (Vam7) or Qc-∆ proteins on native vacuoles. We now emphasize this point more strongly in the Results section and Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Please clarify the statement in the Introduction: &quot;Reconstitution experiments suggested that the SM requirement is fully realized only in the presence of Sec17 and Sec18&quot; and similar arguments in the Introduction. In the absence of Sec17 and Sec18, Munc18-1 is shown to enhance the rate of SNARE-mediated membrane fusion by ~10 fold (Yu, et al., 2015; Shen, 2007), which is as much as in the presence of Sec17 and Sec18.</p></disp-quote><p>In Shen et al., (2007), stimulation of the initial rate of fusion by &gt;5-fold was observed solely with pre-assembled SNARE complexes that incorporated a place-holder VAMP2 “cdv2” fragment, while both Furukawa and Mima, (2014), and Yu et al., (2015) reported SM stimulation &gt;5-fold in the presence of molecular crowding agents. We agree that these are pioneering experiments, and we now discuss them in a bit more detail. However, synthetic crowding agents might or might not replicate crowding in the native cytoplasmic environment: it is established that synthetic crowding agents can also eliminate known in vivo requirements for Rabs, for tethering factors such as HOPS, and even for the SM proteins themselves (e.g. Dennison et al., 2006; Hickey and Wickner, 2010; Zick and Wickner, 2013; this manuscript).</p><p>It is at least as clear that in the absence of an SM, Sec17 and Sec18 + Mg•ATP can completely suppress basal SNARE mediated fusion (e.g., Mima et al., 2008; Ma et al., 2013). Moreover, the combination of an SM with Sec17 and Sec18 + Mg•ATP) yields synergistic fusion over and above that seen with an SM plus SNAREs alone (ibid.; Song et al., 2017; this manuscript). This might originally have been attributed solely to the “churning” function of Sec18: cycles of assembly and disassembly giving more SNARE complexes the opportunity to trigger fusion. However, experiments in systems lacking either Mg•ATP, active Sec18, or both (Shwartz and Merz, 2009; Zick et al., 2015; Song et al.,; and this manuscript) suggest that there is more going on here than solely Sec18-catalyzed churning of SNARE complexes. Together, the data suggest models in which the SM functions not only with the SNAREs alone, but as an interaction partner of Sec17 (and perhaps of Sec18) on the forward docking and fusion pathway.</p><p>We emphasize that this interpretation not only does not exclude, but <italic>requires, and is an elaboration on</italic>, the increasingly well-accepted hypothesis that SMs are sensu stricto catalysts of forward trans-SNARE complex formation.</p><p>We have re-worded the section flagged by the referee to clarify these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) In subsection “Sec17 interacts with partially-zipped SNAREs to control fusion”, it is stated that &quot;We further propose that this state corresponds to metastable, partially-zipped SNARE conformations observed in force spectroscopy studies (Liu et al., 2006; Min et al., 2013; Zorman et al., 2014). In the &quot;half-zipped&quot; state, the neuronal t/Q-SNARE complex is structured to layer +4 (Ma et al., 2016), a result in precise agreement with the present experiments.&quot; The citations here are not so accurate. Liu et al., did not observe a half-zippered state as in other references cited here. The work of Ma et al., 2016, did not reveal any structure partially zippered to +4. Another work of Ma et al., 2015 revealed two partially-zippered states, one between layers -1 and 0 and the other between layers 2 and 3, but not layer +4, because the VAMP2 mutation at this layer decreased zippering of the C-terminal domain, but not other domains.</p></disp-quote><p>We could and should have been more precise in our citation of the literature. We have improved the passage in question and we are grateful to the Referee for pointing out that deficiency. We agree it’s arguable that Liu et al., did not observe a half-zipped state (but were attempting to give the benefit of the doubt in our citation of prior art).</p><p>Nevertheless, the original summary of the state of the science is accurate. There are two issues here: (i) the folding state of the t/Q-SNARE complex; and (ii), the zippering of the trans-SNARE complex.</p><p>(i) In the text of our original manuscript, we wrote: “In the &quot;half-zipped&quot; state, the neuronal t/Q-SNARE complex is structured to layer +4 (Ma et al., 2016), a result in precise agreement with the present experiments.&quot; This is correct. As the referee says, Ma et al. 2016 analyzed the isolated t/Q-SNARE complex (without an R-SNARE):</p><p>“Based on this inferred folding pathway, the positions of the partially zippered state 3 and the folded state 2 were mainly determined by their extensions relative to the extension of the unfolded state 4. The model fitting showed that the folded t-SNARE complex was largely a three-helix bundle with frayed C termini for both syntaxin and SN1. The boundary between the ordered and disordered regions lay approximately between the +4 and +5 layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).”</p><p>They continue: “We derived a structural model for the t-SNARE complex in which the three SNARE motifs formed a three-helix bundle from −7 to +4 layers and were disordered from +5 to +8 layers.”</p><p>(ii) The question then arising is whether this is actually the state of the t/Q-SNARE complex in a half-zipped trans-complex. Zhang et al., have repeatedly argued, based on multiple lines of evidence, that it is. Figure 1E from Ma et al. (2016, Cell Reports) shows their interpretation in graphical form. Note that in State 3, the partially or half-zipped complex, the t/Q SNAREs are structured to layer +4.</p><p>There’s a very similar schema in Ma et al., 2015 <italic>eLife</italic> (by coincidence, also Figure 1E). In that paper Ma et al., write:</p><p>“In the partially-zippered state 3, the VAMP2 CTD and the t-SNARE CTD are <underline>un</underline>folded from layer +8 to layer +3 and layer +5, respectively, whereas the remainder of the SNAREs are largely helical as in the four-helix bundle. This structure is consistent with that of a different trans-SNARE complex located on the yeast vacuole (Schwartz and Merz, 2009).” [Emphasis added.]</p><p>In independent force spectroscopy experiments, a metastable, partially-zipped intermediate was also reported, with the R-SNARE zipped to an ensemble of states from layer -2 to +2 and, again, the authors interpret their data as indicating that the t/Q-SNARE CTD is structured beyond the +2 layer (Min et al., 2013). Thus, the results in the literature are generally consistent between research groups, and are consistent with both our descriptions and our experimental findings.</p><p>Again, we thank the referee for prompting us to go back and take another look at these beautiful papers. Doing so has allowed us to improve both the Results and the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Figure 8D-E: The observation that SM proteins attenuate SNARE CTD zippering was previously reported for Munc18-1 in Ma et al., 2015. This finding is counter-intuitive, but is also consistent with the template model proposed by Baker et al.,.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a critical point and we thank the Referee for the reminder. The Zhang lab’s laser tweezers experiments are consistent both with the Baker-Hughson Vps33 structures and with our fusion experiments. We now cite the Ma 2015 paper. Moreover, we now show that HOPS/Vps33 is ejected from the Qc-3∆ pre-fusion complex when Sec17 is added to trigger fusion (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Discussion section: &quot;Fifth, Sec17 and SM proteins can simultaneously and cooperatively bind quaternary SNARE bundles, with the bound SM opposing Sec18-mediated SNARE disassembly&quot;. It may be confusing to emphasize this point, because the authors stated earlier that SM proteins should be displaced for SNAREs to fully zipper. It is understandable that SM proteins protect the functionally important partially-zippered SNARE complex from pre-mature disassembly by Sec17 and Sec18. What's the biological function for SM proteins to protect the assembled helix bundle?</p></disp-quote><p>We have reason to suspect, but cannot yet say with certainty, that the C-termini of the SNAREs in the SM-Sec17-SNARE complex characterized in solution in Lobingier et al., 2014 are splayed (as in a trans- complex). If that were the case, SM-Sec17-SNARE complex might represent a docked-, trans-paired intermediate. We are working toward a more definitive characterization of this complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Discussion section: &quot;First, Sec17 could stabilize the partially-zipped SNARE complex&quot;. This sentence may be confusing. Stabilizing the partially-zippered SNARE complex would either promote initial SNARE zippering (relative to unzipped state) or hinder CTD zippering (relative to the folded four-helix bundle state), which contradicts the model shown in Figure 9. It seems that Sec17 stabilizes the folded four-helix bundle state.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for catching that. The sentence has been re-worded to clarify.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15). In subsection “HOPS selects the outcome of Sec17–SNARE interactions”, the authors write 'Sec17 triggered fusion by pre-formed Qc-3∆ complexes in PEG reactions just as efficiently as in the HOPS reactions', but the data in Figure 8D suggest that the HOPS reaction is actually quite slower. This could be an important result. What does it mean?</p></disp-quote><p>Here’s the complete passage from the original submission (emphasis added):</p><p><italic>&quot;Remarkably, Sec17 triggered fusion by pre-formed Qc-3∆ complexes in the PEG reactions just as efficiently as in the HOPS reactions. We conclude that HOPS not only accelerates tethering and productive trans-SNARE zippering, but allows these processes to occur in the presence of otherwise-inhibitory Sec17. Once the partially-zipped SNARE complex has assembled, however, HOPS (and its SM subunit Vps33) are dispensable. Indeed, the SM may need to dissociate from the trans-complex before C-terminal zippering can occur and membrane fusion can initiate, as suggested by recent Vps33-SNARE crystal structures (Baker et al., 2015). As expected if a rate-limiting Vps33 dissociation step is bypassed, Sec17 triggers fusion with ~5-fold faster kinetics when HOPS (and hence Vps33) are absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).&quot;</italic></p><p>As mentioned above, we present new results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> showing that HOPS-SNARE docking complexes (which appear to be trans-SNARE complexes), upon Sec17 addition.

The revised Discussion section is now extended to address this point more fully.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The last sentence of the abstract and also the last one of the introduction suggest that they authors are uncovering the reason for the essential nature of SM proteins. However, the major concepts underlying this essential nature (the orchestration of SNARE complex assembly while protecting against disassembly by Sec18-Sec17) were already shown a long time ago by the Wickner lab.</p></disp-quote><p>We’ve deleted the last sentence of the abstract and the last sentence of the Introduction.</p><p>Obviously, variations on these concepts have been introduced to the literature previously, by several labs including Wickner’s. For example, experiments done by the Rizo, Ungermann, and Merz groups were first to show that Vps33 is directly necessary and sufficient for HOPS binding to SNARE domains and SNARE complexes, and that Vps33 (or, similarly, Munc18-1) directly impair Sec18-medited SNARE complex disassembly, in the absence of the other HOPS subunits. Many other experiments relevant to these concepts have been done in other labs, and we cite papers from those groups as well. That said, sixteen papers from Wickner’s lab were cited in the previous submission, and eighteen papers from Wickner’s lab are cited in this submission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors do add another layer by providing evidence that HOPS prevents the inhibitory function of Sec17, which is interesting, but cannot be considered 'the observation' that makes SM proteins essential.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is one of the aspects of the biochemistry uncovered in our study. The phrase “the observation” does not appear in our manuscript.

The authors should rephrase all these parts of the manuscript accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>The third paragraph of the Introduction is a framing paragraph which orients readers to the general features of SM proteins. In the previous submission, we cited three excellent review articles that do in fact steer readers toward many of the Wickner group’s papers (as well as key reports from many labs). We now cite two additional reviews that cover the functions of tethering factors: Angers and Merz, (2011), and Wickner and Schekman, (2008). In addition, we directly cite two pivotal research papers showing that SM proteins can directly stimulate SNARE-mediated fusion in vitro, in the absence of additional factors: Shen et al., (2007), and Furukawa and Mima, (2014). The following paragraph begins to describe the specific properties of Vps33; it cites the only paper ever co-authored by Wickner that assesses specific attributes of Vps33 (versus the HOPS holocomplex). We describe that work (Baker et al., 2015) as a “breakthrough.” The referees’ query served as a reminder that this paragraph would be a good place to cite papers on Vps33 from the Emr, Rizo, and Ungermann groups, as well. We now do so.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the results and particularly in the discussion, the authors argue against the idea that the N-terminal hydrophobic loop of Sec17 acts as a wedge to induce membrane fusion, but the argument is quite weak because it is based on the data acquired with one mutant (with the RSKSR sequence in the loop) that needs to be added at high concentrations to support fusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree.

Specifically, we suspect that Sec17 and the SM can bind simultaneously to the C-terminally splayed trans-SNARE complex, but that as the complex zippers the SM – but not Sec17 – must be ejected. The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> are consistent with this working model, as are available structural data: the Hughson lab’s structures of Vps33 and the Brunger group’s structures of 20S particles.</p><p>We note that our current model is a modification of the model shown in Lobingier et al., (2014), because when we published that model, we did not yet know about the Baker and Hughson structures suggesting that SM ejection is a prerequisite for C-terminal zippering and fusion. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> is part of Figure 9B of Lobingier et al.:</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-27396-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>We now draw the model with the SM (red oval) dissociating prior to final SNARE zippering, as in the current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>.

As discussed above it is likely that SM displacement is essential for (and perhaps normally driven by) the completion of C-terminal zippering (Baker et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2016). We previously demonstrated that three Sec17 molecules and one SM (Vps33 or Sly1) can bind to a single SNARE complex (Lobingier et al., 2014). On a partially zipped trans-complex, a fourth Sec17 molecule might competitively displace the SM (Collins et al., 2005), facilitating the completion of SNARE zippering.”</p><p>This working model does, of course, make lots of additional untested predictions and we are obviously working to test some of them.</p><p>For example, our working model predicts that structural analyses of a SNARE-Sec17-SM complex will reveal that the C-termini of the Qa- and R-SNAREs are splayed, as in the trans-configuration and similar to the SNARE configurations seen in the two Baker-Hughson co-crystal structures of Vps33 with either Vam3 or Nyv1. If these structures actually tell us what the SM-bound zippering intermediate looks like (and we think they probably do), it’s evident that the SM cannot remain bound when the SNAREs fully zipper and fusion occurs.
