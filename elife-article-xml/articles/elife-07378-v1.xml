Whereas maternal control over this remodeling is well described, paternal contributions are virtually unknown. In this study, we show that <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> males lacking <italic>Heterochromatin Protein 1E</italic> (<italic>HP1E</italic>) sire inviable embryos that undergo catastrophic mitosis. In these embryos, the paternal genome fails to condense and resolve into sister chromatids in synchrony with the maternal genome. This delay leads to a failure of paternal chromosomes, particularly the heterochromatin-rich sex chromosomes, to separate on the first mitotic spindle. Remarkably, HP1E is not inherited on mature sperm chromatin. Instead, HP1E primes paternal chromosomes during spermatogenesis to ensure faithful segregation post-fertilization. This transgenerational effect suggests that maternal control is necessary but not sufficient for transforming sperm DNA into a mitotically competent pronucleus. Instead, paternal action during spermiogenesis exerts post-fertilization control to ensure faithful chromosome segregation in the embryo.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07378.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07378.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07378.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The genetic information of cells is packaged into structures called chromosomes, which are made up of long strands of DNA that are wrapped around proteins to form a structure called chromatin. The cells of most animals contain two copies of every chromosome, but the egg and sperm cells contain only one copy. This means that when an egg fuses with a sperm cell during fertilization, the resulting ‘zygote’ will contain two copies of each chromosome—one inherited from the mother, and one from the father. These chromosomes duplicate and divide many times within the developing embryo in a process known as mitosis.</p><p>The first division of the zygote is particularly complicated, as the egg and sperm chromosomes must go through extensive—and yet different—chromatin reorganization processes. For instance, paternal DNA is inherited via sperm, where specialized sperm proteins package the DNA more tightly than in the maternal DNA, which is packaged by histone proteins used throughout development. For paternal DNA to participate in mitosis in the embryo, it must first undergo a transition to a histone-packaged state. Despite these differences, both maternal and paternal chromosomes must undergo mitosis at the same time if the zygote is to successfully divide. Although it is known that the egg cell contributes essential proteins that are incorporated into the sperm chromatin to help it reorganize, the importance of paternal proteins in coordinating this process remains poorly understood.</p><p>Many members of a family of proteins called Heterochromatin Protein 1 (or HP1 for short) have previously been shown to control chromatin organization in plants and animals. In 2012, researchers found that several HP1 proteins are found only in the testes of the fruit fly species <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. They predicted that these proteins might help control the reorganization of the paternal chromosomes following fertilization.</p><p>Levine et al.—including researchers involved in the 2012 study—have now used genetic and cell-based techniques to show that one member of the HP1 family (called HP1E) ensures that the paternal chromosomes are ready for cell division at the same time as the maternal chromosomes. Male flies that are unable to produce this protein do not have any offspring because, while these flies' sperm can fertilize eggs, the resulting zygotes cannot divide as normal.</p><p>Further experiments revealed that HP1E is not inherited through the chromatin of mature sperm, but instead influences the structure of the chromosomes during the final stages of the development of the sperm cells in the fly testes.</p><p>This study shows that both maternal and paternal proteins are needed to control how the paternal chromosomes reorganize in fruit fly embryos. Although difficult to discover and decipher, this work re-emphasizes the importance of paternal epigenetic contributions—changes that alter how DNA is read, without changing the DNA sequence itself—for ensuring the viability of resulting offspring. Future work will reveal both the molecular mechanism of this epigenetic transfer of information, as well as why certain <italic>Drosophila</italic> species are able to naturally overcome the loss of the essential HP1E protein.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07378.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07378.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>paternal effect lethal</kwd><kwd>karyotype evolution</kwd><kwd>sex chromosome</kwd><kwd>heterochromatin protein</kwd><kwd>spermiogenesis</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HHMI Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malik</surname><given-names>Harmit S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99/R00 GM107351</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Levine</surname><given-names>Mia T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM74108</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malik</surname><given-names>Harmit S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001229</institution-id><institution>G Harold and Leila Y.

The very first embryonic mitosis in animals requires additional synchronization. Paternally and maternally inherited genomes undergo independent chromatin reorganization and replication prior to mitotic entry. For instance, maternal chromosomes must complete meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sen et al., 2013</xref>) and then transition from a meiotic conformation to an interphase-like state in preparation for replication. The sperm-deposited, paternal chromosomes must undergo an even more radical transition from a highly compact, protamine-rich state to a decondensed, histone-rich state before DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braun, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miller et al., 2010</xref>). Despite these divergent requirements to achieve replication- and mitotic-competency, maternal and paternal genomes synchronously enter the first mitosis. Failure to carry out paternal chromosome remodeling in a timely fashion results in paternal genome loss and embryonic inviability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Loppin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McLay and Clarke, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Landmann et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The transition from a protamine-rich sperm nucleus to a competent paternal pronucleus requires the action of numerous maternally deposited proteins in the egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McLay and Clarke, 2003</xref>). For instance, paternal genome decondensation post-fertilization requires the integration of histone H3.3, a histone variant deposited by the maternal proteins HIRA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Loppin et al., 2005a</xref>), CHD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Konev et al., 2007</xref>)<italic>,</italic> and Yemanuclein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Orsi et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, maternally-deposited MH/Spartan protein localizes exclusively to the replicating paternal genome and is required for faithful paternal chromosome segregation during the first embryonic division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Delabaere et al., 2014</xref>). These and other studies demonstrate the essential role of maternally-deposited machinery in rendering competent sperm-deposited DNA and ultimately, ensuring faithful paternal genome inheritance.</p><p>Is paternal control also necessary for the extensive decondensation and re-condensation of the post-fertilization paternal genome? If so, disruption of such control would manifest as paternal effect lethality (PEL). Unlike male sterility mutants that lack motile sperm, PEL mutants make abundant motile sperm that fertilize eggs efficiently. However, embryos ‘fathered’ by PEL mutants are inviable. Only a handful of PEL genes have been characterized in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Browning and Strome, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fitch and Wakimoto, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fitch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Loppin et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smith and Wakimoto, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Seidel et al., 2011</xref>). These encode proteins that mediate sperm release of paternal DNA, sperm centriole inheritance, and paternal chromosome segregation. Only one of these PEL proteins directly localizes to paternal chromosomes; the sperm-inherited K81 protein localizes exclusively to paternal chromosome termini and ensures telomere integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dubruille et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gao et al., 2011</xref>). The maintenance of telomeric epigenetic identity joins a growing list of examples of sperm-to-embryo information transmission via protein or RNA inheritance (e.g., diet: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ost et al., 2014</xref>], stress: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rodgers et al., 2013</xref>], embryonic patterning: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayer et al., 2009</xref>], transcriptional competency: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hammoud et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rando, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ihara et al., 2014</xref>]). Despite our new appreciation of paternal control over epigenetic information transfer, there are no reports of paternal control over the global chromatin reorganization required for synchronous mitosis across paternally and maternally inherited genomes. Indeed, in the absence of any known paternal protein-directed genome remodeling, a model has emerged that maternal proteins might be sufficient for transforming tightly packaged sperm DNA into a fully competent paternal pronucleus.</p><p>The notion that maternal control is sufficient to accomplish paternal genome remodeling is challenged by recent findings from the intracellular <italic>Wolbachia</italic> bacterium that infects more than 50% of insect species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hilgenboecker et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>Wolbachia-</italic>infected <italic>Drosophila</italic> males mated to uninfected females father embryos that arrest soon after the first zygotic mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lassy and Karr, 1996</xref>). Embryonic arrest occurs because paternal genomes enter the first mitosis with unresolved sister chromatids that fail to separate on the mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Callaini et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Landmann et al., 2009</xref>). Although the identity of the host factor(s) manipulated by <italic>Wolbachia</italic> to mediate this transgenerational effect is still unknown, what is clear is that pre-fertilization, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> subverts the paternal germline machinery that helps direct global genome remodeling of paternal chromosomes in the embryo. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> action during spermiogenesis leads to paternal-maternal genome asynchrony and ultimately, failure of paternal chromosomes to separate on the first mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Callaini et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Landmann et al., 2009</xref>). Despite decades of interest, the molecular basis of paternal control has remained elusive.</p><p>To investigate the potential for paternal control over sperm genome remodeling post-fertilization, we took a candidate gene approach, focusing on the Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) proteins that orchestrate genome-wide chromosomal organization in plants, animals, fungi, and some protists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lomberk et al., 2006</xref>). HP1 proteins are defined as such by a combination of two domains—a chromodomain that mediates protein-histone interactions and a chromoshadow domain that mediates protein–protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aasland and Stewart, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eissenberg and Elgin, 2000</xref>). The biochemical properties of HP1 members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Canzio et al., 2014</xref>) support a diversity of chromatin-dependent processes in the soma, including DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pak et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwaiger et al., 2010</xref>), telomere integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fanti et al., 1998</xref>), and chromosome condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kellum et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Recently, we carried out a detailed phylogenomic analysis of the HP1 gene family in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that revealed numerous testis-restricted HP1 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Levine et al., 2012</xref>). Given the established roles of HP1 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eissenberg and Elgin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lomberk et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vermaak and Malik, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Canzio et al., 2014</xref>), we posited that these newly discovered male-specific <italic>HP1</italic> genes might represent excellent candidates for encoding chromatin functions specialized for paternal genome organization and remodeling in the early embryo. Using detailed genetic and cytological analyses, here we show that one of these testis-specific HP1 proteins, <italic>Heterochromatin Protein 1E</italic> (HP1E), is essential for priming the paternal genome to enter embryonic mitosis in synchrony with the maternal genome in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Intriguingly, HP1E is able to mediate this priming function transgenerationally i.e., the HP1E protein itself is not epigenetically inherited. We further show that absence of HP1E especially imperils mitotic fidelity of the heterochromatin-rich, paternal sex chromosomes. Thus, our study firmly establishes that both maternal and paternal control are necessary for paternal genome remodeling in the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>HP1E</italic> encodes a spermiogenesis-restricted chromatin protein</title><p>The <italic>HP1E</italic> gene is a testis-restricted <italic>Drosophila HP1</italic> paralog born more than 60 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Levine et al., 2012</xref>). To investigate the possibility that HP1E acts during chromatin reorganization prior to sperm maturation, we generated transgenic flies that encoded a Flag- or YFP-tagged HP1E fusion protein, driven by the native <italic>HP1E</italic> promoter. In addition, we raised a highly specific polyclonal antibody against HP1E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We conducted RNA-seq on control and HP1E-depleted testes, reasoning that loss of heterochromatin organizing protein would uniquely perturb the global transcriptional readout from this specialized genome compartment. We found that <italic>HP1E</italic> knockdown during this narrow developmental stage affects the expression of over 700 genes (fdr &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Of those 700 genes significantly misregulated upon knockdown, there were very few genes that encode known chromatin-modifying or chromosome-bound proteins; of these, most represent uncharacterized genes. However, one intriguing pattern that does emerge from this dataset is that 100% of significantly misregulated heterochromatin-embedded genes are upregulated when <italic>HP1E</italic> is depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In comparison, less than 60% of significantly misregulated euchromatin-embedded genes are upregulated. This dichotomy between the effects of <italic>HP1E</italic> depletion on the euchromatic and heterochromatic compartment is highly significant (p &lt; 0.00001) and suggests a direct action of HP1E in the heterochromatic compartment, akin to its closest HP1 relative, HP1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kellum et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Levine et al., 2012</xref>). Alternatively, one or more of the 700 mis-regulated genes could be responsible for modifying paternal chromatin. However, no obvious candidate genes involved in chromatin modification or binding emerged from the list of mis-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). In the absence of direct evidence of heterochromatin localization via cytology or ChIP-seq, we can only tentatively conclude that HP1E acts directly on this genome compartment. In contrast, HP1E unambiguously localizes to chromatin during sperm development.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07378.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Heterochromatin-embedded genes are globally perturbed upon HP1E-depletion.</title><p>HP1E depletion in testis results directly or indirectly in mis-regulation of hundreds of genes.

We found that paternal DNA failed to condense synchronously with the maternal chromosomes in PEL embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). To quantify this asymmetry, we adopted a measure of ‘circularity’ (see ‘Materials and methods’) of maternal and paternal components across wild-type and PEL embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Condensed chromosomes appear as finger-like projections and therefore exhibit circularity close to 0. In contrast, interphase chromosomes appear close to a perfect circle and exhibit circularity close to 1. In wild-type embryos, we found that the ratio of paternal to maternal circularity was equal to one, suggesting that both pronuclei undergo synchronous condensation. In contrast, paternal DNA had twice the circularity of maternal DNA in PEL embryos, suggesting asynchronous condensation due to failure of the paternal genome to compact into resolved chromatids in a timely fashion.</p><p>Immediately following this asynchronous metaphase in PEL embryos, we found that the paternal DNA failed to separate on the mitotic spindle. Specifically, a prominent chromatin bridge enriched in paternal chromatin-specific AcH4 appeared in PEL embryos at the first anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, arrowhead, n = 20/20). We also observed AcH4 at the poles, suggesting that only a fraction of the paternal genome mis-segregates in PEL embryos. Based on these findings, we conclude that defects in paternal chromatin organization are the primary source of mitotic arrest in embryos fathered by HP1E-depleted males. However, our analyses could not formally rule out the possibility that mitotic defects additionally result from maternal chromatin defects, the loss of essential mitotic machinery normally contributed by wild-type fathers (e.g., the centriole), or the deposition of a mitotic ‘poison’ by the PEL fathers.</p><p>To test whether paternal chromatin alone was sufficient to trigger failed mitosis in PEL embryos, we adopted a genetic approach that took advantage of the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> maternal effect lethal <italic>sesame</italic><sup><italic>185b</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Loppin et al., 2000</xref>). In eggs laid by homozygous mutant <italic>sesame</italic> females, the paternal DNA completely fails to de-condense and so does not participate in zygotic mitosis. Instead, the haploid maternal chromosomes undergo mitotic cycling like wild-type diploid embryos until late embryogenesis—long after the PEL mitotic arrest observed in embryos sired by HP1E-depleted males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We crossed the <italic>HP1E</italic>-depleted males to <italic>sesame</italic> females to ask whether bypassing paternal chromatin was sufficient to rescue mitotic cycling. We observed full rescue of nuclear divisions in these crosses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>); the resulting embryos cycled maternal haploid nuclei identically to those ‘fathered’ by a wild-type male beyond embryonic cycle 12 (85% and 82%, respectively, p &gt; 0.2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

No such cell cycle checkpoint proteins have been identified to act in the very first embryonic mitotic cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">O'Farrell et al., 2004</xref>), which must nevertheless accomplish the difficult task of synchronizing maternal and paternal chromosomes that were inherited in very different chromatin states. To investigate the paternal contributions that ensure timely participation of the paternal genome in early embryogenesis, we carried out a detailed functional analysis of the testis-restricted <italic>HP1E</italic> gene in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. We found that <italic>HP1E</italic> encodes a novel function that ensures paternal genome stability in the embryo. Our cytological and transcriptome analysis revealed that <italic>HP1E</italic> is developmentally restricted within the male germline, where it contributes to heterochromatin integrity. HP1E depletion during sperm development results in a highly penetrant PEL phenotype in which paternal chromosomes, especially the paternal sex chromosomes, fail to condense in synchrony with the maternal chromosomes and ultimately cause mitotic catastrophe. We further showed that the PEL embryonic phenotype could not be rescued by egg-supplied HP1E but could be rescued if the paternal DNA was excluded from participating in embryonic mitosis.

It is formally possible that the PEL phenotype is the consequence of a dysregulated spermatid transcriptome that is, up- or down-regulation of a downstream gene. However, our finding that HP1E depletion results in the global up-regulation of heterochromatin-embedded genes, together with our observation that the heterochromatin-rich paternal sex chromosomes are most vulnerable to HP1E depletion, lead us to favor the alternate model that HP1E functions as a canonical HP1 protein during spermiogenesis. Based on antibody localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3 fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplements 3, 4</xref>) and chromatin bridge morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), we found no evidence for defects in kinetochore assembly or replication machinery engagement in PEL embryos. Instead, our observation that the lethality phenotype first manifests as decondensed paternal chromosomes relative to maternal chromosomes implicates condensation delay of the heterochromatin-rich sex chromosomes. This delay could be the consequence of incomplete replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Landmann et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, large stretches of uninterrupted heterochromatic DNA, as found on the <italic>Drosophila</italic> sex chromosomes, pose a unique challenge to replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leach et al., 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pryor et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collins et al., 2002</xref>). Alternatively, the mitotic delay may be the result of inadequate condensin protein recruitment, which is required for timely resolution of sister chromatids post-replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Steffensen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dej et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Savvidou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cobbe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hirano, 2012</xref>). Previous studies have shown that heterochromatin can also impair chromosome condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peng and Karpen, 2007</xref>). Timely completion of replication and condensation requires the action of HP1E's closest relative, HP1A, in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kellum et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwaiger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2011</xref>). However, in developing spermatids, HP1A localizes to telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dubruille et al., 2010</xref>) rather than broadly to heterochromatin as observed in virtually all other cell types. We posit that HP1E adopts a global, HP1A-like chromatin function during this highly specialized developmental stage and ensures the recruitment or retention of either replication or condensin proteins that are required post-fertilization.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that HP1A is essential for embryo viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eissenberg et al., 1992</xref>).

How do we reconcile the paradox of <italic>HP1E</italic> essentiality in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> with its loss in <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic>? We previously found that HP1E loss along in <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic>-related species occurred during the same 7-million evolutionary period as a major sex chromosome rearrangement event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Levine et al., 2012</xref>), in which the ancestral Y was lost, a neo-Y chromosome was born, and the ancestral X fused to an autosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carvalho and Clark, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Larracuente et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Our finding that the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> sex chromosomes are especially vulnerable to HP1E depletion, combined with the emergence of novel sex chromosome arrangements along the same narrow branch as <italic>HP1E</italic> pseudogenization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), suggests a model under which rearrangements of heterochromatin-rich sex chromosomes in the <italic>obscura</italic> group rendered <italic>HP1E</italic> non-essential. Such karyotypic changes can bring distal heterochromatin into closer proximity to euchromatin and be sufficient to alter heterochromatin packaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spofford, 1976</xref>), replication timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abramov et al., 2005</xref>) or even delete blocks of satellite repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garagna et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, heterochromatin evolution via chromosomal rearrangements may have obviated maintenance of <italic>HP1E</italic>'s essential heterochromatin function, leading to its degeneration in <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic>.</p><p>Our finding that HP1E is essential in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> yet lost in the <italic>obscura</italic> group highlights the lineage-restricted essential requirements of chromatin genes.

We used a similar scheme to visualize protamine:GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jayaramaiah Raja and Renkawitz-Pohl, 2005</xref>) in embryos fathered by <italic>HP1E</italic>-knockdown males.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Assessing embryo arrest, rescue by <italic>sesame-</italic> mothers</title><p>To assess the stage of embryonic arrest, we crossed males encoding both the actin5C driver and HP1E hairpin or the driver alone to wild-type <italic>sevelin</italic> females (gift of B Wakimoto). After a 1-hr pre-lay, we collected embryos for 70 min, methanol-fixed each genotype separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rothwell and Sullivan, 2007</xref>), mounted in SlowFade Gold antifade with DAPI (Molecular Probes, Life Technologies Inc., Grand Island, NY), and counted nuclei number/embryo at 20× on a Leica DMI 6000. A Mann–Whitney U test determined significance between the two frequency distributions. To assess embryonic mitotic rescue by <italic>sesame</italic> mothers, we set up the same cross but with virgin <italic>sesame</italic> females (<italic>ssm</italic><sup><italic>185b</italic></sup>, gift from Kami Ahmad). After a 1-hr pre-lay, <italic>sesame</italic> females oviposited for 45 min followed by 1.5 hr of aging. We then collected, fixed, and counted nuclei as above. For embryos fathered by HP1E knockdown vs wild-type males, we recorded the number of embryos that underwent early arrest (cycle 3 or earlier) and no arrest (beyond cycle 12). We tested for heterogeneity among the four categories using a Fisher's Exact Test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Embryo immunofluorescence</title><p>To characterize the progression of paternal chromatin and mitotic machinery leading up to and during the first embryonic mitosis, we conducted immunofluorescence and DAPI staining on wildtype-, <italic>HP1E</italic> knockdown-, or <italic>HP1E/HP1E</italic> fathered embryos that were 0–20 min old. We methanol-fixed embryos (as above) and then rehydrated in PBS plus a drop of PBS + 0.1% Triton. Next, we permeablized in PBS + 1% Triton for 30 min at room temperature. Embryos were blocked in the StartBlock reagent (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) for 90 min at 4°C. We replaced the block with the primary antibody diluted in StartBlock and incubated overnight at 4°C. We then washed embryos in StartBlock for 1 hr following by a 2-hr room temperature incubation in a secondary antibody diluted in StartBlock. After washing embryos for 1 hr in PBS + 0.1% Triton, we mounted them as described above. Primary antibody dilutions were the following: anti-AcH4 (Millipore, Billerica, MA; 1:1000), anti-alpha tubulin (Serotec, Kidlington, UK; 1:250), anti-gamma-tubulin (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), clone GTU-88, 1:1000, anti-Cenp-C (1:5000, gift of C Lehner), anti-PCNA (1:300, gift of P Fisher), and anti-HP1E (1:1000). Alexa-Fluor goat secondary antibodies (Life Technologies) were diluted at 1:1000. We acquired images from the Leica TCS SP5 II confocal microscope with LASAF software and present maximally projected .tif files. Finally, using ImageJ we quantified paternal—maternal metaphase asymmetry by tracing max projected AcH4-staining wild-type and PEL embryos. We measured ‘circularity’, which is 4<italic>π</italic> × [<italic>Area</italic>]/[Perimeter]<sup>2</sup> and calculated the paternal:maternal ratio.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>HP1E antibody production and western blots</title><p>We raised an antibody against HP1E residues CKSLKRGQELNNQYETKAKRLKI and CRILDRRHYMGQLQYLVKWLDY. Covance Inc. (Princeton, NJ) immunized a single rabbit by injecting it with both peptides over two months. We confirmed HP1E antibody specificity by probing a western blot of nuclear extracts from <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells transfected with a heat-shock inducible, N-terminally Flag-tagged and YFP-tagged HP1E fusion protein plasmids. We designed these constructs using Gateway technology (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://emb.carnegiescience.edu/labs/murphy/Gateway%20vectors.html">emb.carnegiescience.edu/labs/murphy/Gateway%20vectors.html</ext-link>) following standard procedures (destination vectors pHFW and pHVW, respectively). We prepared cell lysates by transfecting (FuGENE, Promega, Madison, WI) S2 cells with 2 μg of plasmid DNA and incubating overnight. We transiently induced expression by heat shock (following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ross et al., 2013</xref>). We washed the recovered cells in PBS and re-suspended in RIPA buffer, sonicated, pelleted, and re-suspended in SDS loading buffer. We probed the membranes with either anti-HP1E (1:500) or anti-Flag (‘M2’, Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; 1:2000) primary antibodies followed by goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies Inc., Dallas, TX). Lysates for the western blot confirming deposition of ectopically-expressed HP1E into embryos were prepared from 0–40 min embryos laid by females encoding the MTD driver and either UASp-HP1E transgene (described above) or a balancer chromosome. We flash froze the embryos followed by grinding with a glass pipette in SDS loading buffer and boiling at 95°C for 5 min. We probed the membranes with anti-HP1E and anti-beta actin (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, both at 1:5000).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Testis immunofluorescence</title><p>To assess HP1E localization in testis, we used the HP1E antibody or generated transgenic flies encoding an N-terminal Flag- or YFP-tag fused to HP1E, flanked by the native promoter and 5′ and 3′ regions. To cytologically characterize HP1E localization without antibody staining, we fixed testis from 2–5 day old YFP-HP1E males in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and mounted in SlowFade Gold antifade with DAPI. For immunofluorescence, we fixed Flag-tagged and untagged testis in 4% PFA in periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde (PLP) for 1 hr followed by 30 min in PBS + 0.3% Triton, 0.3% sodium deoxycholate. After a 10 min wash in PBS + 0.1% Triton, we blocked testis for 30 min in PBS + 0.1% Triton + 3% BSA followed by standard IF procedures using the following dilutions: anti-Flag (‘M2’, Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; 1:2500), anti-HP1E (1:1000), and Alexa Fluor secondaries goat anti-mouse 488 (1:1000) and goat anti-rabbit (1:1000).

The FHCRC Shared Resources Genomics Core prepared six libraries using Illumina TruSeq Sample Prep Kit v2. We performed image analysis and base calling with Illumina's RTA v1.13 software and demulitplexed with Illumina's CASAVA v1.8.2. We aligned reads to BDGP5r66 using TopHat v1.4.0 and converted files to sam format using samtools v0.1.18. We used htseq-count v0.5.3 to generate counts/gene and removed genes that had 0 counts across all samples or less than 1 count/million in at least three samples. This culling resulted in 11,051 genes. We identified differentially expressed genes using edgeR v2.6 and tested for significant enrichment of up-regulated heterochromatin-embedded genes using binomial probability. We annotated heterochromatin-embedded genes using the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Release 5.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Fluorescent in situ hybridization</title><p>To determine if participation in chromatin bridging was chromosome-specific, we designed Cy3 or Cy5 conjugated probes (IDT) for in situ hybridization following (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dernburg, 2011</xref>): X (359 bp satellite), Y (AATAC)n, 2L + 3L (AATAACATAG)n, 4 (AATAT)n and IGS (GTATGTGTTCATATGATTTTGGCAATTATA, ATATTCCCATATTCTCTAAGTATTATAGAG, designed by P Ferree). We co-hybridized two probes using the following conjugated tags and annealing temperatures: 32°C for Y-Cy5 + 2L/3L-Cy3 and Y + X-Cy3, 23°C for Y + 4-Cy3 and 30°C for Y-Cy5 + IGS-Cy3. For the FISH experiments, we modified the above embryo fixation protocol by replacing methanol:heptane with 3.7% paraformaldehyde:heptane.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank B Wakimoto, L Jones, K Ahmad, P Fisher, and Y Yamashita for reagents, J Vasquez for microscopy support, and A Larracuente for the IGS probe sequences.

The reviewers are of the opinion that it is an interesting story with elegant genetics to describe the role of HPIE as a paternal effect mutation required for segregation of paternally-derived chromosomes. However, additional work is required to strengthen your claims so that the manuscript is a strong candidate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Detailed reviewers’ comments are included below, but the consensus among the reviewers was there are at least two major points we would like you to address upon revision.</p><p>1) The authors need to strengthen their claim about the “heterochromatin function” of HP1E. RNA seq is interesting but more direct evidence would be needed. Ideally ChIP-seq from this particular stage will be desirable however, if this is not feasible then at least ChIP-qPCR for a selected gene set will be important to provide more direct evidence for HPIE action on heterochromatin.</p><p>2) The authors also need a better characterization of the mis-segregation phenotype. As pointed out in one of the reviewer's comments, it will be very helpful if the authors used additional probes such as rDNA and a few euchromatic loci and centromeres and compared their phenotype with other reported work at later stages.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Only a few minor comments.</p><p>1) Related to the data that show narrow expression window, yet causing derepression of heterochromatin genes in mutant: What kind of chromatin state do the authors think HP1E is conferring to sperm chromatin that both explains derepression of heterochromatin genes during spermatogenesis AND defective chromatin decondensation and segregation of paternal chromosomes in zygotes?</p><p>2) Related to their conclusion that HP1E is depleted from mature sperm chromatin, any discussion on the possibly very low amount of it marking certain genomic location, similar to a finding that histone is not completely removed from mammalian sperm chromatin? (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19525931">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19525931</ext-link>)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This report shows that knock down and chromosomal mutations that disrupt the <italic>Drosophila</italic> testes specific HP1, HP1E, lead to defects in remodeling of the male pronucleus and segregation of the sex chromosomes during the early cleavage stage embryonic divisions. Western blotting and IF data indicate that HP1E protein localizes to nuclei during spermatogenesis, but is not incorporated into mature sperm or transferred to the embryo. The authors also show that maternal expression of HP1E does not rescue the PEL phenotype, and use a very elegant genetic experiment to show that the embryonic mitotic defects are specifically due to failure to segregate the paternal chromosomes. Based on these observations, the authors propose that HP1E establishes an epigenetic mark that is essential to reorganization of the male pronucleus. The data are consistent with this model, but HP1E mutations alter expression of over 700 genes, and it is also possible that one or more of these genes establish an inherited modification or encode a chromatin protein that is required for reorganization and segregation of the male pronucleus. While directly testing this hypothesis is difficult, this possibility needs to be considered /discussed. Nonetheless, the experiments are well executed, clearly presented, and genetically define a novel paternal function in pronuclear reorganization. The additional experiments suggested below are not essential, but would strengthen the story and could provide mechanistic insights:</p><p>1) HP1E depletion leads to mis-regulation of heterochromatin genes and segregation defects predominantly for sex chromosomes during embryonic mitosis in next generation. Does HP1E preferentially associate with the sex chromosomes during spermatogenesis? ChIP sequencing would be the best way to test this. Is this technically challenging in fly testes? If not, the authors appear to have the reagents needed to perform the experiment, and it could provide important insight into HP1E function.</p><p>2) HP1E is likely to bind H3K9-me3, and co-localization of HP1E and K9-me3 would indirectly test this. HP1A recruits the methyl transferase that generates this binding site, leading to heterochromatin spreading. HP1E may have a similar function. It would be interesting to determine if H3K9me3 localization is altered in HP1E mutants. This could be done by IF, but ChIPseq would be better.</p><p>3) As noted above, the RNAseq data show that many genes change their expression in HP1E mutants. Do any these genes encode chromatin modifying proteins, or proteins that directly associate with chromatin?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Levine et al. have characterized the gene HP1E, discovering that it is a paternal effect mutation required for segregation of paternally-derived chromosomes. The combination of the FISH, anti-AcH4, and sesame mutant experiments are particularly strong with regards to HP1E's requirement for paternal chromosome segregation in the first embryonic mitosis. The authors further establish that HP1E is present and thus likely active only in developing sperm, with a mechanistic understanding of its role in chromosome segregation awaiting further study. The authors suggest that HP1E is a heterochromatin factor but this is based on mostly indirect evidence.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) I'm not very familiar with the spermatid stage being studied but take the authors' point from cited refs that heterochromatin cannot be identified with HP1A, H3MeK9, etc. at that stage. So the inability to directly examine HP1E chromatin localization is an acceptable limitation of the system. Localization in other tissue types upon ectopic expression obviously has caveats but would be useful to show if available.</p><p>The RNA-seq analysis is presented as an indirect alternative to determine whether HP1E is a heterochromatin protein, but more could potentially be gained from this, and the analyses clarified. How are heterochromatin genes defined in this study? What proportion of them are misregulated—all misregulated may be upregulated, but out of what total? Are they equally affected on all chromosome arms—this might give some insight into the apparent specificity of the segregation defect? How do such results compare to euchromatic genes? Chromosome 4 would be of particular interest due to its unusual heterochromatic state.</p><p>Analysis of repetitive sequences could also be informative for addressing whether HP1E is a general or specific chromatin regulator. There's little doubt that satellite sequences are not proportionally represented in Illumina data, especially RNA-Seq, but we have had some success with Hmr and Lhr in mapping reads to satellites, with the results partially correlating with cytological data.</p><p>2) Relating to the issue of whether HP1E is a heterochromatin protein, and its degree of specificity, the mis-segregation phenotypes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> look very different from what we've seen in Ferree's work at later embryonic stages, where mis-segregating sequences like 359 go all the way across the anaphase bridges. Here with HP1E mutant the probes are forming clusters that don't look any more stretched out compared to normal segregation, e.g., when comparing the presumed maternal and paternal X's in the female embryo. So most of the stretched material in the bridge is unidentified. It would be informative to look at additional probes such as rDNA and a few euchromatic loci. Were centromeres looked at (may have missed)? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (and others) are also lacking wild type controls. Here they are really essential in order to interpret the mutant phenotypes.</p><p>3) HP1E is firmly established here as a paternal effect mutant. “Transgenerational” is widely understood to refer to mutant phenotypes that are transmitted across generations, and does not apply here.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07378.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors need to strengthen their claim about the “heterochromatin function” of HP1E. RNA seq is interesting but more direct evidence would be needed. Ideally ChIP-seq from this particular stage will be desirable however, if this is not feasible then at least ChIP-qPCR for a selected gene set will be important to provide more direct evidence for HPIE action on heterochromatin</italic>.</p><p>We absolutely agree with the reviewers that our claim would be substantially bolstered by a ChIP-seq analysis to support our inference that HP1E is a heterochromatin protein. We made a number of unsuccessful attempts prior to our original submission to obtain reliable ChIP-seq data on HP1E in <italic>Drosophila</italic> testes. Unfortunately, ChIP on <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis is notoriously challenging and only a few groups have reported a successful chIP-seq experiment. In those few cases, research groups have either targeted a highly abundant protein or histone mark or have taken advantage of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutant, <italic>bam</italic>, which enriches the testis for the undifferentiated cell type of interest. Unfortunately, neither of these is applicable to the study of HP1E, which is expressed during spermiogenesis only and is not abundant.</p><p>After receiving the reviewer request, we partnered with the Henikoff lab here at the Fred Hutch to attempt chIP using a vetted anti-Flag reagent on <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> testis encoding a Flag:HP1E transgene. Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful despite multiple attempts that took advantage of increasing amounts of starting material. Without reliable recovery of DNA, even chIP-qPCR is hard to validate.</p><p>As an alternate strategy, we also considered conducting ChIP-seq on HP1E transfected into S2 or Kc cells. However, we have found that (unlike HP1A, HP1B, HP1C, and HP1D which we have published on previously) HP1E fails to localize to chromatin in cell culture. This suggests the possibility of a testis-restricted cofactor required for HP1E’s chromatin localization. In any case, we have concluded that we cannot use cell lines for this experiment.</p><p>We have now turned to a newly developed ‘CHEC-seq’ strategy developed by the Henikoff lab that requires construction of transgenic flies encoding an MNase fusion to HP1E (works similar to the Dam-ID strategy developed by Bas van Steensel). Unfortunately, we are only at the beginning of this experiment, which will require at least another year of development and validation.</p><p>Given these technical limitations, we have responded to this concern by moderating the language in the first section, stating now that “…in the absence of direct evidence of heterochromatin localization via cytology or ChIP-seq, we can only tentatively conclude that HP1E acts directly on this genome compartment” (subsection headed “HP1E encodes a spermiogenesis-restricted chromatin protein”). We note that none of our main conclusions depend on HP1E’s direct action at heterochromatin. However, our finding that HP1E loss leads to chromatin bridges, with at least heterochromatic satellites on Y localizing to this bridge, is highly consistent with HP1E action on heterochromatin.</p><p><italic>2) The authors also need a better characterization of the mis-segregation phenotype. As pointed out in one of the reviewer's comments, it will be very helpful if the authors used additional probes such as rDNA and a few euchromatic loci and centromeres and compared their phenotype with other reported work at later stages</italic>.</p><p>While our primary goal for the FISH experiments was to assess the possibility of chromosome specific enrichment in a chromatin bridge, we agree that identifying the offending DNA segment would be extremely informative. We especially agree that testing the <italic>rDNA</italic> locus is important given that it is a rare repetitive locus uniquely shared by the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> X and Y chromosomes. This locus is also technically feasible to investigate in the very early embryo, which is notoriously challenging developmental stage in which to image weak signal (as is typical from non-repetitive targets). In new experiments since our original submission, we have now designed two probes that target the IGS (repetitive) region of the <italic>rDNA</italic> locus. We hybridized these probes in combination to 20 male and 20 female <italic>HP1E</italic> mutant-fathered early embryos. The findings from this new experiment are now reported in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and in the Results section (subsection headed “Heterochromatin-rich paternal sex chromosomes are especially vulnerable to HP1E depletion”). These new data offer an additional contribution to the original FISH table by providing information about the relative likelihood of rDNA versus Y- and X-chromosomal satellites to appear in the telophase bridge. For instance, we found that the Y-linked AATAC repeat is present at the bridge nearly 95% of the time whereas the Y-linked rDNA is present only 50% of the time. In contrast, in female embryos, the rDNA is present in the bridge more often than the X-linked 359 bp satellite (85% versus 60% respectively). We have also now contextualized these results with respect to the similar discovery of Ferree and Barbash (PLOS Biology 2009).</p><p>In contrast to rDNA, non-repetitive euchromatic loci are also not reliably probed via FISH in the first anaphase/telophase. Moreover, our discovery that euchromatin-encoding chromosomes are very rarely found in the bridge (6%) and of the dominant presence of the entirely heterochromatic Y chromosome in the bridge, leads to an a priori reason to hypothesize that euchromatic loci are the source of vulnerability.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>Only a few minor comments</italic>.</p><p><italic>1) Related to the data that show narrow expression window, yet causing derepression of heterochromatin genes in mutant: What kind of chromatin state do the authors think HP1E is conferring to sperm chromatin that both explains derepression of heterochromatin genes during spermatogenesis AND defective chromatin decondensation and segregation of paternal chromosomes in zygotes?</italic></p><p>Chromatin packaging at this late stage of spermatogenesis and post-fertilization/ pre-embryonic mitosis is poorly characterized, particularly in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This dearth of information disables us from proposing a more specific model than the one presented in the paper. We do note that heterochromatin packaging by HP1 proteins in mitosis is required for both transcriptional silencing and high-fidelity DNA repair in heterochromatin (work from Gary Karpen’s lab that we cite).</p><p><italic>2) Related to their conclusion that HP1E is depleted from mature sperm chromatin, any discussion on the possibly very low amount of it marking certain genomic location, similar to a finding that histone is not completely removed from mammalian sperm chromatin? (</italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19525931"><italic>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19525931</italic></ext-link><italic>)</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that small amounts of HP1E could be present in either tissue type but would not be detectable by the assays we have performed. We tried to address this possibility by attempting to rescue embryo viability by ectopic HP1E deposition into the egg via overexpression during oogenesis. However, this ectopic expression would not be able to overcome any defect associated with loss of HP1E retention of particular loci in paternal chromatin. Again, the absence of data on histone retention in <italic>Drosophila</italic> sperm makes speculation beyond our dataset difficult.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>This report shows that knock down and chromosomal mutations that disrupt the</italic> Drosophila <italic>testes specific HP1, HP1E, lead to defects in remodeling of the male pronucleus and segregation of the sex chromosomes during the early cleavage stage embryonic divisions. Western blotting and IF data indicate that HP1E protein localizes to nuclei during spermatogenesis, but is not incorporated into mature sperm or transferred to the embryo. The authors also show that maternal expression of HP1E does not rescue the PEL phenotype, and use a very elegant genetic experiment to show that the embryonic mitotic defects are specifically due to failure to segregate the paternal chromosomes. Based on these observations, the authors propose that HP1E establishes an epigenetic mark that is essential to reorganization of the male pronucleus. The data are consistent with this model, but HP1E mutations alter expression of over 700 genes, and it is also possible that one or more of these genes establish an inherited modification or encode a chromatin protein that is required for reorganization and segregation of the male pronucleus. While directly testing this hypothesis is difficult, this possibility needs to be considered /discussed</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer. We had indeed failed to adequately highlight this potential mechanism of action and so have added a new sentence raising this possibility (in the subsection headed “HP1E encodes a spermiogenesis-restricted chromatin protein”).</p><p><italic>Nonetheless, the experiments are well executed, clearly presented, and genetically define a novel paternal function in pronuclear reorganization. The additional experiments suggested below are not essential, but would strengthen the story and could provide mechanistic insights</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) HP1E depletion leads to mis-regulation of heterochromatin genes and segregation defects predominantly for sex chromosomes during embryonic mitosis in next generation. Does HP1E preferentially associate with the sex chromosomes during spermatogenesis?</italic></p><p>We wondered the same thing and conducted immuno-FISH on testis to test this hypothesis but did not see co-localization. Instead, we found that HP1E mark on the developing spermatids is quite diffuse whereas the FISH signals are not.</p><p><italic>ChIP sequencing would be the best way to test this. Is this technically challenging in fly testes? If not, the authors appear to have the reagents needed to perform the experiment, and it could provide important insight into HP1E function</italic>.</p><p>As we indicated earlier in our response, we have found chIP-seq on HP1E in testes to be extremely challenging (we developed the HP1E-FLAG fusion reagent in part to facilitate these analyses). We have devoted the bulk of our time since receiving the reviews, and even time prior to initial submission, to get HP1E chIP-seq to work. However, our DNA yield is too poor to be reliable even for chIP-PCR analyses. Despite hundreds of testis pairs and use of an anti-Flag antibody used with recurrent success in the Henikoff lab, we were unable to recover detectable amounts of DNA from the IP. We speculate that our failure to successfully perform chIP against HP1E:Flag is related to the small number of cells in testis within which HP1E localizes.</p><p><italic>2) HP1E is likely to bind H3K9-me3, and co-localization of HP1E and K9-me3 would indirectly test this. HP1A recruits the methyl transferase that generates this binding site, leading to heterochromatin spreading. HP1E may have a similar function. It would be interesting to determine if H3K9me3 localization is altered in HP1E mutants. This could be done by IF, but ChIPseq would be better</italic>.</p><p>We agree that a perturbation of H3K9me3 in HP1E mutant testis would be extremely interesting; however, chromatin organization in late spermatogenesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is poorly characterized. We would first need to rigorously describe the distribution of the H3K9me3 mark in wildtype testes and then compare it to the HP1E-knockout case. Moreover, since only a small subset of cells in the testes express HP1E, there is a high likelihood that any effect of HP1E depletion on H3K9me3 would be masked by heterogeneous testis cell types.</p><p><italic>3) As noted above, the RNAseq data show that many genes change their expression in HP1E mutants. Do any these genes encode chromatin modifying proteins, or proteins that directly associate with chromatin?</italic></p><p>This question was one of the first we investigated after analyzing the RNA-seq data. We did not highlight this because very few genes emerged that are known to encode chromatin modifying proteins or chromosome-bound proteins. The few that came out of our go analysis were all uncharacterized “CGs”. We now explicitly refer to this result (please see the subsection “HP1E encodes a spermiogenesis-restricted chromatin protein”).</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>Major points</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) I'm not very familiar with the spermatid stage being studied but take the authors' point from cited refs that heterochromatin cannot be identified with HP1A, H3MeK9, etc. at that stage. So the inability to directly examine HP1E chromatin localization is an acceptable limitation of the system. Localization in other tissue types upon ectopic expression obviously has caveats but would be useful to show if available</italic>.</p><p>We agree that cytological data establishing HP1E heterochromatin localization even using ectopic overexpression would be ideal. However, we previously discovered HP1E fails to localize to chromatin when overexpressed in tissue culture cells (unlike the female germline HP1D, HP1D/Rhino). The striking difference between somatic and germline localization complicates interpretation of HP1E ectopic overexpression experiments.</p><p><italic>The RNA-seq analysis is presented as an indirect alternative to determine whether HP1E is a heterochromatin protein, but more could potentially be gained from this, and the analyses clarified. How are heterochromatin genes defined in this study?</italic></p><p>Heterochromatin genes are defined by their chromosomal locations according to the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Release 5 cytolocations. We now explicitly refer to the annotation of these heterochromatin-embedded genes (in the subsection headed “RNA-seq Methods”). Also in response to Reviewer 2’s request, we now give more details about the genes that are overexpressed (unfortunately most of them are uncharacterized).</p><p><italic>What proportion of them are misregulated—all misregulated may be upregulated</italic>, <italic>but out of what total?</italic></p><p>1/3 of all heterochromatin-embedded genes are significantly misregulated at a p-value of 0.05 and 1/4 at 0.02. Possibly even more compelling was our finding that over 90% of all heterochromatin-embedded genes are upregulated independent of significance level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2–source data 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>Are they equally affected on all chromosome arms—this might give some insight into the apparent specificity of the segregation defect? How do such results compare to euchromatic genes? Chromosome 4 would be of particular interest due to its unusual heterochromatic state</italic>.</p><p>This is a good idea. Unfortunately, we did not detect any significant chromosome effects, including for 4<sup>th</sup> chromosomes genes, but our power is severely limited by the low numbers of heterochromatin-embedded genes annotated per chromosome.</p><p><italic>Analysis of repetitive sequences could also be informative for addressing whether HP1E is a general or specific chromatin regulator. There's little doubt that satellite sequences are not proportionally represented in Illumina data, especially RNA-Seq, but we have had some success with Hmr and Lhr in mapping reads to satellites, with the results partially correlating with cytological data</italic>.</p><p>We did map our reads to repetitive elements (using the repeat masker file, which also contains satellite repeats) but did not find any compelling patterns of up- (or down-) regulation. Only a single element (GTWIN_LTR) exhibited a log -fold change &gt; 2 (2.1), and it was down rather than up in the mutant testis.</p><p><italic>2) Relating to the issue of whether HP1E is a heterochromatin protein, and its degree of specificity, the mis-segregation phenotypes in Figyre 7 look very different from what we've seen in Ferree's work at later embryonic stages, where mis-segregating sequences like 359 go all the way across the anaphase bridges. Here with HP1E mutant the probes are forming clusters that don't look any more stretched out compared to normal segregation, e.g., when comparing the presumed maternal and paternal X's in the female embryo. So most of the stretched material in the bridge is unidentified. It would be informative to look at additional probes such as rDNA and a few euchromatic loci. Were centromeres looked at (may have missed)?</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref> <italic>(and others) are also lacking wild type controls. Here they are really essential in order to interpret the mutant phenotypes</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment that that the X chromosome bridge phenotype is quite distinct from the Ferree and Barbash publication. We now address this difference in the Results section (“Heterochromatin-rich paternal sex chromosomes are especially vulnerable to HP1E depletion”). We have also now conducted a new FISH experiment directed at the rDNA (see above and Results section). We also did investigate the centromeres (via CenpC staining); this data appears in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5–figure supplement 4</xref>.
