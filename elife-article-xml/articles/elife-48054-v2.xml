terminal electron acceptors and discovering the ways in which electrons move through the membrane barrier to the exterior acceptor forms an active field of research with implications for both bacterial physiology and bioenergy. A previous study suggested that <italic>Shewanella oneidensis</italic> MR-1 utilizes a small, polar, redox active molecule that serves as an electron shuttle between the bacteria and insoluble acceptors, but the shuttle itself has never been identified. Through isolation and synthesis, we identify it as ACNQ (2-amino-3-carboxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), a soluble analog of menaquinone. ACNQ is derived from DHNA (1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid) in a non-enzymatic process that frustrated genetic approaches to identify the shuttle. Both ACNQ and DHNA restore reduction of AQDS under anaerobic growth in menaquinone-deficient mutants. Bioelectrochemistry analyses reveal that ACNQ (−0.32 V<sub>Ag/AgCl</sub>) contributes to the extracellular electron transfer (EET) as an electron shuttle, without altering menaquinone generation or EET related cytochrome c expression.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48054.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In order to survive, we break down food through a series of chemical reactions that release energy to power our cells.

It survives on the energy released as electrons move from the substrates that are oxidized to terminal electron acceptors (TEAs). The redox reactions that support life embrace a huge variety of substrates, intermediates, and acceptors as different environments demand different tactics. Anaerobic bacteria with an insoluble TEA face an especially demanding challenge as they must move electrons from inside their cells where the life-sustaining redox reactions occur, to outside the cell where the TEA resides. One solution to this transfer is an ‘electron shuttle’ – a redox active, diffusible molecule that shuttles electrons between a bacterial cell and a TEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brutinel and Gralnick, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gralnick and Newman, 2007</xref>).</p><p><italic>Shewanella oneidensis</italic> MR-1 has been a model organism for studying extracellular electron shuttles since it was discovered by Myers and Nealson in 1988 for its ability to use an array of insoluble, extracellular TEAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Myers and Nealson, 1988</xref>). In 2000 Newman and Kolter provided evidence for an extracellular electron shuttle in MR-1 by demonstrating that strains with a defect in menaquinone (MK) biosynthesis could not grow anaerobically with some TEAs, unless nearby wild type MR-1 provided a ‘quinone-like’ extracellular electron shuttle that functioned as a public good (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Newman and Kolter, 2000</xref>). While their study suggested the existence of an electron shuttle, it did not identify it, and additional attempts at identification led to conflicting results. Subsequent studies by several research groups have since demonstrated that excreted flavins by MR-1 can mediate the reduction of various insoluble TEAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brutinel and Gralnick, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kotloski and Gralnick, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Marsili et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">von Canstein et al., 2008</xref>), such as Fe(III) oxide and electrodes. Conversely, a report by Myers and Myers in 2004 used thin-layer chromatography and UV absorption spectroscopy to conclude that the excreted ‘quinone-like’ metabolite was not an electron shuttle, but rather a biosynthetic intermediate of MK that is capable of bypassing the MK-deficient mutants’ defect and thus generating small amounts of demethyl-MK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Myers and Myers, 2004</xref>). Collectively the previous attempts to identify the elusive electron shuttle demonstrated that it is small (&lt;300 amu), very polar, potent, and excreted under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions by many different bacteria. We were motivated to reinvestigate the identity of this metabolite - shuttle or MK intermediate - as it was never characterized and its identity has reemerged as a research priority through its potential role in bio-energy development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Shi et al., 2016</xref>). In this report we provide evidence that ACNQ (2-amino-3-carboxy-1,4-naphthoquinone) acts as MR-1’s elusive electron shuttle, describe the unusual biosynthetic pathway leading to ACNQ formation and demonstrate the ability of ACNQ to transfer electrons from MR-1 to carbon felt anodes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We began by culturing MR-1 as previously described and assaying for shuttling activity using the original assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Newman and Kolter, 2000</xref>) - the ability to recover respiration of an isogenic MK-deficient <italic>menC</italic> mutant strain (<italic>menC</italic>::Tn<italic>10</italic>) on a color-changing TEA, anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Rounds of bioassay-guided isolation (see Materials and methods – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>) produced highly active reduced complexity fractions and ultimately a single fraction containing the active molecule (C<sub>11</sub>H<sub>8</sub>NO<sub>4</sub>, [M + H]<sup>+</sup> <italic>m/z</italic> 218.0445, calcd. 218.0448 Δ 1.4 ppm). Detailed characterization was challenging as positive mode MS fragmentation did not match any metabolite in commercially available libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), and our extremely mass-limited samples precluded NMR techniques. Additional MS-based experiments revealed that three of the seven protons were exchangeable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), and negative mode MS data analyzed with the Metlin database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Guijas et al., 2018</xref>) identified a MK fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). The candidate fitting the molecular composition, MK core, and other data was ACNQ (2-amino-3-carboxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). An independent synthesis of ACNQ and LCMS comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>) confirmed that ACNQ was the unidentified metabolite in the wild type supernatant that recovered utilization of AQDS (−184 mV vs. SHE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aulenta et al., 2010</xref>) by the <italic>menC</italic> mutant (<italic>menC</italic>::Tn<italic>10</italic>).

As mutations upstream of the synthesis of DHNA (1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid) abolish ACNQ production, we hypothesized that DHNA is used as the substrate for ACNQ production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). <italic>menA</italic> mutants derived from MR-1 and <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 (<italic>menA</italic>::Himar and <italic>menA789::kan</italic>, respectively) produced 2.5 times higher amounts of ACNQ than their wild type parent counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). This increase is consistent with the function of MenA in converting DHNA to demethyl-MK and thus reducing the levels of DHNA available for conversion to ACNQ. Additional support came from the observation that while the genes for the production of MK are not clustered, the genes for the production of DHNA are in one small region of the circular chromosome, while <italic>menA</italic>, which encodes a protein carrying out the step directly following DHNA production in the canonical pathway, is on the opposite side of the chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>To further characterize the conversion of DHNA to ACNQ we searched for the transaminase responsible for this reaction. The most likely candidate seemed to be GlmS, a glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate transaminase, which is expressed by a gene located downstream of <italic>menB.</italic> However, knocking out <italic>glmS</italic> did not result in loss of production of ACNQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). As there were 18 other transaminases in the NCBI-annotated MR-1 genome, we adopted a systematic approach using <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 rather than a piecemeal approach using MR-1 to identify the responsible transaminase. Strains containing disruptions in all 22 annotated genes encoding aminotransferases/transaminases found in <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 genome were acquired from The Coli Genetic Stock Center (CGSC), (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). All of the mutant strains were able to make ACNQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The failure to identify an <italic>E. coli</italic> aminotransferase/transaminase mutant unable to make ACNQ coupled with the failure of several prior genetic screens (transposon libraries) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Myers and Myers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Newman and Kolter, 2000</xref>) in MR-1 background to identify respiration defects in any genes other than MK biosynthetic genes suggested that DHNA might be converted to ACNQ by a non-enzymatic pathway.</p><p>To investigate whether ACNQ forms spontaneously, dilute DHNA was incubated in a variety of aqueous solutions, including the minimal media used in this work to culture MR-1, minimal media with a mixture of amino acids as the sole nitrogen source, and an ammonium phosphate buffered solution. All conditions led to the conversion of DHNA to ACNQ after 24 hr with no remaining DHNA detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplements 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">9</xref>). DHNA is quite labile and appeared to react with other media components as was evident by the complex LCMS chromatogram of the reaction mixtures. Furthermore, MR-1 produced ACNQ when grown on a variety of nitrogen sources, i.e. ammonium sulfate or different amino acid mixtures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s10">Figure 2—figure supplement 10</xref>). Quantification of both the MK pool in the cell pellet and ACNQ in the supernatant, 350 nM and 1.5 nM of MR-1 culture, respectively, indicated that only 2% of the DHNA pool would need to be diverted to ACNQ production if ACNQ were to be generated entirely non-enzymatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s11">Figure 2—figure supplement 11</xref>). A likely non-enzymatic mechanism would commence with the oxidation of DHNA to the quinone then conjugate addition of ammonium at the C3 position followed by enol formation and a subsequent oxidation of the hydroquinone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s12">Figure 2—figure supplement 12</xref>).</p><p>ACNQ, DHNA, menadione, MK-4, and riboflavin were each evaluated for their ability to recover <italic>menC</italic> mutant (<italic>menC</italic>::Tn<italic>10</italic>) reduction of AQDS to AHQDS under anaerobic conditions when it is the sole TEA. These metabolites where chosen because they represent either products of the disrupted pathway in the <italic>menC</italic> mutant strain (MK-4 and DHNA), were previously implicated in electron shuttling (riboflavin) or to define structure-activity relationships (menadione). ACNQ, DHNA, and MK-4 exhibited activity with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 25.0 ± 6.0, 106.2 ± 11.2, and 87.8 ± 4.7 nM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), while neither menadione nor riboflavin allowed for AQDS reduction by <italic>menC</italic> mutant strain (concentrations up to 50 μM). It should be noted that while DHNA can recover respiration nearly as efficiently as ACNQ, DHNA decomposes relatively quickly in media and was not detected in the spent supernatant of MR-1 cultures (data not shown). Although ACNQ is structurally similar to the MK precursor DHNA, addition of ACNQ does not replenish the MK pool in <italic>menC</italic> mutant (<italic>menC</italic>::Tn<italic>10</italic>) as we demonstrated by HR-LCMS analysis on the lipid contents of both MK-negative and MR-1 cultures grown in the presence of various concentrations of ACNQ. This analysis revealed no evidence that ACNQ was being converted to MK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s13">Figure 2—figure supplements 13</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s15">15</xref>), demethyl-MK, or an amino-modified MK analog. The instrument limit of detection for MK and demethyl-MK under the tested conditions is approximately 60 fmol, allowing for the detection of the presence of approximately 20 pmol of MK in a 50 mL culture. The inability of ACNQ to be converted to MK or related analog contrasts with previous findings by Myers and Myers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Myers and Myers, 2004</xref>), however it is important to note that the previous work used a complex mixture of metabolites that is present in spent supernatant and used thin-layer chromatography, a much less informative analytical method.</p><p>To better understand the ability of ACNQ to act as an electron shuttle, we followed the work of Marsili et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Marsili et al., 2008</xref>) and performed detailed bioelectrochemical experiments in which we varied the availability of ACNQ. We grew a biofilm of MR-1 using lactate as the sole electron donor, M9 medium as the electrolyte with 1 μM ACNQ as the possible electron shuttle, and a carbon felt electrode biased at −0.1 V<sub>Ag/AgCl</sub> as the sole electron acceptor. This potential was chosen in order to restrict the redox processes close to the redox potential of ACNQ (−0.32 V<sub>Ag/AgCl</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The established biofilm produced a significant oxidation current,~22 μA·cm<sup>−2</sup>, after 25 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). When the medium was removed and replaced with fresh anaerobic medium, the oxidation current dropped more than 90% [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, curve (1)], showing that the major carrier of current was soluble. 1 μM ACNQ was then added into the reactor, resulted in an immediate increase in current [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, curve (2)], which stabilized in 6 hr to 45% of the original biofilm current, indicating that ACNQ is responsible for the current generation. The loss of planktonic cells and secreted flavins in the original media when changing the media might be the reason that current is not fully restored. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, curve (1) and (2)] reveals a major catalytic wave initiated at around −0.34 V<sub>Ag/AgCl</sub>, which matches the oxidation peak potential of ACNQ. No peaks associated with flavins were observed under these conditions. Also, the peak width at half height (W<sub>1/2</sub>) obtained by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) is 66 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that more than one electron is transferred during the redox reaction as would be expected for the oxidation of a hydroquinone to quinone.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48054.024</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>ACNQ acts as an extracellular electron transfer mediator for MR-1 in a bioelectrochemical system.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The current production of an established MR-1 biofilm over time in the presence of different media.

Further CV analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) indicates that ACNQ is also acting as an absorbed redox species, much like what was observed with flavins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Marsili et al., 2008</xref>). These data indicates that ACNQ can act as the major electron carrier to a carbon-based electrode when biased at −0.1 V<sub>Ag/AgCl</sub>.</p><p>A series of chronoamperometry experiments was performed to investigate how ACNQ influences extracellular electron transfer. In the absence of bacterial cells, ACNQ does not generate current to a biased electrode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Likewise, in the absence of ACNQ, both wild type MR-1 and <italic>menC::Tn10</italic> produce very low current density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We suggest that this occurs because the −0.1 V<sub>Ag/AgCl</sub> potential is too negative for electron transfer through outer membrane cytochromes, and because the bacteria were washed before injection so neither flavins nor ACNQ is present at sufficient concentration to mediate electron transfer. Addition of exogenous ACNQ to wild type MR-1 and <italic>menC</italic> mutant (<italic>menC</italic>::Tn<italic>10</italic>) immediately increases current 33- and 36- fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In accordance with our previous results, HR-LCMS analysis of the relative MK concentration revealed no differences in MK or amino-modified MK analogues’ levels between ACNQ and DMSO-treated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Furthermore, ACNQ does not affect the cytochrome <italic>c</italic> expression in <italic>menC</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), which excludes the possibility that the current increase was due to any change in the cyt c.

To maintain anaerobic conditions, bioreactors were continuously purged with N<sub>2</sub> gas. All the experiment were tested under 30°C. Electrolyte contained M9 growth medium (BD), 50 mM D,L-lactate. Bacteria were cultured aerobically in LB broth at 30°C with 200 rpm shaking overnight. Before injection into the bioreactor, the cells were washed twice with M9 media to remove the LB media.</p><p>Chronoamperometry, cyclic voltammetry, and differential pulse voltammetry were carried out using a Bio-Logic Science Instruments potentiostat model VSP-300. For the chronoamperometry test, the applied potential was set at −0.1 V versus Ag/AgCl, electric currents are reported as a function of the geometric surface area of the electrode. Cyclic voltammetry measurements in the potential region of −0.8 to +0.6 V versus Ag/AgCl and a scan rate of 10 mV s<sup>−1</sup> (if there is no additional declaration). Differential pulse voltammetry measurement was performed with the same scan window, 50 mV pulses height, 500 ms pulses width, 1 mV step height and 1000 ms step time.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by NIH [R01 GM086258 and AT980074 (JC)] and work performed at the Molecular Foundry was supported by the Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231 (CMAF).

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;An elusive electron shuttle from a facultative anaerobe&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jules Butt (Reviewer #4).</p><p>Though there is much to appreciate about the insights gained into ACNQ production on a technical level, the study falls short of demonstrating an unambiguous role for ACNQ as an electron shuttle. Without that critical piece, despite the impressiveness of the authors' chemistry, the story is not a good fit for <italic>eLife</italic>. Constructive reviews from three experts are appended below that we hope will help the authors design additional experiments to better test whether ACNQ is an electron shuttle. Should that prove to be the case, we would welcome a new version to be resubmitted to <italic>eLife</italic>. Assuming you are prepared to do this, we will endeavor to assign the same editor and reviewers to consider the new version of your work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Mevers et al. identify a byproduct of menaquinone biosynthesis (ACNQ) and propose that it functions biologically as an electron shuttle for extracellular electron transfer in <italic>Shewanella</italic>. The authors seem to lack familiarity with literature on <italic>Shewanella</italic> physiology and extracellular electron transfer. Specific growth data is absent in this manuscript, focusing rather on use of AQDS as a proxy for respiration activity, which is problematic for reasons described below. It has previously been established MR-1 is able to cross-feed menaquinone defective mutant strains, which the authors do not discuss and conflicts with data presented here. The evidence that ACNQ plays a specific role in extracellular electron transfer in <italic>Shewanella</italic> is unconvincing. Finally, the authors choose not to present any background on what is known about flavins and their established role as extracellular electron shuttles. This seems odd, considering the wealth of data from multiple labs supporting this role for flavins in <italic>Shewanella</italic> and the focus of this manuscript.</p><p>Introduction: The authors misrepresent the 2004 report by Myers and Myers as evidence that a quinone shuttle could not be identified. Rather, this work presented conclusive data that cross-feeding was occurring between MR-1 and a strain defective in menaquinone production (a menB point mutation, in this case). It should be noted that Newman and Kolter (2000) also suggested that their observations could be explained by cross-feeding, but favored a model of electron shuttling. The authors go on to claim that ACNQ addition did not restore menaquinone biosynthesis, however some clarifications in the protocol would be helpful to understand better how the cells were grown and if different concentrations of ACNQ were tried.</p><p>Results and Discussion, first paragraph: AQDS is perfectly soluble.

Please include 'CymA' in the figure legend here and a description of what the error bars are. CymA is important because it is known to require a menaquinone-derived cofactor for activity (McMillan et al., 2012, JBC). The observed enhancement here could be related to helping provide a cofactor that may be limiting in the native <italic>E. coli</italic> system? Did the authors attempt to quantify quinone levels after ACNQ addition? What is the current profile when ACNQ is added without cells? Is oxygen being scrubbed from the system and therefore more electrons are available to the electrode? Importantly, the authors should perform a medium swap experiment. If the enhancement was due to a co-factor addition and/or quinone pool augmentation current generation will remain high after the swap. If ACNQ is indeed a shuttle, current will return to the unaugmented levels. Finally, considering the established role for riboflavin and FMN as extracellular electron shuttles, it would be interesting to see how addition of these compounds assist in current production under these conditions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This contribution from Clardy and co-workers addresses a longstanding mystery in natural product isolation: identification of the small molecule that complements respiration in menaquinone-deficient mutants of <italic>Shewanella oneidensis</italic> MR-1. Using a bioactivity-guided approach, they isolate ACNQ and confirm its structure via comparison to a synthetic standard. They investigate the biosynthesis of this molecule, providing compelling evidence that it derived from a non-enzymatic transformation of the menaquinone biosynthetic intermediate DHNA. Finally, they show that addition of ACNQ recovers current generation in the <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> menC mutant and instantaneously increases current generation by an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain expressing CymA and MtrCAB. Together, these results suggest ACNQ is indeed the 'missing' redox-active small molecule originally identified by Newman and Kolter.</p><p>My main concern related to the claims of this paper is that the evidence presented for ACNQ playing a direct role in extracellular transfer to insoluble terminal electron acceptors is quite limited. For example, the first paragraph of the Results and Discussion describes AQDS as an insoluble electron acceptor. I am unclear if this is a typo, but AQDS is used as a model compound as a soluble EET mediator. It is extremely soluble in water. It is an excellent choice for the authors' screen to discover ACNQ, but reduction of AQDS does not necessarily demonstrate an extracellular role for ACNQ. Indeed, in the sixth paragraph of the Results and Discussion the authors acknowledge that AQDS can be reduced by intracellular enzymes. Although the authors have shown that ACNQ does not restore the menaquinone pool, I do not think they have eliminated the possibility that ACNQ is complementing the intracellular reduction of AQDS. Similarly, the conclusion states &quot;[ACNQ] alone is capable of recovering respiration on metal-oxides&quot;. But the manuscript does not present data to support this conclusion-as far as I can tell, the only metal substrate tested was iron citrate, a soluble form of chelated iron (and I cannot seem to find the data for iron citrate or fumarate experiments).</p><p>There is also little discussion of this result in the context of what is already known about flavins, which are currently proposed to be responsible for extracellular electron transport in S. oneidensis (see Marsili, Baron, Shikhare, Coursolle, Gralnick, and Bond 2008 PNAS; Kotloski and Gralnick 2013 mBio). Indeed, flavins are mentioned only in the final sentence of the paper. Can the authors reconcile their results with what has been previously reported?

Identification and biosynthesis of ACNQ is described followed by demonstration that ACNQ can enhance electron exchange between MR-1 and electrodes.

Where content in the original manuscript was less convincing it has been removed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript is improved. The authors have put together an impressive array of experiments. I believe they have found something interesting in ACNQ – a byproduct of menaquinone biosynthesis that appears to be able to 'steal' electrons from cells. However, the claim that this molecule plays a significant role in extracellular electron transfer in <italic>Shewanella oneidensis</italic> is not supported by the results presented here.</p><p>When the authors poise a graphite felt electrode at -0.1V vs Ag/AgCl and add 1 μm ACNQ (~ 1000X more than is produced natively) a small amount of current is produced. The new chronoamperometry data is nice, showing that ACNQ indeed appears to act as an electron shuttle – current drops when it's taken away and is restored when added back. However, this current is independent of the Mtr pathway or menaquinone biosynthesis, both of which are essential for growth of <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> via extracellular electron transfer on a variety of substrates (electrodes, iron and manganese minerals, Fe-citrate, etc.). When ACNQ is produced at wild-type levels, MR-1 is unable to produce current under these conditions (-0.1V vs. Ag/AgCl) as the authors point out (Results and Discussion, ninth paragraph). The authors demonstrate that this molecule can act as an electron shuttle, but also show that this activity is irrelevant at the levels naturally produced by the cells. In my opinion, the authors should do a better job communicating this observation.</p><p>ACNQ appears to be acting as an electron pirate, perhaps in a way analogous to neutral red, providing a sink for cellular electrons acquired in the periplasm, cytoplasmic membrane or in the cytoplasm, then delivering the electrons to the poised graphite felt electrode (Park and Zeikus, 2000, AEM). Like neutral red, this activity could have some interesting biotechnological applications.</p><p>A previous comment of mine and response is pasted below. If ACNQ is known to enter cells and acquire electrons from molecules such as NADPH, perhaps this explains the men and mtr-independent current generation? This possibility seems relevant to understanding the role of ACNQ in electron transfer and could be similar to what has been observed previously with neutral red.</p><p>Results and Discussion, sixth paragraph: I'm confused by the logic here.

The authors seem to lack familiarity with literature on Shewanella physiology and extracellular electron transfer. Specific growth data is absent in this manuscript, focusing rather on use of AQDS as a proxy for respiration activity, which is problematic for reasons described below. It has previously been established MR-1 is able to cross-feed menaquinone defective mutant strains, which the authors do not discuss and conflicts with data presented here. The evidence that ACNQ plays a specific role in extracellular electron transfer in Shewanella is unconvincing. Finally, the authors choose not to present any background on what is known about flavins and their established role as extracellular electron shuttles. This seems odd, considering the wealth of data from multiple labs supporting this role for flavins in Shewanella and the focus of this manuscript.</p><p>Introduction: The authors misrepresent the 2004 report by Myers and Myers as evidence that a quinone shuttle could not be identified. Rather, this work presented conclusive data that cross-feeding was occurring between MR-1 and a strain defective in menaquinone production (a menB point mutation, in this case). It should be noted that Newman and Kolter, 2000, also suggested that their observations could be explained by cross-feeding, but favored a model of electron shuttling. The authors go on to claim that ACNQ addition did not restore menaquinone biosynthesis, however some clarifications in the protocol would be helpful to understand better how the cells were grown and if different concentrations of ACNQ were tried.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for making this distinction.

We also observe that addition of ACNQ to the <italic>S. oneidensis menC::Tn10</italic>, which cannot produce either MQ or ACNQ, recovers AQDS reduction (Figure 1C).

What then does it mean for electron shuttling to be stimulated at non-physiological levels? Bringing this observation to the foreground would go far to clarify the impact of this finding on the EET field. Clarifying this point should be straightforward with one more round of revision and will substantially improve the contribution this study will make the to literature. Please also consider the constructive points of the reviewers below before submitting a final revision.</p></disp-quote><p>Bulk levels of ACNQ in mature liquid cultures (1.5 nM) are only about 12-20x lower than measured EC50 value (25 nM) for reduction of AQDS. Under physiologically relevant growth conditions where <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> MR-1 is growing in a biofilm on a mineral, the local concentration will be significantly higher than the bulk concentration in culture conditions. As part of this revision, we did quantify the local concentration of ACNQ using a simulation (see SI for details) and this simulation suggests that the local concentration of ACNQ when growing in a biofilm would be 1000-fold greater than the bulk concentration. Even if this calculation is off by one or two orders of magnitude, the local concentration, which is the physiologically relevant concentration, would still be higher than the EC50. The question equates bulk and physiological concentrations, which are different.</p><p>We used 1 μM ACNQ in the bioreactors in order to ensure that we maintained levels above the EC90 throughout the entire multi-day experiment, i.e. accounting for any potential degradation of ACNQ, and never titrated down the concentration of ACNQ. We have emphasized these important points in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript is improved. The authors have put together an impressive array of experiments. I believe they have found something interesting in ACNQ – a byproduct of menaquinone biosynthesis that appears to be able to 'steal' electrons from cells. However, the claim that this molecule plays a significant role in extracellular electron transfer in Shewanella oneidensis is not supported by the results presented here.</p><p>When the authors poise a graphite felt electrode at -0.1V vs. Ag/AgCl and add 1 μm ACNQ (~ 1000X more than is produced natively) a small amount of current is produced. The new chronoamperometry data is nice, showing that ACNQ indeed appears to act as an electron shuttle – current drops when it's taken away and is restored when added back. However, this current is independent of the Mtr pathway or menaquinone biosynthesis, both of which are essential for growth of S. oneidensis via extracellular electron transfer on a variety of substrates (electrodes, iron and manganese minerals, Fe-citrate, etc.). When ACNQ is produced at wild-type levels, MR-1 is unable to produce current under these conditions (-0.1V vs. Ag/AgCl) as the authors point out (Results and Discussion, ninth paragraph). The authors demonstrate that this molecule can act as an electron shuttle, but also show that this activity is irrelevant at the levels naturally produced by the cells. In my opinion, the authors should do a better job communicating this observation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful comments; however, we believe they misunderstood our results. Both the wild type and mutant strains were washed several times prior to inoculation into the bioreactors in order to avoid transferring excreted ACNQ or flavins. In addition, we’d like to point out the -0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl potential applied the electrode is not ideal for MR1 to generate energy through EET anaerobically as we “turn off” the direct EET through Mtr pathway. In addition, there is no mediator available to perform indirect EET after washing. Most likely these factors will repress the regeneration of both ACNQ and flavin below the natural levels. As expected, no current was generated in the absence of any small molecule mediators. We did not test whether or not unwashed wild type strain, with flavin and/or ACNQ present, could support bacteria growth.</p><p>We chose to use significantly higher concentrations of ACNQ in the bioreactors in order to ensure that we maintained levels above the EC<sub>90</sub> throughout the entire multi-day experiment, i.e. accounting for any potential degradation of ACNQ. Furthermore, levels of ACNQ in liquid culture (1.5 nM) is only about 12-20x lower than measured EC<sub>50</sub> value (25 nM) for reduction of AQDS. Under physiologically relevant growth conditions where <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> MR-1 is growing in a biofilm on a mineral, the local concentration is presumably significantly higher than the bulk concentration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ACNQ appears to be acting as an electron pirate, perhaps in a way analogous to neutral red, providing a sink for cellular electrons acquired in the periplasm, cytoplasmic membrane or in the cytoplasm, then delivering the electrons to the poised graphite felt electrode (Park and Zeikus, 2000, AEM). Like neutral red, this activity could have some interesting biotechnological applications.</p><p>A previous comment of mine and response is pasted below. If ACNQ is known to enter cells and acquire electrons from molecules such as NADPH, perhaps this explains the men and mtr-independent current generation? This possibility seems relevant to understanding the role of ACNQ in electron transfer and could be similar to what has been observed previously with neutral red.</p><p>Results and Discussion, sixth paragraph: I'm confused by the logic here. The authors wish to explore the potential ability of ACNQ to function as an extracellular electron shuttle. However, the authors then go on to cite an example of where ACNQ clearly has an intracellular role as a mediator to reduce NADP, which is found inside cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment, but note that NADP/NADPH has a more negative redox potential (-0.370 V vs. SHE) than ACNQ (-0.32 V vs. Ag/AgCl), which means that at least in principle ACNQ could receive electrons through NADPH directly thus bypassing MK as we established in our studies. We mentioned this and cited studies with cell-free extracts of <italic>B. longum</italic> 6001 in the first submission, which we decided to remove in previous revision based on reviewer comments, and we the fact that we did not attempt to replicate those experiments.</p><p>ACNQ has significant promise for biotechnological applications, which is one of the reasons we’d like to share these results with the community.</p></body></sub-article></article>
