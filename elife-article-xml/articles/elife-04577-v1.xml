neurons comprising the <italic>Drosophila</italic> mushroom body (MB), an associative center in invertebrate brains, and provide a comprehensive map describing their potential connections. Each of the 21 MB output neuron (MBON) types elaborates segregated dendritic arbors along the parallel axons of ∼2000 Kenyon cells, forming 15 compartments that collectively tile the MB lobes. MBON axons project to five discrete neuropils outside of the MB and three MBON types form a feedforward network in the lobes. Each of the 20 dopaminergic neuron (DAN) types projects axons to one, or at most two, of the MBON compartments. Convergence of DAN axons on compartmentalized Kenyon cell–MBON synapses creates a highly ordered unit that can support learning to impose valence on sensory representations. The elucidation of the complement of neurons of the MB provides a comprehensive anatomical substrate from which one can infer a functional logic of associative olfactory learning and memory.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04577.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04577.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04577.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>One of the key goals of neuroscience is to understand how specific circuits of brain cells enable animals to respond optimally to the constantly changing world around them. Such processes are more easily studied in simpler brains, and the fruit fly—with its small size, short life cycle, and well-developed genetic toolkit—is widely used to study the genes and circuits that underlie learning and behavior.</p><p>Fruit flies can learn to approach odors that have previously been paired with food, and also to avoid any odors that have been paired with an electric shock, and a part of the brain called the mushroom body has a central role in this process. When odorant molecules bind to receptors on the fly's antennae, they activate neurons in the antennal lobe of the brain, which in turn activate cells called Kenyon cells within the mushroom body. The Kenyon cells then activate output neurons that convey signals to other parts of the brain.</p><p>It is known that relatively few Kenyon cells are activated by any given odor. Moreover, it seems that a given odor activates different sets of Kenyon cells in different flies. Because the association between an odor and the Kenyon cells it activates is unique to each fly, each fly needs to learn through its own experiences what a particular pattern of Kenyon cell activation means.</p><p>Aso et al. have now applied sophisticated molecular genetic and anatomical techniques to thousands of different transgenic flies to identify the neurons of the mushroom body. The resulting map reveals that the mushroom body contains roughly 2200 neurons, including seven types of Kenyon cells and 21 types of output cells, as well as 20 types of neurons that use the neurotransmitter dopamine. Moreover, this map provides insights into the circuits that support odor-based learning. It reveals, for example, that the mushroom body can be divided into 15 anatomical compartments that are each defined by the presence of a specific set of output and dopaminergic neuron cell types. Since the dopaminergic neurons help to shape a fly's response to odors on the basis of previous experience, this organization suggests that these compartments may be semi-autonomous information processing units.</p><p>In contrast to the rest of the insect brain, the mushroom body has a flexible organization that is similar to that of the mammalian brain. Elucidating the circuits that support associative learning in fruit flies should therefore make it easier to identify the equivalent mechanisms in vertebrate animals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

Innate behaviors are observed in naïve animals without prior learning or experience, suggesting that they are mediated by genetically determined neural circuits. Responses to most sensory stimuli, however, are not innate but experience-dependent, allowing an organism to respond appropriately in a variable and uncertain world. Thus, most sensory cues acquire behavioral relevance through learning. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, a number of different forms of learning have been observed in response to sensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Siegel and Hall, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liu et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Masek and Scott, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schnaitmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ofstad et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Vogt et al., 2014</xref>). In associative olfactory learning, exposure to an odor (conditioned stimulus, CS) in association with an unconditioned stimulus (US) results in appetitive or aversive memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Quinn et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tempel et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tully and Quinn, 1985</xref>). Olfactory memory formation and retrieval in insects require the mushroom body (MB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heisenberg et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">de Belle and Heisenberg, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dubnau et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McGuire et al., 2001</xref>), an associative center in the protocerebrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04577.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Anatomy of olfactory pathways in the adult fly brain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) An image of the adult female brain showing the antennal lobes (AL) and subregions of the mushroom bodies (MB; see panel <bold>B</bold> for more detail). The image was generated using a 3D image rendering software (FluoRender) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wan et al., 2012</xref>). The 51 glomeruli of the AL extend projection neurons (PN) to the calyx of the MB and the lateral horn (LH). There are a total of ∼200 PN; 6 from the DL3 glomerulus are shown. See <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> for an introduction to olfactory circuit. (<bold>B</bold>) Subregions within the MB. The γ lobe, calyx, and pedunculus (ped) are displayed separately from other lobes; their normal positions are as shown in panel <bold>A</bold> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>. Color-coding is as in panel <bold>A</bold>. See below for a detailed description of dorsal accessory calyx (dAC) and ventral accessory calyx (vAC). (<bold>C</bold>) A schematic representation of the key cellular components and information flow during processing of olfactory inputs to the MB (see text for references and more details). Olfactory receptor neurons expressing the same odorant receptor converge onto a single glomerulus in the AL. A small number (generally 3–4) of PNs from each of the 51 AL glomeruli innervate the MB calyx where they synapse on the dendrites of the ∼2000 Kenyon cells (KCs) in a globular structure, the calyx. Each KC exhibits, on average, 6.4 dendritic ‘claws’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Butcher et al., 2012</xref>), and each claw is innervated by a single PN. There is little order in connection patterns of PNs to KCs. The axons of the KCs project in parallel anteriorly through the pedunculus to the lobes, where KCs terminate onto the dendrites of MB output neurons (MBONs). KCs can be categorized into three major classes α/β, α′/β′, and γ based on their projection patterns in the lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Crittenden et al., 1998</xref>). The β, β′, and γ lobes constitute the medial lobes (also known as horizontal lobes), while the α and α′ lobes constitute the vertical lobes. These lobes are separately wrapped by ensheathing glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Awasaki et al., 2008</xref>). The α/β and α′/β′ neurons bifurcate at the anterior end of the pedunculus and project to both the medial and vertical lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 1999</xref>). The γ neurons project only to the medial lobe. Dendrites of MBONs and terminals of modulatory dopaminergic neurons (DANs) intersect the longitudinal axis of the KC axon bundle, forming 15 subdomains, five each in the α/β, α′/β′, and γ lobes (numbered α1, α2, and α3 for subdomains in the α lobe from proximal to distal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, one MBON and one DAN innervate the core of the distal pedunculus intersecting the α/β KCs (pedc, see below). There are seven types of KCs; five of the seven types have their dendrites in the main calyx, while those of the γd cells form the vAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Butcher et al., 2012</xref>) and those of the α/βp cells the dAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>). The accessory calyces are thought to receive non-olfactory input since they do not receive input from the PNs from the AL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>). Different KCs occupy distinct layers in the lobes as indicated (p: posterior; c: core; s: surface; m: medial; a: anterior; and d: dorsal). Some MB extrinsic neurons extend processes to only a specific layer within a subdomain, defining elemental subdivisions in the lobes, or ‘synaptic units’ as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tanaka et al.

Most antennal lobe projection neurons (PNs) extend dendrites to a single glomerulus and project axons that bifurcate to innervate two brain regions, the lateral horn and the MB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stocker et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wong et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jefferis et al., 2007</xref>). The invariant circuitry of the lateral horn is thought to mediate innate behaviors, whereas the MB translates olfactory sensory information into learned behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heisenberg et al., 1985</xref>). The PN axons synapse onto the dendrites of the Kenyon cells (KCs) in the MB calyx; the parallel axons of the KCs form the MB lobes. Odors activate sparse subpopulations of KCs distributed across the MB without spatial preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Turner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Honegger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Campbell et al., 2013</xref>). Anatomical and physiological studies reveal that each KC receives on average 6.4 inputs from a random combination of glomeruli; that is, knowledge of a single input to a KC provides no information about the identity of the additional inputs, and connections differ in different flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Murthy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Caron et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gruntman and Turner, 2013</xref>). Thus, the calyx of the MB discards the highly ordered structure of the antennal lobe. A restoration of order must therefore be imposed downstream to link the KC representation to an appropriate behavioral output.</p><p>Three classes of KCs extend parallel fibers that form the γ, α′/β′, and α/β lobes of the MB, where they form synapses with a relatively small number of MB output neurons (MBONs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Crittenden et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ito et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Strausfeld et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busch et al., 2009</xref>). The MBONs have dendrites in the MB lobes and project axons to neuropils outside of the MB. Modulatory input neurons, including dopaminergic neurons (DANs) and octopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nassel and Elekes, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mao and Davis, 2009</xref>), also innervate the MB lobes. The MBONs and DANs send their processes to stereotyped locations, defining spatially restricted ‘subdomains’ in each lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ito et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mao and Davis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pech et al., 2013</xref>). However, these studies did not establish the precise anatomical relationships between the subdomains; knowledge of these relationships will be required to understand the structure and logic of MB circuits.</p><p>The DANs are the most prevalent modulatory neurons in the MB and dopamine is thought to act locally to modify KC–MBON synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aso et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Waddell, 2013</xref>). In accord with this model, DAN activity is required during learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aso et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu et al., 2012</xref>) and exogenous activation of DAN subpopulations can serve as an US in associative learning paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schroll et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Claridge-Chang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aso et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, D1-like dopamine receptors in the KCs are necessary to form olfactory memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Different populations of DANs are activated by USs of different valence; see Figure 1A of the accompanying paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014</xref>) for summary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Riemensperger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mao and Davis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Das et al., 2014</xref>). Genetic manipulation has also implicated specific subsets of MBONs in the mediation of learned appetitive and aversive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sejourne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Placais et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014</xref>). These experiments implicate the DANs as the source of the learning cue and the MBONs as the mediators of behavioral output. The elucidation of the connections between KCs, DANs, and MBONs should provide insight into a problem shared by invertebrate and vertebrate nervous systems: how is meaning imposed on an unstructured ensemble of neurons and how is imposed valence translated into an appropriate behavioral response?</p><p>In this study, we developed new genetic reagents and used them to identify the cell types and projections of the neurons comprising the MB lobes. These data provide insight into the potential connections in the MB and suggest how the MB may mediate learned behaviors. We found that the MB lobes are composed of ∼2200 neurons that include 7 KC, 21 MBON, and 20 DAN cell types. The MBONs of a given type exhibit spatially stereotyped dendritic arbors in the MB lobes that form 15 compartments that collectively tile the lobes. Each DAN cell type projects axons to one or at most two of the compartments defined by the MBONs. The alignment of DAN axons with compartmentalized KC–MBON synapses creates an isolated unit for learning that can transform the disordered KC representation into ordered MBON output. The MBON axons project to five discrete neuropils outside of the MB, providing loci for the convergence of all the information necessary for learned associative responses. The elucidation of the full complement of MB neurons and the details of their projections provide an anatomical substrate from which we can infer a functional logic of olfactory learning and memory.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We designed a genetic approach to examine the architecture of the MB circuit and identified most, if not all, of the neurons innervating the MB lobes. We screened adult brains from 7000 GAL4 lines driven by known enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pfeiffer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jenett et al., 2012</xref>) to identify lines containing neurons that innervate the MB lobes. These GAL4 drivers typically label many other neurons, making it difficult to disambiguate the projection patterns of the labeled MB neurons. We therefore identified lines with overlapping expression patterns for the MB neurons and used the split-GAL4 strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Luan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</xref>) to identify lines with more restricted expression in the MB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). After screening 2500 such intersections, we obtained more than 400 split-GAL4 combinations that had strong expression in the MB neurons. Most split-GAL4 lines that drive expression in MBONs or DANs contain a small number of neurons that share virtually identical morphologies and exhibit bilateral symmetry, and this profile is maintained across different individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3 fig2s4 fig2s5 fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplements 3–6</xref> and data not shown). The split-GAL4 lines that label the KC contain far greater cell numbers (75–600) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). These split-GAL4 lines allowed us to classify the MB neurons into cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2 media3 media4">Videos 2–4</xref>). We operationally define a cell type as a single neuron (per hemisphere) or a group of neurons that is not further subdivided in any of the 7000 GAL4 lines. Moreover, neurons within most cell types exhibit indistinguishable morphology. Importantly, we identified on average 12 GAL4 drivers that label the same cell type within the set of 7000 lines, indicating that the screen was near saturation in our large GAL4 collection.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04577.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Generation of split-GAL4 drivers for the MB neurons.</title><p>An example of the use of the split-GAL4 approach to generate a driver line specific for MBON-α′2 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> for the naming convention of MBONs and DANs). <italic>R20G03-GAL4</italic> in <italic>attP2</italic> (left) and <italic>R19F09-GAL4</italic> in <italic>attP2</italic> (center) both show expression in MBON-α′2 when crossed to <italic>pJFRC2</italic>-<italic>10XUAS-IVS-mCD8::GFP</italic> in <italic>attP2</italic> and in many other neurons that differ between the two GAL4 lines.

Photoactivation of the MB lobes was guided by a red fluorescent protein expressed broadly in the KCs (<italic>MB247-DsRed</italic>). A two-photon laser was used to achieve three-dimensional precision of the photoactivation. Photoactivation results in an increase in the fluorescence of PA-GFP molecules in the processes of neurons innervating the MB lobes.

KCs are labeled in magenta (<italic>MB247-DsRed</italic>) and the cell bodies and the processes of photoactivated neurons are shown in green (native PA-GFP fluorescence). Five clusters of cell bodies comprising more than two cells were detected reproducibly (see ‘Materials and methods’) and are schematically indicated by the boxes (bottom): 1, ventral medial cluster; 2, posterior lateral cluster; 3, dorsal medial cluster; 4, anterior lateral cluster; and 5, delineated by the dashed lines, the anterior medial cluster that includes the PAM-cluster DANs. PA-GFP labeling in the contralateral (i.e., left) hemisphere includes the cell bodies of DANs (the PAM cluster DANs in the anterior medial region and the PPL1 cluster DANs in the posterior lateral region), as they innervate the MB lobes bilaterally. Eight individual neurons were also detected, which include MB-APL and MB-DPM in the ipsilateral hemisphere, and one MBON-β1&gt;α, one MBON-γ4&gt;γ1γ2 (closed arrow), one MBON-γ3, and one MBON-γ3β′1 (open arrow) in the contralateral hemisphere, because these extend dendrites in the contralateral MB lobes (see below). In addition, one cell body ventral to the calyx (arrowhead) and one cell body ventral lateral to the antennal lobe were reproducibly observed, which represent MBONs not identified in the split-GAL4 lines (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, also see ‘Materials and methods’). The comparison of number of cells identified in split-GAL4 lines and in the PA-GFP tracing experiments is as follows: cluster name; cell counts by split-GAL4 lines, cell counts by PA-GFP tracing (sample size): (1) Ventral medial; 5, 5.2 ± 0.8 (n = 5). (2) Posterior lateral; 14–15, 15.9 ± 2.1 (n = 9). (3) Dorsal medial; 4, 5.4 ± 1.2 (n = 13). (4) Anterior lateral; 8–10, 5.9 ± 2.0 (n = 8). Note that the split-GAL4 line labeling the MBON-β′1 type, which comprises of 7–9 cells in the anterior lateral cluster (MB078C, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) includes at least three cells that exhibit very sparse dendritic arbors in the MB lobes as examined by multicolor flp-out experiments (data not shown). This was also observed in an independent experiment, in which the β′1 compartment was specifically photoactivated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and may account for the fact that PA-GFP experiments identified fewer cells than the split-GAL4 lines in the anterior lateral cluster. It was not feasible to accurately count the large number of cells in the anterior medial cluster (cluster 5; indicated as a dashed box) comprising mostly the PAM DANs and several MBONs such as MBON-α1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and ‘Materials and methods’).

Note that the α′/β′ KCs were visualized when compartments in the α′/β′ lobes were photoactivated (e.g., panel <bold>B</bold>). Different split-GAL4 lines (e.g., MBON lines for panels <bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>, and DAN lines for panels <bold>C</bold> and <bold>D</bold>) were used to drive expression of membrane-targeted red fluorescent protein (myr::tdTomato) to demarcate a specific compartment within the lobes for photoactivation. The photoactivated samples were subsequently immunostained for a marker of dopaminergic cells (tyrosine hydroxylase [not shown] or dopa-decarboxylase [DDC, see panels <bold>E</bold> and <bold>F</bold>]) to classify individual photoactivated neurons as MBONs or DANs (see ‘Materials and methods’). (<bold>A</bold>–<bold>D</bold>) Each panel shows a diagram of the experiment and a three-dimensional reconstruction of confocal images showing DANs and MBONs innervating the photoactivated compartment. Photoactivation was performed unilaterally (i.e., right) as indicated in the diagram. Native PA-GFP fluorescence is shown alone in gray scale in the middle panel and in green in the bottom panel together with myr::tdTomato signals driven by the indicated split-GAL4 in magenta; overlap is white. We identified all of the MBONs found in the split-GAL4 lines by photoactivation of each compartment (arrows and data not shown). We also identified DANs innervating each compartment (for example, myr::tdTomato negative and PA-GFP positive cells in panels <bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>). We noted additional DANs in the PAM cluster that are not labeled by the split-GAL4 lines (green cell bodies in panels <bold>C</bold> and <bold>D</bold>). We therefore counted PAM cluster DANs associated with each medial lobe compartment based on these PA-GFP experiments (see ‘Materials and methods’). The comparison of numbers of DANs in the PAM cluster identified in split-GAL4 lines and in the PA-GFP tracing experiments (i.e., photoactivated cells positive for tyrosine hydroxylase or dopa-decarboxylase) is as follows: compartment name; cell counts by split-GAL4 lines, cell counts by PA-GFP tracing (sample size): γ1; 13 (as mixtures of PAM-γ4 and PAM-γ4&gt;γ1γ2 in MB312B), 3.8 ± 1.3 (n = 5). γ2; 13 (as mixtures of PAM-γ4 and PAM-γ4&gt;γ1γ2 in MB312B), 7.8 ± 2.2 (n = 6). γ3; 9 (MB441B), 23.6 ± 6.3 (n = 5). γ4; 13 (as mixtures of PAM-γ4 and PAM-γ4&gt;γ1γ2 in MB312B), 17.3 ± 1.3 (n = 6). γ5; 8 (MB315C), 21.5 ± 1.3 (n = 6). β′1; 14 (as mixtures of PAM-β′1ap and PAM-β′1m in MB025B), 12.8 ± 1.3 (n = 4). β′2; 35 (sum of PAM-β′2a in MB109B, PAM-β′2m in MB032B, PAM-β′2p in MB056B, and PAM-β2β′2a in NP5272), 41.3 ± 6.6 (n = 4). β1; 5 (sum of PAM-β1 in MB063B and at least one PAM-β1 in MB194B), 6.6 ± 1.1 (n = 5). β2; 11 (sum of PAM-β2β′2a in NP5272 and PAM-β2 in MB209B), 18.8 ± 4.3 (n = 5). Thus, by simply summing the number of cells associated with these compartments, PA-GFP experiments identified ∼154 DANs in the anterior medial cluster (i.e., PAM cluster) as compared to 121 cells labeled by the split-GAL4 lines. Note these numbers include PAM DANs innervating multiple compartments (PAM-γ4&gt;γ1γ2 and PAM-β2β′2a) and are therefore an overestimate. The split-GAL4 collection identified 98 DANs of 14 types in the PAM cluster, whereas anti-dopamine immunostaining identified 115–135 DANs in the PAM cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu et al., 2012</xref>).

We defined MBONs as neurons that have dendrites in the MB. The antennal lobe projection neurons are also MB-extrinsic neurons by definition, but not listed. The polarity of neurons was often obvious in high-resolution confocal images of membrane labeled cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>) in which presynaptic terminals and dendrites exhibit distinctive morphologies. However, in each case we confirmed the polarity using a reporter that localizes to presynapses by virtue of the synaptic vesicle protein Synaptotagmin (<italic>pJFRC51-3xUAS-Syt::smGFP-HA</italic> in <italic>su(Hw)attP1</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). In addition to the 21 MBON cell types, one neuron (MBON-calyx, or MB-CP1) extends dendrites in the main calyx, the posterior part of the pedunculus and the ventral part of the lateral horn, and thus we classify this as an atypical MB output neuron (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></fn><fn id="tblfn2"><label>†</label><p>Four of the MBON cell types have been previously described as ChAT immunoreactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sejourne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Placais et al., 2013</xref>), and we observed consistent results.

For the MBONs with axon terminals in the MB lobes, the ‘&gt;’ symbol followed by the compartments, or the lobes, in which the axon terminals innervate is appended to the dendritic compartment (e.g., MBON-β1&gt;α for the MB output neuron with dendrites in β1 and presynaptic terminals in the α lobe). For the DAN type with dendrites in the MB lobes, the ‘&lt;’ symbol followed by the compartments in which its dendritic arbors elaborate is appended to the compartment with axon terminals (e.g., PAM-γ4&lt;γ1γ2 for the PAM neuron that terminates in γ4 and has dendrites in γ1 and γ2).

The dendrites of the KCs form the MB calyx and their parallel axons form the three MB lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Crittenden et al., 1998</xref>). The main calyx primarily receives olfactory input from the antennal lobe, whereas the smaller ventral and dorsal accessory calyces are thought to receive non-olfactory input (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Butcher et al., 2012</xref>). The KCs have been divided into three classes, γ, α′/β′, and α/β, with each class projecting axons to the eponymous lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Crittenden et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 1999</xref>). The split-GAL4 screen and the analysis of the axonal projection patterns of single cells revealed that these three classes of KCs divide into seven cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Each of the four neuroblasts contributes to each of the seven cell types and the dendrites of the KCs generated from the different neuroblasts remain segregated in the main calyx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lin et al., 2007</xref>). The parallel axon fibers of each of the seven types of KCs occupy specific layers within the γ, α′/β′, and α/β lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7">Figures 6 and 7</xref>). Two KC types divide the γ lobe into the main and dorsal (d) layers, two types divide the α′/β′ lobe into the middle (m) and anterior–posterior (ap) layers, and three KC types divide the α/β lobe into the posterior (p), core (c), and surface (s) layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7">Figures 6 and 7</xref>, also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Examination of single cell morphologies suggests that each KC may form <italic>en passant</italic> synapses with target MBONs along the length of its axon, providing each MBON with access to a large number of KC inputs. Five of the seven types of KCs elaborate their dendrites in the main calyx, whereas two types of KCs (γd and α/βp) have dendrites exclusively in the ventral and dorsal accessory calyces, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7">Figures 6A and 7A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Butcher et al., 2012</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04577.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>KCs of the γ and α′/β′ lobes.</title><p>Seven KC types identified by split-GAL4. Representative aligned images of each KC type (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) are shown; the name of the cell type and the approximate number of cells per brain hemisphere are indicated. Three examples of single cell morphologies, segmented from multicolor flip-out experiments, are presented for each cell type illustrating the branching pattern of the KC axons as they project through the lobes. In the single cell images, the cell body, primary neurite, dendrites, and axon in the pedunculus have been false-colored green and axons in the lobes are magenta. Based on co-expression in specific split-GAL4 lines and single cell morphologies, we have divided the KC population into 7 cell types. The number of cells of each type was estimated by counting labeled nuclei in split-GAL4 lines (see ‘Materials and methods’) and is shown in parentheses. (<bold>A</bold>) The γd KCs are thought to be of embryonic origin, because they are not included in a clonal analysis that visualized all post-embryonic KCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Yu et al., 2013</xref>), and they have morphological similarity to the embryonic born KCs of basal cockroaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Farris and Strausfeld, 2003</xref>). Their dendritic arbors form a protrusion extending ventral lateral to the main calyx, which we named the ventral accessory calyx (vAC). Their axons occupy the most peripheral layer in the pedunculus, the ventral and anterior layers in the γ1–γ4 compartments, and the dorsal layer in γ5. Single cell morphologies (from MB028B and MB355B) reveal that the γd axons have more branches in γ3–γ5 than in γ1 and γ2. The vAC may be devoted to non-olfactory inputs; the major types of olfactory projection neurons from the antennal lobe do not innervate this structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Butcher et al., 2012</xref>). (<bold>B</bold>) The γ main KCs have their dendrites in the main calyx and their axons occupy about 75% of the volume of the γ lobes. Single cell morphologies (from MB369B and MB355B) reveal that each γ main KC branches in all the five compartments of the γ lobe. (<bold>C</bold>) The α′/β′ap KCs have dendrites in the main calyx and project axons to the anterior and posterior layers of the α′/β′ lobes. Single cell morphologies (from MB461B and MB463B) reveal that axonal branches from single KCs project to both β′2a and β′2p, where they overlap with distinct sets of output and dopaminergic neurons (see below). (<bold>D</bold>) The α′/β′m KCs have dendrites in the main calyx. In β′2, their axons are located in the area between the bifurcating axons of α′/β′ap neurons shown in panel <bold>C</bold>.

For example, the β1 compartment can be divided into posterior (β1p), surface (β1s), and core (β1c) subdivisions containing the axons of the α/βp, α/βs, and α/βc KCs, respectively. The processes of some MBONs and DANs do not arborize in an entire compartment, but only in a subset of its elemental subdivisions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tanaka et al. (2008)</xref> first described this anatomical feature and called such regions ‘synaptic units’. An example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>, which shows a two-color labeling experiment illustrating the subdivision of the α2 compartment by the dendrites of the two MBONs, one of which arborizes in the domain of the posterior KCs (α2p) and the other in the domain of the surface and core KCs (α2sc); this arrangement is diagrammed in Panel <bold>D</bold>. The heavy vertical lines divide subdivisions into three groups representing different MBON neurotransmitter types (also indicated by the colors filling the cells of the matrix). The rows of the matrix correspond to the cell types of KCs, MBONs, and DANs. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> for synonyms for cell type names and references. The colors of the cells of the matrix indicate the putative transmitter for MBONs and cluster of origin for DANs. The color correspondence is given below the matrix. The two MBON types of unknown neurotransmitter type are indicated in light gray. The fully-colored cells of the matrix represent processes of neurons (dendrites for MBONs and synaptic terminals for DANs) that are uniformly and densely distributed in that subdivision; fainter colors represent subdivisions that are innervated only sparsely. In three cases, output neurons send axon terminals back into the MB. Such cases are represented by an ‘X’ with the size representing the density of terminals in that subdivision. One DAN cell type (PAM-γ4&lt;γ1γ2) has dendrites within (as well as outside) the lobes in the subdivisions indicated by an ‘O’ (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s1">Figure 14—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

(<bold>C</bold>) Two DANs (PAM-γ5 and PAM-β′2a) innervate the region occupied by one MBON (MBON-γ5β′2a). One DAN fills the γ5 compartment and the other only innervates the anterior elemental subdivision of the β′2 compartment (β′2a); a single MBON has inputs from the areas defined by both DANs.

Eight MBON types, like MBON-α2sc and MBON-α2p3p, arborize dendrites further confined to elemental subdivision(s) within a compartment. This suggests that these MBONs receive input exclusively from subtypes of KCs; for example, MBON-α2p3p receives input from α/βp KCs, which presumably carry non-olfactory information (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Two-color labeling and multicolor flp-out of DANs innervating neighboring compartments show clear segregation of their axon termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11E,F</xref> and data not shown).

Computational alignment to a single reference brain extends these observations to all DAN types and further demonstrates that the DAN axon termini tile the MB lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10H,J,L</xref>). Thus, different MBON types have access to largely equivalent input from the KCs but are modulated by different DANs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12 fig13">Figures 12 and 13</xref>).

The compartmental organization we observe suggests that the DANs may convey information about the US to specific MBON types. Dopamine release in specific compartments may modify local KC–MBON synapses to bias behavioral output.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Interactions between the MBON compartments</title><p>We identified three MBONs and one DAN type that appear to interconnect different compartments of the MB lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s1">Figure 14—figure supplement 1E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17A–D</xref>). Each of these three MBONs projects to the compartments of other MBONs but not back to the compartment occupied by its own dendrites. Thus information flows in one direction, and these MBON connections could create a multi-layered feedforward network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17J</xref>, see ‘Discussion’). 12 of the MBON types receive input from the KCs but not from other MBONs and therefore read out KC activity as a single output layer. Most of the MBONs having dendrites in the α′/β′ and γ lobes provide such a single-layer readout. In contrast, the glutamatergic MBON whose dendrites arborize in the γ4 compartment projects axons into the γ1 and γ2 compartments as well as to neuropils outside the MB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17A,G–I</xref>). Thus, the γ1 and γ2 MBONs have access to direct KC input as well as to the input provided by the γ4 MBON. The outputs of these two γ lobe compartments thus reflect a two-layer feedforward network. The readout of the α/β lobe is even more elaborate because the γ1 MBON projects to all of the compartments of the α/β lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17C,E,F</xref>), and the β1 MBON projects to the α1, α2, and α3 compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17B</xref>). The α1, α2, and α3 MBONs thus represent a four-layer feedforward network with access to the KC activity of the α/β and γ lobes, both directly and indirectly through MBON intermediaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17J</xref>).<fig id="fig17" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04577.037</object-id><label>Figure 17.</label><caption><title>Three types of MBONs and one type of DAN interconnect multiple compartments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>) Registered images of the three MBON cell types whose axons project to other compartments within the MB lobes.

Interestingly, 90% of the dendritic arbors of the DANs reside in four of the neuropils targeted by the MBONs: CRE, SMP, SIP, and SLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18 fig19">Figures 18E and 19</xref>). Because DANs are activated by unconditioned stimuli (US), these neuropils are likely targets of the US input (see ‘Discussion’). We observed cases where the dendrites of different DAN types in a single neuropil overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20">Figure 20B,F,G</xref>), suggesting that they may share upstream input. Furthermore, we observed overlap between MBON terminals and DAN dendrites within each neuropil, implying that some MBONs may synapse on specific DANs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20">Figure 20C,H,I</xref>). In some cases, the axon terminals of an MBON overlap with the dendrites of the DAN type innervating the same compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20">Figure 20H</xref>). This may provide feedback that regulates dopamine release and hence learning. In other cases, axon termini of MBONs from one compartment overlap with the dendrites of DAN types projecting to different compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20">Figure 20I</xref>). This provides a pathway through which the activity of one MBON could modulate the synapses between KCs and MBONs of other compartments.</p><p>The MBONs are thought to elicit learned behavioral responses, and it is therefore of interest that four MBON types project to the lateral horn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18s1">Figure 18—figure supplement 1</xref>), a brain region responsible for innate odor responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heisenberg et al., 1985</xref>). These cholinergic MBONs may exploit LH neurons capable of eliciting innate behaviors to generate learned olfactory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sejourne et al., 2011</xref>). This connection may also serve to modulate innate behavioral responses as a consequence of learning. Most of the MBON outputs, however, do not target the LH but converge onto the neuropils surrounding the MB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">Figure 18</xref>). These convergent loci also receive projections from the antennal lobe and the lateral horn and are likely to be major sites of integration and processing of information within the fly brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have identified the neurons that comprise the MB and characterized their projection patterns. These data provide a comprehensive map describing the potential connections of neurons in the MB lobes. The MB lobes are innervated by approximately 2000 KCs, 34 MBONs of 21 cell types, and about 130 modulatory DANs of 20 cell types that fall into two families, PAM and PPL1. These data, extending the level of detail and completeness of previous studies of MB anatomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mao and Davis, 2009</xref>), describe the neuronal architecture of the MB and provide insight into the logic of MB function.</p><p>Most of the cell types in the olfactory circuit—the MBONs and the DANs as well as the olfactory sensory neurons, the PNs, and the LH neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Vosshall and Stocker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Masse et al., 2009</xref>)—comprise small groups containing from one to 20 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tanaka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Yu et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, neurons within these groups share highly stereotyped projection patterns that superimpose across different individuals (this work) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Marin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Datta et al., 2008</xref>). This suggests that the input and output connections of these neurons are genetically determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ruta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kohl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fisek and Wilson, 2014</xref>), although these may be subject to plasticity. In contrast, the KCs of the MB comprise 2000 neurons that define only seven distinct cell types, receive unstructured, rather than stereotyped, inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Murthy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Caron et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gruntman and Turner, 2013</xref>), and connect to multiple MBONs through plastic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cassenaer and Laurent, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2012</xref>). These distinctive features of the KCs afford the MB the ability to contextualize novel sensory experiences, consistent with its role in mediating learned olfactory associations and behavior.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Divergent input and convergent output of the MB</title><p>Neural representations of odor exist at multiple stations of the olfactory circuit. In the representation of odors by the antennal lobe projection neurons, every odor can be thought of as a point in an approximately 50 dimensional space, each dimension corresponding to a particular glomerulus. The KC representation of odor identity has a dimension at least an order of magnitude larger, not only because there are many more KCs than antennal lobe glomeruli but also because the KCs mix projection neuron inputs nonlinearly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gruntman and Turner, 2013</xref>). The dimension of the KC representation not only allows for a far greater capacity to respond appropriately to a large number of odors, it can also enhance performance in more complex decision-related tasks. Interestingly, the lack of structure in the input to the KCs, the small number of inputs, and the sparseness of their activity all appear to be tuned to maximize this dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Perez-Orive et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huerta et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Caron et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gruntman and Turner, 2013</xref>) (Ann Kennedy, Columbia University Thesis). The fly has therefore evolved an olfactory circuit that exhibits structural and functional features predicted to optimize its ability to contextualize and respond appropriately to a rich array of olfactory experiences.</p><p>The convergence of a large number of KCs onto a small number of MBONs indicates that the dimension of the MBON representation is significantly smaller than that of the KCs. The dimension of the MBON can be no greater than their number (34) and is likely to be considerably smaller because there are only 21 different MBON cell types. Thus, rather than providing a general representation of odor identity, the activity of the individual MBONs is more likely to encode a set of ‘state variables’ that collectively bias behavioral responses to sensory stimuli. This bias is likely to reflect the combined effects of external experiences and the internal state of the fly (see accompanying paper) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Krashes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bracker et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with this view, the odor responses of individual MBONs differ between flies and these differences appear to depend on plasticity (Hige et al., unpublished).</p><p>It is tempting to associate individual MBONs with specific behaviors, but the ultimate bias in behavioral response may be represented across the full set of MBONs as a population code. Thus, the high-dimensional representation of odor identity in the KCs may be transformed into a low-dimensional representation that dictates behavioral bias. Just as an individual odor is represented by an ensemble of KCs, a given behavioral bias is likely to be represented by an ensemble of MBONs. In accord with this view, activation or inactivation of combinations of MBON cell types results in more robust effects on behavior than those observed with individual MBONs (see the accompanying paper) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Reactive DANs and predictive MBONs</title><p>We have shown that the MB lobes are divided into compartments that receive input from the KCs and specific DANs and transmit information to a small number of MBONs. Each compartment therefore receives specific dopaminergic input capable of modifying the synapses between the KCs and specific MBONs. These compartments may reflect basic computational units of the MB. The specificity of the dopamine input and its ability to direct learning may therefore transform the unstructured KC representation of odor to an ordered MBON representation encoding behavioral bias. Specific subpopulations of DANs may react to different features in the external and internal world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mao and Davis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tomchik, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Das et al., 2014</xref>). DAN activity may modify the activity of MBONs through learning to provide a representation that is predictive of the implications of an olfactory stimulus. Learning, in this view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sutton and Barto, 1998</xref>), is a transition from a reactive DAN representation to a predictive MBON representation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Feedforward and feedback processing in the MBON/DAN network</title><p>The dendritic and axonal projection patterns of the MBONs and DANs suggest feedforward and feedback circuit motifs in the MB lobes. The interactions among the different MBON types may form a multi-layer feedforward readout network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17</xref>). Processing through such a network significantly expands the computational capacity of a readout system, which can be valuable for more complex learning strategies. Consider a learning scenario in which a fly associates an odor with a strongly aversive US. A conditioned aversive response to the initial odor could occur through plastic changes affecting an ensemble of output neurons, and a low response threshold could allow these responses to generalize to related odors. Upon further experience, some odors within this category might be identified as ‘safe’ or even appetitive. Ethologically important exceptions could be learned if one of the neurons that interconnect compartments (MBON-γ4&gt;γ1γ2, MBON-γ1pedc&gt;α/β, and MBON-β1&gt;α) became responsive to a ‘safe’ odor and inhibited the original trained ensemble of aversive MBONs. Thus, the layered MBON network provides an efficient mechanism for modifying and updating previous learning.</p><p>Interestingly, the dendrites of the DANs overlap with MBON axons in four of the five MBON projection zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19 fig20">Figures 19 and 20</xref>). Thus, MBONs may modify the activity of the DANs that modulate their own activity and plasticity, resulting in a recurrent loop. This could provide positive or negative feedback to a specific compartment. Positive feedback might enhance learning to particularly salient stimuli, whereas negative feedback might suppress dopamine release once the correct response has been learned. These recurrent connections may also allow output from one compartment to modulate learning in other compartments, as some MBONs appear to target DANs that innervate non-cognate compartments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Convergence zones of the MB outputs</title><p>The axonal terminals of the MBONs are largely confined to five discrete neuropils in the brain, the SIP, SMP, CRE, SLP, and the LH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18 fig19">Figures 18 and 19</xref>). The CRE, SMP, SIP, and SLP may be sites of convergence for all of the signals relevant for classical conditioning. These convergence zones are major sites of arborization for the dendrites of the DANs and axons of the MBONs. Since DANs are activated in response to an aversive or appetitive US, these neuropils are also likely to receive input from neurons transmitting information about the nature of the US. A US, by definition, elicits an innate behavioral response consistent with its valence, suggesting that the outputs from these neuropils may convey motor commands. Interestingly, dendrites of neurons projecting to the fan-shaped body in the central complex, a brain region coordinating motor actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Strauss, 2002</xref>), arborize in these neuropils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hanesch et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Young and Armstrong, 2010</xref>). We therefore postulate an evolutionary primitive circuit in the MBON convergence zones, in which US inputs activate motor command neurons to elicit innate responses. Evolution may have built upon this simple reflex circuit, incorporating pathways from the MB that generate learned behaviors in response to a CS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig21">Figure 21</xref>).<fig id="fig21" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04577.043</object-id><label>Figure 21.</label><caption><title>Schematic of the proposed convergence zone.</title><p>MB lobes consist of three groups of compartments based on the putative transmitter of MBONs (glutamate, GABA, and acetylcholine, shown color-coded). These compartments are interconnected inside the lobes and the MBONs send converging outputs (color-coded arrows) to small subregions within five neuropils: the lateral horn (LH), CRE, SMP, SIP, and SLP. The dendrites of DANs are also confined mostly in the convergence zones within the CRE, SMP, SIP, and SLP. These neuropils, therefore, must receive information encoding the unconditioned stimuli (US), such as sugar and shock, which recruit DANs for memory formation. In the simplest model, these same sensory inputs would activate not just the DANs but also other output neurons of these neuropils that elicit appropriate unconditioned behaviors. MBON, conveying the learned valence of stimuli, might then terminate onto these same output neurons. A subset of projection neurons from the antennal lobe and LH output neurons (LHONs) also converge with MBONs in these zones (see accompanying paper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014</xref>). In this way, learned and innate responses could use a common set of downstream circuits, originating in the LH, CRE, SMP, SIP, and SLP, to drive behavior.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04577.043">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04577.043</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-04577-fig21-v1.tif"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The vertebrate brain consists of interconnected structures comprised of large collections of equivalent neurons whose number often increases with evolutionary complexity. This is in sharp contrast to most brain structures in invertebrates that consist of small number of neurons with stereotyped projections that suggest determined connections. The MB represents an exception. The MB lobes are formed by the axons of a large number of equivalent neurons, the KCs, and as with vertebrate cortical neurons, the number of KCs increases in species with more complex behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Strausfeld, 2012</xref>). Moreover, the inputs to the KCs from olfactory projection neurons are not determined or stereotyped but appear random. Thus, the MB diverges from the highly ordered neural architecture typical of the invertebrate nervous system. The MB may therefore represent an evolutionary primitive brain structure homologous in form and function to structures in the vertebrate brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schurmann, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Laurent, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tomer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Farris, 2011</xref>).

For screening, we performed immunohistochemistry as described below in Terasaki 60-well microtiter plates (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) containing 8 µl of solution.

We further characterized lines we intended to use in behavioral experiments.

KC nuclei were visualized with <italic>UAS-nlsLacZ</italic> and their membranes with <italic>pJFRC225-5xUAS-IVS-myr::smGFP-FLAG</italic>. The cell body cluster of the KCs was imaged at high-resolution (0.1 µm × 0.1 µm × 0.1 µm voxels).

Photoactivation was performed using a two-photon laser scanning microscope (Ultima, Prairie Technologies, Middleton, WI) with an ultrafast Ti:S laser (Chameleon Vision, Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) modulated by Pockels Cells (Conoptics, Danbury, CT). A water immersion objective (60X/1.0 NA, Olympus, Japan) was used for both visualization and photoactivation. Emitted photons were detected by a GaAsP detector (Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan) for green fluorescence and a PMT for red fluorescence. The laser was tuned to 925 nm for visualizing the samples (with an intensity of ∼0.7–2 mW as measured after the objective) and 710 nm for photoactivation. The Pockels Cells bias voltage was adjusted to obtain maximum signal-to-noise ratio when tuned at 710 nm, and photoactivation laser intensity at 710 nm was adjusted to be between 2 and 3 mW as measured after the objective. The photoactivation scan was performed with a pixel size of 0.24–0.39 μm and pixel dwell time of 2 μs. Each pixel was scanned four times successively using the frame-averaging function of the microscope software (PrairieView, Prairie Technologies); this was repeated with each repetition separated by 10–30 s. A target volume, such as the MB lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) or a single MB lobe compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), was divided into 8–15 z-slices with 2–5 μm steps, depending on the size of the target as well as the orientation of the sample. The number of repetitions of the photoactivation scan depended on the expression levels of PA-GFP as well as the depth of the photoactivation target. For photoactivation of the MB lobes, the photoactivation scan was repeated 30–60 times. For photoactivation of a single compartment, the photoactivation scan was repeated 90–120 times. All photoactivated samples were prepared for confocal microscopy as follows: fixed for 45 min at RT using 2% PFA/PBL (2% paraformaldehyde in 75 mM lysine, 37 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4), washed multiple times in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBST), blocked with 10% normal goat serum in PBST, incubated in primary antibodies overnight at 4°C, washed multiple times in PBST, and incubated in secondary antibodies overnight at 4°C (or for more than 3 hr at RT) before final washes with PBST. The samples were mounted using either VECTASHIELD (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) or SlowFade Gold (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and confocal imaging was performed using an LSM510 with a Plan-Neofluar 40X/1.3 objective (Zeiss, Germany). The following primary and secondary antibodies were used: rabbit-anti-DsRed (1:1000, Clontech), nc82 (1:10, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), mouse anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (1:100, EMD Millipore, Germany), rat anti-Dopa decarboxylase (1:400, a gift from Jay Hirsch), rabbit anti-TexasRed (1:500, Invitrogen, Life Technologies), Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit (1:200, Life Technologies), Alexa Fluor 633 goat anti-rat (1:200, Life Technologies), and Alexa Fluor 633 goat anti-mouse (1:200, Life Technologies).</p><p>We used flies expressing PA-GFP pan-neuronally with the exception of the KCs, generated with a <italic>Synaptobrevin-GAL4</italic> driver (<italic>NSyb-GAL4 2-1</italic>; gift of Julie Simpson) in combination with <italic>MB247-GAL80</italic>, to identify the MB extrinsic neurons by photoactivation of the MB lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Generation of the photoactivation mask for the MB lobes was guided by a red fluorescent protein expressed in KCs (<italic>MB247-DsRed</italic>, a gift of Andre Fiala). In initial experiments, a volume of ∼800 μm × ∼600 μm × ∼220 μm covering most of the central brain was imaged at a pixel size of 0.39 μm × 0.39 μm, with z-step size of 3 μm before and after photoactivation of the MB lobes in a hemisphere. This identified five clusters of MB extrinsic neuron cell bodies, each of which reproducibly contained more than two cells (n = 3 brains, data not shown, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Neurons found reproducibly, but not within these clusters, include MB-APL, MB-DPM, two MBONs located by the contralateral spur (MBON-γ4&gt;γ1γ2 and MBON-β1&gt;α; MV2), and two MBONs located in the contralateral anterior lateral region (MBON-γ3 and MBON-γ3β′1). We examined the number of neurons in each of the five clusters except the anterior PAM cluster (see below) by comparing higher resolution images of areas containing each cluster taken before and after photoactivation. Two or three clusters were examined per sample, and a volume of ∼200 μm × ∼200 μm × ∼100 μm was imaged at 0.39 μm × 0.39 μm × 1 μm resolution for each cluster. Images taken before and after photoactivation were aligned using a subpixel registration algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guizar-Sicairos et al., 2008</xref>) and correlation between registered images. Slight shifts in sample orientation precluded the use of a simple image calculation to identify photoactivated neurons. Instead, the photoactivated cell bodies were visually identified from aligned images assisted by a custom MATLAB interface. This analysis identified two neurons with their cell bodies located in regions that do not contain any of the neurons identified in the split-GAL4 lines. One was located ventral to the calyx (MBON-γ4γ5) and the other was located ventral lateral to the antennal lobe (MBON-γ1γ2) (see below, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). They represent the only two cell types identified by PA-GFP tracing that were not found in the split-GAL4 lines.</p><p>It is important to note that we were not able to reproducibly visualize neurons with elaborate arbors over multiple neuropils and only diffuse and sparse processes in the MB lobes, such as octopaminergic neurons and SIFamide peptidergic neurons (data not shown). This indicates a limitation for the PA-GFP tracing experiments, at least using the parameters described above, in detecting neurons with a large cytoplasmic volume by just photoactivating PA-GFP molecules within a small fraction of the total volume.</p><p>We performed photoactivation of individual compartments to more specifically visualize the MB extrinsic neurons innervating each compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). PA-GFP was expressed pan-neuronally using the Q-system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Potter et al., 2010</xref>) except in the α/β and γ KCs (<italic>NSyb-QF, MB247-QS, QUAS-PA-GFP</italic>) and each compartment was demarcated by a red fluorescent protein (myr::tdTomato) expressed using a split-GAL4 driver. The photoactivation mask was generated using this red marker, and in some cases where the split-GAL4 driver labels two compartments, this was further restricted using basal fluorescence of PA-GFP in the α′/β′ KCs (for example, to demarcate the β2 compartment using MBON-β2β′2a, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Upon photoactivation, the brains were fixed and immunostained for tdTomato and tyrosine hydroxylase or dopa-decarboxylase as described above. The confocal images were processed by a custom MATLAB code to identify photoactivated cells. For each image, the fluorescent intensity of the photoactivated GFP signals was measured by drawing a region-of-interest around tdTomato positive neurons (i.e., neurons whose processes had been used as target for the photoactivation), and the green channel of the image was thresholded by a pixel intensity value representing mean minus 2× standard deviations of all the pixels within the regions-of-interest. A cell was counted as photoactivated if most of the pixels within the cell, as determined visually, were over this threshold value. Finally, we determined whether these cells are dopaminergic by examining co-localization with tyrosine hydroxylase or dopa-decarboxylase. Photoactivation of each of the 15 compartments identified all the MBONs included in the split-GAL4 lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, and data not shown). We observed the same number of PA-GFP positive cell bodies for each MBON cell type as were labeled by the corresponding MBON split-GAL4 line (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>) and therefore these experiments confirmed that the split-GAL4 lines label all neurons within each MBON type. For the MBONs with dendrites in α′1 and α′3 compartments and cell bodies near KC cell bodies, it was not possible to assess whether there are more neurons of these types, because the cell bodies of photoactivated α′/β′ KCs were not distinguishable from those of the MBONs.</p><p>Photoactivation of the MB lobes resulted in labeling of over 100 cells in the anterior medial cluster including the PAM-DANs (cluster 5 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and it was not feasible to accurately count them by the methods described above. We therefore employed two independent approaches to examine the MB neurons in this cluster. We first performed photoactivation of the MB lobes with flies carrying <italic>R58E02-GAL80</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu et al., 2012</xref>) transgene that suppresses <italic>NSyb-GAL4</italic>-mediated PA-GFP expression in all PAM-DANs. We observed a dramatic reduction in the number of photoactivated cells in the anterior medial cluster ipsilateral to the photoactivated lobes as compared to flies without <italic>R58E02-GAL80</italic> (data not shown). This suggests that many of the MB extrinsic neurons in the anterior medial cluster are PAM-DANs. Moreover, we observed no photoactivated cells in the contralateral anterior medial cluster when using <italic>R58E02-GAL80</italic>, indicating that the MB extrinsic neurons in this region are all PAM-DANs. We then characterized the MB extrinsic neurons in the anterior medial cluster by photoactivation of individual compartments as described above. We identified all the MBONs in this cluster and confirmed their numbers. We observed that there are more photoactivated GFP positive neurons in this cluster than those labeled by the split-GAL4 lines expressed in PAM-DANs (see for example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). These are likely dopaminergic as confirmed by the immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and data not shown).</p><p>It is important to note that the identification of neurons using PA-GFP tracing critically depends on the signal-to-noise ratio of photoactivated fluorescence relative to basal fluorescence of PA-GFP molecules. Neurons may not be detected if they express insufficient levels of PA-GFP, as observed in some cases using NSyb-enhancer, or if the photoactivated volume contains only a small fraction of a neuron's processes. For example, we observed little expression of <italic>NSyb-QF</italic> in a subset of DANs in the PPL1 cluster as well as in PAM-α1 DANs (data not shown). Thus, we could not assess whether the split-GAL4 lines label all the PPL1-DANs and PAM-α1 DANs.</p><p>We used dye-filling to visualize one of the MB extrinsic neurons identified by PA-GFP that was not included in the split-GAL4 collection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Flies were generated in which PA-GFP was expressed pan-neuronally except in the KCs (genotype in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> legend). No red fluorescent protein was expressed. Photoactivation was targeted to the medial lobes using the absence of basal PA-GFP fluorescence in the KCs to demarcate the MB lobes. Upon photoactivation, the brain was treated with collagenase (2 mg/ml, Sigma) for 30 s, the glial sheath removed using fine forceps, and the brain was mounted again in Sylgard-coated Petri dish in saline. A fire-polished, pulled glass pipette (0.5 mm ID, 1.0 mm OD, Sutter) was backfilled with a TexasRed dye (lysine-fixable 3000 MW, Invitrogen) dissolved in saline. A two-photon microscope was used to guide the pipette to the photoactivated cell body, and the dye was injected into the cell body by iontophoresis using over one hundred 3 ms pulses of 20 Vdc applied every 0.5 s. The dye was allowed to diffuse for an additional 10 min and then the brain was fixed and immunostained with anti-TexasRed antibody and nc82. Four brains were examined and in all cases we identified one neuron with the same morphology.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Dissection and immunohistochemistry of fly brains were done as previously described with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jenett et al., 2012</xref>).

In order to minimize the amount of deformation required in the brain alignment process, we prepared a standard brain (JFRC2013) using fixation and dehydration steps identical to those used to prepare our experimental samples. After stitching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Yu and Peng, 2011</xref>) five tiles of high-resolution confocal image stacks covering the entire brain and optic lobes, debris on the brain surface were removed from the image using Fluorender. We then generated a downscaled (0.38 µm isotropic voxels) version of the JFRC2013 standard brain for use in alignment.</p><p>Because confocal imaging time was a limiting factor, we sought to develop a method that enabled alignment of a single 63× confocal image stack that covered only a portion of the brain to a standard model of the entire brain. Our alignment strategy is outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig22">Figure 22</xref>. We imaged each brain twice: the entire brain at low-resolution (20× objective lens; voxel size, 0.56 × 0.56 × 1.0 µm) and a confocal stack (or stacks) covering the region of interest at high-resolution (63× objective lens; voxel size, 0.19 × 0.19 × 0.38 µm). The two images were scaled to have isotropic voxels; because the low-resolution images were obtained with an air objective, they were optically flattened compared to the high-resolution images and, thus, required scaling in the z-axis. We then aligned the high-resolution image tile to the low-resolution whole brain image, using the reference nc82 channel, by means of image stitching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Yu and Peng, 2011</xref>), which obtains translations through searching the maximum normalized cross correlation using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Then affine registration of the low-resolution whole brain image to the JFRC2013 standard brain was used to provide a global alignment of the partial brain image to the standard brain. Finally, a non-linear transformation was applied to locally register the high-resolution tile image to the JFRC2013 standard brain using a symmetric diffeomorphic registration algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Avants et al., 2008</xref>) with a combination of mutual information and normalized cross correlation as the similarity metric in the local alignment.<fig id="fig22" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04577.044</object-id><label>Figure 22.</label><caption><title>Alignment of partial brain images to a standard brain model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A low-resolution (20×) confocal stack covering the entire brain and optic lobes (magenta diagram) and a single high-resolution (63×) confocal stack of the portion of the brain containing the MB (blue square) are collected for each specimen.

In this way we were able to obtain very high-quality alignments as judged by two criteria. First, the alignments to the standard brain obtained from multiple specimens of the same GAL4 line were very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig22">Figure 22E,F</xref>). Second, we observed the same relative arrangement of cell types when assessed using images from a single brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11F</xref>) and by alignment of images of separate brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig22">Figure 22G</xref>). We routinely obtained alignment data of a given cell type from multiple brains to allow us to assess biological and alignment variability between samples.</p><p>Neuropil masks were generated in the JFRC2013 standard brain by alignment to the binary masks of the neuropils defined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ito et al. (2014)</xref> , followed by manual editing of the neuropil borders guided by the nc82 staining of the JFRC2013 brain. To generate masks for each MB compartment, we averaged the registered intensities of MB extrinsic neurons projecting to the same compartment and samples representing the same KC cell type; we manually defined the borders between neighboring compartments after applying a Gaussian blur filter in 3D (sigma = 2).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Distribution of terminals and dendrites in the brain</title><p>After normalization of intensities between images, terminals and dendrites were segmented based on morphology and Syt::smGFP-HA distribution using FluoRender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wan et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">2012</xref>). To determine the distribution of projections in different brain regions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">Figure 18E</xref>, signals from the cell types making up each of five groups—glutamatergic, GABAergic and cholinergic MBONs and the PPL1 and PAM DANs—were averaged within a group. Then the total signal within the volume of each neuropil mask for each of the five groups was divided by total signal observed in all neuropils. To calculate signal intensities shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19">Figure 19C</xref>, the average of signals in 10 × 10 × 10 voxel volumes (3.8 µm in each dimension) were used.</p><p>To estimate degree of overlap between processes of MBONs and DANs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20">Figure 20</xref>, we used the method previously described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cachero et al. (2010)</xref>. We had multiple images for each cell type and we treated the two brain hemispheres separately, giving us on average 17.4 image pairs per cell type combination. We computed the overlap for each image pair separately; each cell in the matrices shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20">Figure 20A–C</xref> represents the mean value.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Yichun Shuai (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) for pointing out the presence of MB extrinsic neurons in the GAL4 line <italic>VT999036</italic>, Barry Dickson for providing <italic>VT999036</italic>, and Christopher Potter (Johns Hopkins) for proving the QFrco vector and sharing unpublished information.

For each driver line, the source of the enhancer fragments used to make the p65ADZp and ZpGAL4DBD constructs are given. Most enhancer fragments are from the collection of GAL4 lines described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jenett et al. (2012)</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’ for the details of the TH and TDC2 constructs. All ZpGAL4DBD constructs are inserted into <italic>attP2</italic>; the insertion sites of the p65ADZp constructs are indicated by the letter at the end of the driver name as follows: A, <italic>su(Hw)attP8</italic>; B, <italic>attP40</italic>; C, <italic>VK00027</italic>. The cell types in which expression is seen with each driver are indicated in the matrix; the level of expression in each cell type is indicated by the gray scale (see ‘Materials and methods’). Note that observed expression depends to some extent on the reporter construct used (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for an example). The data in this matrix were based on imaging with <italic>pJFRC225-5xUAS-IVS-myr::smGFP-FLAG</italic> in <italic>VK00005</italic>. The <italic>VK00005</italic> insertion site supports high-expression levels (Pfeiffer et al., 2012); many of the split-GAL4 drivers show more cell type specificity using reporters in <italic>attP18</italic> (see the accompanying paper for examples) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014</xref>). We did not observe expression outside the central nervous system in any of these lines except MB062C; see ‘Materials and methods’ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement

Together with the accompanying behavioral analysis paper, these represent major breakthrough in understanding the structure and function of the mushroom bodies, their output, and their modulatory input. These studies have certainly laid down groundwork for years to decades of future investigations, and have already provided interesting insights on the logic of information processing principles through these intriguing structures. I am extremely enthusiastic in supporting the publication of these papers. Below I provide critiques to the anatomy paper mostly to ensure that the paper is accessible to as wide an audience as it can.</p><p>1) My strongest critique is the nomenclature, in particular the classes of MBONs. As far as I understand, most of these neurons are identified for the first time, at least to the resolution described, in this paper. So, the authors are in a position to name these neurons. I understand the rationales of the authors' choice using the connectivity with specific mushroom body lobes, and it may seem rational within this paper as it builds from Kenyon cell subtypes to MBONs. But even when reading the companion paper, only a slight distance away, it is already very difficult to remember these names (e.g., MBON-gamma4&gt;gamma1gamma2, MBON-beta'2mp_bilateral, MBON-gamm1pedc&gt;alpha/beta, etc.) or the rationale behind without constantly checking this paper. Consider many papers that will follow this paper in many years to come! Often complex names can turn off young scientists wishing to enter an otherwise very exciting field. In my view, these names should be greatly simplified. I have a specific suggestion. Since the authors found that MBONs neatly fall within three neurotransmitter phenotypes, and that MBONs that belong to a particular neurotransmitter category intersect with specific MB lobes at specific locations (both very interesting new findings!), why not name the MBONs after neurotransmitters (which is one of the most used convention for classifying neurons), and then within a neurotransmitter category, give a number, perhaps based on the proximal-distal axis of the mushroom body axons (e.g., MBON-ACh1, ACh2...; GABA1, GABA2...; Glu1, Glu2...). An alternative is to use consecutive numbers, for instance, MBON-ACh1-ACh8, GABA9-GABA12, GLU13-19, etc. With a modified <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, readers can quickly check which lobe MBON-GABA3 receives input from, etc. The authors may also consider renaming the DANs but this may have more historical constraint and DANs don't neatly match MBONs. Still, some simplification also seems to be useful.</p><p>2) Definition of cell type: I would add the following &quot;We operationally define a cell type...&quot; at the beginning, and &quot;The screen was near saturation in our largeGAL4 collection.&quot;</p><p>3) I may have missed among the large amount of data, but can the authors describe MBON subtypes that are modulated by previously reported appetitive vs. aversive DANs?</p><p>4) A few critiques on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig21">Figure 21</xref> (the summary figure). It is probably better to draw a more anatomically correct mushroom body schematics (with a bifurcation), with Glu, ACh, and GABA mapped to the correct anatomical loci (right now Glu is the most proximal to the cell body, which is misleading as in reality it is the most distal at the tip of medial lobes). Also, why is the lateral horn left out of the scheme since it is the target of some MBONs and is thought to mediate innate olfactory medicated behavior?</p><p>5) Discussion of what is known about the inputs to CRE, SMP, SIP, and SLP neuropils will be helpful for readers to appreciate how the US leads to behavior through the action of the DA-MBON loops.</p><p>6) The movies are very useful to educate readers about the 3D organization of neuronal composition and their projections. However, the names stay too transient for readers to learn/remember. The authors could color code the names for each subclass of neurons and leave them on the screen after the neuronal classes are introduced, at least during segments when different classes of neurons are presented at the same time, to help readers to learn the relative positions of different classes of neurons and to remember one thing or two after viewing the movies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The study is a milestone in Drosophila neuroanatomy. Using state-of-art genetic tools, authors identified a comprehensive list of single neurons comprising the mushroom body and constructed a map of potential neural connections dividing MB lobes into 15 functional compartments. Moreover, they generated 85 split-GAL4 lines expressing exclusively in few MB related neurons that allow genetic manipulation of specific target neurons. Most major claims, except one which can be easily addressed (see below), are supported by thorough and convincing evidence. The study has great impact to the field and will transform the way of future study for understanding how genes and circuits control complex insect behaviors. I support the publication of the study and urge the authors make the generated tools immediately available to the entire field to further accelerate our understanding of brain functions.</p><p>It has been reported previously that &quot;KC dendrites are segregated into 17 complementary domains according to their neuroblast clonal origins and birth orders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lin et al., 2007</xref>). The authors stated that &quot;The five KC types that receive olfactory information are each represented by hundreds of neurons per hemisphere and have their dendrites in the main calyx. Although their axons project to spatially segregated layers in the lobes, their dendritic arbors are intermingled in the calyx and KCs within a given cell type exhibit variable dendritic projection patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7">Figures 6 and 7</xref>). Moreover, the KCs receive input from an apparently random collection of glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Murthy et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gruntman and Turner, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Caron et al., 2013</xref>)&quot;. The statement is vague and implies a random spatial distribution of KC dendrites in the main calyx. In fact, the main calyx is clearly subdivided into 4 paralleled divisions, each derived from dendrites of descendent neurons of one of the four neuroblasts (Technau and Heisenberg, 1982; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ito et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zhu et al., 2003</xref>, 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lin et al., 2007</xref>). Within each division, dendritic arbors of each KC type segregate at specific and separate spatial domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lin et al., 2007</xref>). Authors agree with that the pioneer alpha/beta (the posterior alpha/beta) KCs have dendrites exclusively in the dorsal accessory calyx and show that the newly identified embryonic gamma KCs have dendrites exclusively in the ventral accessory calyx. Consistently, in the main calyx, dendritic arbors of 5 other KC types also appear to distribute differently from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7">Figures 6 and 7</xref>). It remains unclear how the segregated KC dendrites account for the random PN-KC connections. Authors should either clarify their statement and cite the previous report indicating segregated dendrite distribution of each KC type in the main calyx or provide additional evidences of detailed anatomical analysis if otherwise.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04577.047</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>Aso et al. reported stunning advances in the anatomical organization of the mushroom bodies, a key center for learning and memory in insects.

Still, some simplification also seems to be useful</italic>.</p><p>We recognize that anatomical nomenclature always represents a compromise between “simple” names and names that convey greater meaning. We chose our naming system, after much thought and consultation with many individuals working in the field, for two main reasons: (1) We felt our anatomical data provided a very solid foundation, making it unlikely that the MBON names would have be revised due to future studies. In contrast, we were not able to assign neurotransmitter types to all MBONs and even for those that we could assign, the possibility of additional co-transmitters remains open. (2) We preferred names that provided more anatomical information, allowing the name itself to provide the reader with an immediate connection to the existing literature that often refers to particular anatomical domains of the MB lobes.</p><p>As a practical matter, changing names now would be problematic, as our lines are currently in use in about a dozen other laboratories (most of whom were collaborators in the work described in these two papers), that have been doing behavioral and physiological studies extending the current work. We are aware of five papers currently under review from those laboratories that use our current nomenclature.</p><p>However, we do appreciate the point raised by the reviewer and so we have included a short name as a column in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. We also introduce this in the second paper where <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> serves to diagram the morphology of these cells. For the reason mentioned above, we are not including transmitter information, but just a simple numbering scheme; MBON-01, MBON-02, etc. We also provide a short name for each DAN cell type of the format PAM-01 to PAM-14 and PPL1-01 to PPL1-06. We also show these short names in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14 fig15 fig16">Figures 14-16</xref>, where we also show previously used names from the literature; in this way the reader can see all alternative names for a cell type together with a visualization of the cell types morphology.</p><p>In these two papers (also for the reasons mentioned above) we otherwise continue to use the “full names”.</p><p><italic>2) Definition of cell type: I would add the following &quot;We operationally define a cell type...&quot; at the beginning, and &quot;The screen was near saturation in our largeGAL4 collection</italic>.<italic>&quot;</italic></p><p>We modified the text as suggested.</p><p><italic>3) I may have missed among the large amount of data, but can the authors describe MBON subtypes that are modulated by previously reported appetitive vs</italic>. <italic>aversive DANs?</italic></p><p>Direct experimental evidence for modulation (that is, electrophysiological measurement of MBON output before and after dopamine signaling by specific DANs) has not yet been reported. What we now have is anatomical correlations between the MB compartments containing the dendrites of specific MBON and the synaptic terminals of subsets of DANs that have been implicated in behavioral assays of aversive or appetitive memory. This large body of work is summarized diagrammatically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (and the text) of the accompanying paper we now refer the reader to that summary.
