Plant NLRs typically detect strain-specific pathogen effectors and trigger immune responses often linked to localized host cell death.

These effectors are sequence-unrelated, except for allelic <italic>AVR<sub>a10</sub></italic> and <italic>AVR<sub>a22</sub></italic> that are co-maintained in pathogen populations in the form of a balanced polymorphism. Contrary to numerous examples of indirect recognition of bacterial effectors by plant NLRs, co-expression experiments with matching <italic>Mla-AVR<sub>a</sub></italic> pairs indicate direct detection of the sequence-unrelated fungal effectors by MLA receptors.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44471.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Powdery mildews are fungal diseases that affect many plants, including important crops such as barley. The fungi behind these diseases deliver molecules known as effectors inside plant cells, which manipulate the plants' biology and help the fungus to invade the plants' tissues. In response, some plants have evolved immune receptors encoded by so-called <italic>R</italic> genes (short for resistance genes) that detect the effectors inside the plant cell and trigger an immune response. The response often kills the plant cell and those nearby to limit the spread of the fungus. Effectors that are recognized by host immune receptors are termed avirulence effectors (or AVRs for short).</p><p>Scientists tend to assume that most effectors do not bind directly to their immune receptors. Instead, it is thought that the immune receptors are more likely to be detecting a change in some other plant protein that is caused by the effectors' activities.</p><p>In barley populations, one <italic>R</italic> gene that protects against powdery mildew encodes an immune receptor known as MLA. Different plants can carry subtly different versions of this <italic>R</italic> gene meaning that they make similar but different variants of the same receptor. Each MLA variant confers immunity only to strains of powdery mildew that carry the matching AVR effector. A few AVR effectors from powdery mildews have been identified, but most AVR effectors from powdery mildews remain unknown.</p><p>Saur et al. looked for new AVR effectors from powdery mildew fungi collected in the field, and found four that were recognized by barley plants carrying MLA variants. Two of these new effectors were fairly similar to each other, but they were all unlike those that had been identified previously.</p><p>When Saur et al. engineered barley cells to make these new AVRs alongside their matching MLA receptors, the cells died – which is consistent with the expected immune response. Similar experiments with distantly related tobacco plants agave the same results. This suggested that the immune receptors did not need any other barley proteins to recognize the effectors, indicating that the interaction between the two may be direct. Indeed, two other techniques that test for direct protein-protein interactions, – one that involved extracts from tobacco leaves, and another that involved yeast, – gave results consistent with a direct interaction between the MLA receptor variants and the fungal effectors.</p><p>Plant disease is still a major cause of loss of yield in crops. Transferring an <italic>R</italic> gene from one plant species to another is a potentially powerful approach to help crops resist disease. The discovery that multiple variants of the same resistance gene can bind to dissimilar effectors from a disease-causing fungus in distantly related plant species underlines the potential of this approach.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>plant innate immunity</kwd><kwd>NLR receptor</kwd><kwd>avirulence effector</kwd><kwd>powdery mildew</kwd><kwd>pathogen population</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB670</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kracher</surname><given-names>Barbara</given-names></name><name><surname>Maekawa</surname><given-names>Takaki</given-names></name><name><surname>Schulze-Lefert</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open-access funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bauer</surname><given-names>Saskia</given-names></name><name><surname>Schulze-Lefert</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 368-2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saur</surname><given-names>Isabel ML</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cluster of Excellence in Plant Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CEPLAS 1028</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schulze-Lefert</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPP1819</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franzeskakis</surname><given-names>Lamprinos</given-names></name><name><surname>Panstruga</surname><given-names>Ralph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002974</institution-id><institution>Daimler und Benz Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saur</surname><given-names>Isabel ML</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Allelic MLA immune receptors have an exceptional propensity to directly detect sequence-unrelated pathogen effectors and this feature might have facilitated functional diversification of the receptor in the host population.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The NLR family of immune receptors is structurally conserved between animals and plants, perceives non-self and modified-self molecules inside host cells, and mounts potent innate immune responses to terminate microbial pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maekawa et al., 2011a</xref>). Animal NLRs are normally activated by conserved microbe- or damage-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs/DAMPs), whereas plant NLRs typically detect strain-specific pathogen effectors, designated avirulence effector proteins (AVRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maekawa et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jones et al., 2016</xref>). Plant NLRs recognize either the effector structure or sense effector-mediated modifications of host proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jones et al., 2016</xref>). Single plant NLRs or NLR pairs can also detect the manipulation of effector target mimics, called decoys, and a variation of the latter mechanism involves the direct integration of decoy domains mimicking host targets within NLRs, termed integrated decoy domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jones et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cesari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kroj et al., 2016</xref>). The selective forces shaping the evolution of the comparatively small complement of NLRs in vertebrates are incompletely understood (~20 family members, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lange et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Meunier and Broz, 2017</xref>)), but in plant species co-evolution with host-adapted pathogens has strongly influenced the expansion and diversification of NLR repertoires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jacob et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Meyers et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Plant disease resistance (<italic>R</italic>) genes to host-adapted pathogens often encode NLRs, are frequently members of large gene families organized in complex clusters of paralogous genes, and can rapidly evolve through a range of natural gene diversification mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jacob et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Meyers et al., 2005</xref>). There are several examples of allelic series of NLR-type <italic>R</italic> genes known in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ellis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Srichumpa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Seeholzer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kanzaki et al., 2012</xref>). In these cases, multiple distinct recognition specificities evolved in the host population at a single <italic>R</italic> gene with each allele detecting a corresponding strain-specific AVR in the pathogen population. Such multi-allelic NLR-type <italic>R</italic> genes are particularly instructive for studying the underlying co-evolutionary process between host and pathogen.</p><p>Ascomycete powdery mildews are widespread pathogens of thousands of angiosperm plant species in temperate climates, including economically relevant crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glawe, 2008</xref>). They are obligate biotrophic pathogens, meaning that their growth and reproduction is entirely dependent on living host cells. The haploid barley powdery mildew pathogen <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> forma specialis <italic>hordei</italic> (<italic>Bgh</italic>) multiplies mainly clonally and is a member of the species <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> that is specialized for its host plant barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>). There are various specialized forms (<italic>formae speciales</italic> or fs. spp.) of <italic>B. graminis</italic>, each of which is capable of infecting the respective host plant species belonging to the grass (Poaceae) family, including cereals such as barley and wheat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wyand and Brown, 2003</xref>). Within each <italic>forma specialis</italic>, numerous isolates (strains) can be distinguished in the pathogen population, based on their respective virulence or avirulence infection phenotypes vis-à-vis particular genotypes of the host population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). The genomes of powdery mildews are characterized by the loss of several, otherwise widely conserved Ascomycete genes with functions related to carbohydrate degradation and primary and secondary metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Spanu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wicker et al., 2013</xref>), and this is believed to explain their strict dependence on living plant cells. Similar to other filamentous phytopathogens, grass-infecting powdery mildew genomes harbor hundreds of candidate secreted effector protein (CSEP)-coding genes, which are assumed to contribute to fungal pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wicker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pedersen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guttman et al., 2014</xref>). Pathogen effectors often work by subverting innate immune responses, thereby facilitating host colonization and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rovenich et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Domesticated barley and wheat contain numerous powdery mildew <italic>R</italic> gene loci that were often introgressed from their corresponding wild relatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jørgensen and Wolfe, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lutz et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maekawa et al., 2019</xref>). In both barley and its close relative wheat, one of these powdery mildew <italic>R</italic> loci, designated <italic>mildew locus a</italic> (<italic>Mla)</italic> and <italic>powdery mildew 3</italic> (<italic>Pm3</italic>), respectively, has been subject to exceptional functional diversification, resulting in large numbers of <italic>Mla</italic> or <italic>Pm3</italic> recognition specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Seeholzer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lutz et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhullar et al., 2010</xref>). Although wheat <italic>Pm3</italic> and barley <italic>Mla</italic> loci each span a cluster of <italic>NLR</italic> genes, known <italic>Pm3</italic> and <italic>Mla</italic> recognition specificities to the <italic>B. graminis</italic> pathogen appear to have arisen from allelic diversification of a single <italic>NLR</italic> gene in the corresponding <italic>NLR</italic> clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Seeholzer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maekawa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shen, 2003</xref>). Isolate-specific disease resistance to <italic>Bgh</italic> mediated by MLA receptors is invariably linked to the activation of localized host cell death, and this immune response likely terminates growth of the biotrophic pathogen by shutting off its nutrient supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyd et al., 1995</xref>). Of note, the <italic>Mla</italic> orthologs <italic>Sr33</italic> in wheat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Periyannan et al., 2013</xref>) and <italic>Sr50</italic> in rye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mago et al., 2015</xref>) confer disease resistance to the stem rust pathogen <italic>Puccinia graminis</italic> f. sp. <italic>tritici</italic> (<italic>Pgt</italic>) isolate Ug99, a major threat to global wheat production. <italic>Pgt</italic> and <italic>Bgh</italic> belong to the Basidiomycota and Ascomycota phyla, respectively, indicating that MLA receptors can detect the presence of independently evolved avirulence effectors. Barley <italic>Mla</italic> and wheat <italic>Pm3</italic> both encode intracellular NLRs with an N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain but lack significant sequence relatedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>), whereas 23 allelic barley MLA resistance proteins exhibit &gt;91% amino acid (aa) sequence identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Seeholzer et al., 2010</xref>), and 17 deduced allelic wheat Pm3 receptors share &gt;97% aa sequence identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhullar et al., 2010</xref>). Diversifying selection among resistance alleles of <italic>Mla</italic> and <italic>Pm3</italic> is largely confined to regions encoding the C-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRR) of the receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Seeholzer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maekawa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhullar et al., 2010</xref>). The polymorphic MLA LRR is critical for effector detection as shown by a series of reciprocal domain swaps between MLA1 and MLA6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shen, 2003</xref>). Barley <italic>Mla1</italic> confers race-specific disease resistance to a <italic>Bgh</italic> isolate carrying the cognate avirulence gene <italic>AVR<sub>a1</sub></italic> in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, suggesting ∼ 150 million years of evolutionary conservation of the underlying immune mechanism and potentially pointing to a direct recognition mechanism of AVR<sub>A</sub> effectors that is highly conserved between barley and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maekawa et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Recently, the <italic>Bgt</italic> avirulence gene <italic>AvrPm3<sup>a2/f2</sup></italic>, recognized by the wheat <italic>Pm3a</italic> and <italic>Pm3f</italic> alleles, was identified by a map-based cloning approach and found to encode a typical CSEP that belongs to an effector family of 24 members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bourras et al., 2015</xref>). The clonal nature of the haploid <italic>Bgh</italic> pathogen facilitated the identification of isolate-specific sequence variation in the transcriptomes of a global collection of 17 <italic>Bgh</italic> strains. These were associated with <italic>Bgh</italic> pathotypes on <italic>Mla1</italic>- and <italic>Mla13</italic>-containing near-isogenic barley lines to identify sequence-unrelated <italic>AVR<sub>a1</sub></italic><sub>-</sub> and <italic>AVR<sub>a13</sub></italic>-encoding CSEPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether these powdery mildew avirulence effectors bind directly to the corresponding NLR receptors or whether the receptors sense the presence of the pathogen indirectly through effector-mediated modifications of host proteins.</p><p>To reveal the molecular mechanism underlying the co-evolutionary diversification of barley MLA NLRs with host-adapted <italic>Bgh</italic>, we first described the natural <italic>AVR<sub>a</sub></italic> gene diversity in a local <italic>Bgh</italic> population. This allowed us to isolate four additional AVR<sub>A</sub> effectors by applying a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) with high-confidence single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) underlying disease resistance/susceptibility phenotypes in barley. We then employed co-transfection experiments to show that only matching <italic>Mla-AVR<sub>a</sub></italic> pairs activate cell death in barley leaf protoplasts. <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>-mediated co-delivery of <italic>Mla-AVR<sub>a</sub></italic> pairs in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> leaves demonstrated that their co-expression is sufficient to trigger cell death in this heterologous plant species. The <italic>AVR<sub>a</sub></italic> avirulence effectors encode CSEPs that are sequence-unrelated except for allelic AVR<sub>A10</sub> and AVR<sub>A22</sub>. These findings are inconsistent with a co-evolutionary arms race model describing iterative cycles of MLA receptor and AVR<sub>A</sub> effector adaptations. Moreover, we failed to detect cell death activity for the previously reported <italic>EKA_AVR<sub>a10</sub></italic>, a member of the EKA gene family that is derived from part of a class-1 LINE retrotransposon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ridout, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amselem et al., 2015</xref>). Using co-expression experiments with matching <italic>Mla-AVR<sub>a</sub></italic> pairs, including previously reported <italic>AVR<sub>a13</sub></italic>, we present evidence for direct receptor-avirulence effector interactions. Our findings imply that MLA receptors have an exceptional propensity to directly detect sequence-unrelated and likely structurally diverse pathogen effectors and that this feature might have facilitated the functional diversification of the receptor in the host population.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Natural variation of <italic>AVR<sub>a</sub></italic> genes within a local <italic>Bgh</italic> population</title><p>In 2016 we collected 13 <italic>Bgh</italic> field isolates from leaves of barley plants within the same locality near Cologne, Germany (GPS 5˚57′N, 6˚51′E 5; isolates designated K2, K3, K4, S11, S15, S16, S19, S20, S21, S22, S23, S25 and S26).

The retention of MLA1-dependent recognition of AVR<sub>A1</sub> in three divergent plant families (Triticeae, Brassicaceae, Solanaceae) suggests direct interactions of matching MLA and AVR<sub>A</sub> pairs or an indirect recognition mechanism involving highly evolutionarily conserved AVR<sub>A</sub> host target(s).

This marginal increase in LUC activity may partly reflect differences in protein stability, as the AVR<sub>A22</sub>-nLUC protein is barely detectable when compared to AVR<sub>A10</sub>-nLUC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) and because both, MLA10-cLUC and MLA22-cLUC are seemingly less stable when compared to MLA7-cLUC and MLA13-cLUC.</p><p>Although the LUC complementation assay is suggestive of direct receptor – avirulence effector associations, we cannot fully exclude the involvement of other plant proteins in this association.

We have shown here that among 13 <italic>Bgh</italic> isolates from a local population in Germany ten virulence combinations can be distinguished in interactions with a panel of <italic>Mla</italic> NILs, suggesting potential adaptation of the pathogen population to multiple <italic>Mla</italic> resistance specificities. Our findings are congruent with a recent study describing a high complexity of Central European <italic>Bgh</italic> virulence pathotypes on a panel of 50 differential barley varieties carrying <italic>Mla</italic> or other powdery mildew <italic>R</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dreiseitl, 2014</xref>). The same study also provided evidence for a complete separation of the Central European and Australian <italic>Bgh</italic> populations with non-overlapping pathotypes and estimated an almost three-fold higher virulence complexity for the European population. This is believed to be due to the cultivation of barley varieties carrying distinct powdery mildew <italic>R</italic> gene combinations on the two continents, which leads to differential intensities of directed selection on <italic>Bgh</italic> populations. Analysis of our isolate collection comprising, among others, 13 newly characterized <italic>Bgh</italic> strains from a local population in Germany and three representative Australian isolates, is supportive of a significantly greater virulence complexity of the Central European over the Australian isolates even when considering virulence patterns only on <italic>Mla</italic> NILs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The complexity of avirulence and virulence alleles in the Central European population suggests that the fungus adapts by balancing selection of <italic>AVR<sub>a</sub></italic> genes among strains rather than selective sweeps to maintain pathogenicity.</p><p>Specific activation of cell death upon transient gene expression of matching <italic>AVR<sub>a</sub></italic> and <italic>Mla</italic> gene pairs in barley protoplasts and heterologous <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> provided evidence for the function of candidate <italic>AVR<sub>a7</sub></italic>, <italic>AVR<sub>a9</sub></italic>, <italic>AVR<sub>a10</sub>,</italic> and <italic>AVR<sub>a22 </sub></italic>as avirulence effectors, all of which encode <italic>Bgh</italic> CSEPs with a predicted signal peptide. This is different from the previously reported EKA_AVR<sub>A10</sub>, which lacks a canonical signal peptide, belongs to the large <italic>EKA</italic> gene family that is derived from part of a class-1 LINE retrotransposon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ridout, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amselem et al., 2015</xref>), and was used as an elicitor of induced MLA10 nuclear interaction with a WRKY transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shen et al., 2007</xref>). However, we were unable to detect MLA10-mediated cell death activity for EKA_AVR<sub>A10</sub>. Our findings demonstrate that virulent <italic>Bgh</italic> isolates escape recognition of corresponding MLA receptors predominantly by non-synonymous SNPs but also loss of expression of the corresponding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lu et al., 2016</xref>).

By contrast, MLA7, MLA9, MLA10 and MLA13 receptors are &gt;96% identical in aa sequence to each other, whereas MLA1 and MLA22 are more diverged and share 91% identical polypeptide sequences with this receptor group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Seeholzer et al., 2010</xref>). This raises questions regarding the evolutionary history of MLA10- AVR<sub>A10</sub> and MLA22-AVR<sub>A22</sub> receptor-effector pairs<italic>. AVR<sub>a10</sub></italic> and <italic>AVR<sub>a22</sub></italic> are notable for several reasons: (i) these allelic effectors define two dominant haplotypes of <italic>CSEP0141</italic> in <italic>Bgh</italic>, (ii) <italic>CSEP0141</italic> belongs to a core of 190 effectors that are conserved among different <italic>B. graminis</italic> f. sp. and, therefore, likely contributes to pathogen fitness, (iii) <italic>CSEP0141</italic> represents the core effector with the highest frequency of non-synonymous SNPs among the tested global collection of <italic>Bgh</italic> isolates, and (iv) a single dominant haplotype of its <italic>Bgt</italic> ortholog, designated <italic>BgtE-5921</italic>, was found in the wheat powdery mildew population. Collectively, this suggests a model in which the two dominant <italic>CSEP0141</italic> haplotypes, <italic>AVR<sub>a10</sub></italic> and <italic>AVR<sub>a22</sub></italic>, evolved in <italic>Bgh</italic> by the action of two opposing selective forces: functional conservation that maintains pathogen fitness through retention of effector virulence activity and sequence diversification to escape recognition by MLA10 and MLA22 receptors, respectively. <italic>AVR<sub>a10</sub></italic> and <italic>AVR<sub>a22</sub></italic> likely represent a balanced polymorphism in the extant pathogen population because <italic>Bgh</italic> isolates containing one or the other haplotype do not form discrete subgroups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, the likely source of many, if not all, <italic>Mla</italic> recognition specificities in domesticated barley is wild barley, <italic>H. spontaneum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jørgensen and Wolfe, 1994</xref>). Thus, it is possible that <italic>Mla10</italic>, <italic>Mla22</italic> and their matching avirulence effector genes have not diversified during a co-evolutionary arms race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ravensdale et al., 2011</xref>) but have rather evolved independently in separate host and pathogen populations. In such a scenario, the balanced AVR<sub>A10</sub> and AVR<sub>A22</sub> polymorphism in the extant pathogen population is the consequence of concurrent cultivation of domesticated barley varieties with these <italic>Mla</italic> resistance specificities. Besides an apparently balanced <italic>AVR<sub>a10</sub></italic> and <italic>AVR<sub>a22</sub></italic> polymorphism at <italic>CSEP0141</italic> in the <italic>Bgh</italic> field population one would expect sporadic strains that are virulent on both <italic>Mla10</italic>- and <italic>Mla22</italic>-harboring host varieties, which is the case for <italic>Bgh</italic> isolate DH14 carrying a SNP that introduces a single aa substitution in <italic>AVR<sub>a10</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In such strains, a fitness penalty for the pathogen might be mitigated by residual virulence activity of the CSEP0141 variant.</p><p>Our split-LUC and yeast two-hybrid experiments provided evidence for direct and specific interactions between multiple matching MLA/AVR<sub>A</sub> pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). More than 50 years after the original discovery of multi-allelic race-specific disease resistance at <italic>Mla</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Moseman and Schaller, 1960</xref>), these findings now imply that the co-evolutionary functional diversification of these immune receptors is at least in part mechanistically underpinned, and was perhaps driven by direct interactions with sequence-unrelated <italic>Bgh</italic> avirulence effectors. Direct receptor-avirulence effector interactions have been described for flax L and rice Pik multi-allelic disease resistance genes, which encode NLR-type receptors, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kanzaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dodds et al., 2006</xref>). In flax, a subset of allelic L receptors (L5, L6, and L7) interact with a specific subset of highly sequence-related flax rust AvrL567 proteins, and in rice, allelic Pik receptors interact with specific variants of highly sequence-related AVR-Pik proteins. Rice Pik immune receptors contain an integrated heavy metal-associated RATX1/HMA domain, which binds directly to AVR-Pik and <italic>Pik</italic> functional diversification is driven by polymorphisms in this integrated domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kanzaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maqbool et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De la Concepcion et al., 2018</xref>). Barley MLA and flax L proteins lack detectable integrated domains, and diversifying selection in allelic MLA receptors is largely confined to predicted solvent-exposed residues of leucine-rich repeats 7 to 15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Seeholzer et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, to the best of our knowledge, a co-evolutionary functional diversification of multi-allelic NLR-type receptors in plants with directly recognized sequence-unrelated avirulence effectors, as described here for matching MLA, is without precedence. Effectors AVR1-CO39 and AVR-Pia of the ascomycete <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> are sequence-unrelated but have very similar 6 β-sandwich structures that are stabilized in both cases by a disulfide bridge and are both recognized by the rice NLR pair RGA4-RGA5 through the integrated RATX1/HMA domain located at the C-terminus of RGA5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Guillen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cesari et al., 2013</xref>). Structural similarity searches then showed that AVR1-CO39 and AVR-Pia are founders of a family of sequence-unrelated but structurally conserved fungal effectors in a broad range of ascomycete phytopathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Guillen et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with structural modelling (IntFOLD Version 3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McGuffin et al., 2015</xref>)), the recently resolved NMR-based and crystal structure of <italic>Bgh</italic> CSEP0064 revealed a ribonuclease-like fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pennington et al., 2019</xref>) with the absence of canonical catalytic residues in the substrate-binding pocket, and the gene products of ~120 additional <italic>Bgh</italic> CSEPs very likely adopt a similar structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pennington et al., 2019</xref>). Structural similarity searches (IntFOLD Version 3.0) also suggested a ribonuclease-like fold for AVR<sub>A7</sub> and AVR<sub>A13</sub> (high and certain confidence at p=3.739E-3, and 6.174E-4, respectively), whereas no significant structural similarities were detected between CSEP0064 and AVR<sub>A1</sub>, AVR<sub>A9</sub>, AVR<sub>A10</sub>, or AVR<sub>A22</sub> (low and medium confidence at p&gt;0.01). Instead, we find that AVR<sub>A9</sub> may adopt a structural fold that is similar to an antimicrobial peptide called microplusin (p=6.014E-3). In addition, no obvious structural similarities were predicted between AVR<sub>A1</sub>, AVR<sub>A9</sub>, and AVR<sub>A10</sub>/AVR<sub>A22</sub>, suggesting that allelic MLA receptors are capable of detecting the presence of structurally unrelated Bgh effectors. This assumption is consistent with the recent finding that the wheat <italic>Mla</italic> ortholog Sr50 directly binds to the Basidiomycete stem rust (<italic>Pgt</italic>) avirulence effector AvrSr50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). This Basidiomycete effector most likely evolved independently from the Ascomycete <italic>Bgh</italic> effectors and lacks significant sequence and predicted structural similarity with the known <italic>AVR<sub>a </sub></italic>effectors. We speculate that MLA receptors might have an exceptional propensity to directly detect unrelated pathogen effectors and that this feature might have facilitated the functional diversification of the receptor in the host population.</p><p>In a whole leaf context, race-specific disease resistance specified by MLA receptors to <italic>Bgh</italic> is invariably linked to the activation of localized host cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyd et al., 1995</xref>). NLR-mediated cell death likely contributes to the termination of biotrophic fungal pathogenesis, including that of powdery mildews, because this class of pathogens feeds on living plant cells. A striking feature of the functional diversification at <italic>Mla</italic> is the enormous variation in microscopic and macroscopic resistance-associated <italic>Bgh</italic> infection phenotypes as shown with barley NILs carrying different <italic>Mla</italic> resistance specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyd et al., 1995</xref>). For instance, the onset of detectable host cell death can vary dramatically and can be both rapid and limited to the first attacked leaf epidermal cell, terminating early fungal pathogenesis, or can occur at later stages of fungal pathogenesis and involve numerous leaf mesophyll cells that subtend <italic>Bgh</italic>-infected epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyd et al., 1995</xref>). Here we have employed co-transfection experiments of barley leaf protoplasts with <italic>Mla-AVR<sub>a</sub></italic> pairs and protoplast cell death as a proxy for receptor activation, excluding the possibility that additional <italic>Bgh</italic>-derived molecules associated with Pattern-triggered immunity influence the timing of immune receptor-mediated cell death in this system. Although based on overexpression data, the significant variation in cell death phenotypes reported here could partly reflect variable <italic>Bgh</italic> infection phenotypes on different MLA NILs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyd et al., 1995</xref>). In turn, these differences of infection phenotypes are possibly due to variations in the steady-state levels of the MLA receptors during <italic>Bgh</italic> infection, timing of <italic>Bgh</italic>-mediated AVR<sub>A</sub> secretion and/or AVR<sub>A</sub> steady-state levels <italic>in planta</italic>, or MLA-AVR<sub>A</sub> pair-dependent receptor binding affinities. Whilst etablishing the relevance of the the latter requires future biochemical characterization of MLA-AVR<sub>A</sub> complexes, our work revealed a very strong binding of AVR<sub>A13</sub>-V2 to MLA13 both in the split-LUC and yeast two-hybrid experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), thereby uncoupling AVR<sub>A</sub> binding to the receptor from receptor activation, that is immune receptor-mediated cell death activation. Future biochemical and genetic experiments will clarify whether the naturally occurring AVR<sub>A13</sub>-V2 effector variant acts as a dominant negative ligand when co-expressed with the AVR<sub>A13</sub> avirulence effector.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain (<italic>Blumeria</italic> <break/> <italic>graminis f. sp. hordei</italic>)</td><td>CC107, CC148, <break/>CC1, CC52, CC66, <break/>CC88, NCI, 63.5, A6, B103, <break/>Aby, Art, Will, OU14, <break/>RACE1, K1</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lu et al.

To allow for adequate alignment efficiency also for those isolates with higher sequence divergence from the reference genome, we adjusted the alignment settings as follows: --read-mismatches 10 --read-gap-length 10 --read-edit-dist 20 --read-realign-edit-dist 0 --mate-inner-dist 260 --mate-std-dev 260 --min-anchor 5 --splice-mismatches 2 --min-intron-length 30 --max-intron-length 10000 --max-insertion-length 20 --max-deletion-length 20 --num-threads 10 --max-multihits 10 --coverage-search --library-type fr-firststrand --segment-mismatches 3 --min-segment-intron 30 --max-segment-intron 10000 --min-coverage-intron 30 --max-coverage-intron 10000 --b2-very-sensitive. Using the SAMtools suite (Version 0.1.18) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2009</xref>), the generated alignment files were subsequently filtered to retain only properly paired reads with mapping quality &gt;0 for the downstream analyses.</p><p>To assess the expression levels of individual genes, we obtained the fragment counts per gene for each isolate and time point from the mapped RNA-seq reads after filtering using the Subread function ‘featureCounts’ (version 1.5.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liao et al., 2014</xref>) with options -t CDS -s 2 M –p. Subsequently, the raw counts were summarized over both time-points for each isolate and normalized to FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads) values for better comparability of expression levels.</p><p>In parallel, sequence variants were identified from the mapped RNA-seq reads using two different tools. In both cases, the variant calling was performed on a combined alignment dataset that was obtained by merging the mapped RNA-seq reads from all isolates using the merge function of the SAMtools suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2009</xref>). In one approach, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified using the mpileup function in the SAMtools suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2009</xref>) with options -A, -u, -D, -d 30000 –L 7000. The resulting mpileup variants were filtered using SnpSift (Version 3.4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cingolani et al., 2012a</xref>) with filter settings “(AF1 &gt;= 0.01852) and ((DP &gt;= 30) | ((DP &gt;= 10) and (GEN[*].DP&gt;=5))) and (QUAL &gt;= 50) and (GEN[*].GQ&gt;=10) and ((na PV4) | ((PV4[0]&gt;1e-10) and (PV4[3]&gt;1e-5)))” to extract high-quality variants with sufficiently high allele frequency (≥0.01852; that is alternate allele present in at least ~50% of the reads of one isolate), sufficient read coverage (≥30 reads in total, or ≥10 reads in total and at least one isolate with ≥5 reads), a SNP calling quality score ≥50, at least one isolate with a genotype quality score ≥10, and absence of extreme placement bias. In the other approach, variants were called using freebayes (version 9.9.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garrison and Marth, 2012</xref>) with options --ploidy 1 --use-duplicate-reads --min-mapping-quality 0 --min-base-quality 20 --min-coverage 30 --genotype-qualities. To allow correct variant calling from our RNA-seq data with freebayes, the mapped reads in this case were preprocessed using the function SplitNCigarReads in the GenomeAnalysis Toolkit (version 3.4.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McKenna et al., 2010</xref>) with options -U ALLOW_N_CIGAR_READS -fixNDN -maxOverhang 10 to split any reads with splice junctions. An additional, independent freebayes variant calling was also performed with --ploidy 2, to allow processing of cases where an isolate contains additional gene copies that differ from each other at some residue(s). The resulting freebayes variant sets were filtered using SnpSift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cingolani et al., 2012a</xref>) with filter settings “(AF[*]&gt;=0.01852) and ((exists GEN[*].GQ) and (GEN[*].GQ[*]&gt;=10)) and ((exists GEN[*].AO) and (GEN[*].AO[*]&gt;=3)) and ((DP &gt;= 30) | ((DP &gt;= 10) and (exists GEN[*].DP) and (GEN[*].DP&gt;=5))) and (SAR[*]&gt;0) and (SAF[*]&gt;0) and (RPR[*]&gt;1) and (RPL[*]&gt;1)’ to extract high-quality variants fulfilling the same criteria as described above for mpileup. The subsequent variant annotation and effect prediction for all datasets was performed using snpEff (Version 3.4; default settings) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cingolani et al., 2012b</xref>) based on the new DH14 genome and gene models.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Population structure and genetic association analysis of <italic>Bgh</italic> isolates</title><p>To obtain a suitable set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for population structure analysis, we further filtered the set of high-quality variants obtained with mpileup from the combined alignment data as described above. We extracted only silent (synonymous) SNPs in coding regions for which exactly two different alleles were found (diallelic SNPs), and complete genotype information was available for all isolates (i.e., no missing data). The resulting set of 6286 high-quality diallelic synonymous SNPs was used to examine the genotype data for the presence of any obvious population structure using the R packages adegenet (Version 2.0.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jombart and Ahmed, 2011</xref>) and ape (Version 3.4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Paradis et al., 2004</xref>). To this end, we created a PCA plot from the genotype data using the function glPca (R package adegenet) and additionally computed a neighbour-joining tree based on the pairwise Euclidean distances between the isolate genotypes using the function nj (R package ape). Additionally, another PCA plot was generated for the European isolates only, based on a set of 5170 high-quality diallelic synonymous SNPs found in the European isolates.</p><p>For the association analysis we focused on the high-quality variants obtained with freebayes in the haploid SNP calling, which we filtered further to extract only non-synonymous coding variants predicted to change the protein sequence and generated a simplified genotyping table listing all of these variants. Additionally, we also screened the results from the diploid freebayes variant calling for ‘heterozygous’ positions with a minor allele frequency of at least 1/3, as in this case the different ‘alleles’ are likely derived from differing paralog copies, and added these positions to the genotyping table. This procedure was implemented in R (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) and resulted in a set of 22,838 high-confidence variants with predicted effect on the protein sequence, which we tested for their association with the observed avirulence phenotypes using Fisher’s exact test.</p><p>Loss of avirulence might be caused by different variants in different isolates. Therefore, we integrated all high-confidence non-synonymous variants over each gene to obtain gene-wise genotypes. Moreover, to also include presence/absence polymorphisms we considered the complete absence of a transcript as a ‘missing’ genotype. Finally, these gene-wise genotypes were tested for association with the observed avirulence phenotypes using Fisher’s exact test. This gene-wise integration of variants and the subsequent association test were implemented in R. As further technical validation, we additionally performed the same association test also on gene-wise genotypes obtained in the same way from the high-quality mpileup SNPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

Each sample was thawed in 100 µl 2x cell culture lysis buffer (Promega, E1531) supplemented with Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 to a final concentration of 150 mM. Luciferase activity was determined by mixing 50 µl of leaf extract with 50 µl luciferase substrate (Promega, E1501) in a white 96-well plate and light emission (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source datas 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata3">3</xref>) was measured 1 s/well in a microplate luminometer (Centro, LB960).

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Six pairs of allelic MLA immune receptor-powdery mildew AVR<sub>A</sub> effectors argue for a direct non-self recognition mechanism&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work can not be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> in its present form.</p><p>The referees strongly acknowledge the comprehensive molecular pathological survey of local <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> pv. <italic>hordei (Bgh</italic>) isolates and their virulence activities on various barley cultivars, along with the identification and functional verification of numerous novel <italic>Bgh</italic> avirulence factors and their matching barley NLR immune receptors. They also agree that demonstration of physical interaction of NLRs with their corresponding AVRs has major scientific implications as it is contrary to the prevailing view that such events are rare exceptions only. Regretfully, experimental evidence for this latter part is considered not of sufficient quality to support such a major claim. Given that a series of sophisticated methodologies exist to prove and quantify protein-protein interactions in vitro or in vivo, you may choose such techniques to validate the findings obtained by split-luciferase for some of the effector-NLR pairs prior to re-submission of a revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This paper reports a comprehensive molecular pathological survey of local <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> pv. <italic>hordei (Bgh</italic>) isolates and their virulence activities on various barley cultivars. While such surveys have been successfully undertaken in the past, the authors of the present study do not stop by identifying <italic>Bgh</italic>/barley cultivar pairs but identify individual <italic>Bgh</italic> avirulence factors and their matching NLR immune receptors in barley. Functionality of these pairs in plant defense (cell death) activation is tested upon expression in heterologous <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves or in barley protoplasts. The most intriguing finding is demonstration of physical interaction of NLRs with their corresponding AVRs by means of split-luciferase assays in planta (<italic>N. benth.)</italic> and (at least in the case of one combination) in yeast. This is an important finding as it is widely believed that NLR activation is virtually a case of indirect effector or effector activity recognition. Avr-Pita/PiTa interactions (rice/rice blast) are so far the only examples for which such a direct interaction has been demonstrated. In sum, this is a nice molecular survey that is properly conducted. It may not report an exciting novel molecular mechanism but may contribute to a shift in our perception on how NLR-mediated non-self recognition works.</p><p>One criticism I have is that biochemical demonstration of ligand-receptor interaction is based upon a rather simple (should I say poor?) set of experiments. Given the technology available to demonstrate (and quantify) receptor ligand binding (affinities), which is also widely used to demonstrate pattern recognition through pattern recognition receptors in plant immunity, the technology used here falls short of what would be possible to demonstrate physical interaction. In particular, reporting affinities between AVR proteins and their corresponding NLRs has not been done before, and would indeed be a true novelty.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript “Six pairs of allelic MLA immune receptor-powdery mildew AVR<sub>A</sub> effectors argue for a direct non-self recognition mechanism” reports on:</p><p>1) The molecular identification of 4 novel barley powdery mildew (<italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> f. sp. <italic>hordei, Bgh</italic>) Avr genes coding all for small secreted proteins (Candidate Secreted Effector Candidate Proteins (CSEPs) by a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS),</p><p>2) The investigation of the molecular details of their recognition by allelic barley <italic>Mla</italic> NLR immune receptors and</p><p>3) Analysis of the diversity of the novel Avr<sub>A</sub> effectors in <italic>Bgh</italic> populations and populations of other formae specialis of Bg.</p><p>While part 1 (TWAS-based Avr identification) is quite straightforward and largely validated by transient assays in barley protoplasts and <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> agro-infiltration assays, parts 2 (investigation of association and physical binding between MLA NLRs and <italic>AVR<sub>a</sub></italic>s) and 3 (diversity analysis) are much less convincing. The major weakness of the study is that direct binding of <italic>AVR<sub>a</sub></italic>effectors to MLA NLR immune receptors is only weakly supported by the data (in particular, the strong statement in the title is not justified). A minor weakness is that population analysis of the distribution and diversification of the Avr<sub>A</sub> effectors suffers from lack of description/characterization of the isolates (cf more detailed discussion of the individual parts) and does not bring very interesting new insights. Taken together, the findings in the manuscript are new and of high interest for researchers working on plant immunity and fungal virulence because they broaden knowledge on the molecular identity of fungal effectors recognized by cereal NLR immune receptors and further confirm that highly sequence-conserved <italic>Mla</italic> immune receptors (in certain cases &gt; 96% aa identity) recognize sequence-unrelated effectors.</p><p>I recommend to reject the manuscript and to encourage resubmission of a revised manuscript that shows additional data supporting direct binding of <italic>AVR<sub>a</sub></italic>s to MLAs (and specific binding of recognized <italic>AVR<sub>a</sub></italic> alleles). Eventually, submission of a strongly revised manuscript that presents and interprets the data on <italic>AVR<sub>a</sub></italic>/MLA interaction more cautiously would be acceptable. In addition, the description and discussion of the diversity of the novel <italic>AVR<sub>a</sub></italic>s should be improved.</p><p>Specific comments on part 1: TWAS for <italic>AVR<sub>a</sub></italic> gene identification and validation of candidate genes by transient assays:</p><p>This part of the study is straightforward and adds 3 novel <italic>Bgh</italic> Avr<sub>A</sub> effectors to a recent series of studies that identified 2 <italic>Bgh AVR<sub>a</sub></italic> effectors (<italic>AVR<sub>a1</sub></italic> and <italic>AVR<sub>a13</sub></italic>, Lu et al., 2016), 2 <italic>Bgt</italic> avirulence effectors (NLRs unrelated to <italic>Mla</italic>, Bourras et al., 2015, Praz et al., 2016) as well as 2 wheat stem rust effectors (NLRs highly similar to <italic>Mla</italic>s, Chen et al., 2017 and Salcedo et al., 2017).</p><p>Figure 4: The <italic>AVR<sub>a9</sub></italic> candidate is not validated. Statistical analysis of data from the protoplast assay (panel A, co-expression with <italic>Mla9</italic>) shows no difference to the virulent allele Avr<sub>a9-</sub>V1, Avr<sub>a13-1</sub> or <italic>AVR<sub>a13</sub>-V2</italic> (all are in class a). Only AVR<sub>a9</sub>-V2 is different. In addition, co-expression with <italic>Mla9</italic> in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> does not give HR. Based on these data Avr<sub>a9</sub> cannot considered as validated and paragraph five of subsection “Co-expression of matching <italic>Mla</italic> and <italic>AVR<sub>a</sub></italic> pairs is necessary and sufficient to trigger cell death in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>” should be revised accordingly (there is no discrepancy for <italic>AVR<sub>a9</sub></italic> between protoplast and <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> assay). <italic>AVR<sub>a10</sub></italic> is not significantly different from <italic>AVR<sub>a10</sub>-V/AVR<sub>a22</sub>-V</italic> in the protoplast assay when co-expressed with <italic>Mla10</italic>. This striking result should be more clearly described. For cell death induction in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> (panel D of Figure 4), it would be important to have quantitative data since there is high variability in this assay. Best would be use of cell death scoring (4 or five scales based on cell death intensity) and comparison using appropriate statistics and replicate number.</p><p>Subsection “Functional analysis of <italic>AVR<sub>a</sub></italic> candidates in barley leaf protoplasts”: &quot;We detected reduced LUC activity when <italic>AVR<sub>a7</sub>-AUS</italic> was co-expressed with <italic>Mla7</italic>, but statistically this did not differ from protoplasts expressing <italic>AVRa7 -V2</italic> with <italic>Mla7</italic> (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A)&quot;. Since the difference between <italic>AVR<sub>a7</sub></italic>-AUS and <italic>AVRa7 -V2</italic> is statistically not significant you cannot say that LUC activity is reduced. The statistic test says there is no difference!</p><p>In the same subsection: There is no statistically significant difference between <italic>AVR<sub>a7</sub>-1</italic> and <italic>AVR<sub>a7</sub>-V1</italic> in Figure 4—figure supplement 1C. Therefore, it does not make sense to insist on a reduction in Luc Activity and the interpretation of the experiment should be accordingly: recognition of <italic>AVR<sub>a7</sub>-1</italic> by MLA7_AAQ55540 is not detected in the protoplast assay.</p><p>Specific comments on Part (2) Physical binding between MLA and <italic>AVR<sub>a</sub></italic> proteins is not convincingly demonstrated by Y2H and split luciferase assay.</p><p>Figure 5A, B and C: The split ubiquitin assay shows association between two proteins in planta not direct physical binding. Reconstitution of functional luciferase occurs when nLUC and cLUC are close enough which indicates that the nLUC and cLUC fusion proteins are part of the same protein complex but not necessarily that their interaction is direct. The sentence &quot;Although the LUC complementation assay is suggestive of a direct receptor – avirulence effector interaction, we cannot fully exclude the involvement of other plant proteins in the detected interactions&quot; gives clearly the wrong direction for the interpretation of these experiments.</p><p>Figure 5C. It is surprising that the difference between <italic>AVR<sub>a10</sub></italic> and <italic>AVR<sub>a10</sub>-V/AVR<sub>a22</sub>-V</italic> is statistically not significant because the variance is limited; the statistical test should be verified and if calculation is correct, the number of replicates should be increased. If there is indeed no statistically significant difference between the two constructs such differences should not be claimed. Specific formation of a <italic>Mla22/AVR<sub>a22</sub></italic>complex is not supported by the split luciferase assay and should not be claimed.</p><p>The yeast two hybrid assay in Figure 5D is a key experiment. However, the signal for <italic>AVR<sub>a13</sub>-1</italic>/MLA13 interaction in the Y2H assay is extremely weak (and for <italic>AVR<sub>a13</sub>-3</italic>/MLA13 this is even worse) and not convincing enough for such an important key experiment. Results from quantitative LacZ activity measurements should be provided or other Y2H constructs (in particular GAL4-based constructs) and/or other reporters (in particular His auxotrophy that can be precisely adjusted by varying 3AT concentrations) should be used. It would also be interesting to test the interactions between the other <italic>AVR<sub>a</sub></italic>s and their corresponding MLAs.</p><p>Specific comments on part 3: Investigation of <italic>AVR<sub>a</sub></italic> effector diversity</p><p>Paragraph three of subsection “Evolutionary history of <italic>Bgh AVR<sub>a</sub></italic> genes and population-level <italic>AVR<sub>a10</sub> /AVR<sub>a22</sub></italic> sequence variation in <italic>B. graminis</italic> formae speciales” In the phylogenetic analysis of CSEP0141 using <italic>Bg</italic> isolates other than <italic>Bgh</italic>, it should be indicated which isolates were used, where and when they were sampled and what diversity they are intended to represent. In addition, actual diversity measured with neutral markers should be provided. Otherwise, it is difficult to interpret the information that one single haplotype was identified in f. sp. <italic>triticale</italic> and one in f. sp. <italic>secalis</italic>. Also the frequencies of the different <italic>Bgt</italic> haplotypes is difficult to interpret.</p><p>In the same paragraph: It is not correct that there is limited diversity for CSEPS0141 in wheat since 7 haplotypes were detected. The frequencies of these haplotypes in world-wide or European populations remain unclear since there is no documentation on the analyzed <italic>Bgt</italic> isolates.</p><p>Comments on the Discussion</p><p>Paragraph one: How good is the diversity in Australian <italic>Bgh</italic> populations reflected by the 3 chosen isolates? From neutral diversity (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A) the 3 Australian isolates seem to be extremely similar. Does that reflect the diversity of <italic>Bgh</italic> in Australia? Are this historical or recent isolates? Would additional, well selected isolates add additional neutral and/or pathotype diversity?</p><p>Paragraph two: The <italic>AVR<sub>a9</sub> </italic>and the <italic>AVR<sub>a10</sub></italic> candidates were not really validated by protoplast assays, the <italic>AVR<sub>a9</sub></italic> candidate was not validated by <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> assays.</p><p>Paragraph two: Escape from <italic>Mla</italic>-mediated recognition by loss of expression is not really demonstrated in the study. Only one single isolate lacks expression of the <italic>AVR<sub>a9</sub></italic>-candidate gene.</p><p>“Our split-LUC and yeast-two-hybrid experiments provided evidence for direct and specific interactions between MLA7 and AVR<sub>A7</sub>, MLA10 and AVR<sub>A10</sub>, and MLA13 and AVR<sub>A13</sub> pairs (Figure 5).”: Sentence incorrect and in insufficiently supported. Y2H was only performed with <italic>AVR<sub>a13</sub></italic>. Direct interaction is not demonstrated by Split Luciferase.</p><p>“The recently resolved NMR based and crystal structure of <italic>Bgh</italic> CSEP0064 revealed a ribonuclease-like fold, lacking canonical catalytic residues in the substrate-binding pocket, and the gene products of ~120 additional <italic>Bgh</italic> CSEPs very likely adopt a similar structure [52].”: This sentence refers to un-published results of another group (cited as submitted manuscript). Data are not available for readers of the manuscript.</p><p>“When we used the crystal structure of <italic>Bgh</italic> CSEP0064 as template for structural similarity searches, we identified <italic>AVR<sub>a7</sub></italic> and <italic>AVR<sub>a13</sub></italic> as family members (high and certain confidence at p = 3.739E-3, and 6.174E-4, respectively), whereas no significant structural similarities were detected with <italic>AVR<sub>a1</sub>, AVR<sub>a9</sub>, AVR<sub>a10</sub></italic>, and <italic>AVR<sub>a22</sub></italic> (low and medium confidence at p &gt; 0.01).”: Sentence refers to data that are not shown. Cannot be verified and properly appreciated.</p><p>“Instead, we find that <italic>AVR<sub>a9</sub></italic> likely adopts a structural fold that is similar to an antimicrobial peptide, called microplusin (p = 6.014E-3).”: Again, data are not shown. In addition, it is unclear what type of modeling was performed since there seem to be no sequence homology and how reliable his modeling is.</p><p>“We conclude that MLA receptors might have an exceptional propensity to directly detect unrelated pathogen effectors and that this feature has facilitated the functional diversification of the receptor in the host population”. Highly speculative hypothesis.</p><p>“Whilst the latter is subject to future biochemical characterization of MLA – AVR<sub>A</sub> complexes, our work revealed a very strong binding of AVR<sub>A</sub>13-V2 to MLA13 both in the split-LUC and yeast two-hybrid experiments”. It would be interesting to see hypothesis why there is uncoupling of binding and recognition in the case of <italic>AVR<sub>a13</sub>-V2</italic>/ MLA13.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript &quot;Six pairs of allelic MLA immune receptor-powdery mildew AVR<sub>A</sub> effectors argue for a direct non-self recognition mechanism&quot; provides new and interesting data on the identification of avirulence genes in the species <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> and on its potential direct interaction with corresponding NLR-type receptors which are encoded by allelic versions of the R-gene MLA. The manuscript is generally well written and most of the conclusions are justified by the results. It provides new genetic information from a difficult and model system with socioeconomic relevance. Data show an astonishing diversity of a Blumeria population from single local population. It provides evidence for the novel finding that allelic and highly similar MLA receptors can detect non-allelic <italic>AVR<sub>a</sub></italic>proteins that lack structural conservation. <italic>AVR<sub>a</sub></italic>proteins likely activate MLA proteins by direct protein-protein interaction. <italic>AVR<sub>a</sub></italic> genes diversified apparently to avoid recognition and partially balancing selection can observed. I enjoyed reading the manuscript.</p><p>The fact that allelic MLA immune receptors and their orthologs apparently detect sequence unrelated fungal avirulence effectors was known before and it was speculated that this is based on direct protein interaction between MLA and <italic>AVR<sub>a</sub></italic>proteins (Lu et al., 2016). Now the authors newly identified and tested a more comprehensive collection of specific pairs of MLAx and <italic>AVR<sub>a</sub>x</italic> proteins. Here lies novelty and the unique advantage of the system, that authors can test multiple avirulence factors on a series of nearly identical allelic receptors. This allowed for substantiation of previous hypothetical statements. Genetic data appear very solid and overall, I can follow most of the conclusions. However, in quite some details, bioassay/biochemical data are not fully convincing or conclusions are perhaps too strong. I therefore think that the very high potential of this contribution is not yet fully exploited.</p><p>I have the following major questions and suggestions:</p><p>I am not fully convinced that direct binding potential of the AVR<sub>A</sub>-proteins explains cell death induction and avirulence. Some of your data could be also explained by lack of protein expression or stability. Loss of intrinsic protein stability might be indeed a biologically meaningful and exciting mechanism for avoiding recognition. I think quantification of AVR<sub>A</sub>-protein amounts might help interpreting cell death and split LUC assays more precisely.</p><p>I think you should show more positive results for direct protein interaction for at least three of six MLA-AVR<sub>A</sub> pairs. Show it in vivo instead of protein extracts.</p><p>It would be good to show AVR<sub>A</sub> avirulence function in regard to fungal development by transient expression in epidermal cells. Alternatively, you should reword the manuscript by exchanging avirulence with cell death induction.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Multiple pairs of allelic MLA immune receptor-powdery mildew AVR<sub>A</sub> effectors argue for a direct recognition mechanism&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some editorial issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The authors should state explicitly in the Discussion that attempts to produce recombinant proteins for protein-protein interactions studies failed for technical reasons. This will be important to readers unaware of such problems.</p><p>2) Your split luciferase assay is performed with protein extracts and not monitored in intact tissue and therefore cannot be considered an in planta assay.

They also agree that demonstration of physical interaction of NLRs with their corresponding AVRs has major scientific implications as it is contrary to the prevailing view that such events are rare exceptions only. Regretfully, experimental evidence for this latter part is considered not of sufficient quality to support such a major claim.

We agree that our previous submission fell short in validating the findings obtained by split‐luciferase for some of the effector‐NLR pairs, and we are confident that we now address the concerns in this new version and that, in particular, we provide additional convincing evidence for the association of NLRs with their corresponding AVRs.</p><p>We have also addressed the other comments of the reviewers and have revised our manuscript considerably.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] One criticism I have is that biochemical demonstration of ligand-receptor interaction is based upon a rather simple (should I say poor?) set of experiments. Given the technology available to demonstrate (and quantify) receptor ligand binding (affinities), which is also widely used to demonstrate pattern recognition through pattern recognition receptors in plant immunity, the technology used here falls short of what would be possible to demonstrate physical interaction. In particular, reporting affinities between AVR proteins and their corresponding NLRs has not been done before, and would indeed be a true novelty.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments and raising these concerns. We agree that our previously submitted manuscript fell short in demonstrating interactions between multiple AVR<sub>A</sub>/MLA pairs. We understand that new technologies are available for protein‐protein interaction studies and would be excited to use these in the future. Unlike surface-resident pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) for which ligand affinities can be obtained in vivo, these methods cannot be applied to date to quantify in vivo ligand binding with labelled ligands for NLRs inside plant cells.</p><p>NLRs and their ligand-induced responses are different from PRRs; in particular, MLA-triggered cell death and receptor oligomerisation (Maekawa et al., 2011) means that it has (so far) been impossible to purify large quantities of this receptor (and probably other full‐length NLRs) for in vitro association studies: we have assessed and attempted to test advanced methods for determining protein-protein interactions and for this also collaborate with Jijie Chai, a renowned biochemist and structural biologist with expertise in NLR biology. We considered pull-down assays with recombinant, purified proteins as the most promising approach. However, extensive efforts focused on recombinant expression of sufficient quality AVR<sub>A</sub>s and MLAs in heterologous systems such as insect cells remained unsuccessful. We were forced to conclude that we are at this stage unable to produce MLA and AVR<sub>A</sub> proteins in sufficient quantity and quality for in vitro protein‐protein interaction assays.</p><p>To independently validate the findings obtained by split‐luciferase in planta, we focused to significantly extend the Yeast-2-Hybrid (Y2H) assays.

Statistical analysis of data from the protoplast assay (panel A, co-expression with Mla9) shows no difference to the virulent allele Avr<sub>a9</sub>-V1, Avr<sub>a13</sub>-1 or AVR<sub>a13</sub>-V2 (all are in class a). Only AVR<sub>a9</sub>-V2 is different. In addition, co-expression with Mla9 in N. benthamiana does not give HR. Based on these data Avr<sub>a9</sub> cannot considered as validated and paragraph five of subsection “Co-expression of matching Mla and AVR<sub>a</sub> pairs is necessary and sufficient to trigger cell death in N. benthamiana” should be revised accordingly (there is no discrepancy for AVR<sub>a9</sub> between protoplast and N. benthamiana assay). AVR<sub>a10</sub> is not significantly different from AVR<sub>a10</sub>-V/AVR<sub>a22</sub>-V in the protoplast assay when co-expressed with Mla10. This striking result should be more clearly described. For cell death induction in N. benthamiana (panel D of Figure 4), it would be important to have quantitative data since there is high variability in this assay. Best would be use of cell death scoring (4 or five scales based on cell death intensity) and comparison using appropriate statistics and replicate number.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this inconsistency. We have carefully checked the raw data for all of our experiments. All the data was generated by two individuals in independent experiments (I. S and S.B.). After re‐inspection of the raw data of all replicates, we realized that the transfection efficiency in half of these individual replicates for the <italic>AVR<sub>a9</sub>/Mla9</italic> dataset was low. This was evidenced by a comparatively poor luciferase activity for the <italic>AVR<sub>a9</sub></italic> dataset in Figure 4B. As our protocol requires the transfection of three binary plasmids, high transfection efficiency is critical. The replicates with these low‐quality reads have now been repeated according to our standard protocol, resulting in higher transfection efficiency. These new data was now used to generate revised Figure 4B. We speculate that indeed the low transfection efficiency lead to the high variability between samples in Figure 4B, as variability is significantly reduced when including the new high‐quality data.</p><p>All <italic>AVR<sub>a10</sub>‐ Mla10</italic> replicates are of high quality and as such, we assume that <italic>AVR<sub>a10</sub>/AVR<sub>a22</sub>‐V</italic> is not significantly different from <italic>AVR<sub>a10</sub></italic> in this assay, which may be due to the low signal/noise ratio here. Yet, <italic>AVR<sub>a10</sub></italic> is significantly different from its virulent variant <italic>AVR<sub>a22</sub></italic> in protoplasts and both <italic>AVR<sub>a10</sub>/AVR<sub>a22</sub>‐V</italic> and <italic>AVR<sub>a22</sub></italic> do not elicit cell death upon co‐expression of <italic>Mla10</italic> in the <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaf assay, for which statistical analysis was now performed (see below).</p><p>Regarding cell death induction in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic></p><p>We agree that a more transparent data analysis is favourable for these kinds of assays.

It is surprising that the difference between AVR<sub>a10</sub> and AVR<sub>a10</sub>-V/AVR<sub>a22</sub>-V is statistically not significant because the variance is limited; the statistical test should be verified and if calculation is correct, the number of replicates should be increased. If there is indeed no statistically significant difference between the two constructs such differences should not be claimed. Specific formation of a Mla22/AVR<sub>a22</sub> complex is not supported by the split luciferase assay and should not be claimed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed the case; we thank the reviewer for pointing out this issue. As requested by Reviewer #3, we have now also determined the protein levels of constructs expressed to measure luciferase activity in the split‐LUC interaction assay and show representative western blots in Figure S4.

AVR<sub>A22</sub>/MLA22 is only significantly different from all other constructs tested together with MLA22, although the signal/noise ratio remains low and we mention this in the text. We speculate that this low signal/noise ratio may be due to the comparatively low AVR<sub>A22</sub> protein levels (new data Figure S4). We do not interpret beyond. Notably, we could not detect EKA_AVR<sub>A10</sub> protein in any replicate of our association assays and have thus excluded EKA_<italic>AVR<sub>a10</sub></italic>from these datasets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The yeast two hybrid assay in Figure 5D is a key experiment. However, the signal for AVR<sub>a13</sub>-1/MLA13 interaction in the Y2H assay is extremely weak (and for AVR<sub>a13</sub>-3/MLA13 this is even worse) and not convincing enough for such an important key experiment. Results from quantitative LacZ activity measurements should be provided or other Y2H constructs (in particular GAL4-based constructs) and/or other reporters (in particular His auxotrophy that can be precisely adjusted by varying 3AT concentrations) should be used.

In addition, actual diversity measured with neutral markers should be provided.

From neutral diversity (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A) the 3 Australian isolates seem to be extremely similar. Does that reflect the diversity of Bgh in Australia?

It has been reported that, in contrast to European <italic>Bgh</italic> populations, the Australian <italic>Bgh</italic> population is characterized by highly similar pathotypes as well as a low genotypic diversity (Kominkova et al., 2016; Dreiseitl et al., 2014; Dreiseitl et al., 2013). In accordance with these observations, for our previous study (Lu et al., 2016), we initially had examined the virulence phenotypes of in total 14 Australian isolates, which, however, did not reveal any further distinct pathotypes. Therefore, we believe that the chosen three isolates, at least for our purposes, are a faithful representation of the Australian <italic>Bgh</italic> population. Accordingly, while an extensive examination of further Australian isolates might have allowed us to incorporate further diversity, the inclusion of further European isolates seemed to be the more promising approach to increase the diversity of our <italic>Bgh</italic> isolate panel to improve the power of our association analysis and facilitate identification of further <italic>Avr</italic> genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Paragraph two: The AVR<sub>a9</sub> and the AVR<sub>a10</sub> candidates were not really validated by protoplast assays, the AVR<sub>a9</sub> candidate was not validated by N. benthamiana assays.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you.

Here lies novelty and the unique advantage of the system, that authors can test multiple avirulence factors on a series of nearly identical allelic receptors.

However, we are unable to support these yeast data with split‐LUC assays due to very low protein levels of AVR<sub>A1</sub> and AVR<sub>A22</sub> in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves (Figure S4). In addition, co‐expression of <italic>Mla9</italic> and <italic>AVR<sub>a9</sub></italic> failed to trigger a cell death response in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves (Figure 4E). For these reasons, we do not wish to include yeast data of these MLA – AVR<sub>A</sub> pairs in the current manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some editorial issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The authors should state explicitly in the discussion that attempts to produce recombinant proteins for protein-protein interactions studies failed for technical reasons. This will be important to readers unaware of such problems.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. For clarification, we added:</p><p>“So far it has been impossible to purify large quantities of recombinant full‐length MLA receptors for in vitroAVR<sub>A</sub>‐MLA association studies, possibly because of MLA‐triggered cell death and receptor oligomerisation (Maekawa et al., 2011). We thus focused on quantitatively measuring putative AVR<sub>A</sub>‐MLA associations in plant extracts using the highly sensitive split‐luciferase (split‐LUC) complementation assay.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Your split luciferase assay is performed with protein extracts and not monitored in intact tissue and therefore cannot be considered an in planta assay. This should be reworded.</p></disp-quote><p>Throughout the text, we changed “<italic>in planta</italic>” to “in plant extracts” or deleted <italic>in planta</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3)The authors conclude that differences in AVR protein stability is not the dominant mechanism deciding about whether and how strong cell death is executed. However, in single cases you cannot exclude this, and this should be made transparent to the reader to avoid misinterpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we now mention this in the respective results section. Specifically, we have changed:</p><p>“All AVR<sub>A13</sub> variants except for AVR<sub>A13</sub>‐V1 were detectable in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> extracts without GFP‐Trap pull‐down.”</p><p>to</p><p>“AVR<sub>A13</sub>‐1, AVR<sub>A13</sub>‐3, and AVR<sub>A13</sub>‐V2 were detectable in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> extracts without GFP‐Trap pull‐down (Figure 4E). AVR<sub>A13</sub>‐V1‐mYFP protein was barely detectable even after GFPTrap enrichment (Figure 4E) suggesting that loss of MLA13‐mediated cell death activity for AVR<sub>A13</sub>‐V1 may be due to protein instability”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) You need to explain why no protein expression data are provided for barley protoplast assays. Similarly, protein expression data for Figure 5A-C (Figure S4) must be shown in the main figure and explained in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>In the results paragraph describing the protoplast-based cell death assay, we now explain the reasoning:</p><p>“As epitope tag sequences can interfere with signal‐noise ratios of LUC activity in this assay (Lu et al., 2016), we refrained from fusion of constructs with epitope sequences.”</p><p>We understand the necessity of determining protein expression and stability in the heterologous <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> systems and for clarity and direct comparison of phenotype and protein levels, we added the respective western blot analysis to the main figure (Figure 5E; 5F; 5J) as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is inappropriate to deduce functional consequences of different natural expression levels of MLA or AVR<sub>a</sub> proteins from over-expression data. Here, wording should be more cautious.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the statement to:</p><p>“Although based on overexpression data, the significant variation in cell death phenotypes reported here could partly reflect variable <italic>Bgh</italic>infection phenotypes on different MLA NILs (Supplementary File 1, Boyd et al. 1995). In turn, these differences of infection phenotypes are possibly due to variations in the steady‐state levels of the MLA receptors during <italic>Bgh</italic>infection, timing of <italic>Bgh</italic>‐mediated AVR<sub>A</sub> secretion and/or AVR<sub>A</sub> steady‐state levels <italic>in planta</italic>, or MLA-AVR<sub>A</sub> pair‐dependent receptor binding affinities.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Summary statistics of the two SNP calling methods must be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the statistical summary of freebayes and mpileup SNP calling and <italic>p‐values</italic> for significant hits to Supplementary File 4 and refer to this in the results text and Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Your mapping allows up to 10 mismatches per read (subsection “RNA-seq read alignment and variant calling”). Read length and filtering of read lengths are not mentioned. How do you distinguish copy number variants from sequence polymorphism with your methods? Likewise, experimental details on how Pi and which Pi (per gene, per site, per gene per site) were calculated must be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>Read length and filtering</p><p>We did not apply any filtering other than read length. Read length information of here sequenced <italic>Bgh</italic>isolates is deposited in the NCBI GEO database (accession no. GSE110266). To the respective method section (RNA‐seq read alignment and variant calling) we added:</p><p>“Read length was 100 bp for previously sequenced isolates (GSE83237), 150 bp for DH14 (GSE106282), S20 and S25, and 250 bp for all other isolates (GSE110266).”</p><p>Copy number variation</p><p>We are able to only identify exact gene copy numbers in <italic>Bgh</italic>isolates for which long‐read genome sequences are available (DH14 and RACE1).

The only assumptions one can make from the transcriptome data are on cases where a <italic>Bgh</italic>isolate carries and expresses variable copies of a gene. Such variables appear as “heterozygous” SNPs in transcriptome data indicating the existence of at least two non‐identical copies of this particular gene. These cases are described in subsection “Combined TWAS and <italic>Bgh</italic> genome analysis identified candidates for <italic>AVR<sub>a7</sub>, AVR<sub>a9</sub></italic>, <italic>AVR<sub>a10</sub></italic>, and <italic>AVR<sub>a22</sub></italic>”.</p><p>Nucleotide diversity Pi</p><p>We mention this information in the Materials and method section (Genome‐wide nucleotide diversity of <italic>B.g.</italic> ff. spp. isolates) and now explicitly state in the Results section that Pi refers to Per‐site nucleotide diversity in this analysis (second paragraph of subsection “Evolutionary history of <italic>Bgh</italic> AVR<sub>a</sub> genes and population-level <italic>AVR<sub>a10</sub></italic> /AVR<sub>a22</sub> sequence variation in B. graminis formae specialis”).

E.g., the Avr<sub>a13</sub>-V1-nLUC construct that does not give luciferase activity when co-expressed with Mla13-cLUC is not detected in WB blot. Therefore, no conclusion can be drawn on the association of Avr<sub>a13</sub>-V1with Mla13.</p></disp-quote><p>For clarity and direct comparison of cell death and associated phenotypes with protein levels, we added the respective western blot analysis to the main figures (Figure 4E; 4F; 4H and Figure 5E; 5F; 5J) as requested.</p><p>We explicitly note in the text that lack of cell death and LUC activity of samples expressing <italic>AVR<sub>a13</sub>‐V1</italic> and <italic>Mla13</italic> is accompanied by undetectable levels of AVR<sub>A13</sub>‐V1 protein in plant extracts.</p></body></sub-article></article>
