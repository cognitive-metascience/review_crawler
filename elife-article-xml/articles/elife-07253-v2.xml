understood non-vesicular mechanism. We identified a novel, evolutionarily diverse family of ER membrane proteins with StART-like lipid transfer domains and studied them in yeast. StART-like domains from Ysp2p and its paralog Lam4p specifically bind sterols, and Ysp2p, Lam4p and their homologs Ysp1p and Sip3p target punctate ER-PM contact sites distinct from those occupied by known ER-PM tethers. The activity of Ysp2p, reflected in amphotericin-sensitivity assays, requires its second StART-like domain to be positioned so that it can reach across ER-PM contacts. Absence of Ysp2p, Ysp1p or Sip3p reduces the rate at which exogenously supplied sterols traffic from the PM to the ER. Our data suggest that these StART-like proteins act <italic>in trans</italic> to mediate a step in sterol exchange between the PM and ER.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07253.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07253.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07253.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Membranes are crucial structures for cells that are made primarily of fat molecules. The most important membrane is the external one that surrounds cells and keeps the outside world out and cellular contents in. The single most common fat component in the external membrane is cholesterol, which makes the membrane rigid and better able to withstand the outside world. So even though excess cholesterol contributes to diseases such as heart disease, stroke and Alzheimer's, the external membrane of every cell needs about a billion cholesterol molecules for its normal function. But how do cells manage the traffic of these molecules to their destination?</p><p>It is known that when external membranes are short of cholesterol they make it at a different cellular location. There is an internal network—called the endoplasmic reticulum—that spreads just about everywhere throughout the cell. This network is where fats like cholesterol are made when the cell has not got enough, and where they are converted into an inert form when the cell has too much. What is not known is how cholesterol moves to and fro between this network and the external membrane.</p><p>One theory is that cholesterol and other fats move only where the internal network comes into close contact with the external membrane, without quite touching. This theory comes in part from the finding that many of the proteins found in the narrow gaps between the internal network and the external membrane are capable of transferring fats across the gap. However, one of the missing supports for this theory is that no protein that transfers cholesterol across this gap has been found.</p><p>Gatta, Wong, Sere et al. used computational tools to scan the database of known proteins for those that might be able to transfer cholesterol, and found a new family of fat transfer proteins. Further experiments showed that these proteins only bind to cholesterol out of all the fats. Next, Gatta, Wong, Sere et al. studied what the proteins do in cells, but instead of looking at the proteins in human cells they studied the related proteins in yeast. This is because the details of both the traffic of cholesterol and contacts between the internal network and the external membrane are in many respects understood better in yeast than in human cells.</p><p>Gatta, Wong, Sere et al. found the cholesterol transfer proteins were embedded in regions where the internal network was in close contact with the external membrane. Also, in cells that lacked these proteins, cholesterol added to the external membrane had difficulty transferring to the internal network.</p><p>These results together suggest that the newly identified lipid transfer proteins exchange lipids between the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum at membrane contact sites. Further research is required to understand in detail how these proteins work.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07253.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07253.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>membrane contact site</kwd><kwd>lipid traffic</kwd><kwd>cholesterol</kwd><kwd>ergosterol</kwd><kwd>StART protein</kwd><kwd>polyene</kwd><kwd>VASt domain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NPRP 5-669-1-112</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sere</surname><given-names>Yves Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Calderón-Noreña</surname><given-names>Diana M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council (MRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/J006580/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Louise H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sphingonet ITN, project ref 289278</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gatta</surname><given-names>Alberto T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new family of sterol-specific lipid transfer proteins has been found that anchors in the endoplasmic reticulum; some of these proteins stretch across membrane contacts and mediate sterol traffic from the plasma membrane.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Although lipids are synthesized only in specific locations in the cell and must be exported to populate membrane-bound organelles, the mechanisms of intracellular lipid traffic are still uncertain. Each organelle has a unique set of lipids, which in some cases (for example, mitochondria) cannot be delivered by vesicles. Even for organelles linked by the secretory pathway, non-vesicular mechanisms dominate for both phospholipids and sterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holthuis and Levine, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Voelker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holthuis and Menon, 2014</xref>). Sterols are critically important lipids that are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and trafficked mainly to the plasma membrane (PM). Traffic is very fast (t½ &lt; 5 min), bidirectional, and independent of the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pagano, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Simons and Ikonen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baumann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mesmin et al., 2011</xref>), so non-vesicular mechanisms must exist to transfer sterol across the cytoplasm between the ER and PM.</p><p>Non-vesicular sterol transport is likely to be mediated by sterol-specific lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) with the ability to extract sterols from membranes, effectively solubilizing them for transport through the cytoplasm. Models vary in the envisaged distance across which LTP-sterol complexes must diffuse. When the entire ER is considered to exchange lipid with the entire PM, the presumed diffusion distance is up to 50% of the cell diameter. Other models specify that LTPs only diffuse between ER and PM where they form membrane contact sites (MCSs) with interorganelle gaps ∼30 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Helle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Prinz, 2014</xref>). The ER forms MCSs with many organelles, and MCSs have become a significant subject of research as MCS-specific proteins have been identified. The dominant classes of MCS proteins are tethers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Brito and Scorrano, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lahiri et al., 2014</xref>), regulators of calcium traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takeshima et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wu et al., 2006</xref>), lipid biosynthetic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vance, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pichler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tavassoli et al., 2013</xref>), and LTPs including ceramide transfer protein (CERT) and oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vihtelic et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Levine and Munro, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hanada et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peretti et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rocha et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Toulmay and Prinz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maeda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mesmin et al., 2013</xref>). Many of these LTPs contain a linear motif (two phenylalanines in an acidic tract = ‘FFAT’) that binds to VAP, a conserved integral ER membrane protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Loewen et al., 2003</xref>), and these LTPs target an MCS by containing both a FFAT motif for ER targeting and a second targeting domain for the other organelle.</p><p>Finding so many LTPs at MCSs has led to the widespread expectation that lipid transfer occurs there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holthuis and Levine, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Prinz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vance, 2015</xref>), but there is little direct evidence for this. Some of the best evidence relates to CERT and OSBP, which bind ceramide and sterol respectively. Both CERT and OSBP have FFAT motifs, and their recruitment causes VAP to redistribute from the whole ER into MCSs, indicating that CERT or OSBP is physically bridging the MCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mesmin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kumagai et al., 2014</xref>). While CERT mediates non-vesicular ceramide traffic, there is some doubt that OSBP homologs mediate all sterol traffic because deleting Osh4, the major OSBP in yeast has no effect on ER → PM or PM → ER sterol transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Raychaudhuri et al., 2006</xref>) (Sullivan and Menon, unpublished). Also, deleting all seven OSBP homologs in yeast only reduces PM → ER sterol traffic by ∼twofold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Georgiev et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that other mechanisms exist. Apart from OSBPs, the other sterol specific LTPs are members of the <underline>St</underline>eroidogenic <underline>A</underline>cute <underline>R</underline>egulatory <underline>T</underline>ransfer (StART) proteins. Among 15 human StARTs, the founding member of the family (StARD1) transports cholesterol into mitochondria in steroidogenic cells, and StARD4 transports cholesterol from the late secretory pathway to the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mesmin et al., 2011</xref>). Budding yeast has no canonical StART proteins, but has Coq10p and Ups1-3p, which are distantly related StART-like proteins that bind non-sterol lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barros et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Connerth et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here, we identified a large new protein family distantly related to StART proteins. We found that Ysp2p, one of six StART-like proteins in yeast, has two StART-like domains both of which bind sterol. Along with three other yeast StART-like proteins Ysp1p Sip3p and Lam4p, it is anchored in the ER at contact sites with the PM. In addition, its function requires anchoring to these sites in such a way that its StART-like domain can reach out across the contacts. Finally, loss of Ysp2p, Ysp1p or Sip3p reduces the rate of transfer of sterol from PM to ER, consistent with these proteins mediating a component of sterol transport.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A family of membrane anchored StART-like proteins includes Ysp1p, Ysp2p and Sip3p</title><p>To identify novel sterol transfer proteins, we used StART domains to seed the homology tool HHpred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Soding et al., 2005</xref>).

First we considered the effect of over-expression. For Ysp2p, high expression had little effect on its distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). However, in cells highly expressing Sip3p, protein accumulated in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This suggests that Sip3p, and by extension Ysp1p, Ysp2p and Lam4p, target a saturable punctate subdomain of the cER. However, additional information is required to make a precise assignment because cER occupies a high proportion of the periphery in yeast, so co-localization with cER could be coincidental. To refine the localization data, we therefore genetically reduced the amount of cER using a strain lacking 90% of cER. In this ‘∆tether’ strain six proteins involved in ER-PM tethering are deleted, and the proportion of PM with cER is reduced from 40% to 4% with ER accumulation in the center of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Manford et al., 2012</xref>). In ∆tether cells GFP-Ysp2p and GFP-Sip3p were still found in peripheral puncta, although these were less numerous compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). All puncta with GFP-Ysp2p were in close proximity to a strand of ER extending into the periphery, although each ER strand appeared in fewer confocal sections than the associated punctum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, arrows). The same was found for Ysp1p, Sip3p and Lam4p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>), indicating that all four proteins target ER-PM contacts that are distinct from those mediated by the six tether proteins previously identified.</p><p>We next determined sequence elements required for contact site targeting by analyzing variants of Ysp2p. Surprisingly, we found that Ysp2p is targeted normally to cER puncta in the absence of its N-terminal domains. Unexpectedly, this targeting resulted from just the Ysp2 C-terminal region (Ysp2CT), including the predicted luminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Similarly, for Ysp1, the C-terminus alone produced punctate targeting (data not shown). Also, because localization to ER-PM contacts is consistent with being embedded either in the PM or in the ER, we induced expression of GFP-Ysp2CT from the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter after inactivating <italic>SEC18</italic> (yeast NSF). Despite the block in secretion, newly expressed Ysp2CT still localized to peripheral puncta, while a PM resident protein could only attain its normal distribution if expression was induced before inactivating <italic>SEC18</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). This indicates that Ysp2p reaches its final destination without leaving the ER.</p><p>Finally we asked if Ysp2p is colocalized with other cER proteins. We first found partial but significant overlap between Ysp2 and Lam4p, its paralog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6A</xref>). Next, we found a much greater colocalization of Ysp2p with Sip3p with 87% of puncta being double positive (18 cells, 17.2 puncta per cell, s.d. 11%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This was only true in low expressing cells, as overexpression of Sip3p caused delocalization of Ysp2p from puncta into the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). For comparison, we examined other punctate cER markers, including the tricalbin Tcb2p, the most punctate of the known ER-PM tethers. Tcb2-GFP at endogenous levels did not significantly colocalize with Ysp2CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6B</xref>). Similarly, other punctate cER proteins such as Lnp1p and viral TGBp3 did not colocalize with Ysp2CT (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). The colocalisation of Ysp2p and Sip3p is therefore specific, and suggests a functionally important relationship between Ysp2p and Sip3p.</p><p>In summary, Ysp2p and its homologs are ER proteins strongly enriched at puncta in the cER that may define a sub-class of ER-PM contact site.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Ysp2p function correlates with sterol binding to its StART-like domain</title><p>Since we know the lipid binding specificity of Ysp2p and Lam4p, we next looked for sterol-related phenotypes associated with loss of these genes.

Firstly, plasmid-borne GFP-tagged Ysp2p expressed from its own promoter restored AmB resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), showing that the construct localized to cER puncta is functional. Next, we looked for active domains within Ysp2p. By deleting regions of Ysp2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), we found that rescue of AmB-sensitive growth was affected most upon removing either the C-terminal anchor or the second StART-like domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). On the other hand, deletion of Ysp2S1 had no effect. This indicated that both the C-terminus and the second StART-like domain are necessary for Ysp2p function. We next determined which domains are sufficient for rescue. The C-terminus was inactive, even though it is sufficient for punctate cER localization, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>). In contrast, both Ysp2S1 and Ysp2S2 rescued AmB<sup>s</sup> growth, although these required over-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), possibly because the constructs are diffusely cytoplasmic (data not shown). Therefore Ysp2S2 is the only component that is both necessary and sufficient, but it requires overexpression if it is cytoplasmic rather than membrane anchored.</p><p>To investigate the activity of YspS2 in rescuing AmB sensitivity, we compared it to other StART-like domains. Activity was found not only in Ysp2S1, but also Lam4S1, Lam4S2, and the StART-like domains of Lam5p and Lam6p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Significantly, human GramD1a increased resistance to AmB in both mutant and wild-type cells. The conservation of activity from yeast to human strongly indicates that the StART-like domains are the active portions of this protein family. Furthermore, constructs that rescued <italic>∆ysp2</italic> generally also rescued <italic>∆ysp1</italic> and <italic>∆sip3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which indicates that there may be considerable overlap in function between these homologs.</p><p>To investigate the role of sterol binding, we made a non-sterol-binding mutant by mutating a conserved glycine residue in the C-terminal helix predicted to interact with the omega-1 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Replacing G1205 in Ysp2p with alanine, threonine and arginine successively reduced the ability of Ysp2S2 to rescue AmB-sensitive growth (data not shown). Mutating the equivalent residue in Lam4S2 (G1119R) completely inhibited sterol binding in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), showing that this residue is indeed critical. Substitution of this G → R mutated domain abolished rescue of AmB sensitivity by Ysp2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), supporting a correlation between Ysp2p function and sterol binding by Ysp2S2. We next tested if the AmB-sensitive phenotype of <italic>∆ysp2</italic> cells could be rescued by a heterologous StART domain with very little sequence similarity to Ysp2S2, as was previously done for PITP/Sec14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Skinner et al., 1993</xref>). For this we expressed StART domains of human MLN64 (sterol-specific), PCTP (phosphatidylcholine-specific) and CERT (ceramide-specific) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The StART domain of MLN64 produced significant rescue, but the StART domains of PCTP and CERT did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This strongly supports the idea the function of Ysp2p resides in its interaction with sterol, rather than a specific protein–protein interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Ysp2p function correlates with the ability of its StART-like domain to reach across ER-PM contacts</title><p>Without its C-terminus, Ysp2p loses both targeting and function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). To examine the importance of anchoring further, we used the AmB resistance assay to determine the role of intracellular localization of Ysp2S2 by anchoring it to the cytoplasmic face of different organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Ysp2S2 activity was completely inhibited when anchored to either mitochondria or the vacuole. It was slightly activated by anchoring throughout the ER, and greatly activated by anchoring either to ER-PM contacts (with Ysp2CT) or to the PM as a whole.

This distance is large compared to the size of the StART-like domain itself (diameter 2.5 nm). While Ysp2p may act to extract or sense ER sterol, that is, function <italic>in cis</italic>, we wondered if its function requires it to act <italic>in trans</italic> by reaching across ER-PM contacts. Since unstructured peptide chains can extend up to 0.38 nm per residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pillardy et al., 2001</xref>), a linker between Ysp2S2 and a TMD anchor would need to be ≥40 aa to allow Ysp2S2 to cross the minimal 15 nm gap. We expressed constructs with Ysp2S2 linked to the generic ER anchor by unstructured linkers of varying length. Linkers of up to 10 aa (≤4 nm) completely inhibited Ysp2S2. In contrast, YspS2 was active when the linker was 40 aa (≤15 nm) or longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). More stringent testing, achieved using a higher concentration of AmB, showed that the 40 aa linker was only partially active, and that Ysp2S2 with linkers of 71 aa (≤27 nm) and 103 aa (≤39 nm) was progressively more active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This suggests that Ysp2p is only active when its StART-like domain can reach across the ER-PM contact to the other side.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Elimination of Ysp1p, Ysp2p and Sip3p slows transport of exogenously supplied sterols to the ER</title><p>We have shown that (i) Ysp2p is localized to puncta in the cER, (ii) Ysp2p can bind ergosterol via its StART-like domain, (iii) the function of Ysp2 and related genes can be partially rescued by an evolutionarily distant sterol transfer domain, and (iv) expression of Ysp2p variants can rescue the AmB-sensitivity of <italic>∆ysp2</italic> cells only when the StART-like domain is attached to a linker capable of spanning the ER-PM contact distance. Thus Ysp2p is positioned either to mediate sterol exchange between the ER and PM at a MCS or to act as a sterol-sensor that transmits information on lipid composition/organization between the ER and PM. Although we know less about the other members of the yeast StART-like family, we have established that Sip3p and Ysp1p localize to peripheral ER puncta and have overlapping functions, so we are interested in these other proteins alongside Ysp2p.</p><p>First we measured the anterograde transport of ergosterol between the ER and PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Georgiev et al., 2011</xref>). This is a direct transport assay that measures the appearance in the PM of a pulse of radiolabelled ergosterol generated in the ER. We metabolically labeled cells with [<sup>3</sup>H-methyl]-methionine for 4 min and either stopped the reaction immediately or chased the cells in excess unlabelled methionine for 15 min. At both time points we measured the ratio of radioactive ergosterol to total ergosterol (specific radioactivity, or SR) in purified PM fractions (SR<sub>PM</sub>) and in unfractionated extracts (SR<sub>cell</sub>). The amount of newly synthesized sterol in the PM was expressed as the relative specific ratio (RSR) = SR<sub>PM</sub>: SR<sub>cell</sub>. At long time points (90 min) RSR typically tends to 1, but even by the end of the pulse, RSR was 0.38 (s.d. 0.035, n = 5) in wild-type cells, which is similar to values achieved previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Georgiev et al., 2011</xref>). RSR increased to 0.61 (s.d. 0.072, n = 5) after 15 min chase. Deletion of <italic>YSP2</italic> alone produced no significant change in traffic during the pulse or after the chase (0.33 and 0.63, range for both ±0.032, n = 2). This results rules out that Ysp2p is the sole transporter of sterol between ER and PM. However, because the assay has a rapid first phase (pulse period &gt;t1/2), we cannot determine whether loss of Ysp2p causes a partial defect that would be undetectable in our protocol.</p><p>To test for more subtle effects that Ysp2p and homologs might play in sterol transport, we deployed two assays to measure the transport of exogenously supplied sterols (DHE and cholesterol) from the PM to the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Georgiev et al., 2011</xref>). Both assays require cells to be permissive for sterol uptake, which was achieved for DHE by reversibly inducing hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Georgiev et al., 2011</xref>), and for cholesterol by using <italic>upc2-1</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crowley et al., 1998</xref>). Key mechanistic steps that generate the eventual read-out of the assays are the insertion of sterol into the PM (requiring the ABC transporters Aus1p and Pdr11p), non-vesicular movement from PM to ER, and esterification at the ER requiring the ACAT enzymes Are1p and Are2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Raychaudhuri et al., 2006</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07253.019</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Retrograde sterol traffic is slower in strains lacking Ysp1p Ysp2p or Sip3p.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of retrograde traffic pathway for exogenous sterols.

DHE was loaded into the PM under hypoxic conditions and transport was initiated by exposing the cells to air. DHE esterification commenced after an initial lag period of 1 hr that was common to all strains tested.

We next assayed cholesterol import in the <italic>upc2-1</italic> strain background. The use of this background avoided the lengthy hypoxic induction used for DHE uptake, and because cholesterol is poorly tolerated in the yeast PM its flux through the import pathway leading to esterification is more rapid than for DHE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li and Prinz, 2004</xref>).

This indicates that similar defects exist for retrograde traffic of both exogenous sterols we tested.</p><p>To rule out trivial explanations for these results, we verified that Aus1p and Pdr11p localized similarly in deletion and wild-type cells (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li and Prinz, 2004</xref>). We also found that sterol esterification activity was not altered by deletion of Ysp2p and was marginally increased by loss of Ysp1p or Sip3p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Another issue we investigated was whether loss of StART-like proteins altered overall ergosterol distribution, which could interfere with the kinetics of our assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li and Prinz, 2004</xref>). Firstly, we measured the total amount of ergosterol in gradient fractions enriched for PM; this was not significantly changed in the delete strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Secondly, we assessed the organization of PM sterol, since changes in other lipids, especially sphingolipids, might lead to increased traffic of endogenous sterol that would compete with exogenous lipid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Simons and Ikonen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li and Prinz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Das et al., 2014</xref>). The proportion of sterol that partitions into detergent–insoluble complexes was unaffected by <italic>∆ysp1</italic>, <italic>∆ysp2</italic> or <italic>∆sip3</italic> deletions (54 ± 1%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Therefore, effects on the distribution and organization of ergosterol do not explain the effect of <italic>∆ysp1</italic>, <italic>∆ysp2</italic> and <italic>∆sip3</italic> on esterification of exogenous sterol. This leaves one major site of action of these proteins: they appear to act on the retrograde transport step itself, although we have not tested if their mechanism of action is direct or indirect.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We discovered a StART-like family of membrane-anchored lipid-binding proteins that is conserved throughout eukaryotes. Among the six yeast family members, the StART-like domains of Ysp2p and Lam4p specifically bind sterols, and the StART-like domains of GramD1a, Lam5p and Lam6p rescue AmB<sup>s</sup> growth, indicating that these too bind sterol. We were not able to test the StART-like domains of Ysp1p and Sip3p as they were poorly expressed, but since the AmB<sup>s</sup> phenotype of <italic>∆ysp1</italic> and <italic>∆sip3</italic> cells could be rescued by sterol-specific StART-like domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), it appears that these proteins also bind sterols. Thus, all members of this new protein family in yeast and humans may be specific for sterol.</p><p>The presence of TMDs is a key aspect for the entire StART-like family. Ysp1p, Ysp2p, Sip3p and Lam4p reside in puncta in the cER network that may define a novel class of ER-PM contact sites, while Lam5p and Lam6p target internal MCSs. This suggests that the fundamental molecular feature for members of this family is being a <bold><underline>l</underline></bold>ipid transfer protein <bold><underline>a</underline></bold>nchored at a <bold><underline>m</underline></bold>embrane contact site (hence ‘LAM’). Previous studies of Ysp1p, Ysp2p and Sip3p antedated the prediction of StART-like domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lesage et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pozniakovsky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sokolov et al., 2006</xref>), and we suggest providing a uniform nomenclature in the future by renaming these Lam1-3p respectively. Little is known about the human proteins, except that variation at the GramD1b locus is linked to lymphoma/leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Di Bernardo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conde et al., 2010</xref>), and we suggest renaming GramD1a-c as hLAMa-c. Intriguingly, the one LAM gene to have previously been linked to lipids is <italic>LAM4</italic>, which we previously identified in a random transposon screen as one of 20 genes involved in sterol import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sullivan et al., 2009</xref>). Although <italic>∆lam4</italic> has no sterol traffic defect, this might be explained by its lower level of expression compared to Ysp2p, so the previous results suggest that transposon insertion in <italic>LAM4</italic> can produce a dominant negative effect.</p><p>Ysp1p and Sip3p are outliers in terms of sequence to the other yeast and human StART-like proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 1, 2</xref>). Nevertheless, the co-localization of Sip3p with Ysp2p, and the fact that altered levels of Sip3p cause redistribution of Ysp2p suggest that these proteins interact. It is possible that they target a specific class of ER-PM contact site, similar to the sub-division of ER-mitochondria contacts into regions with different molecular components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lahiri et al., 2014</xref>). However targeting to puncta by Ysp2p does not appear to require stoichiometric interaction with Sip3p, as highly overexpressed Ysp2p remains punctate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>∆sip3</italic> has a much greater polyene sensitivity than <italic>∆ysp2</italic>, even though the two mutants have similar retrograde sterol defects, which indicates that the these proteins have significant non-overlapping functions.</p><p>We focused on studying the physiological role of Ysp2p. The activity of the StART-like domain of Ysp2S2 was maximized by anchoring it to either PM or ER with a linker of ≥100 aa. With a linker of 10 aa (≤4 nm) it was completely inactive, even though this is long enough for the domain to access lipids <italic>in cis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schulz et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, when anchored in the ER, Ysp2S2 function appears to function <italic>in trans</italic>. The activity of Ysp2S2 increased as the linker was extended from 40 aa (≤15 nm) to 103 aa (≤39 nm). However, linkers in the StART-like proteins are 55–75 aa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), similar to TULIPs (45–75 aa), which are also membrane anchored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Toulmay and Prinz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schauder et al., 2014</xref>). Since the natural linkers are shorter than those we needed for maximal activation of artificial Ysp2S2–TMD constructs, other factors, such as the accessory domains found commonly in this family, may contribute to activation in vivo. Hydrophobic loops of C2 domains and of PH-like domains penetrate into membranes to destabilize them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ramachandran et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paddock et al., 2011</xref>), which may disturb the local bilayer and contribute to function.</p><p>An important point to make is that we have not yet established how Ysp1p, Ysp2p and Sip3p modulate the movement of sterol between the PM and ER. Their mode of action might be indirect and regulatory, or they themselves might directly mediate sterol transfer. This lack of certainty arises because our assays of retrograde transport can be affected by sterol partitioning within the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li and Prinz, 2004</xref>). A key experimental question for the future will be to develop a new biophysical approach that shows how many sterol molecules that traffic between PM and ER actually pass into (and out of) the pocket of one of these LTPs. We have also not established how polyene sensitivity arises in cells lacking the StART-like proteins. Studies in pathogenic fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vincent et al., 2013</xref>) and in sphingolipid mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sharma et al., 2014</xref>) suggest that AmB sensitivity might be accompanied by gross biophysical change in sterol levels or extractability respectively, but this was not found. Mutations of several different <italic>ERG</italic>osterol biosynthetic genes in pathogenic fungi induce clinically relevant polyene resistance that is mediated by a range of stress responses to reduced sterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vincent et al., 2013</xref>). However the situation may be different in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> where deletions of single non-essential <italic>ERG</italic> genes do not induce polyene resistance, and one deletant is sensitive to both AmB and nystatin (<italic>∆erg4</italic>: 38th out of 4130 deletion strains tested) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hillenmeyer et al., 2008</xref>). As for altered sphingolipid metabolism, which can affect sterol traffic and AmB sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li and Prinz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Das et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sharma et al., 2014</xref>), this has been linked to Pmp3p, a conserved small hydrophobic PM protein of unknown function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bari et al., 2015</xref>). However, Pmp3 only affects sensitivity to AmB not other polyenes, so it seems likely that LTPs anchored at MCSs, mutants of which are sensitive to all polyenes, act in a separate pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemicals</title><p>Unless otherwise stated chemicals were obtained from Sigma–Aldrich, UK.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>1) There is concern regarding the conclusion that Lam proteins mediate sterol exchange between the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum. The reviewers appreciate that this is unlikely to be resolved in a single study, however, they feel that more definitive evidence that sterol is a physiological ligand for Lam proteins needs to be provided. Specific experiments to address this more rigorously are the following:</p><p>A) In panel 2C, the authors indicate that Lam4S2 shows saturable binding of DHE at increasing concentrations of liposomes that contain 30 mol% DHE. This is not obvious from this figure (no FRET values below 1 µM DHE, which is similar 2-6 µM); the experiments should be repeated with liposomes containing lower mol% of DHE in order to measure binding or use a fixed liposome concentration but with increasing mol% of DHE.</p><p>B) For the competition experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, competing lipids and sterols are dispersed in methanol in aqueous buffer, which is not an appropriate experimental approach since the lipids will not be dispersed homogenously (likely just insoluble aggregates of unknown structure) and it is unclear how much DHE binding occurs under these conditions. Competing ligands should be presented in liposomes with a defined composition of DHE.</p><p>2) AmB sensitivity of <italic>Lam</italic> mutant strains is inconsistent with the observation that sterol levels do not change in the plasma membranes of mutant cells and, hence, are not fully consistent with the proposed role of Lam proteins in sterol transport. Again, the reviewers appreciate that this is unlikely to be resolved here, so they suggest that you present the lipid analyses of plasma membrane fractions, which are stated, but the data are not shown, in the manuscript. Related, the text should emphasize that it is presently unclear if the Lam proteins regulate or themselves mediate sterol levels in organelle membranes.</p><p>The reviewers also make several other suggestions that I encourage you to take to heart when revising your manuscript. In particular, regarding information to include (labels) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, and the Discussion section, which they found to be confusing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07253.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) There is concern regarding the conclusion that Lam proteins mediate sterol exchange between the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum.

Compared to the previous estimate of Kd as 0.61 µM (SD ±0.25), we have now obtained a value of 0.53 µM (±0.11), where the increased accuracy derives from the inclusion of the additional concentrations. This experiment is now shown in panel 2C.</p><p><italic>B) For the competition experiments presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2D</italic></xref><italic>, competing lipids and sterols are dispersed in methanol in aqueous buffer, which is not an appropriate experimental approach since the lipids will not be dispersed homogenously (likely just insoluble aggregates of unknown structure) and it is unclear how much DHE binding occurs under these conditions. Competing ligands should be presented in liposomes with a defined composition of DHE</italic>.</p><p>There may well be a problem of phospholipids not competing ideally with sterols when together added in methanol, although we note that this can only be quantitative, not qualitative, since PLs bound well to E-Syt2 (in preference to sterol) using precisely this approach (Schauder et al., Nature 2014). For the major phospholipids (PC, PS, PI and PE) we note that there was no extraction of radiolabelled lipid by Lam4S2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. Here all of PC, PS, PI and PE were present and labelled to levels equal to (or above) that of cholesterol. For the revised text we have analyzed the phosphorimager file, finding that these lipids were virtually absent from the Lam4S2 lane (relative recovery ≤0.3% compared to cholesterol). This places a lower limit on the Kd of binding of these lipids of approximately 100 µM.</p><p>We consider that the problem of dispersal after addition in methanol does not apply when comparing one sterol with another, so the sterol competition data from the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> have been retained.</p><p><italic>2) AmB sensitivity of Lam mutant strains is inconsistent with the observation that sterol levels do not change in the plasma membranes of mutant cells and, hence, are not fully consistent with the proposed role of Lam proteins in sterol transport. Again, the reviewers appreciate that this is unlikely to be resolved here, so they suggest that you present the lipid analyses of plasma membrane fractions, which are stated, but the data are not shown, in the manuscript. Related, the text should emphasize that it is presently unclear if the Lam proteins regulate or themselves mediate sterol levels in organelle membranes</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the points raised by the reviewers, and we have followed their suggestions.</p><p>We have included a new supplement for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> with 3 panels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>):</p><p>A: ACAT activity in strains lacking Ysp1p, Ysp2p or Sip3p.</p><p>B: Overall amount of ergosterol in PM fractions enriched in these single delete strains.</p><p>C: Sterol partitioning into detergent-insoluble complexes in the same strains, an empirical indicator of lipid organization.</p><p>All three panels confirm the results stated (but not shown) in the first draft.</p><p>The final section of the Discussion has been re-written completely. It emphasizes the lack of mechanistic certainty, beginning: “An important point to make is that we have yet to establish whether the StART-like proteins Ysp1p, Ysp2p and Sip3p regulate changes in sterol levels in organelle membranes, with an indirect role on traffic, or if they themselves directly mediate sterol transfer.”</p><p>We have included a short section in the Discussion (new paragraph five) that addresses the lack of correlation between sterol levels/extractability mentioned by the reviewers. This includes a brief description of the genetics of AmB sensitivity, in relation to which we have carried out one additional experiment, which shows <italic>∆ysp1</italic>/<italic>∆ysp2</italic>/<italic>∆sip3</italic> strains are sensitive to natamycin, a third polyene (result described, not shown, in relation to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> in the subsection headed “Ysp1p, Ysp2p, Sip3p and Lam4p target punctate ER-PM membrane contacts”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
