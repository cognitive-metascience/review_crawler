To cope with stresses, a variety of mechanisms have evolved allowing cells to respond acutely and survive. These include changes in the gene expression program, which are often driven by robust transcriptional responses. Yet cells must also inactivate old mRNAs that may interfere with adaptation to the new condition, and therefore, post-transcriptional regulation and RNA turnover are critical to enable rapid changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mager and Ferreira, 1993</xref>).</p><p>The post-transcriptional fate of eukaryotic mRNAs is tightly linked to the complement of proteins that associate with it to form mRNPs (messenger ribonucleoproteins). For example, the presence of the m<sup>7</sup> G cap structure at the 5’ end is crucial for eIF4E binding, while Pab1 binds the 3’ poly-A tail, both of which protect the mRNA against degradation and promote translation initiation. On the other hand, mRNA turnover is thought to initiate via deadenylation by the Ccr4/Pop2/Not1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Muhlrad and Parker, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sheth and Parker, 2003</xref>), followed by cap removal by the decapping enzyme Dcp1/2 and 5’−3’ degradation of the transcript by the exonuclease Xrn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coller and Parker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Larimer and Stevens, 1990</xref>). Thus, the processes of mRNA translation and decay are coupled and act antagonistically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Radhakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beelman and Parker, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schwartz and Parker, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schwartz and Parker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2018</xref>)</p><p>The balance between mRNA translation and decay is not only temporally but also spatially controlled. For instance in yeast, upon glucose starvation, the majority of cellular translation halts and untranslated mRNA as well as many factors of the RNA decay machinery concentrate in large cytoplasmic mRNP granules, so called processing bodies [PBs] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brengues et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sheth and Parker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Teixeira et al., 2005</xref>). PBs contain major components of the 5’−3’ RNA decay pathway, for example Dcp1/2 and Xrn1, as well as activators of decapping - namely, the DEAD-box ATPase Dhh1, Pat1, Edc3 and the Lsm1-7 complex. PBs presumably form around mRNAs sequestered away from active translation, and in support of this, inhibition of translation initiation leads to induction of PBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franks and Lykke-Andersen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Teixeira et al., 2005</xref>). On the contrary, inhibition of translation elongation, for example by the drug cycloheximide which traps mRNA on ribosomes, and prevents their influx into PBs, has the opposite effect and leads to PB disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Teixeira et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mugler et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In consequence, PBs have been implicated in a variety of post-transcriptional processes such as translational repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holmes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>), mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sheth and Parker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cougot et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mugler et al., 2016</xref>), mRNA storage (Brengues et al., 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhattacharyya et al., 2006</xref>), and in higher eukaryotes, micro RNA-mediated repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pillai, 2005</xref>). PBs and related mRNP granules such as stress granules, P granules in germ cells, neuronal granules etc. form in a number of different species from yeast to mammals, and in a variety of cell types and biological contexts, suggesting that these structures are crucial for cellular function or survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Seydoux and Braun, 2006</xref>). Indeed, there is evidence that PBs can be essential for cell survival under stress. For instance, cells unable to form PBs show a drastic loss in viability in stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ramachandran et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shah et al., 2013</xref>). However, the precise role of PBs in the regulation of gene expression is a matter of debate and in order to understand PB function it is critical to examine how PBs assemble and are regulated.</p><p>Numerous recent studies have shown that PBs are dynamic, membraneless organelles that assemble from a variety of multivalent but weak RNA-protein, protein–protein and RNA-RNA interactions; a phenomenon called liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS). The resulting granules are liquid-like, spherical, dynamic and are dissolved by the alcohol 1,6-hexanediol, all key features of LLPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Decker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fromm et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fromm et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guo and Shorter, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mugler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kroschwald et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Although PB formation occurs via a plethora of multivalent protein–RNA interactions in a redundant fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rao and Parker, 2017</xref>), there are key players whose deletion drastically attenuates PB assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Decker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pilkington and Parker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Scheller et al., 2007</xref>). One such component is the highly abundant DEAD-box ATPase Dhh1 (DDX6 in humans). Dhh1 is an enhancer of decapping and is involved in the translational repression of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carroll et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fischer and Weis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coller et al., 2001</xref>). We recently showed that Dhh1 undergoes phase separation <italic>in vitro</italic>, and controls PB dynamics <italic>in vivo</italic> via its RNA-stimulated ATPase activity whereas the ATPase activator Not1 dissolves Dhh1 droplets <italic>in vitro</italic> and inhibits PB formation <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, whether additional factors assist Dhh1 in promoting PB formation remains to be determined and is the focus of this study.</p><p>One such candidate is the eukaryotic PB component Pat1, an evolutionarily conserved multi-domain RNA binding protein that, like Dhh1, functions in both translational repression and mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pilkington and Parker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Teixeira and Parker, 2007</xref>). In yeast, Pat1 acts as a scaffold that brings together repression and decay factors (Dhh1, Edc3, Lsm1-7, Dcp1/2 etc.) via direct and/or indirect interactions with mRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nissan et al., 2010</xref>). Dhh1 for example directly binds acidic residues in the N-terminal domain of Pat1, an interaction that is conserved across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sharif et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ozgur and Stoecklin, 2013</xref>). Deletion of <italic>PAT1</italic> in yeast alters the localization of PB components, whereas its overexpression induces the formation of constitutive PBs even in unstressed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pilkington and Parker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, it was shown that phosphorylation of Pat1 by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) inhibits PB formation, and cells expressing a phospho-mimetic mutant of Pat1 are defective in PB assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ramachandran et al., 2011</xref>). However, the mechanism by which Pat1 regulates PB assembly is unclear.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that Pat1 promotes PB formation via Dhh1, and we show that the interaction between Pat1 and Dhh1 is critical for robust PB assembly <italic>in vivo</italic>. Using a liquid phase separation assay, we can recapitulate this function of Pat1 <italic>in vitro</italic> as addition of recombinant Pat1, but not of a Pat1 variant that cannot bind Dhh1, enhances phase separation of Dhh1 and RNA. Overall, our <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> data suggests that during stress Pat1 antagonizes the inhibitory effect of Not1 on PB assembly and promotes the multimerization of Dhh1 on mRNA, leading to the formation of PBs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Constitutive PB formation upon Pat1 overexpression is Dhh1 dependent</title><p>The PB components Pat1 and Dhh1 were each previously shown to be required for PB formation in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pilkington and Parker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ramachandran et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mugler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rao and Parker, 2017</xref>). To understand the relationship between Pat1 and Dhh1 in the regulation of PB assembly, we took advantage of the observation that overexpression of Pat1 leads to constitutive PB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>). This allowed us to characterize their respective regulatory contributions without external influences such as nutrient starvation signals. As expected, Pat1 overexpression from its endogenous locus using the galactose promoter in the presence of Dhh1 led to the formation of constitutive PBs, as visualized by co-localization of Dhh1-GFP and Dcp2-mCherry foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). No foci were formed when Pat1 was not overexpressed or when we overexpressed the human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Notably, when Pat1 was overexpressed in cells that lack Dhh1, a drastic reduction in the number of PBs was observed, as visualized by the <italic>bona fide</italic> PB marker Edc3-GFP and its co-localization with Dcp2-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). This demonstrates that formation of constitutive PBs upon Pat1 overexpression requires Dhh1.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41415.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Constitutive PB formation upon Pat1 overexpression is Dhh1 dependent. </title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overexpression (OE) of Pat1 leads to constitutive PB formation but only in the presence of Dhh1. Cells co-expressing the indicated PB components were grown in synthetic complete (SC) raffinose media to exponential growth phase after which Pat1 was overexpressed via addition of galactose.

Since the strong DETF binding site in Pat1-N might mask any weaker interaction in Pat1-C, we also tested for direct binding of Pat1-C to Dhh1 but were unable to detect any interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), indicating that the DETF-motif in Pat1-N provides the major interaction surface for Dhh1.</p><p>Pat1-C was previously shown to bind RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pilkington and Parker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chowdhury et al., 2014</xref>).

Second, the activity of cAMP-dependent PKA negatively regulates PB assembly in nutrient-rich conditions, at least in part through phosphorylation of Pat1. However, since expression of non-phosphorylatable Pat1<sup>AA</sup> at endogenous levels (in contrast to overexpression) is not sufficient to induce PBs, Pat1 availability appears to be limiting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ramachandran et al., 2011</xref>).

It is of note that Not1 itself might also be subject to post-translational regulation, in response to metabolic state and/or cell cycle stages of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mugler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braun et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In this model, a tug-of-war between Pat1 and Not1 regulates PB assembly and disassembly: whereas a tight Pat1-Dhh1 interaction in the presence of RNA clients, promotes PB formation, Not1, induces PB turnover via stimulating the ATPase activity of the DEAD box ATPase Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Remarkably, our <italic>in vivo</italic> findings are corroborated <italic>in vitro</italic> wherein, Pat1 enhances the LLPS of Dhh1 and RNA, a step critical for the assembly of large mRNP granules, and by contrast, Not1 reverses the LLPS of Pat1-Dhh1-RNA droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7C</xref>).

The benefit of these modes of PB formation are that they bypass the characteristic stresses associated with PB formation, such as nutrient starvation, that might have more widespread and confounding effects on translation, mRNA degradation, or on the regulation of other PB components.</p><p>Our experiments reveal that Pat1 functions in PB formation through Dhh1 since PB induction by Pat1 overexpression is strictly dependent on the presence of Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, a mutant in the DETF motif in the N-terminus of Pat1 mediating direct binding to Dhh1 (Pat1<sup>4A-Dhh1</sup> variant) and mutants of Dhh1 that abolish Pat1 binding fail to promote PB assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These results were further confirmed using the drug hippuristanol that inhibits translation initiation wherein PBs were induced in wild-type cells but not in cells expressing the Pat1<sup>4A-Dhh1</sup> mutant, and the Dhh1 mutants that abolish Pat1 binding (Dhh1<sup>R295D</sup> and Dhh1 <sup>S292DN294D</sup>) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2018</xref>]. This suggests that high mRNA load alone is inadequate for PB formation and that a direct physical interaction between Pat1 and Dhh1 is obligatory as well. Since the DETF motif in Pat1 is conserved across evolution and was suggested to regulate PB assembly in human cells as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sharif et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ozgur and Stoecklin, 2013</xref>), the Pat1-Dhh1 interaction likely plays a critical role in PB formation across species.</p><p>Our results seem to be at odds with a previous publication, which suggests that Pat1 acts independently of Dhh1 to promote PB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>). However, in this study Pat1 was overexpressed from a plasmid, in the presence of the endogenous copy. When recapitulating these conditions, we observed that PB components mislocalize to the nucleus [observed by DAPI and a nuclear rim marker, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>] and it is possible that in the absence of additional organelle markers, this nuclear accumulation was misinterpreted as PB formation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Pat1 enhances the LLPS of Dhh1, thereby promoting PB formation</title><p>How does Pat1 enhance PB formation? One hypothesis is that Pat1 directly counteracts the Not1-stimulated ATPase activation of Dhh1, but we do not favor such a model since i) Pat1 does not inhibit Dhh1's ATPase activity at physiological protein ratios <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), ii) Not1<sup>MIF4G</sup> dissolves Pat1-Dhh1 condensates, while droplets formed from catalytic-dead Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> are Not1-resistant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mugler et al., 2016</xref>), and iii) <italic>in vivo</italic>, PBs formed upon Pat1 overexpression are much more dynamic than those formed from Dhh1<sup>DQAD</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Instead, our data are consistent with a model in which Pat1 promotes PB assembly by directly enhancing the LLPS of Dhh1. DDX6, the human homolog of Dhh1 can oligomerize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ernoult-Lange et al., 2012</xref>), and given the fact that both DDX6 and Dhh1 are found in molar excess over mRNA, we propose that Pat1 functions as a scaffold, providing additional multivalent interactions with Dhh1 and RNA, thereby aiding in the fusion of Dhh1 LLPS droplets and promoting assembly of microscopically-detectable mRNP condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Interestingly, both functional binding to Dhh1 in Pat1-N and RNA-binding in Pat1-C are required for this mechanism as individually mutations in each of the domains alter PB assembly <italic>in vivo</italic> and fail to enhance Dhh1’s phase separation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Rather, Pat1-N alone diminishes the extent of LLPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). It is interesting to note that Pat1-N was previously shown to interfere with the ability of Dhh1 to interact with RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sharif et al., 2013</xref>) and we thus speculate that Pat1-N might outcompete RNA from Dhh1, and in the absence of the C-terminal Pat1 RNA-binding site destabilize droplets. This might explain why RNA-binding by Pat1’s C-terminus that is under the regulation of PKA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) is critical for LLPS and PB assembly. <italic>In vivo</italic>, we find that the Pat1<sup>4A-Dhh1</sup> (Dhh1 binding mutant) and Pat1<sup>EE</sup> (phospho-mimetic mutant) not only have a drastically reduced number of PBs, but also much lower intensity (reduced by 7 and 8 fold respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C</xref>) compared to Pat1 wild-type PBs.</p><p>Our recent findings also show that the un-structured poly-Q rich C-terminal tail of Dhh1 is required for PB formation <italic>in vivo</italic> and Dhh1 LLPS <italic>in vitro</italic> (Hondele et al., <italic>submitted</italic>). Thus, Pat1 might potentially enhance Dhh1 multimerization via the low complexity tails of Dhh1. Structural studies will now be needed to clarify how Pat1 facilitates oligomerization and PB formation of the Dhh1-Pat1- RNA complex.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The emerging importance of LLPS in diverse aspects of cell biology and the power of <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution systems</title><p>As non-membrane bound organelles, it is of interest to understand how cells assemble large RNP granules and regulate their dynamics. PBs are prominent membraneless cellular compartments, which have been shown to be not only involved in numerous aspects of mRNA turnover, but also crucial for survival under various cellular stresses. With an <italic>in vitro</italic> phase separation tool in hand that faithfully reconstitutes certain aspects of PB formation, we are now in a position to dissect how PBs form and characterize their biophysical behavior. This will aid us not only in elucidating key components of PB formation, but also help us elucidate the function of PBs in regulating mRNA turnover.</p><p>At this stage, our <italic>in vitro</italic> systems are limited to Dhh1, Pat1, Not1 and RNA and for the sake of simplicity; we present a model only depicting the role of Pat1 and Dhh1 in PB formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). However, it is important to note that several additional PB components have been characterized. For example, this includes Ecd3, members of the Lsm1-7 complex, or Dcp2 that play crucial roles either alone or together with Pat1 and Dhh1 in PB assembly. Both Edc3 and Lsm4 contain low complexity-domains that were shown to be critical for PB formation <italic>in vivo</italic>, and it was recently demonstrated a threshold concentration of low-complexity domain containing proteins is required for robust PB assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Protter et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, it was previously shown that both Pat1 (C-terminus) and the Lsm1-7 complex individually have low RNA binding ability but a reconstituted Lsm1-7-Pat1-C complex displays an enhanced ability to bind RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chowdhury et al., 2014</xref>). This might suggest that <italic>in vivo</italic> the Pat1-C- terminus functions together with the Lsm1-7 complex to bind RNA and enhance PB formation. Furthermore, it cannot be excluded that direct binding of Dcp2 to the C-terminus of Pat1 also regulates PB assembly and RNA turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fourati et al., 2014</xref>). It will thus be critical to examine additional PB components in future experiments and to evaluate how they function together with Pat1 and Dhh1 in order to understand the complex interplay of various inputs that regulate PB assembly and dynamics. Nonetheless, based on our data and the aforementioned literature evidence, we propose that Pat1 provides a central PB scaffold and participates in an intricate network of protein–protein and protein-RNA interactions that promote PB assembly and influence RNA turnover rates <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The physical basis of LLPS has attracted a great deal of attention recently, at least in part because of the critical role that proper mRNP assembly plays in pathological neurodegenerative diseases and stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ramaswami et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberti and Hyman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Patel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguzzi and Altmeyer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>). An important challenge is to understand how these granules are kept dynamic and functional under some conditions whereas the formation of solidified and aberrant aggregates are triggered under others. Robust <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution systems that can recapitulate mRNP granule assembly, dynamics and stoichiometry will be invaluable in addressing these research questions and increase

The size distributions were obtained by analyzing the images obtained by fluorescence microscopy with an in-house code written in Matlab.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>GST pull-down assays</title><p>25 µl of 100 µM recombinant purified GST Pat1-NC was bound to 30 µl GST-slurry (Sigma), and one aliquot of GST-beads was included without added Pat1-NC as negative control. Reactions were incubated for 30mins rotating at 4°C and washed 4-times with wash buffer (300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.05 % NP40). 4 µl 250 µM Dhh1 was added in 500 µl wash buffer and incubated rotating at 4°C for 1 hr. Reactions were washed 5-times, proteins eluted by boiling with 4x SDS loading buffer and separated on a 12% acrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie. For V5-pulldown assays, the bait (15 µl 100 µM Pat1-C construct) was bound to 15 ml V5-slurry (Sigma), the bait 3 µl 200 µM Dhh1-mCherry, and incubation/wash buffers as above with salt concentration as indicated in the blot. Final washes were only performed three times.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Native PAGE</title><p>Proteins were diluted to 20 µM. 0, 2 or 4 µl of protein solution was filled to 4 µl with storage buffer (200 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 2 mM DTT). Proteins were mixed with a master mix containing per reaction 2 µl 10x ATPase buffer (300 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl, 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>), 0.3 µl Cy5-labeled <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed RNA oligo (29nt, 1.1 µg/µl), 2 µl 2.5M NaCl, 13.7 µl H<sub>2</sub>O and 3 µl 60% glycerol.

Growth curves were acquired using CLARIOstar automated plate reader (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany) at 30°C in 24-well plastic dishes (Thermo Fisher) from overnight pre-cultures diluted 1:125 in the specified synthetic liquid media. For spotting assays on plates the indicated strains were grown overnight at 25°C to saturation. Next day equal number of ODs for each strain was spotted (with a 1:10 series dilution) on YPD plates and incubated at 25°C, 30°C and 37°C for 2–3 overnights.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Western blotting</title><p>For Western blot analysis, roughly 5 OD<sub>600</sub> units of log growing cells were harvested and treated with 0.1M NaOH for 15 mins at room temperature. The samples were vortexed in between and finally centrifuged to remove the NaOH. SDS sample buffer was added and homogenates were boiled. Proteins were resolved by 4–12% Bolt Bis-Tris SDS PAGE (Thermo Fischer, Waltham, MA), then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (GE Life Sciences, Marlborough, MA). Membranes were blocked in PBS with 5% non-fat milk, followed by incubation with primary antibody overnight. Membranes were washed four times with PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBS-T) and incubated with secondary antibody for 45 min. Membranes were imaged and protein bands quantified using an infrared imaging system (Odyssey; LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). The following primary antibodies were used for detection of tagged proteins at the indicated dilutions: rabbit-anti-Dhh1 (1:5000) as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fischer and Weis, 2002</xref>), (Weis Lab ETH Zurich Cat# Weis_001, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2629458">AB_2629458</ext-link>), mouse-anti-GFP (1:1000) (Roche Cat# 11814460001, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_390913">AB_390913</ext-link>), and rabbit-anti-Hxk1 (1:3000) (US Biological Cat# H2035-01, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2629457">AB_2629457</ext-link>, Salem, MA).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Alan Hinnebusch as the Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Martine A Collart.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work the authors address the role of an activator of mRNA decapping called Pat1 in the formation and disassembly of P-bodies (PB) in budding yeast. Using both <italic>in vivo</italic> analyses and <italic>in vitro</italic> assays the authors conclude that Pat1 promotes PB formation by interaction with the Dhh1 ATPase, another decapping activator and functions in opposition to Not1, which instead reverses Dhh1-RNA condensation.</p><p>The authors show that overexpression of Pat1 leads to PB formation, identify a minimal Pat1 derivative that is sufficient for this and enables PB formation upon glucose depletion, and show that this minimal derivative interacts with Dhh1. They use mutants that disrupt interaction with Dhh1 to determine that the interaction is necessary for PB formation in response to glucose or inhibition of translation initiation. They also provide evidence that phosphorylation of Pat1 regulates its contribution to PB formation, and ability to interact directly with RNA, but not its interaction with Dhh1, by using non-phosphorylatable or phosphomimetic mutants of the phosphorylation site. They further show that the role of Pat1 is not to antagonize the activation of Dhh1 ATPase activity by Not1. They use an <italic>in vitro</italic> system to follow LLPS with Dhh1-mCherry and can recapitulate <italic>in vitro</italic> the positive impact of Pat1 on LLPS formation, and provide evidence using different Pat1 variants that its interactions with Dhh1 and RNA are both important for stimulating LLPS formation. Finally, they determine that the stoichiometry of Pat1 relative to Dhh1 in the LLPS <italic>in vitro</italic> is similar to that in PBs <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>This work is well performed with solid controls and clear results. It is an important study not only because it defines a direct role for an additional factor, Pat1, in the formation of PBs, and how it interplays with the other factors that regulate PB formation and disassembly, but also because it consolidates the ability of the <italic>in vitro</italic> system set up by the Weiss laboratory to study the dynamics of these bodies that play important roles in the regulation of gene expression. Nevertheless, there are a number of issues that require additional experimental data or revisions of text.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>- It would useful to verify that the Pat1<sup>4A-Dhh1</sup> and Pat1<sup>EE</sup> variants are well expressed in cells to bolster the argument that these mutations primarily impair Pat1 function; although it is realized that failure to interact with Dhh1 or RNA might reduce the stability of these variants.</p><p>- It would be useful to extend the complementation analysis of the internally truncated PAT1-NC allele to a <italic>pat1</italic> mutant also lacking one or both of the EDC3 or SCD6 genes in order to provide a more rigorous test of its functionality <italic>in vivo</italic> compared to WT PAT1.</p><p>- It would be useful to demonstrate that a mutation in DHH1 that specifically impairs interaction with Pat1 (assuming one exists and has been rigorously shown to have this specific defect) also impairs PB formation to rule out the possibility that the Pat1<sup>4A-Dhh1</sup> substitution impairs Pat1 binding to some other factor with a role in PB formation besides Dhh1.</p><p>- The model in Figure 6C is being questioned in that it lacks the LSm1-7 complex, whereas much of the available evidence indicates that Pat1 acts in the context of a Pat1/LSm complex to regulate mRNA turnover and translation in cells. In particular, there are data indicating that the presence of both Pat1 and Lsm proteins are required for efficient RNA association (RNA. 2014 Sep; 20(9): 1465-1475). To strengthen their model, it would be useful to show that a mutation in Pat1 that specifically impairs its RNA binding activity would reduce LLPS droplet assembly <italic>in vitro</italic>. While the Pat1<sup>EE</sup> variant shows reduced RNA binding <italic>in vitro</italic> and also is defective for LLPS formation, it is unclear that this mutation specifically impairs LLPS formation by reducing RNA binding. It would strengthen their model if they could show that a mutation in the Pat1 C-domain that impairs RNA binding would also impair LLPS droplet formation. If such a Pat1 mutant has not been described in the literature then they could at least show that LLPS assembly is dependent on RNA and that single-stranded DNA will not suffice, to provide additional evidence that RNA is specifically required for LLPS assembly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41415.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>- It would useful to verify that the Pat1<sup>4A-Dhh1</sup> and Pat1<sup>EE</sup> variants are well expressed in cells to bolster the argument that these mutations primarily impair Pat1 function; although it is realized that failure to interact with Dhh1 or RNA might reduce the stability of these variants.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have measured the expression level of the different Pat1 mutants used in this study and compared it to the expression level of wild-type Pat1 via Western blotting (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Both the Pat1<sup>4A-Dhh1</sup> (Dhh1-binding mutant) and Pat1<sup>EE</sup> (phospho-mimetic mutant) expressed as well as, if not better than wild-type Pat1 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C). Moreover, we also checked the expression level of Dhh1 in the background of different Pat1 mutant cells compared to wild-type Pat1. Our data reveal that also Dhh1 is expressed to comparable levels in the different Pat1 backgrounds (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- It would be useful to extend the complementation analysis of the internally truncated PAT1-NC allele to a pat1 mutant also lacking one or both of the EDC3 or SCD6 genes in order to provide a more rigorous test of its functionality <italic>in vivo</italic> compared to WT PAT1.</p></disp-quote><p>To further extend the analysis of the truncated Pat1 construct (Pat1-NC) and demonstrate its functionality <italic>in vivo</italic> we have assessed as requested its growth phenotype in different sensitized backgrounds under various temperatures. A <italic>pat1</italic> null mutant was shown to have a growth defect at a temperature of 37°C (Fourati et al., 2014) and Charenton et al., 2017 showed that a deletion of <italic>PAT1</italic> in an <italic>edc3Δ scd6Δ</italic> background also leads to a thermosensitive growth defect. We therefore employed these strains to test if the Pat1-NC construct is able to functionally replace wild-type Pat1. For this, we endogenously expressed Pat1-NC from its locus in <italic>edc3Δ scd6Δ</italic> cells and compared the growth phenotype to that of <italic>edc3Δ scd6Δ</italic> and <italic>pat1Δ edc3Δ scd6Δ</italic> cells at different temperatures. The Pat1-NC construct was able to rescue the growth phenotype of <italic>pat1Δ edc3Δ scd6Δ</italic> cells at the thermosensitive temperaturecomparable to wild-type, full-length Pat1 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D).Overall, this demonstrates that the Pat1-NC construct is functional <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, we also show that the Pat1-NC construct rescues the growth defect of <italic>pat1</italic> null mutant cells at 37°C (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C).These new results together with the robust PB induction observed in Pat1-NC expressing cells (Figure 1C, D, E, F and Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, C) further bolster our conclusions that the Pat1-NC truncated construct behaves similar to wild-type Pat1 <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- It would be useful to demonstrate that a mutation in DHH1 that specifically impairs interaction with Pat1 (assuming one exists and has been rigorously shown to have this specific defect) also impairs PB formation to rule out the possibility that the Pat1<sup>4A-Dhh1</sup> substitution impairs Pat1 binding to some other factor with a role in PB formation besides Dhh1.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for this suggestion and have now added the analysis of PB formation in cells expressing mutants of Dhh1 that abolish binding to Pat1 (complementing our prior analysis with a Dhh1 binding mutant in Pat1 (Pat1<sup>4A-Dhh1</sup>). Sharif et al., 2013 previously defined -using structural data and binding studies- two patches on Dhh1, which when mutated block Pat1 binding. Dhh1-Mut-3A (Dhh1<sup>S292DN294D</sup>) weakens Dhh1-Pat1 binding whereas Dhh1-Mut-3B (Dhh1<sup>R295D</sup>) completely abolishes binding to Pat1.</p><p>Our data reveal that yeast cells expressing Dhh1<sup>S292DN294D</sup> or Dhh1<sup>R295D</sup> show defects in PB formation when compared to wild-type cells both in carbon starvation stress and upon hippuristanol treatment (Figure 3 and Videos 3, 4, 5). Remarkably, the Dhh1<sup>R295D</sup> mutant that <italic>in vitro</italic> completely blocks Pat1 binding shows a more severe defect in PB formation in comparison to the partial Pat1 binder Dhh1<sup>S292DN294D</sup>(Figure 3). Both Dhh1<sup>R295D</sup> and Dhh1<sup>S292DN294D</sup> mutants expressed as well as wild-type Dhh1 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Taken together these new data strengthen our conclusion that a robust and direct interaction between Pat1 and Dhh1 is a key driver for PB formation in cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The model in Figure 6C is being questioned in that it lacks the LSm1-7 complex, whereas much of the available evidence indicates that Pat1 acts in the context of a Pat1/LSm complex to regulate mRNA turnover and translation in cells.

While the Pat1<sup>EE</sup> variant shows reduced RNA binding <italic>in vitro</italic> and also is defective for LLPS formation, it is unclear that this mutation specifically impairs LLPS formation by reducing RNA binding. It would strengthen their model if they could show that a mutation in the Pat1 C-domain that impairs RNA binding would also impair LLPS droplet formation. If such a Pat1 mutant has not been described in the literature then they could at least show that LLPS assembly is dependent on RNA and that single-stranded DNA will not suffice, to provide additional evidence that RNA is specifically required for LLPS assembly.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have now added new experiments to test the role of RNA in the <italic>in vitro</italic> liquid-liquid phase separation assay. Unfortunately, to our knowledge there is no Pat1 mutant described in the literature that has been shown to abolish its binding to RNA. We therefore tested the RNA-dependence of the Pat1-mediated enhancement of the phase separation of Dhh1. As shown before, in the absence of RNA (with ATP) no Dhh1 droplets are observed in our assay conditions [Mugler et al., 2016]. When increasing concentrations of Pat1 were added, we did not observe phase separation of either Dhh1 or Pat1 in the absence of RNA(Figure 6—figure supplement 2B) suggesting that the enhancement of phase separation of Dhh1 upon addition of Pat1 is strictly RNA-dependent. In order to further evaluate the critical role of RNA we also tested only the N-terminus of Pat1 lacking the C-terminal RNA-binding domain in the <italic>in vitro</italic> phase separation assay. Addition of increasing concentrations of Pat1-N to Dhh1 in the presence of RNA and ATP did not stimulate the phase separation of Dhh1 (Figure 6—figure supplement 2C) thus demonstrating that both the N and the C-terminus of Pat1 are essential to promote condensation and oligomerization of Dhh1 into liquid droplets. This suggests that the N-terminus of Pat1 binds Dhh1 directly and the C-terminus of Pat1 functions via RNA binding to promote higher order droplet formation.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion to try the liquid-liquid phase separation assay also in the presence of ssDNA to further reveal the importance of RNA. However, we would like to point out that many DEAD-box ATPases are expected to bind to ssDNA via a phosphate-backbone interaction. For instance the DEAD-box ATPase Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) was shown to bind ssDNA (Peck and Herschlag, 1999). Tai et al., 1996 showed that a DEAD-box protein of the hepatitis C virus can unwind DNA duplexes and in particular, we would like to draw the attention to the study by Dutta et al., 2011 where the authors demonstrate that Dhh1 is able to interact with ssDNA. We therefore did not include a phase separation assay with ssDNA, and we believe that the experiments described in Figure 6—figure supplement 2B, C serve as a better control.</p></body></sub-article></article>
