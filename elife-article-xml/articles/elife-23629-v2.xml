To decipher ribosome kinetics at stall sites, we induced ribosome stalling at specific codons by starving the bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> for the cognate amino acid. We measured protein synthesis rates from a reporter library of over 100 variants that encoded systematic perturbations of translation initiation rate, the number of stall sites, and the distance between stall sites. Our measurements are quantitatively inconsistent with two widely-used kinetic models for stalled ribosomes: ribosome traffic jams that block initiation, and abortive (premature) termination of stalled ribosomes. Rather, our measurements support a model in which collision with a trailing ribosome causes abortive termination of the stalled ribosome. In our computational analysis, ribosome collisions selectively stimulate abortive termination without fine-tuning of kinetic rate parameters at ribosome stall sites. We propose that ribosome collisions serve as a robust timer for translational quality control pathways to recognize stalled ribosomes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23629.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23629.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>ribosome stalling</kwd><kwd>kinetic modeling</kwd><kwd>premature termination</kwd><kwd>ribosome collisions</kwd><kwd>quality control</kwd><kwd>amino acid starvation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM119835</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferrin</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name><name><surname>Subramaniam</surname><given-names>Arvind R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005895</institution-id><institution>Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferrin</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name><name><surname>Subramaniam</surname><given-names>Arvind R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00 GM107113</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferrin</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name><name><surname>Subramaniam</surname><given-names>Arvind R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Collision between ribosomes can cause dissociation of stalled ribosomes from messenger RNAs during the process of mRNA translation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ribosomes move at an average speed of 3–20 codons per second during translation elongation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dalbow and Young, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonven and Gulløv, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yan et al., 2016</xref>). Since this rate is higher than the typical initiation rate of ribosomes on mRNAs [less than 1 s<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kennell and Riezman, 1977</xref>)], elongation is often assumed to not affect the expression level of most proteins. Nevertheless, the elongation rate of ribosomes can decrease significantly at specific locations on an mRNA due to low abundance of aminoacyl-tRNAs, inhibitory codon pairs or amino acid pairs, nascent peptides interacting strongly with the ribosome exit tunnel, or the presence of RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Richter and Coller, 2015</xref>). Ribosome profiling — the deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments — has enabled the identification of additional factors that induce slowing or stalling of ribosomes during elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ingolia, 2014</xref>). An important question emerging from these studies is the extent to which ribosome stalling affects the expression of the encoded protein, since initiation might still be the slowest step during translation.</p><p>Several mechanistic models have been proposed to explain how ribosome stalling during elongation might affect the expression of the encoded protein. In the widely used traffic jam model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">MacDonald et al., 1968</xref>), the duration of ribosome stalling is sufficiently long to induce a queue of trailing ribosomes extending to the start codon, thus decreasing the translation initiation rate. Evidence supporting this model has been found in the context of EF-P dependent polyproline stalls in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hersch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Woolstenhulme et al., 2015</xref>), and rare-codon induced pausing in <italic>E. coli</italic> and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mitarai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chu et al., 2014</xref>). In an alternate abortive termination model, ribosome stalling causes premature termination without synthesis of the full-length protein. This model is thought to underlie the action of various ribosome rescue factors in <italic>E. coli</italic> and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Subramaniam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choe et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, ribosome stalling can also affect protein expression indirectly by altering mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Presnyak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Radhakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>), co-translational protein folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chaney and Clark, 2015</xref>), or stress-response signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishimura et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Despite the experimental evidence supporting the above models, predicting the effect of ribosome stalling on protein levels has been challenging because of uncertainty in our knowledge of <italic>in vivo</italic> kinetic parameters such as the duration of ribosome stalling and the rate of abortive termination. Further, while we have a detailed understanding of the kinetic steps and structural changes that occur during the normal elongation cycle of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wintermeyer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Voorhees and Ramakrishnan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blanchard et al., 2004</xref>), the ‘off-pathway’ events that occur at stalled ribosomes have been elucidated in only a few specific cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neubauer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shao et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, development of complementary approaches, which can quantitatively constrain the <italic>in vivo</italic> kinetics of stalled ribosomes without precise knowledge of rate parameters, will be useful for bridging the gap between the growing list of ribosome stall sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ingolia, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Woolstenhulme et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gamble et al., 2016</xref>) and their effect on protein expression.</p><p>Here, we investigated the effect of ribosome stalling on protein expression using amino acid starvation in <italic>E. coli</italic> as an experimental model. In this system, we previously found that both ribosome traffic jams and abortive termination occur at a subset of codons cognate to the limiting amino acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Subramaniam et al., 2013</xref>). Motivated by these observations, here we computationally modeled ribosome traffic jams and abortive termination with the goal of predicting their effect on protein expression. Even without precise knowledge of <italic>in vivo</italic> kinetic parameters, we found that these two processes give qualitatively different trends in protein expression when the initiation rate, the number of stall sites, and the distance between stall sites are systematically varied. Surprisingly, experimental measurements support a model in which traffic jams and abortive termination do not occur independent of one another; rather, collisions by trailing ribosomes stimulate abortive termination of the stalled ribosome. We find that this model is consistent with the absence of long ribosome queues in ribosome profiling measurements, and it naturally provides a mechanistic basis for the selectivity of abortive termination towards stalled ribosomes. While these conclusions are limited to the specific context of amino acid starvation in <italic>E. coli</italic>, the integrated approach developed in this work should be generally applicable to investigate other ribosome stalls in both bacteria and eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Effect of ribosome stalling on measured protein level, mRNA level, and polysome occupancy</title><p>During starvation for single amino acids in <italic>E. coli</italic>, certain codons that are cognate to the limiting amino acid decrease protein expression, while the same codons have little or no effect during nutrient-rich growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Subramaniam et al., 2013</xref>). For example, synonymously mutating seven CTG leucine codons in the yellow fluorescent protein gene (<italic>yfp</italic>) to CTA, CTC, or CTT reduced the synthesis rate of YFP 10–100 fold during leucine starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Subramaniam et al., 2013</xref>). Genome-wide ribosome profiling showed that ribosomes stall at CTA, CTC, and CTT codons during leucine starvation, which leads to a traffic jam of trailing ribosomes and abortive termination of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Subramaniam et al., 2014</xref>). These observations led us to ask whether ribosome traffic jams and abortive termination can quantitatively account for the decrease in protein synthesis rate (number of full proteins produced per unit time) caused by ribosome stalling during leucine starvation in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>To measure the effect of ribosome stalling on protein synthesis during leucine starvation, we constructed fluorescent reporter genes which have a stall-inducing CTA codon at one or two different locations along <italic>yfp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, blue bars). We induced these reporter variants from very low copy vectors (SC*101 <italic>ori</italic>, 3–4 copies per cell) either during leucine starvation or during leucine-rich growth. While YFP expression was similar across all <italic>yfp</italic> variants during leucine-rich growth, a single CTA codon at two different locations reduced YFP expression during leucine starvation by 3–4 fold relative to a control <italic>yfp</italic> without CTA codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Introducing both CTA codons reduced YFP expression by ~6 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and a stretch of 7 CTA codons reduced YFP expression close to background level as observed in our earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Subramaniam et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, YFP expression can serve as a quantitative readout of the effect of ribosome stalling on protein synthesis.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23629.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effect of ribosome stalling on measured protein level, mRNA level, and polysome occupancy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of ribosome stalling reporters used in B–E.

We reasoned that ribosome traffic jams that reduce protein expression by blocking initiation should increase the number of ribosomes on an mRNA when the stall site is far from the initiation region. However, polysome fractionation of leucine-starved <italic>E. coli</italic> did not indicate an unambiguous shift of the <italic>yfp</italic> mRNA to higher polysome fractions when two stall-inducing CTA codons were introduced 475nt from the start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, top vs bottom panels). This observation agrees with previous ribosome density measurements that detected traffic jams of only 1–2 ribosomes behind stalled ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Subramaniam et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We detected truncated YFP fragments consistent with abortive termination at stall-inducing CTA codons during leucine starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Previous studies suggested that abortive termination of stalled ribosomes requires cleavage of mRNA near the stall site as an obligatory step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Keiler, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hayes and Sauer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ivanova et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether changes in mRNA levels could account for the 3–4 fold decrease in YFP expression caused by single CTA codons during leucine starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, we found that <italic>yfp</italic> mRNA levels, as measured by quantitative RT-PCR spanning the single CTA codons, did not decrease significantly during leucine starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Similarly, introducing two CTA codons resulted in &lt;2 fold decrease in <italic>yfp</italic> mRNA levels despite ~6 fold decrease in YFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E vs 1B</xref>). These observations are consistent with earlier measurements using ribosome profiling and Northern blotting that did not find evidence for significant mRNA cleavage or decay upon ribosome stalling at CTA codons during leucine starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Subramaniam et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Computational modeling of ribosome kinetics at stall sites</title><p>Since the above reporter-based experiments were qualitative and could miss subtle effects, we formulated an alternate approach using computational modeling to quantitatively test the role of ribosome traffic jams and abortive termination at stall sites during amino acid starvation in <italic>E. coli</italic>.

Once the aminoacyl-tRNA is accommodated, A-site empty ribosomes transition to the A-site occupied state <italic>ao</italic>. Ribosomes transition back from the A-site occupied state <italic>ao</italic> to the A-site empty state <italic>ae</italic> upon peptide-bond formation and translocation. Beyond the <italic>ae</italic> and <italic>ao</italic> states, we did not consider additional kinetic states in the normal elongation cycle of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wintermeyer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blanchard et al., 2004</xref>), since these states cannot be resolved using our measurements of protein synthesis rates during amino acid starvation. Ribosomes that have dissociated from mRNA, due to either normal termination at stop codons or abortive termination at stall sites, transition to the free state <italic>f</italic>. Finally, collision between a stalled ribosome with an empty A-site and a trailing ribosome with an occupied A-site transitions the stalled ribosome to the 5’ hit state <italic>5h</italic> and the trailing ribosome to the 3’ hit state <italic>3h</italic>.</p><p>To model ribosome traffic jams, we chose the rate constant for abortive termination of all elongating ribosomes to be zero. Hence if the duration of ribosome stalling is sufficiently long, a queue of trailing ribosomes forms behind the stalled ribosome and ultimately reduces protein synthesis rate by blocking the initiation region. We designate this as the traffic jam (TJ) model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, top).</p><p>To model abortive termination, we set the transition rate constant from stalled ribosomes to free ribosomes to be non-zero. Abortive termination occurs selectively at stalled ribosomes, and not at normally elongating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roche and Sauer, 1999</xref>). Even though the mechanistic basis for this selectivity is poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Janssen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miller and Buskirk, 2014</xref>), we can account for the selectivity in our modeling by simply setting the abortive termination rate to be zero at all codons except at the stall site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Subramaniam et al., 2014</xref>). We designate this as the simple abortive termination (SAT) model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, middle).</p><p>While abortive termination and traffic jams are usually considered as independent molecular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kurland, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson and Kurland, 1990</xref>), our definition of kinetic states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) suggests a more general model in which these processes are coupled. Specifically, we considered a model in which the rate of abortive termination is non-zero only when stalled ribosomes have undergone a collision with a trailing ribosome, i.e. when they are in the <italic>5h</italic> state. We designate this as the collision-stimulated abortive termination (CSAT) model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, bottom). As shown below, the CSAT model is closer to experimental measurements of protein synthesis rate than the TJ and SAT models, and it also suggests a mechanistic basis for the selectivity of abortive termination.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Experimental variables for distinguishing kinetic models of ribosome stalling</title><p>Predicting the effect of ribosome stalling on YFP expression in our three kinetic models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) requires knowledge of the elongation rate and the abortive termination rate of ribosomes at stall-inducing codons during amino acid starvation in <italic>E. coli</italic>. In principle, these rate constants can be estimated using the ribosome profiling method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Subramaniam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shah et al., 2013</xref>), but sequence-specific and protocol-related biases in ribosome profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Woolstenhulme et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mohammad et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lareau et al., 2014</xref>) will introduce a large uncertainty in this estimation. Therefore, we sought to identify experimental variables that would enable us to discriminate between the different kinetic models of ribosome stalling without precise knowledge of the underlying rate constants.</p><p>First, we examined the effect of varying the initiation rate of an mRNA with a single stall site in our three kinetic models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We used stochastic simulations to predict the protein synthesis rate from a <italic>yfp</italic> mRNA under this perturbation (Materials and methods). We chose the elongation and abortive termination rate constants at the stall site so that an mRNA with an initiation rate of 0.3 s<sup>-1</sup> — a typical value for <italic>E. coli</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kennell and Riezman, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Subramaniam et al., 2014</xref>) — had the same protein synthesis rate (number of full proteins produced per unit time) in all three models. In the SAT model, varying the initiation rate does not modulate the effect of the stall site on protein synthesis rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, blue squares). By contrast, in the TJ and CSAT models, the effect of the stall site on protein synthesis rate is reduced at lower initiation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, green circles and red diamonds). This reduction is more pronounced in the TJ model because, at low initiation rates, ribosome queues do not block the initiation region in the TJ model, while they still lead to collision-stimulated abortive termination in the CSAT model.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23629.004</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Distinct predictions from three kinetic models.</title><p>Predicted effect on protein synthesis rate upon varying the initiation rate (<bold>A</bold>), the number of ribosome stall sites (<bold>B</bold>), and the distance between two stall sites (<bold>C</bold>) of a <italic>yfp</italic> mRNA.

We chose the elongation rate and abortive termination rate constants at stall sites so that the effect of a single stall site on protein synthesis rate was identical between the three models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). With no further parameter adjustments, we introduced additional identical stall sites, with each stall site separated by at least two ribosome footprints (&gt;60 nt) from other stall sites. In the traffic jam (TJ) model, additional stall sites had very little effect on protein synthesis rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, green circles). In the simple abortive termination (SAT) model, protein synthesis rate decreased exponentially with the number of stall sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, blue squares). In the collision-stimulated abortive termination (CSAT) model, the effect of additional stall sites was intermediate between the TJ and SAT models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, red diamonds). The differential effect of multiple stall sites in the three models can be intuitively understood as follows: In the TJ model, extended queues of ribosomes occur only at the first stall site because the average rate at which ribosomes arrive at subsequent stall sites is limited by the rate at which they elongate past the first stall site. In the CSAT model, ribosome collisions occur at a greater rate at the first stall site, but are not completely prevented at subsequent stall sites due to stochastic ribosome elongation past the first stall site. In the SAT model, abortive termination rate at each stall site does not depend on the presence of other stall sites on the mRNA.</p><p>Finally, we considered the effect of varying the distance between two identical stall sites in our kinetic models. In the SAT model, varying the distance between two stall sites does not modulate the effect of the stall sites on protein synthesis rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, blue). In the CSAT model, when the two stall sites are separated by less than a ribosome footprint, then the frequency of collisions at the stall sites increases, thus resulting in the lower protein synthesis rate in this regime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, red). In the TJ model, the length of ribosome queues at the first stall site is modulated by the formation of shorter ribosome queues at the second stall site when it is within a few ribosome footprints. This interaction results in a lower protein synthesis rate when the stall sites are separated by a few ribosome footprints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, green).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Measured protein synthesis rates support a collision-stimulated abortive termination model</title><p>We tested the predictions from our kinetic models using <italic>yfp</italic> reporters with stall-inducing codons during starvation for single amino acids in <italic>E. coli</italic>.

Our integrated approach allowed us to infer the extent to which each of these three kinetic models quantitatively accounted for the measured protein synthesis rate from a library of <italic>yfp</italic> variants during starvation for single amino acids.</p><p>The TJ model has been considered theoretically in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">MacDonald et al., 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mitarai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 1994</xref>). While queues of ~7 ribosomes have been detected <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wolin and Walter, 1988</xref>), ribosome profiling studies have revealed a queue of only a few ribosomes at stall sites <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Woolstenhulme et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Subramaniam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guydosh and Green, 2014</xref>). These smaller queues can modulate protein expression only if the stall site is within a few ribosome footprints from the start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mitarai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liljenström and von Heijne, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tuller et al., 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, recent studies on EF-P dependent pauses in bacteria and rare-codon dependent pauses in yeast suggested that the TJ model underlies the decreased protein expression when stall sites are over 100 codons away from the start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hersch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chu et al., 2014</xref>). These conclusions were based on observations that decreasing initiation rate of ribosomes on reporters reduced the effect of stall sites on protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hersch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chu et al., 2014</xref>). This regulatory effect of initiation rate was also observed in our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, we find that both the TJ and CSAT models predict this regulatory effect of initiation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), while only the CSAT model predicts a queue of few ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) that is observed experimentally.

However, our modeling indicates that this non-selective mechanism of abortive termination will result in decreased protein expression from mRNAs that do not have stall sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, top panel). This observation can be intuitively understood from the fact that even a small probability of abortive termination during each elongation cycle will be exponentially amplified over the course of translating a typical <italic>E. coli</italic> protein with 300 amino acid residues.</p><p>Despite the better fit provided by the CSAT model to our measured YFP synthesis rates, there still remains a residual error in its prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). This error might arise from several simplifying assumptions in our definition of the CSAT model, which we made in order to emphasize its qualitative difference with the TJ and SAT models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). First, we assumed the rate of abortive termination to be zero in the absence of ribosome collisions. Relaxing this assumption is likely to provide a better fit to our measurements, but it will introduce an extra free parameter while not providing additional mechanistic insight into the kinetics of abortive termination. Second, we assumed the rate of abortive termination to be zero for the trailing ribosome in the collided state (<italic>3h</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), since there is no biochemical evidence for such a process. This assumption could be relaxed based on evidence from future biochemical studies of ribosome queues formed at stall sites. The inverse approach used in our work relied on model predictions that did not depend sensitively on underlying kinetic parameters such as the elongation rate and the abortive termination rate at stall sites. Hence, our work cannot be used to infer the exact values of these kinetic parameters <italic>in vivo</italic>. Finally, we studied the CSAT model solely in the context of ribosome stalls caused by amino acid starvation in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Hence, the validity of this model at ribosome stalls in exponentially growing bacterial cells remains to be tested.</p><p>Ribosome collisions during amino acid starvation could stimulate abortive termination through several mechanisms. Specifically, ribosome collisions could either stimulate spontaneous drop-off of stalled ribosomes, or they could stimulate the activity of quality control pathways such as the tmRNA and the ArfA systems that rescue stalled ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Keiler, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shoemaker and Green, 2012</xref>). In the latter case, ribosome collisions might allow the quality control pathway to selectively recognize ribosomes that have been stalled for an extended duration over ribosomes that are transiently stalled due to the stochasticity of normal elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miller and Buskirk, 2014</xref>). In this sense, the frequency of ribosome collisions can provide a natural timer for achieving selectivity of quality control pathways towards stalled ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shao and Hegde, 2016</xref>). Further, the robustness of the CSAT model to changes in the abortive termination rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, bottom panel) can buffer against cell-to-cell variation in the concentration of quality control factors that mediate abortive termination. Finally, ribosome collisions might also have a role in stimulating the activity of eukaryotic translational quality control pathways (C. Simms and H. Zaher, personal communication) such as No-Go mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doma and Parker, 2006</xref>), where the kinetic events leading to recognition of stalled ribosomes remain poorly defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shoemaker and Green, 2012</xref>). This general role for ribosome collisions in translational quality control could have arisen during evolution to minimize the idling of translation-competent ribosomes on mRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and plasmids</title><p>All leucine starvation experiments in this study were performed using an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Subramaniam et al., 2013</xref>) that is auxotrophic for leucine and contains the <italic>tet</italic> repressor gene for inducible control of reporter genes (ecMF1).

Each elongating ribosome was represented as an instance of the <italic>Ribosome</italic> class. The four distinct states of the elongating ribosome (<italic>ae</italic>, <italic>ao</italic>, <italic>5h</italic>, <italic>3h</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) were tracked using three <italic>bool</italic> properties of the <italic>Ribosome</italic> class: <italic>AsiteEmpty</italic>, <italic>hitFrom5Prime</italic>, and <italic>hitFrom3Prime</italic>.

Therefore we assumed that both the translation rate of native mRNAs, as well as the pool of free ribosomes and aminoacyl-tRNAs remain constant across all reporters used in this study. Hence, each simulation considered a minimal set of two mRNA molecules that both encoded YFP. The first mRNA molecule was a control <italic>yfp</italic> sequence without any CTA, CTC or CTT codon. The second mRNA molecule was the test <italic>yfp</italic> sequence with the CTA, CTC or CTT codon as specified for individual simulations. The simultaneous translation of the two mRNA molecules was simply to ensure that we used exactly the same set of parameters for our test and control reporters during simulation runs and subsequent analyses.</p><p>We simulated four different molecular processes during translation: initiation, elongation, aminoacylation and abortive termination.

The tRNA accommodation rate for all codons was calculated as the product of a pseudo first-order rate constant (2 × 10<sup>7</sup> ⁢M<sup>-1⁢</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>), the concentration of individual tRNAs, and a weight factor to account for codon-anticodon pairing strength. The concentration of tRNAs and the weight factors were based on measured concentration of <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 1996</xref>) and known wobble-pairing rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Subramaniam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shah et al., 2013</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Alan G Hinnebusch (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Yitzhak Pilpel (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study uses a combination of molecular biology and computational modeling to examine the mechanism of reduced translation of mRNA in response to prolonged pausing of elongating ribosomes evoked by particular leucine codons in bacterial cells starved for leucine. It seeks to distinguish between two leading models of simple abortive termination (SAT) versus a traffic jam (TJ) wherein the stalled ribosome sets up a queue of trailing ribosomes that extends to the start codon and inhibits initiation. The latter model has been favored because it can explain the finding that reducing the rate of initiation can mitigate the inhibitory effect of pausing; however, it is at odds with results of ribosome profiling in which long queues of stalled ribosomes have not been observed. The study begins by providing evidence at odds with the TJ model by showing that introducing stall-inducing codons at a large distance (&gt;400 nt) from the initiation codon of a YFP reporter evoked a large reduction in protein output, which is inconsistent with the limited queues of only 1-2 ribosomes (~20 codons) observed previously by ribosome profiling. They also found no significant increase in the average polysome size of the reporter mRNA that would expected from a long queue of trailing ribosomes; and they ruled out the possibility that the mRNA with stalled ribosomes was being degraded.</p><p>They then proceed to computational modeling to predict the effects of abortive termination vs. traffic jams on YFP synthesis rates in the presence of different numbers of stall sites, different spacing between two stall sites, and different initiation rates, revealing predicted synthesis rates that vary significantly among three different mechanisms modeled, including TJ (where the stalled and queuing ribosomes never terminate or dissociate from the mRNA; SAT (where only the stalled ribosome terminates and dissociates); and collision-stimulated abortive termination (CSAT, wherein termination of a stalled ribosome and dissociation occurs only on collision with the trailing elongating ribosome. The modeling predicts that increasing the initiation rate has no effect on YFP synthesis in the SAT model (where collisions by trailing ribosomes have no impact), but progressively reduces YFP synthesis in the TJ and CSAT models, where the effects of queuing ribosomes are paramount. The TJ and CSAT models also make predictions quite distinct from those of SAT when the number of stall sites increases, with SAT predicting much steeper and extensive declines, and the TJ and CSAT predictions differing in that additional stall sites have almost no impact for the TJ model. Increasing the distance between two stall sites is predicted to have no impact on YFP synthesis in the SAT model, to evoke a large step increase in synthesis in the CSAT models when the distance between stall sites is less than the ribosome footprint, and in the TJ model, YFP synthesis is predicted to exhibit a similar step increase followed by a gradual further increase that plateaus in the TJ model.</p><p>They went on to measure the effects on YFP reporter expression in response to altering the initiation rate with a single stall site, achieved by replacing the ATG start codon with near-cognates, or altering the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. They consistently observed the increased inhibitory effect with increasing initiation rate predicted by the TJ and CSAT models, and at odds with the SAT model, for various positions or sequences of a single stall site. Testing the effect of multiple stall sites in a variety of different configurations showed a better fit of the experimental data for the CSAT versus both the SAT and TJ models. The CSAT model also outperformed the other two models for the constructs where the distance between two stall sites was varied. They finish by presenting modeling results designed to show that the CSAT model out-performs the SAT model in explain in vivo observations of very low rates of premature termination from mRNAs lacking stall sites and the insensitivity of premature termination rates to overexpression of ribosome rescue factors; and the CSAT model outperforms the TJ model in explaining in vivo observations of very limited queuing of ribosomes upstream from stall sites.

To address the key comment of Rev. #2, it is necessary to repeat a subset of the experiments with a second set of reporters containing a different codon besides leucine to rule out the possibility of effects specific to leucine starvation. One possibility would be to repeat only the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> for a different amino acid. To address the key comment of Rev. #3, it is important to acknowledge that the CSAT mechanism might not apply to ribosome stalling imposed by different mechanisms operating in non-amino acid starved cells. Second, it is necessary to perform statistical analyses to determine whether the agreement of the experimental data with the CSAT model predictions is significantly better than that given by the SAT or TJ models. Third, you are asked to repeat the simulations to consider the more realistic situation where the reporter mRNAs with inserted Leu codons are being translated in the presence of a full complement of mRNAs and not merely a single control reporter mRNA lacking the Leu codon.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Summary of work:</p><p>This study uses a combination of molecular biology and computational modeling to examine the mechanism of reduced translation of mRNA in response to prolonged pausing of elongating ribosomes evoked by particular leucine codons in bacterial cells starved for leucine.

They do so by introducing synthetic stall site into a fluorescent reporter and by examining the effect of number of stall sites, distance between adjacent stall sites, and initiation rate. They examine three different models that can explain the reduced expression level due to ribosome stalling, two previously proposed models, and a new model which suggests that collision of ribosomes at stalling sites causes abortive termination of the stalled ribosome.</p><p>Using simulation, the authors predict the behavior of protein synthesis rate for mRNA with stalling sites, under different regimes, and then they measure the synthesis rate of 100 different variants which are aimed to test the predictions of the simulations. By comparing the simulation predictions and the measured synthesis rate, they demonstrate that the collision associated model best explain the reduction in protein synthesis rate due to ribosome stalling.</p><p>This is a very interesting paper. The three models are clearly motivated and the combination of simulations with experiments on synthetic genes is certainly a sound one. The conclusions are of importance and of potential interest to the community, the experiments and simulations are done with rigor. In principle this paper could be suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Yet, there are several points which we think that should be addressed before publication.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) The authors demonstrate the effect of ribosome stalling through a single stalling mechanism – &quot;slow&quot; codons of leucine under leucine starvation. It might be that the observations presented in this paper are through a different mechanism related specifically to leucine or to nucleotides in its codons, and not due to general ribosome stalling. We encourage the authors to test other means to stall ribosomes. One possibility can be starvation for a different amino acid. Perhaps easiest for the authors would be to examine their own synthetic genes from the PI's PNAS paper in which other yfp constructs for more amino acids were found to stall ribosomes upon starvation to additional amino acids.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript is immediately interesting because it proposes a new and reasonable hypothesis for how ribosomal stalling might reduce protein expression - by abortive termination of a stalled ribosome caused by collision with an upstream elongating ribosome. The study argues for this novel model using a combination of experiments with synthetic YFP constructs in <italic>E. coli</italic>, under leucine starvation, combined with stochastic simulations of three alternative models.</p><p>Overall, whether or not the conclusions are entirely general or even correct, I believe the paper is important because it raises a novel and quite reasonable hypothesis. However, I have three major concerns about the paper in its current form, which can presumably be addressed in revision:</p><p>1) The study conclusions are limited to conditions of amino-acid starvation, but the authors discuss their results as if they hold generally;</p><p>2) The comparison between empirical data and three alternative models of ribosome stalling/abortion is done purely by visual inspection, without any statistical inference at all;</p><p>3) Some aspects of the model simulations contradict the experiments performed.</p><p>I will elaborate on these concerns below. But I want to re-iterate from the start that I remain quite enthusiastic about the work, for its conceptual novelty and admirable combination of experiment and theory.</p><p>Concern 1) The entire study (experiments and models) addresses the effects of ribosome stalling on decreased synthesis under a condition of severe amino-acid starvation. This is a perfectly reasonable biological question in its own right. But the authors must explain in their Abstract, Introduction, and Discussion that their results are limited to conditions of starvation, and they have no reason or evidence to favor one model over another for the effects of stalling on synthesis in healthy cells (indeed there may be almost no effect of a few stall sites on rates of synthesis in healthy <italic>E. coli</italic> cells). This needs to be clarified throughout the text, especially in the Abstract.</p><p>Concern 2) The authors consider three physical models: traffic jams from pause site all the way back to start codon (TJ), simple abortive termination (SAT), and collision-stimulated abortive termination (CSAT). Each of these models makes predictions according to stochastic simulations, with several fitted parameters; and the predictions are compared to empirical data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The authors conclude that CSAT matches the data best, but they do not seem to make any attempt at a statistical inference - that is to ask whether there is sufficient evidence to reject either of the classical models in favor of CSAT. Needless to say, such a statistical inference is de rigor in modern biological research, and the authors must actually perform statistics to draw their conclusions. It is not clear from visual inspection alone that CSAT does best in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, eg, the data are sometimes closer to SAT in 4C, and the data are sometimes closer to SAT in 4B as well. The point is that visual inspection is not a sound scientific basis for comparing prediction to data. Hence the entire field of statistics.</p><p>Fortunately, because they have a stochastic model, the authors could easily compute the likelihood of the empirical data under each model, and perform standard statistical inferences (eg likelihood ratio tests for nested models, or AIC for non-nested models). They should do so. Note that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> only shows the average synthesis rate under the models - averaged over a period of time equivalent to production of 10,000 control YFPs; the variance within this ensemble of simulations would allow the authors to compute the actual likelihood of the empirical data, as opposed to simply plotting average predictions over the experimental observations.</p><p>On a related note: the authors should state clearly how many parameters are fit, for each of the three models, for each of the experimental conditions? Are the same number of parameters fit for each model? This is a critical question that must be answered, as it pertains strongly to model comparison and inference.</p><p>Concern 3) The simulations are unrealistic in several respects, and not directly comparable to the experiments (to which they are compared in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). After reading the Methods in detail it appears that, for each model, simulations were run with a single control yfp mRNA as well as a single yfp sequence containing some combination of CTA (or other stalling) codons. This does not make much sense to me. Presumably, in the experiments, the ypf constructs are over-expressed in the <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, leading to depletion of available (free) ribosomes as a result of sequestration on the heterologous transcripts. And yet the simulation only considers two mRNA molecules in isolation, without any of the other native <italic>E. coli</italic> mRNAs? This is unrealistic, and it excludes the possibility that stalling may cause reduced protein expression due to a reduction of the pool of free ribosomes - a possibility that the model, as implemented, does not even consider. The authors should either simulate a realistic mRNA pool of native and heterologous transcripts, or explain this deficiency of the model openly - that they are not accounting for feedback between ribosomes stalled on the over-expressed construct and the pool of free ribosomes.</p><p>Moreover, it appear that each simulation considered the simultaneously translation of one wildtype yfp mRNA molecule along with a single modified yfp mRNA that contains some CTA codons. But the experiments surely express either the control construct OR the modified construct in any given cell. Why then do the simulations involve simultaneous translation of both types of mRNAs? (This may not be a problem because the authors are simulating an unrealistically small number of mRNAs of each species, reducing the possibility for feedback via the common pool of free ribosomes; but it is not a realistic setup compared to the experiments and it can easily be re-done properly). Do the authors see any feedback - ie, does the amount of time required to produce 10,000 control YFP proteins in the simulations depend on the identity of the other yfp transcript in those simulations? If not, then why simulate both construct simultaneously? And if so, then this underscores my previous point, that the authors should be simulating a realistic full complement of all mRNAs in the cell, including native ones and the heterologous ones.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Kinetic modeling predicts a stimulatory role for ribosome collisions at elongation stall sites in bacteria&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

We ask that you attempt to conduct the requested analysis and provide the results in revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>I had three main concerns in my original review report:</p><p>1) Authors must state that conclusions are limited to stalling caused by aa starvation.</p><p>2) Authors must perform statistical comparison of three models (TJ, SAT, CSAT), not merely report mean square error.</p><p>3) Authors must perform simulations of the synthetic mRNAs in context of full complement of all other mRNAs (as opposed to in isolation).</p><p>The authors have addressed concern 1 through revised text. The authors do not perform the simulations suggested in concern 3, but argue that their transgenes are expressed at such low-levels that feedback on pool of available ribosomes is negligible. The authors offer additional experiments with integrated transgenes to support this. This is satisfying response. (Although it would still be better to perform the full simulations.)</p><p>With regard to point #2 (statistical comparison of models), the authors have not done much of anything in the way of new analysis, it seems. They do not provide any p-value to compare one model to another. They suggest that RMS is equivalent to reporting the Akaike Information Criterion. Even though all models being considered have the same number of parameters, they have not actually computed the likelihood under each model. The equivalence of AIC and RMS only occurs if the error distribution is the same under all models (eg all normal errors), but in fact the error distribution is surely not normal in these simulations. If the authors wish to use AIC for model comparison then they must actually compute the likelihood of the ML parameters under each model - which involves running an ensemble of simulations at each parameter to set to determine the likelihood of the data under that set of parameters. As it stands, the central claim comparing the TJ SAT and CSAT models rests on an entirely qualitative, non-statistical comparison.</p><p>Overall, the study makes a strong contribution. But I hesitate to offer acceptance until the data in support of the central claim have been analyzed statistically.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Kinetic modeling predicts a stimulatory role for ribosome collisions at elongation stall sites in bacteria&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

We wanted to give you one more chance to implement his/her suggestions before moving forward to publication, with the idea that you might be able to achieve a manuscript that would meet the most rigorous statistical standards. If you disagree with this reviewer's suggested approach, please provide us with a brief explanation for rejecting it and justifying the approach you have taken instead.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>My concern was that the authors did not provide statistical support in favor of one model versus another, given the data. There is a standard way to provide a statistical comparison of stochastic models - which I mentioned in my review, and which the authors have not addressed. What they should do is compute the most-likely parameters under each model, compute the actual likelihood of each model under the ML parameters, and then compare model fit using AIC. They have done nothing of the sort - indeed, they still fit the parameters by least squares (as opposed to maximum likelihood), and they never report the likelihood of the data under the inferred parameters, for any model.</p><p>In response to my critique they undertook extensive ensembles simulations of their models (with fixed parameters inferred by least squares) and they now compare the error distributions of the various models using AIC. Although this procedure seems correct, prima facie, it actually only makes sense if the parameters had been fit by maximum likelihood to begin with.</p><p>Overall, I think the paper should be published. The authors have made some attempt to provide statistical model comparison. Whatever deficiencies of this analysis remain, as long as the authors make their data available, anyone can analyze it and draw their own conclusions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23629.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>It is necessary to respond to requests for revisions of text and figures to make the paper easier to read and understand.</italic> </p><p>We have responded to these requests as explained below the specific points raised by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>To address the key comment of Rev. #2, it is necessary to repeat a subset of the experiments with a second set of reporters containing a different codon besides leucine to rule out the possibility of effects specific to leucine starvation.

It might be that the observations presented in this paper are through a different mechanism related specifically to leucine or to nucleotides in its codons, and not due to general ribosome stalling. We encourage the authors to test other means to stall ribosomes. One possibility can be starvation for a different amino acid. Perhaps easiest for the authors would be to examine their own synthetic genes from the PI's PNAS paper in which other yfp constructs for more amino acids were found to stall ribosomes upon starvation to additional amino acids.</italic> </p><p>We have addressed this concern as part of Essential revisions above.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>Concern 1) The entire study (experiments and models) addresses the effects of ribosome stalling on decreased synthesis under a condition of severe amino-acid starvation. This is a perfectly reasonable biological question in its own right. But the authors must explain in their Abstract, Introduction, and Discussion that their results are limited to conditions of starvation, and they have no reason or evidence to favor one model over another for the effects of stalling on synthesis in healthy cells (indeed there may be almost no effect of a few stall sites on rates of synthesis in healthy E. coli cells). This needs to be clarified throughout the text, especially in the Abstract.</italic> </p><p>We have addressed this concern as part of Essential revisions above.</p><p><italic>Concern 2) The authors consider three physical models: traffic jams from pause site all the way back to start codon (TJ), simple abortive termination (SAT), and collision-stimulated abortive termination (CSAT). Each of these models makes predictions according to stochastic simulations, with several fitted parameters; and the predictions are compared to empirical data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The authors conclude that CSAT matches the data best, but they do not seem to make any attempt at a statistical inference that is to ask whether there is sufficient evidence to reject either of the classical models in favor of CSAT. Needless to say, such a statistical inference is de rigor in modern biological research, and the authors must actually perform statistics to draw their conclusions. It is not clear from visual inspection alone that CSAT does best in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, eg, the data are sometimes closer to SAT in 4C, and the data are sometimes closer to SAT in 4B as well. The point is that visual inspection is not a sound scientific basis for comparing prediction to data. Hence the entire field of statistics.</italic> </p><p>We have addressed this concern as part of Essential revisions above.</p><p><italic>Fortunately, because they have a stochastic model, the authors could easily compute the likelihood of the empirical data under each model, and perform standard statistical inferences (eg likelihood ratio tests for nested models, or AIC for non-nested models). They should do so. Note that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> only shows the average synthesis rate under the models averaged over a period of time equivalent to production of 10,000 control YFPs; the variance within this ensemble of simulations would allow the authors to compute the actual likelihood of the empirical data, as opposed to simply plotting average predictions over the experimental observations.</italic> </p><p><italic>On a related note: the authors should state clearly how many parameters are fit, for each of the three models, for each of the experimental conditions? Are the same number of parameters fit for each model? This is a critical question that must be answered, as it pertains strongly to model comparison and inference.</italic> </p><p><italic>Concern 3) The simulations are unrealistic in several respects, and not directly comparable to the experiments (to which they are compared in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). After reading the Methods in detail it appears that, for each model, simulations were run with a single control yfp mRNA as well as a single yfp sequence containing some combination of CTA (or other stalling) codons. This does not make much sense to me. Presumably, in the experiments, the ypf constructs are over-expressed in the E. coli cells, leading to depletion of available (free) ribosomes as a result of sequestration on the heterologous transcripts. And yet the simulation only considers two mRNA molecules in isolation, without any of the other native E. coli mRNAs? This is unrealistic, and it excludes the possibility that stalling may cause reduced protein expression due to a reduction of the pool of free ribosomes -- a possibility that the model, as implemented, does not even consider. The authors should either simulate a realistic mRNA pool of native and heterologous transcripts, or explain this deficiency of the model openly -- that they are not accounting for feedback between ribosomes stalled on the over-expressed construct and the pool of free ribosomes.</italic> </p><p><italic>Moreover, it appear that each simulation considered the simultaneously translation of one wildtype yfp mRNA molecule along with a single modified yfp mRNA that contains some CTA codons. But the experiments surely express either the control construct OR the modified construct in any given cell. Why then do the simulations involve simultaneous translation of both types of mRNAs? (This may not be a problem because the authors are simulating an unrealistically small number of mRNAs of each species, reducing the possibility for feedback via the common pool of free ribosomes; but it is not a realistic setup compared to the experiments and it can easily be re-done properly). Do the authors see any feedback - ie, does the amount of time required to produce 10,000 control YFP proteins in the simulations depend on the identity of the other yfp transcript in those simulations? If not, then why simulate both construct simultaneously? And if so, then this underscores my previous point, that the authors should be simulating a realistic full complement of all mRNAs in the cell, including native ones and the heterologous ones.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer’s concern that reporter over-expression will complicate the interpretation of our experiments by depleting the pool of free ribosomes. To avoid this complication, we had performed all our experiments using a very low copy <italic>E. coli</italic> plasmid vector (<italic>SC*101 ori</italic>). To unambiguously demonstrate that our results are not affected by reporter over-expression, we have now chromosomally-integrated a subset of our wild-type and stall-containing <italic>yfp</italic> mRNAs used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> of our manuscript. As shown in Author-response <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">image 2</xref>, YFP genes in our plasmid vectors are expressed at ~4-fold the level of the same gene present on the chromosome. As seen in Author-response <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">image 3</xref>, the reduction in YFP expression caused by ribosome stalling during leucine starvation is essentially identical between our plasmid-borne and chromosomally integrated reporters, confirming that the copy number of our reporters does not influence our measurements.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23629.020</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of measured YFP levels when expressed from chromo- some and plasmid during Leu-rich growth</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23629.020">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23629.020</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-23629-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23629.021</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Comparison of measured YFP levels when expressed from chromo- some and plasmid during Leu starvation</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23629.021">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23629.021</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-23629-resp-fig3-v2"/></fig></p><p>We wish to highlight that our work includes a whole cell simulation of all native mRNAs that we had used for inferring the steady-state fraction of charged tRNAs during leucine starvation. As the reviewer has rightly pointed out, in the absence of reporter over-expression (and consequent depletion of free ribosomes), the exact reporter mRNA copy-number or the simultaneous presence of a second reporter does not affect our prediction for the effect of stall sites on YFP synthesis rate (relative to a no-stall control). In this regime where there is no feedback between the translation of native and heterologous mRNAs, we used the whole cell simulation to compute the steady state concentration of charged tRNAs in the cell (Run 1 in github code). We then used this whole-cell simulation results to simulate the simultaneous translation of a single mRNA molecule of the test reporter and the control reporter (Runs 3–5 in github code). Simulating just the reporters enables faster simulation times (few min vs. several hours for the whole-cell simulation) without any loss of accuracy. More importantly, since we measured only the YFP synthesis rate in this work, we believe that our reporter-only simulation with the minimal number of unobserved parameters provides a more transparent representation of the underlying kinetic model than an equivalent whole-cell simulation with thousands of unobserved parameters. Finally, the simultaneous translation of the two reporters is simply to ensure that we used exactly the same set of parameters for our test and control reporters during simulations and subsequent analyses. We regret that we had implicitly assumed much of this discussion to be superfluous in our earlier draft, and we have now included a summary of this explanation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>I had three main concerns in my original review report:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Authors must state that conclusions are limited to stalling caused by aa starvation.</italic> </p><p><italic>2) Authors must perform statistical comparison of three models (TJ, SAT, CSAT), not merely report mean square error.</italic> </p><p><italic>3) Authors must perform simulations of the synthetic mRNAs in context of full complement of all other mRNAs (as opposed to in isolation).</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors have addressed concern 1 through revised text.

(Although it would still be better to perform the full simulations.)</italic> </p><p><italic>With regard to point #2 (statistical comparison of models), the authors have not done much of anything in the way of new analysis, it seems. They do not provide any p-value to compare one model to another. They suggest that RMS is equivalent to reporting the Akaike Information Criterion. Even though all models being considered have the same number of parameters, they have not actually computed the likelihood under each model. The equivalence of AIC and RMS only occurs if the error distribution is the same under all models (eg all normal errors), but in fact the error distribution is surely not normal in these simulations. If the authors wish to use AIC for model comparison then they must actually compute the likelihood of the ML parameters under each model – which involves running an ensemble of simulations at each parameter to set to determine the likelihood of the data under that set of parameters. As it stands, the central claim comparing the TJ SAT and CSAT models rests on an entirely qualitative, non-statistical comparison.</italic> </p><p><italic>Overall, the study makes a strong contribution. But I hesitate to offer acceptance until the data in support of the central claim have been analyzed statistically.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for the comments regarding the distribution of errors. To clarify our statistical analysis, we note that there are three main sources of error/uncertainty in our work:</p><p>1) The first source is from imperfect simulation of the underlying kinetic model. We refer to this as simulation error below. We assume that this is the error the reviewer has in mind when referring to non-normal distribution of errors.</p><p>2) The second source is from imperfect measurement of YFP synthesis rate for any given yfp mutant. We refer to this as measurement error below. This error is represented by the error bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5,</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>.</p><p>3) The third source is from imperfect kinetic modeling, i.e. none of our models fully account for all the molecular processes that affect the measured YFP synthesis rate. We refer to this as modeling error below. This modeling error could either be relevant to our work, for eg. Inclusion / exclusion of abortive termination; or it might not be of interest for the question at hand, for eg. Local sequence context effects that are specific to individual yfp mutants.</p><p>In order to perform statistical inference, we consider each of these errors below:</p><p>1.1) Simulation Error</p><p>Before we consider the error in our simulation, we clarify the definition of YFP synthesis rate in our simulations. In each simulation run, YFP synthesis rate is defined as the number of YFP molecules produced from a yfp mutant during the time it takes to produce 10,000 YFP molecules from the no-stall control, normalized by 10000. We chose this definition of YFP synthesis rate in our simulations to match the number of YFP molecules that we expect to be produced in a cell during the course of our experimental measurement over 1-2 hours, based on a typical translation initiation rate of ~0.3 s<sup>−1</sup> and a typical mRNA copy number of 10 molecules per cell (for a chromosomally-integrated gene expressed from a moderately strong promoter).</p><p>To address the reviewer’s suggestion to consider the error in a ensemble of identical simulations, we performed 5,000 independent and identically-parametrized simulations for each of the three kinetic models considered in our work. We show the distribution of YFP synthesis rate across this simulation ensemble for a double stall-site mutant in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 4</xref> using parameters that were inferred from the corresponding single-mutant measurements. We note that the width of the distribution of simulation errors is approximately the standard error of our YFP synthesis rate estimate and is close to normal. Notably, these simulation errors are much smaller than the modeling errors discussed below (compare X-axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 5</xref>).</p><p>1.2) Measurement Error</p><p>We performed all our measurements of YFP synthesis rate in triplicates from three clonal <italic>E. coli</italic> colonies.

By contrast, the CSAT model’s prediction shows no such overestimation or underestimation bias (P &gt; 0.45, N=94 for both cases). If we assume normal distribution of modeling errors (see discussion below) and use the one-sided Student’s t test, we can then conclude that the SAT model systematically underestimates the measured YFP synthesis rate (P &lt; 10<sup>−8</sup>) while the TJ model systematically overestimates the YFP synthesis rate (P &lt; 10<sup>−15</sup>).

This suggests that additional stochastic processes have acted on the measured YFP synthesis rate that have not been included in our modeling. Since our goal is only to distinguish between the three kinetic models considered in this work, we account for this unexplained variability outside of the stochastic simulation, following suggested practice (Hartig et al., 2011). Specifically, we assume that additional variability is independently and normal distributed. We believe that this assumption is the most parsimonious one based on our expectation that the additional variability arises from local sequence-context effects that are specific to each yfp mutant. Additive combination of several independent mutant-specific effects will result in a normal distribution of residuals. This assumption is consistent with our observation that the empirical residual distribution for the CSAT model (which has no prediction bias) is reasonably approximated by a normal distribution (black line in left panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Author response image 6</xref>). This practice of using the empirical residuals to test the assumption of normal error distribution has been used previously in diverse biological contexts where the underlying models do not capture the full variability present in the measured data (Martínez et al., 2011; Coulon et al., 2014; Wood et al., 2012</p><p>We then use the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for obtaining the statistical evidence favoring each of the three models considered in our work. AIC is an estimate of the expected, relative distance (Kullback-Leibler distance) between the fitted model and the unknown true mechanism that actually generated the observed data (Burnham and Anderson, 2013). The model with the lowest AIC is considered the best model since it will minimize the distance between the model prediction and observed data. Under the assumption of an external error model for the residuals with normal distribution and unknown constant variance, AIC can be computed from the empirical residuals as (Burnham and Anderson, 2013):<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:msup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> is the ML estimate of the residual variance:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> are the estimated residuals for the candidate model. <italic>n</italic> is the number of observations. <italic>K</italic> is the total number of fitted parameters including the unknown <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>.

[…] Whatever deficiencies of this analysis remain, as long as the authors make their data available, anyone can analyze it and draw their own conclusions.</italic> </p><p>We understand Reviewer #3’s suggested approach for statistical comparison of stochastic models. However, we believe that it is inapplicable to our work because the stochasticity in our simulations reflects only the error in our simulations, and not the error in our modeling. As we highlighted in our previous round of response, the simulation error is negligible in comparison to our modeling error. In other words, our simulations are essentially perfect and deterministic representations of our kinetic models. If we follow the procedure suggested by Reviewer #3, the likelihood of each model given the data will be zero since none of our simulation runs will reproduce the measurements for most of the YFP mutants.</p><p>Since the processes that cause the modeling error are not of interest to us (for eg. local sequence context effects), we have followed a standard approach [Hartig et al., Ecology Letters, (2011) 14:816–827 Statistical inference for stochastic simulation models – theory and application] of accounting for the modeling error outside of the stochastic simulation. Our procedure follows the prescription that has been suggested by Hartig et al.: “If it is difficult to specify an explicit statistical error model from the data, informal likelihoods offer an alternative. By informal likelihoods, we understand any metric that quantifies the distance between the predictions of a stochastic simulation model and the observed data, but is not immediately interpretable as originating from an underlying stochastic process (see Beven 2006; Smith et al., 2008). A common example is the sum of the squared distances between Sobs and the mean of Ssim (Refsgaard et al., 2007; Winkler &amp; Heinken 2007)”.</p><p>Finally, we note that the Akaike weights for each model that we have reported are just normalized likelihood values (Burnham and Anderson, Springer (2002); Model Selection and Multimodel Inference).</p></body></sub-article></article>
