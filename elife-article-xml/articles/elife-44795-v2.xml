Here, we report that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells regulate carbon and nitrogen metabolic homeostasis through tRNA U<sub>34</sub>-thiolation. Despite amino acid sufficiency, tRNA-thiolation deficient cells appear amino acid starved. In these cells, carbon flux towards nucleotide synthesis decreases, and trehalose synthesis increases, resulting in a starvation-like metabolic signature. Thiolation mutants have only minor translation defects. However, in these cells phosphate homeostasis genes are strongly down-regulated, resulting in an effectively phosphate-limited state. Reduced phosphate enforces a metabolic switch, where glucose-6-phosphate is routed towards storage carbohydrates. Notably, trehalose synthesis, which releases phosphate and thereby restores phosphate availability, is central to this metabolic rewiring. Thus, cells use thiolated tRNAs to perceive amino acid sufficiency, balance carbon and amino acid metabolic flux and grow optimally, by controlling phosphate availability. These results further biochemically explain how phosphate availability determines a switch to a ‘starvation-state’.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44795.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The building blocks of all cells are made from a handful of chemical elements, including carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus. To grow optimally, cells need to regulate their metabolism – in other words, the biochemical reactions that keep them alive – based on the availability of these elements. As a result, cells have evolved various mechanisms to sense when usable forms of these elements are present.</p><p>Proteins are chains of building blocks known as amino acids, which are assembled with the help of molecules called transfer ribonucleic acids, or tRNAs for short. Some of these molecules can be modified by attaching sulfur-containing chemical tags known as thiol groups to make “thiolated tRNAs”. Research has shown that, when there was more of an amino acid known as methionine around, the cells made more thiolated tRNA. These previous studies also suggested that mutant cells lacking thiolated tRNAs might have altered carbon and nitrogen metabolism. Yet, it remained unclear what exactly was leading to this metabolic rewiring.</p><p>Now, Gupta et al. have combined several biochemical and genetics approaches to study the role of thiolated tRNAs in yeast. The experiments revealed that mutant cells lacking thiolated tRNAs were unable to properly sense the levels of methionine and other amino acids, which are the cell’s major source of nitrogen. These mutant cells were also found to have a reduced level of phosphorous-containing compounds known as phosphates, which are involved in numerous biological processes.</p><p>Gupta et al. showed that reducing the level of phosphates caused carbon that is normally used to make chemicals required for growth to be re-routed towards making carbohydrates to store energy instead. This is similar to what happens when the cells are starving, showing that a ‘squeeze’ on internal phosphates metabolically rewires cells into a state that is like starvation.</p><p>These findings show how modified tRNAs can use the availability of amino acids to alter the cell’s metabolism by altering how much phosphate is present. In doing so, the thiolated tRNAs essentially allow the cell to decide whether it has enough of the right nutrients to grow. These findings may also have implications for human health, since errors in coordinating metabolism are responsible for certain medical conditions including several cancers.</p><p>Finally, technical challenges mean many questions remain unanswered about how phosphate levels are regulated within cells. These new findings point to a pressing need to understand phosphate metabolism as a prerequisite to better understand how cells regulate their overall metabolism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>phosphate</kwd><kwd>methionine</kwd><kwd>tRNA modification</kwd><kwd>trehalose</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Science and Engineering Research Board, DST</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PDF/2016/000416</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gupta</surname><given-names>Ritu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Science and Engineering Research Board, DST</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PDF/2015/000225</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walvekar</surname><given-names>Adhish S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009053</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IA/I/14/2/501523</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laxman</surname><given-names>Sunil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Govt. of India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laxman</surname><given-names>Sunil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>inStem</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laxman</surname><given-names>Sunil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM124976</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Premal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DK056645</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Premal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DK109714</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Premal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Human Genetics Institute of New Jersey at Rutgers University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Start-up funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Premal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The role of an amino acid-dependent tRNA modification as a nutrient sensor and regulator of metabolic homeostasis has been discovered.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells utilize multiple mechanisms to sense available nutrients, and appropriately alter their internal metabolic state. Such nutrient-sensing systems assess internal resources, relay this information to interconnected biochemical networks, and control global responses that collectively reset the metabolic state of the cell, thereby determining eventual cell fate outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jeong et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Förster et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zaman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Broach, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai and Tu, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ljungdahl and Daignan-Fornier, 2012</xref>). However, much remains unknown about how cells sense and integrate information from multiple nutrient inputs, to coordinately regulate the metabolic state of the cell and commit to different fates.</p><p>In this context, the metabolic state of the cell is also closely coupled with mRNA translation. Protein synthesis is enormously energy consuming, and therefore must be carefully regulated in tune with nutrient availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Warner, 2001</xref>). Generally, overall translational capacity and output increases during growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jorgensen et al., 2004</xref>), and decreases during nutrient limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wullschleger et al., 2006</xref>). Signalling processes that regulate translational outputs (such as the TORC1 and PKA pathways) are well studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wullschleger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zaman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Broach, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">González and Hall, 2017</xref>). Notwithstanding this, little is known about how core components of the translation machinery might directly control metabolic outputs, and thus couple metabolic states with physiological cellular outcomes.</p><p>tRNAs are core components of the translation machinery, and are extensively modified post-transcriptionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Björk et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Phizicky and Hopper, 2010</xref>). Some tRNA modifications are required for tRNA folding, stability, or the accuracy and efficiency of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Phizicky and Hopper, 2010</xref>). However, the roles of many of these highly conserved modifications remain unclear. One such modification is a thiolation of uridine residue present at the wobble-anticodon (U<sub>34</sub>) position of specifically glu-, gln- and lys- tRNAs (s<sup>2</sup>U<sub>34</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gustilo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Phizicky and Hopper, 2010</xref>). In yeast, this is mediated by a group of six enzymes- Nfs1, Tum1, Uba4, Urm1, Ncs2 and Ncs6, which are evolutionarily conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nakai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Leidel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Noma et al., 2009</xref>). These enzymes incorporate a thiol group derived directly from an amino acid (cysteine), and replace the oxygen present at the 2-position of U<sub>34</sub> with sulfur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schmitz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Leidel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Noma et al., 2009</xref>). Surprisingly, these thiolated tRNAs appear to have a relatively minor role in general translation, as seen in multiple studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rezgui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zinshteyn and Gilbert, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Klassen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chou et al., 2017</xref>) with modest roles in enhancing the efficiency of wobble base codon-anticodon pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yarian et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rezgui et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Contrastingly, tRNA thiolation appears to directly alter cellular metabolism, but this connection has remained largely unexplored. The suggestive connections to metabolism come from disparate studies. The loss of tRNA thiolation results in hypersensitivity to oxidative agents, and the TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fichtner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goehring et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goehring et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Laxman and Tu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Scheidt et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting a role for thiolated tRNAs in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. More pertinently, several studies have observed that a loss of this modification alters amino acid homeostasis, and the amino-acid starvation regulator Gcn4 is induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Laxman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zinshteyn and Gilbert, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nedialkova and Leidel, 2015</xref>). Further, thiolated tRNAs are required to maintain metabolic cycles in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Laxman et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, the amounts of thiolated tRNAs reflect the intracellular availability of sulfur-containing amino acids (cysteine and methionine), and couple the sensing of amino acid sufficiency with growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Laxman et al., 2013</xref>). These studies all hint that a core function of this tRNA modification may be to integrate the sensing of amino acid availability (primarily methionine/cysteine), with the coordinate regulation of overall metabolic state, in order for the cell to appropriately commit to growth. Yet, how thiolated tRNAs regulate metabolism, and the extent to which this may control cellular outcomes remains entirely unaddressed.</p><p>In this study, by directly analyzing different metabolic outputs, we identify the metabolic nodes that are altered in tRNA thiolation deficient cells. We find that tRNA thiolation regulates central carbon and nitrogen (amino acid) metabolic outputs, by controlling flux towards storage carbohydrates. In tRNA thiolation deficient cells, overall metabolic homeostasis is altered, with carbon flux diverted away from the pentose-phosphate pathway and nucleotide synthesis axis, and towards storage carbohydrates trehalose and glycogen. This thereby alters cellular commitments towards growth and cell cycle progression. Counter-intuitively, we discover that this metabolic-state switch in cells lacking tRNA thiolation is achieved by down-regulating a distant metabolic arm of phosphate homeostasis. We biochemically elucidate how regulating phosphate balance can couple amino acid and carbon utilization towards or away from nucleotide synthesis, and identify trehalose synthesis as a pivotal control point for this metabolic switch. Through these findings we show how tRNA thiol-modifications regulate overall metabolic homeostasis, integrating nutrient inputs to enable optimal growth. We further present a general biochemical explanation for how inorganic phosphate homeostasis regulates commitments to different arms of carbon and nitrogen metabolism, thereby determining how cells commit to a ‘growth’ or ‘starvation’ state.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Amino acid and nucleotide metabolism are decoupled in tRNA thiolation deficient cells</title><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44795.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Amino acid and nucleotide metabolism are decoupled in tRNA thiolation deficient cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Intracellular pools of amino acids are increased in tRNA thiolation mutants. Steady-state amino acid amounts were measured in wild-type (WT) and tRNA thiolation mutant cells (<italic>uba4</italic>Δ and <italic>ncs2</italic>Δ) grown in minimal media by targeted liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).

These studies therefore suggested that tRNA thiolation-deficient cells were amino-acid starved. We investigated this surmise, by directly measuring free intracellular amino acids in wild-type (WT) and tRNA thiolation mutant cells, using two distinct thiolation pathway mutants (<italic>uba4</italic>Δ and <italic>ncs2</italic>Δ). In our studies, we used a prototrophic yeast strain grown in synthetic minimal medium without supplemented amino acids, in order to minimize any confounding interpretations coming from supplemented amino acids/nucleobases in the medium. Using quantitative, targeted LC-MS/MS approaches, we compared relative amounts of amino acids in WT and thiolation mutants. Unexpectedly, we observed a substantial increase in the intracellular pools of free amino acids in thiolation mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This shows that the thiolation deficient cells are not amino acid starved, but instead accumulate amino acids. We next correlated these actual amino acid amounts with the abundance of Gcn4. Gcn4 is the major amino acid starvation responsive transcription factor, and is induced upon amino acid starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hinnebusch, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hinnebusch, 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We measured Gcn4 protein in WT and thiolation deficient cells, and contrarily observed increased Gcn4 protein in thiolation mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Further, <italic>GCN4</italic> translation was correspondingly higher in thiolation mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (as also seen earlier in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zinshteyn and Gilbert, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nedialkova and Leidel, 2015</xref>). This increased <italic>GCN4</italic> translation in the thiolation mutants was also Gcn2- and eIF2α phosphorylation-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). These observations comparing actual amino acid amounts in cells with the activity of Gcn4 therefore present a striking paradox. As canonically understood, Gcn4 is induced upon amino acid starvation, while Gcn4 translation and protein decrease when intracellular amino acid amounts are restored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hinnebusch, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hinnebusch, 2005</xref>). Contrastingly, in the results observed here, despite the high amino acid amounts present in the tRNA thiolation mutants, the Gcn2-Gcn4 pathway remains induced. We therefore concluded that the metabolic node regulated by tRNA thiolation, resulting in an apparent amino acid starvation signature, cannot be at the level of amino acid biosynthesis and availability.</p><p>We therefore considered the possible metabolic outcomes of amino acid utilization, and hypothesized that an alteration in amino acid utilization could be a source of this metabolic rewiring. In particular, amino acids are the sole nitrogen donors for de novo nucleotide synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Since amino acids accumulated in thiolation mutants, we explored the possibility that this was due to reduced de novo nucleotide synthesis. We first measured steady-state nucleotides in WT and thiolation mutants, and observed decreased steady-state levels of nucleotides (NMPs, as well as ATP) in thiolation mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). To unambiguously determine if these decreased nucleotide amounts in the thiolation mutants were due to reduced nucleotide synthesis, we adopted a metabolic flux-based approach we had developed earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Walvekar et al., 2018b</xref>). In such an approach, <sup>15</sup>N-labelled ammonium sulfate can be provided as a pulse to cells growing with ammonium sulfate as a sole nitrogen source, and label incorporation via glutamine and aspartate into newly formed nucleotides can be measured. Notably, the incorporation of <sup>15</sup>N-label into nucleotides (GMP, AMP and CMP) decreased in thiolation mutants relative to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating reduced flux towards nucleotide synthesis. As an internal control, the <sup>15</sup>N-label incorporation into amino acids (aspartate and glutamine) themselves were not affected in thiolation mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>), ruling out amino acid synthesis defects. These data therefore show that nitrogen incorporation from amino acids to nucleotides decrease in the thiolation mutants, resulting in decreased nucleotides. We further addressed this pharmacologically, using a purine-analog, 8-azaadenine, which acts as a pseudo-feedback inhibitor of nucleotide biosynthesis. Consistent with the decreased nucleotide levels observed, thiolation mutants exhibited increased sensitivity to 8-azaadenine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Collectively, these data show that the loss of tRNA thiolation decreases nucleotide biosynthesis, with a corresponding accumulation of amino acids. Notably, early studies have shown that nucleotide limitation can itself directly induce Gcn4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rolfes and Hinnebusch, 1993</xref>), suggesting that the increased Gcn4 amounts could be due to this. We also asked if the decreased nucleotide synthesis was due to reduced expression of nucleotide biosynthetic genes. We observed that the expression of candidate genes in this pathway were increased in thiolation mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>), diminishing the possibility of reduced nucleotide biosynthetic capacity as a reason for decreased nucleotides. Indeed, increased mRNA levels of nucleotide biosynthetic genes observed in thiolation mutants may be due to feedback upregulation in response to reduced nucleotides, which is also a well-established phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davis and Ares, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kwapisz et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, despite increased intracellular pools of amino acids, tRNA thiolation deficient cells exhibit signatures of amino acid starvation, including decreased nucleotide biosynthesis. These data therefore suggest that the tRNA thiolation pathway is important for cells to appropriately balance amino acid utilization for nucleotide synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Carbon flux is routed towards storage carbohydrates in thiolation mutants</title><p>Despite amino acids being non-limiting in thiolation deficient cells, flux towards nucleotide synthesis was decreased. This observation was in itself puzzling, and the reason was not obvious. We therefore asked if carbon metabolism was instead rewired in the thiolation mutants. Our reasoning was as follows: while amino acids are the sole nitrogen donors for nucleotide synthesis, the carbon backbone for nucleotides is derived from central carbon metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We reasoned that since the decreased nucleotide synthesis was not due to amino acid limitation, this could instead be due to a metabolic shift where carbon flux is routed away from nucleotide synthesis. Carbon derived from glucose is converted to glucose-6-phosphate, and then is typically directed towards glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). The PPP, along with one-carbon folate metabolism provides the necessary carbon precursors (including ribose sugars) for nucleotide synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyle, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hosios and Vander Heiden, 2018</xref>). However, if glucose-6-phosphate is instead diverted towards storage carbohydrates trehalose and glycogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), this can result in reduced flux into the arm of glucose metabolism leading towards nucleotide synthesis. To assess if such a metabolic rewiring might happen in tRNA thiolation mutants, we pulsed [U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]-labelled glucose to growing WT or thiolation deficient cells, and measured label incorporation into nucleotides as the end-point readout. Here, labelled carbons will only be present in newly synthesized nucleotides, and the label can only come from the pulsed labelled glucose, through the PPP and one-carbon metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We observed significantly decreased carbon label incorporation towards new nucleotide synthesis, as shown for GMP and AMP, as well as label incorporation into ADP and ATP in the thiolation mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This result is also consistent with the decreased nucleotide synthesis based on amino acid derived nitrogen assimilation, observed earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Experimental note: Given how rapidly the pulsed carbon label saturates in glucose medium for early glycolytic and PPP intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heerden et al., 2014</xref>), using nucleotide synthesis as a read-out of this arm of carbon metabolism is a more reliable, quantitative indicator of carbon flux. Here, we reliably obtained nucleotide information (ensuring that label incorporation was not saturated) by pulsing cells with <sup>13</sup>C-glucose and quenching/processing metabolites within 5 min. By this time, the <sup>13</sup>C-glucose label incorporation into glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway intermediates was already near-saturation, and hence differences in these metabolites could not be seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We therefore carried out experiments where cells were quenched and metabolites extracted within 2 min of <sup>13</sup>C-glucose addition. Here, a significant decrease in <sup>13</sup>C-label incorporation into newly synthesized ribose-5-phosphate (a late PPP metabolite) was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This is entirely consistent with results obtained with nucleotides in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>.

Separately, studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Laxman et al., 2013</xref>) show that the amounts of thiolated tRNAs are highest in cells entering a ‘growth state’ (with high ribosomal biosynthesis). In this context, we also recently defined a methionine induced anabolic program, where abundant methionine triggers increased carbon flux (particularly PPP flux) towards nucleotide synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Walvekar et al., 2018b</xref>). Given our observations here in standard medium, where thiolation mutants showed decreased carbon flux from glucose towards nucleotides, we further investigated this coupling of tRNA thiolation with methionine availability. The prediction is that if tRNA thiolation enables cells to fully respond to abundant methionine, then thiolation mutants will exhibit a reduced methionine response. As a result, when methionine is supplemented, thiolation mutants will show reduced carbon incorporation into nucleotides (i.e. nucleotide synthesis), compared to WT cells. To test this, WT or thiolation mutant (<italic>uba4</italic>Δ) cells grown in standard glucose minimal medium were supplemented with 2 mM methionine, and then pulsed with <sup>13</sup>C-glucose (as described earlier) for 15 min. Subsequently, we compared carbon-label incorporation into newly synthesized nucleotides. Here, we expectedly observed a sharp increase in carbon-label incorporation into nucleotides in WT cells supplemented with methionine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Notably, while the extent of this methionine-dependent induction of carbon flux into nucleotides was significantly reduced, it was not completely abolished in the thiolation mutant (<italic>uba4</italic>Δ), indicating the involvement of additional as yet unknown pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Together, these data reiterate that tRNA thiolation allows cells to fully integrate amino acid (methionine) sensing, with a routing of carbon (glucose) flux towards new nucleotide synthesis, collectively indicative of a growth state. Furthermore, in a converse experiment, we subjected WT cells to brief inorganic sulfur/sulfur amino acid limitation, to determine the metabolic signature of cells in this condition (experimental design shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Cells subjected to a brief shift to sulfur starved medium showed a sharp decrease in sulfur amino acid-related metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We measured the steady-state amounts of other amino acids, nucleotides (AMP), trehalose and the level of Gcn4 translation. We observed increased steady-state amino acid amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>), reduced nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>), increased trehalose levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>), and strong Gcn4 induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F</xref>) upon sulfur limitation. These data strikingly resembled the metabolic state of the thiolation mutants. Thus, WT cells subject to sulfur amino acid limitation phenocopied the metabolic signature of tRNA thiolation mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>tRNA thiolation couples cellular metabolic state with normal cell cycle progression</title><p>Dissecting physiological roles of such a fine-tuning of metabolic outputs can be challenging, and this has been the case for tRNA thiolation mutants.

This was reminiscent of phenotypes exhibited by mutants of cell division cycle regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2007</xref>). We therefore asked if tRNA thiolation coupled metabolic and cell division cycles. To test this, we sampled the cells at regular intervals of time during the metabolic cycles, and determined their budding index. While WT cells showed synchronized cell cycle progression, tRNA thiolation mutants showed asynchronous cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting a de-coupling of metabolic and cell division cycles. Given our earlier data showing a metabolic rewiring away from nucleotide synthesis in thiolation mutants, we hypothesized that tRNA thiolation controlled normal cell cycle progression by regulating the balance between nucleotide synthesis, and storage carbohydrate synthesis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44795.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>tRNA thiolation couples cellular metabolic state with normal cell cycle progression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) tRNA thiolation mutants exhibit asynchronous cell division and disrupted yeast metabolic cycles. WT and tRNA thiolation mutant cells (<italic>uba4</italic>Δ) growing in chemostat cultures under conditions of normal yeast metabolic cycles, were sampled at 20 min time intervals.

Since nucleotides are required for DNA replication during the S-phase of the cell cycle, we reasoned that that this S-phase delay is due to decreased flux towards nucleotide synthesis in thiolation mutants (shown earlier). To investigate this, we examined the sensitivity of WT and thiolation deficient cells to hydroxyurea (HU), which inhibits the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) enzyme and arrests cells in the S-phase. Thiolation mutants exhibited increased sensitivity to HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As a control, to rule out any abnormal activation of DNA damage readouts in the thiolation mutants as a cause for this phenotype, we also examined activity of the Rad53 checkpoint pathway.

This therefore suggests a deeper, non-intuitive regulatory check-point underpinning the overall metabolic rewiring towards a ‘starvation-like’ state in tRNA thiolation mutants. In order to identify what this controlling bottleneck might be, we identified transcriptional and translational changes in thiolation mutants relative to WT by performing RNA-seq and Ribo-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>) based on methods described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Weinberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McGlincy and Ingolia, 2017</xref>). Notably, as detailed in the Materials and methods section, while collecting cells for RNA and Ribo-seq, we avoided the use of cycloheximide, as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Weinberg et al., 2016</xref>), to minimize biases in our interpretations of ribosome profiling datasets due to the use of this translational inhibitor as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hussmann et al., 2015</xref>).

We first biochemically estimated amounts of trehalose in WT cells with or without phosphate starvation, and found a robust increase in trehalose upon phosphate starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), much like the thiolation mutants. We next measured Gcn4 (protein) in WT cells, with or without phosphate starvation. Here, we observed a strong induction in Gcn4 protein upon phosphate starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Further, like the Gcn4 response in the thiolation mutants, the Gcn4 induction in phosphate-starved WT cells was Gcn2-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition to these data shown here in WT cells with phosphate starvation, earlier studies in response to phosphate limitation, have also observed high amino acid and low nucleotide levels under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Klosinska et al., 2011</xref>).

Nonetheless, it is not immediately obvious biochemically how this relates to re-routing carbon towards storage carbohydrates, and decoupling amino acid metabolism from nucleotide synthesis. Perplexingly, in our transcript and translation analysis, no other metabolic arms were similarly decreased in the thiolation deficient cells, and only the amino acid biosynthesis arm (dependent on Gcn4) increases, which we have addressed earlier. Notably, while earlier studies have hinted that phosphate limitation results in a shift towards storage carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lillie and Pringle, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boer et al., 2010</xref>), this more extensive metabolic rewiring has not been carefully analyzed, and a biochemical explanation for this is missing. We wondered if some overlooked aspect within this biochemical process could explain why a perturbation in phosphate homeostasis connects to the synthesis of storage carbohydrates trehalose and glycogen, as is also seen in tRNA thiolation mutants. To address this, we carefully examined all the metabolic nodes altered in the tRNA thiolation mutants, evaluating necessary co-factors and products of each pathway, and looking for possible connections to phosphate. Here, we noted an apparently minor, largely ignored output in the arm of carbon metabolism, where glucose-6-phosphate is routed towards trehalose synthesis. The first step of trehalose synthesis is the formation trehalose-6-phosphate (T-6-P), carried out by trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (Tps1). This is followed by the dephosphorylation of T-6-P by Tps2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Virgilio et al., 1993</xref>), forming trehalose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We noted that this Tps2-dependent second step is accompanied by the release of free, inorganic phosphate (Pi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Canonically, these two steps are viewed as an apparently futile trehalose cycle during glycolysis, regenerating glucose, in order to maintain balanced glycolytic flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heerden et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">van Heerden et al., 2014</xref>). However, we reasoned that if the availability of inorganic phosphate is limiting, a shift to trehalose synthesis can be a way by which cells can liberate Pi, and restore phosphate levels. For this to be generally true, the prediction is that during phosphate starvation, WT cells must accumulate trehalose in order to recover phosphate. As shown earlier, this is exactly what is observed in WT cells limited for phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), and in the tRNA thiolation mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) which are effectively phosphate limited due to a reduction in the <italic>PHO</italic> genes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44795.019</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Trehalose synthesis associated phosphate release enables cells to maintain phosphate balance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic representation of the trehalose cycle, showing the routing of glucose-6-phospate towards trehalose and glycogen biosynthesis. Trehalose synthesis requires two glucose molecules, catalysed by the Tps1 and Tps2 enzymes.

However, we directly tested the hypothesis that trehalose synthesis is a direct way for cells to restore internal phosphate in tRNA thiolation mutants, by utilizing cells lacking <italic>TPS2.</italic> These cells cannot complete trehalose synthesis, and importantly cannot release phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We first measured the intracellular Pi levels in WT cells, thiolation mutants (<italic>uba4</italic>Δ), cells lacking Tps2p (<italic>tps2</italic>Δ), and cells lacking tRNA thiolation as well as Tps2p (<italic>uba4</italic>Δ <italic>tps2</italic>Δ). <italic>pho85</italic>Δ cells were used as a control, since they exhibit intrinsically higher intracellular Pi levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu et al., 2017</xref>).

This suggests that while other pathways (phosphate uptake, glycerol production and vacuolar phosphate export) remain relevant, Tps2p-mediated Pi release by dephosphorylation of trehalose-6-P is itself important for maintaining internal phosphate levels. Importantly, <italic>uba4</italic>Δ cells had only slightly reduced intracellular Pi levels (~90%) relative to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This is consistent with the prediction that due to reduced <italic>PHO</italic> expression in these cells, phosphate homeostasis is altered, but they can compensate for phosphate availability through increased trehalose synthesis. Contrastingly, the cells lacking both thiolation and Tps2 (<italic>uba4</italic>Δ <italic>tps2</italic>Δ) showed a dramatic reduction in Pi levels (~65%), compared to either of their single mutants. This striking reduction in Pi levels in these cells is consistent with the predicted outcome, where an inability to release phosphate from trehalose (<italic>tps2</italic>Δ) is also coupled with reduced expression of phosphate assimilation genes (<italic>uba4</italic>Δ). Next, we tested possible genetic interactions between <italic>tps2</italic>Δ and thiolation mutants (<italic>uba4</italic>Δ and <italic>ncs2</italic>Δ) by assessing relative growth. In our genetic background, <italic>tps2</italic>Δ cells exhibit slightly slower growth at 37°C. Notably, in cells lacking both <italic>TPS2</italic> and tRNA thiolation (<italic>tps2</italic>Δ <italic>uba4</italic>Δ or <italic>tps2</italic>Δ <italic>ncs2</italic>Δ), we observed a strong synthetic growth defect, in conditions of low phosphate as well as normal phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This is entirely consistent with the proposed role of Tps2p in maintaining phosphate balance in thiolation mutants. Finally, if we completely imbalance phosphate homeostasis in cells, using cells lacking <italic>PHO80</italic>, individual mutants of either <italic>pho80</italic>Δ or thiolation deficient cells show minimal growth defects, but double mutants (<italic>pho80</italic>Δ <italic>uba4</italic>Δ or <italic>pho80</italic>Δ <italic>ncs2</italic>Δ) show a severe synthetic growth defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, our results suggest that altering phosphate homeostasis by decreasing <italic>PHO</italic> activity regulates overall carbon and nitrogen flow.

Cells can use tRNA thiolation to sense overall nutrient sufficiency and appropriately modulate metabolic outputs, using phosphate homeostasis as the metabolic control point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In this model, tRNAs are thiolated in tune with methionine and cysteine availability, as has been demonstrated earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Laxman et al., 2013</xref>). Separately, the presence of these sulfur amino acids themselves reflect an overall amino acid sufficiency state, leading to an anabolic program capable of sustaining cell growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Walvekar et al., 2018b</xref>). Methionine up-regulates both amino acid synthesis and carbon flux leading towards nucleotide synthesis, and therefore growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Walvekar et al., 2018b</xref>). Collectively therefore, in conditions of methionine sufficiency (and therefore amino acid sufficiency), where tRNAs are maximally thiolated, cells direct carbon flux towards nucleotide biosynthesis, coupled with amino acid utilization (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Accordingly, at this level of metabolic coupling, thiolated tRNAs sense amino acids, and ensure appropriate nucleotide levels for growth and cell cycle progression (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). On the other hand, the loss of thiolated tRNAs results in an inability of cells to fully sense and integrate these nutrient cues, rewiring carbon and nitrogen flux away from nucleotide synthesis and instead towards storage carbohydrates. This switches cells to a ‘starvation-like state’. This metabolic rewiring mediated by tRNA thiolation is achieved not by directly regulating enzymes in these arms of carbon metabolism, but instead by down-regulating the <italic>PHO</italic> regulon. This constricts intracellular phosphate availability (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). A result of this dampened <italic>PHO</italic> response, and constriction in available free phosphate, is that in order to restore phosphate, cells divert glucose flux towards Tps2-mediated trehalose synthesis, which concurrently releases Pi (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Thus, while the trehalose shunt and phosphate recycling restores phosphate levels, this is at the cost of decreased nucleotide biosynthesis, and delayed cell cycle progression. Effectively, the loss of tRNA thiolation rewires cells to a starved metabolic state. Collectively, tRNA thiolation appropriately regulates metabolic outputs by controlling phosphate homeostasis, thereby enabling cells to commit to growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Intriguingly, this correlation of tRNA thiolation with growth and rewired metabolism is emerging in cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McMahon and Ruggero, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rapino et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting possibly conserved metabolic roles for these modified tRNAs.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44795.021</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A model illustrating how tRNA thiolation regulates the metabolic state of the cell.</title><p>WT cells (which have a functional tRNA thiolation machinery) in amino acid (methionine and cysteine) replete conditions have high amounts of thiolated tRNAs. In these cells, carbon flux coupled with amino acid utilization is towards nucleotide biosynthesis. Sufficient nucleotide levels support growth, and proper cell cycle progression, and reflect an overall ‘growth’ metabolic state. The absence of the tRNA thiolation machinery results in non-thiolated tRNAs, and here carbon flux is driven away from nucleotide synthesis and towards storage carbohydrates, with a concurrent accumulation of amino acids. This metabolic rewiring in these mutants is due to reduced expression of genes involved in phosphate-responsive signalling pathway (a dampened <italic>PHO</italic> response), which results in a phosphate-limited state. Due to this restricted phosphate availability in the thiolation mutants, these cells attempt to restore intracellular phosphate levels through a metabolic rewiring, via Tps2-dependent trehalose synthesis, accompanied by phosphate release. Thus, despite the absence of carbon or nitrogen (amino acid) starvation, the tRNA thiolation mutants exhibit an overall metabolic signature of a ‘starved state’, with decreased nucleotide synthesis and delayed cell cycle progression.

Reduced ATP synthesis is a hallmark of phosphate starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boer et al., 2010</xref>), along with increased trehalose synthesis (discussed in a subsequent paragraph). Through this metabolic rewiring, reduced flux through the PPP and one-carbon/folate cycle can be inferred. A reduction in these metabolic pathways will reduce not just nucleotide synthesis, but also the production of NADPH, and cellular reductive biosynthetic capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hosios and Vander Heiden, 2018</xref>). Notably, the reductive costs in terms of NADPH utilized to assimilate sulfates into sulfur amino acids (methionine and cysteine), and their subsequent metabolites, are themselves extremely high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Thomas and Surdin-Kerjan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kaleta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Walvekar et al., 2018b</xref>). Indeed, this coupling of NADPH production and methionine availability is also observed in the converse direction (as noted earlier in the text), where the presence of methionine increases PPP flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Walvekar et al., 2018b</xref>), and mutants in the PPP pathway are methionine auxotrophs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Thomas et al., 1991</xref>). Therefore, an amplified regulatory response in relation to tRNA thiolation can be imagined. In such a response, in the presence of methionine, there is an increase in PPP and one-carbon flux and nucleotide synthesis, which is amplified by the maximally thiolated tRNAs by ensuring sufficient phosphate availability and an intact <italic>PHO</italic> response. Conversely, reduced sulfate assimilation in turn could limit thiolation, and thereby amplify the regulatory response, again using phosphate homeostasis as a control point. Indeed, the metabolic state of the tRNA thiolation mutants (and the phenotypes associated) are consistent with what is expected in a cell with reduced NADPH availability and reduced reductive biosynthetic capacity. Our data suggest a subtler, more integrative role for tRNA thiolation in optimally sensing overall nutrient sufficiency, and modulating overall metabolic responses leading to a growth-sustaining state.</p><p>More generally, our findings identify a biochemical reaction, the trehalose shunt, that explains how phosphate homeostasis determines the extent of carbon and nitrogen flux towards nucleotide synthesis. While it is textbook knowledge that inorganic phosphate is important for glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mason et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyle, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heerden et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">van Heerden et al., 2014</xref>), the biochemical connection of phosphate balance to carbon and nitrogen flux remains poorly explained. Studies have observed that trehalose increases upon phosphate starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lillie and Pringle, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Klosinska et al., 2011</xref>), and <italic>TPS2</italic> is upregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ogawa et al., 2000</xref>). In these conditions, central carbon metabolism is down, and phosphate limitation is a ‘general starvation’ cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brauer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gurvich et al., 2017</xref>). Why this occurs has not been immediately apparent. Here, identifying the trehalose shunt as a way to restore phosphate balance, explains these observations. These data also explain earlier observations from pathogenic fungi, showing that that trehalose synthesis determines flux through the pentose phosphate pathway, and nitrogen metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, phosphate starvation results in better cell survival in limited nutrient conditions, and also promotes efficient recovery when nutrients become available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gurvich et al., 2017</xref>). Since trehalose accumulation and utilization are respectively tightly coupled with exit from and re-entry into the cell division cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shi and Tu, 2013</xref>), we propose a dual role for trehalose synthesis during phosphate-limitation. During phosphate limitation, trehalose synthesis concurrently releases inorganic phosphate, which restores phosphate balance in the cell and diverts flux away from nucleotide synthesis and growth. When phosphate is no longer limiting, cells can liquidate trehalose to re-enter the cell division cycle, enabling rapid recovery. Thus, this study adds an important biochemical function to the many roles played by this versatile metabolite. These include cell survival during desiccation and freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calahan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Erkut et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Erkut et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tapia and Koshland, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tapia et al., 2015</xref>), the ability to act as a protein chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tapia and Koshland, 2014</xref>), and as a membrane protectant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abusharkh et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>A modified tRNA is an unusual but effective mechanism to coordinately integrate sensing of overall nutrient sufficiency, and regulate metabolic homeostasis. While previous studies have observed decreased phosphate-related transcripts in tRNA thiolation deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Leidel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nedialkova and Leidel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chou et al., 2017</xref>), possible roles for phosphate in tRNA thiolation mediated function have been ignored. Furthermore, tRNAs undergo other conserved modifications in the U<sub>34</sub> position: 5-methoxycarbonylmethyluridine (mcm<sup>5</sup> U<sub>34</sub>), 2-thiouridine (s<sup>2</sup> U<sub>34</sub>), 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine (mcm<sup>5</sup>s<sup>2</sup> U<sub>34</sub>), 5-methylaminomethyluridine (mnm<sup>5</sup>U<sub>34</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Phizicky and Hopper, 2010</xref>). In this study we focus only on how the s<sup>2</sup> U<sub>34</sub> modification (which is derived from sulfur amino acids) regulates cellular metabolic state. Interestingly, the other U<sub>34</sub> modifications all require s-adenosyl methionine (SAM), and SAM is itself directly derived from sulfur amino acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Thomas and Surdin-Kerjan, 1997</xref>. Mutants of all these related U<sub>34</sub> tRNA modifications show similar metabolic phenotypes as the thiolation mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zinshteyn and Gilbert, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nedialkova and Leidel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Han et al., 2018</xref>), and have a down-regulated <italic>PHO</italic> response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chou et al., 2017</xref>). This raises the possibility that these U<sub>34</sub>-tRNA and other tRNA modifications derived from amino acid metabolism use similar mechanisms, of controlling phosphate availability in order to regulate metabolic homeostasis. A primordial role of such tRNA modifications might therefore be to appropriately sense overall amino acid sufficiency (with methionine as a sentinel growth signal; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Walvekar et al., 2018b</xref>), and modulate metabolic states towards growth, regulating phosphate availability as a means to achieve this. Co-opting tRNAs (which are the translation components most closely linked to amino acids) to control metabolic states can therefore be an efficient means to ensure appropriate commitments to growth and proliferation, and maximize cellular fitness.</p><p>Concluding, here we discover that a sulfur amino acid-dependent tRNA modification (thiolated U<sub>34</sub>) enables cells to appropriately balance amino acid and nucleotide levels and regulate metabolic state, by controlling phosphate homeostasis. More generally, we suggest how phosphate homeostasis can impact flux through different arms of carbon and nitrogen metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-HA</td><td valign="top">Roche</td><td valign="top">Cat# 12CA5</td><td valign="top">WB (1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-phospho eIF2a (Ser51)</td><td valign="top">Cell Signalling Technology</td><td valign="top">Cat# 9721S</td><td valign="top">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-FLAG</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat # F1804-5MG</td><td valign="top">WB (1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-Rad53 yC-19</td><td valign="top">Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td valign="top">Cat # sc-6749</td><td valign="top">WB (&gt;1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-mouse, anti-rabbit)</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat # 7076S <break/>Cat # 7074S</td><td valign="top">WB (1:5000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">HPLC column</td><td valign="top">Synergi 4µ Fusion-RP 80A column (100 × 4.6 mm)</td><td valign="top">Phenomenex</td><td valign="top">Cat # 00D-4424-E0</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">Gcn4-luciferase translation reporters</td><td valign="top">this study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">trehalase</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat # T8778</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">amyloglucosidase</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat # 10115</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">RNAse A</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat # R4875</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">protease solution</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat # P6887</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Glucose estimation kit</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat # GAGO20</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">RiboZero</td><td valign="top">Epicenter</td><td valign="top">Cat # MRZH116</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">luciferase assay kit</td><td valign="top">Promega</td><td valign="top">Cat # E1500</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Maxima SYBRGreen/ROX qPCR Master Mix</td><td valign="top">Thermo Scientific</td><td valign="top">Cat # K0222</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">ATP estimation kit</td><td valign="top">Thermo Scientific</td><td valign="top">Cat # A22066</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">SYTOX green</td><td valign="top">Thermo Scientific (Invitrogen)</td><td valign="top">Cat # S7020</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">p-nitrophenyl phosphate</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat # N4645</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">bicinchoninic acid assay</td><td valign="top">Thermo Scientific</td><td valign="top">Cat # 23225</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Prism 7</td><td valign="top">Graphpad</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains, media and growth conditions</title><p>The prototrophic CEN.PK strain of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> was used in all the experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">van Dijken JP et al., 2000</xref>).

Total RNA and ribosome-protected fragments were isolated from the cell lysates and RNA-seq and ribosome profiling were performed, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Weinberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McGlincy and Ingolia, 2017</xref>), with minor modifications. Separate 5’ and 3’ linkers were ligated to the RNA- fragment instead of 3’ linker followed by circularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Subtelny et al., 2014</xref>). 5’ linkers contained four random nt unique molecular identifier (UMI) similar to a five nt UMI in 3’ linkers. During size-selection, we restricted the footprint lengths to 18–34 nts. Matched RNA-seq libraries were prepared using RNA that was randomly fragmentation by incubating for 14 min at 95<sup>0</sup>C with in 1 mM EDTA, 6 mM Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, 44 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, pH 9.3. RNA-seq fragments were restricted to 18–50 nts. Ribosomal rRNA were removed from pooled RNA-seq and footprinting samples using RiboZero (Epicentre MRZH116). cDNA for the pooled libraries were PCR amplified for 16 cycles.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Ribosome profiling data processing and analysis</title><p>RNA-seq and footprinting reads were mapped to the yeast transcriptome using the riboviz pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carja et al., 2017</xref>).

This apparently accounts for the decreased nucleotide synthesis and nucleotide abundance observed in these mutants, with attendant induction of Gcn2-dependent Gcn4 translation and amino acid biosynthesis (shown previously to be induced by purine limitation). The mutants also exhibit elevated trehalose, whose synthesis by Tps2 is shown to mitigate the reduction in intracellular Pi levels and to support cell viability in the thiolation mutants. Furthermore, Pi starvation was shown to induce trehalose and Gcn4 in wild-type cells (although nucleotide synthesis/levels were not measured and probably should have been). They propose a model that tRNA thiolation is an intracellular signal for methionine/cysteine availability and that when thiolation drops it reduces nucleotide synthesis and cell division as an adaptive response by down-regulating PHO gene expression and intracellular Pi levels. This in turn diverts glucose utilization from glycolysis to trehalose synthesis, liberating Pi from glucose-6-Pi to ameliorate the Pi starvation and slow down cell growth and metabolism. The study does not provide a molecular basis for the down-regulation of PHO gene transcripts in the thiolation mutants; nor was it shown that starvation for Met or Cys would elicit the key phenotypic responses observed in the thiolation mutants, which would seem to be essential evidence for their model if it is not already demonstrated in the literature. The study also provides an apparently overlooked explanation for why trehalose increases on phosphate starvation-to release Pi from Glu-6-Pi-in addition to diverting glucose to a storage carbohydrate like glycogen; although they seem to overlook the fact that increased trehalose levels is a common response to many different kinds sorts of cellular stress.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Perform new experiments to show that limitation for the sulfur-containing amino acids and/or inorganic sulfate, elicits the same key responses seen for the thiolation mutants, to support the claim that tRNA thiolation is used as a sensor for sulfur levels.</p><p>2) Cite the appropriate literature from the Rabinowitz and Broach labs (Boer et al., 2010 and Klosinslka et al., 2011) showing that nucleotide levels are reduced on Pi starvation, to support the claim that the reduced nucleotide levels in the thiolation mutants can be attributed to the reduced Pi levels in these strains.</p><p>3) Measure the ATP/GTP levels (or at least AXP/GXP) in the thiolation mutants rather than relying on measurements of the much less abundant AMP/GMP.</p><p>4) Expand the analysis of the RNA-Seq data of Figure 5 to show and discuss all of the transcriptional changes for genes in the PPP and trehalose and glycogen pathways.</p><p>5) Use the proper time frame for the experiment in Figure 2 in order to measure the flux in the PPP and glycolysis pathways in the thiolation mutants, to confirm the rerouting hypothesis.</p><p>6) Discuss the possibility that lower flux in the PPP might result in low NADPH and attendant diminished sulfate assimilation under conditions where sulfur is already limiting.

They should examine the reporter lacking both uORF1 and uORF4 to determine whether the increased expression in the mutants is eliminated by removing both uORFs.</p><p>- Can the S phase delay, as well as the induction of Gcn4, in the thiolation mutants be rescued by supplementing cultures with nucleoside precursors or ribose-5-P to confirm that these phenotypes result from low nucleotide levels?</p><p>- Subsection “Phosphate depletion in wild-type cells phenocopies tRNA thiolation mutants” and Figure 5D: It should be determined whether the increase in Gcn4 protein level elicted by Pi starvation is abolished in a gcn2 mutant, as would be expected if phosphate starvation is mimicking the thiolation mutants.</p><p>- It seems important to determine whether nucleotide levels are reduced during Pi starvation, unless shown in the literature already, to support the claim that the reduced nucleotide levels in the thiolation mutants result from their reduced Pi levels.</p><p>- Subsection “Trehalose synthesis associated phosphate release enables cells to maintain phosphate balance”, second paragraph and Figure 6D: PHO gene expression is reduced in the thiolyation mutants. Why then should constitutively activating PHO genes under the control of Po2/Pho4 in a pho80 mutant be synthetic-sick with the thiolyation mutants? This needs to be explained more precisely than just a loss of phosphate homeostasis, which is too vague.</p><p>- Given that increased trehalose synthesis is a common response to different kinds of stress e.g. trehalose is an osmoprotectant – isn't it dangerous to ascribe to increased trehalose synthesis a specific role in mitigating the effects of reduced Pi levels in the thiolation mutants, and by extension, conditions of Met/Cys limitation? Wouldn't it make more sense to emphasize the role of increased trehalose synthesis in depleting Glucose-6-P levels, with attendant reduction in nucleotide synthesis and cell division when cells are limited for Met/Cys?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript entitled « A tRNA modification balances carbon and nitrogen metabolism by regulating phosphate homeostasis. » by Gupta and co-workers reveals a very interesting crosstalk between metabolic pathways in yeast. The authors take advantage of mutants lacking a specific tRNA-modification to reveal and decipher complex interactions between metabolic pathways. This work hence nicely illustrates how cells integrate signals resulting from various nutrient inputs. The general scheme emerging from the work is that lack of tRNA-thiolation somehow affects the regulation of phosphate metabolism and results in lower intracellular inorganic-phosphate. As a consequence, glucose-6P would be rerouted from the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to trehalose synthesis which releases inorganic phosphate. Lower flux in the PPP would limit nucleotide synthesis and thereby activate a Gcn4-dependent response.</p><p>Each of the metabolic and expression steps is well documented, however most of the mechanisms connecting the regulation processes are not elucidated nor discussed. Addressing (when possible) and/or discussing the following questions would improve and strengthen the manuscript:</p><p>1) What is the physiological signal mimicked by thiolation defective mutants? Since tRNA-thiolation reflects intracellular availability of sulfur containing amino-acids (Introduction, fourth paragraph) and since sulfur is mostly used for synthesis of methionine, cysteine and S-adenosylmethionine (Thomas and Kerjan, 1997, p. 503-532), does thiolation mirror sulfur availability? Would sulfur limitation recapitulate the thiolation-defect? this would strongly increase the overall interest of the paper.</p><p>2) What is the connection between tRNA-thiolation and PHO-genes down-regulation? Simple experiments would allow to genetically position the tRNA-thiolation mutants within the phosphate regulation scheme. For example, do the ncs2/uba4 mutants affect Pho4 nuclear localization? Systematic additivity and epistasis studies with PHO regulation-mutants could be carried out. Unexpectedly the double ncs2/uba4 mutants with pho80 (subsection “Trehalose synthesis associated phosphate release enables cells to maintain phosphate balance”, second paragraph) reveal a synthetic growth phenotype while these mutants should antagonize each other. As such this experiment does not support the model.</p><p>3) It is not clear how the rerouting from the PPP to trehalose synthesis takes place. The authors should show (Figure 4) and discuss the transcriptional response for all the genes of the PPP as well as the trehalose and glycogen pathways. Is transcriptional regulation responsible for the rerouting? Importantly the chosen time frame (Figure 2 and subsection “Carbon flux is routed towards storage carbohydrates in thiolation mutants”, first paragraph) did not allow to directly measure the flux in the PPP and glycolysis and therefore the rerouting hypothesis relies only on trehalose, AMP and GMP synthesis.</p><p>4) The proposed PPP to trehalose rerouting allows to recycle inorganic phosphate when carbon is plentiful and phosphate is scarce, however the lower flux in the PPP might result in low NADPH which is crucial for sulfate assimilation (the zwf1/met19 mutant is a strict methionine-auxotroph). Hence a decreased flux in the PPP could limit sulfur assimilation under conditions where sulfur might already be limiting (see point 1 above).</p><p>5) In the proposed model, activation of the Gcn4-dependent pathway is merely a consequence of the rerouting and is not responsible for lower phosphate or higher trehalose. This assumption could easily be verified by combining ncs2/uba4 and gcn4 mutations and measuring phosphate and trehalose in the double mutants.</p><p>6) The effect of tRNA-thiolation on nucleotides synthesis should also be documented at the level of tri-phosphates (not only AMP and GMP) since ATP and GTP are by far the most abundant nucleotides and more directly reflect intracellular nucleotide content. At least AXP and GXP could be shown. Similarly, measurements of intracellular dNTPs would be relevant to confirm cell cycle analyses/hypotheses.</p><p>7) I do not understand how the authors can normalize on &quot;cell number as well as biomass&quot;. I could not find the information in the Materials and methods section nor in the figure legend. This is a very important point that should be clarified. Cell number imperfectly reflects biomass if not corrected by the cell volume.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A tRNA modification balances carbon and nitrogen metabolism by regulating phosphate homeostasis&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Several of the original concerns have been satisfactorily addressed, but the following remain:</p><p>1) Perform new experiments to show that limitation for the sulfur-containing amino acids and/or inorganic sulfate, elicits the same key responses seen for the thiolation mutants, to support the claim that tRNA thiolation is used as a sensor for sulfur levels.</p><p>Figure 2G shows that absence of methionine elicits a much stronger response than the thiolation mutant does. Indeed, the increased flux toward AMP in the presence of methionine is diminished in the uba4 mutant but stays much higher than in the absence of methionine (same for either WT or uba4) and similar partial effects were observed for GMP (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D). These results indicate that tRNA thiolation contributes (very) partially to the methionine (sulfur) signal (when purine synthesis is used as a readout) suggesting the existence of other (yet unknown) mechanisms connecting sulfur and carbon metabolism. This should be discussed.</p><p>4) Expand the analysis of the RNA-Seq data of Figure 5 to show and discuss all of the transcriptional changes for genes in the PPP and trehalose and glycogen pathways.</p><p>As now shown (Figure 4C and Figure 4—figure supplement 3C) and stated by the authors &quot;there are very minor changes in either transcript or RPF for any of the genes in these pathways&quot;. Consequently, the molecular mechanism resulting in rerouting the carbon flux away from the PPP toward trehalose synthesis is clearly not at the RNA or protein expression levels and is not yet elucidated. Hence the last sentence of the Discussion &quot;we biochemically explain how phosphate homeostasis determines flux through different arms of carbon and nitrogen metabolism&quot; appears overstated to me.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44795.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Perform new experiments to show that limitation for the sulfur-containing amino acids and/or inorganic sulfate, elicits the same key responses seen for the thiolation mutants, to support the claim that tRNA thiolation is used as a sensor for sulfur levels.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point that requires a substantial response, which also allows us to more clearly explain inferences made from earlier studies. Multiple lines of evidence, based on published work, along with this study, suggest that tRNA thiolation is not a starvation response, but a growth response, i.e. tRNA thiolation enables cells to fully respond to the <italic>presence</italic> of sulfur amino acids, and not starvation /absence of sulfur/sulfur amino acids. The loss of tRNA thiolation results in a more subtle metabolic phenotype, and understanding this is the primary point of this manuscript. To clarify further, the connection of tRNA thiolation (and related modifications) with sulfur amino acids and sulfur comes from our earlier work that demonstrate the following: (i) when comparing the amounts of thiolated tRNAs in methionine rich medium vs. medium with less methionine, the amount of thiolated tRNAs increased with increasing methionine availability and vice versa (see Laxman et al., 2013, Figures 1C, 1D, 1F, and supplementary figures). (ii) This same study quantified the absolute amounts of sulfur amino acid metabolites, and compared it with amounts of thiolated tRNAs. Both methionine and thiolated tRNAs (and closely related modified tRNAs) were present at low μM amounts in cells in normal medium, i.e. the amount of tRNA thiolation reflected the availability of methionine. (iii) The amounts of thiolated tRNAs are highest in cells entering a ‘growth state’ (high ribosomal biosynthesis, entry into the cell cycle etc.), as suggested from that study, as well as earlier gene expression studies (e.g. Tu et al., 2005). (iv) in thiolation mutants, the proteins involved in methionine salvage and biosynthesis increase in amounts over time (Laxman et al., 2013), further suggesting a coupling between the thiolation pathway and methionine. (v) the key enzyme in the thiolation pathway, Uba4, is strongly regulated by methionine availability, decreasing in methionine limited medium. These together show the coupling of tRNA thiolation with methionine/sulfur amino acids, pointing towards a role for tRNA thiolation when sulfur amino acids are abundantly present. Separately, several recent studies have suggested a multi-component growth program when methionine is abundant (including Sutter et al. Cell 2013, Yi et al. Mol Cell 2017). Pertinently, our recent study defined a methionine induced anabolic program, which centred around two arms: an increase in carbon metabolism (particularly PPP flux) towards nucleotide synthesis, and an increased utilization of amino acids for the same, when methionine is abundant (Walvekar et al., 2018). Therefore, to demonstrate this coupling of tRNA thiolation with the presence of sulfur amino acids, and the full response of sulfur amino acids, the more appropriate experiment will be to compare carbon flux towards nucleotides (via the PPP, as also elaborated in response to point #5 below) when abundant methionine is provided. Here, the prediction would be that if tRNA thiolation aided the methionine mediated metabolic program, this increase in nucleotide synthesis due to methionine would be less in thiolation mutants, compared to WT cells. We therefore carried out the following experiment: in WT cells growing in minimal glucose medium, or in this medium supplemented with methionine, using labeled 13C glucose pulsed into the system, we measured flux of carbon incorporation into nucleotides (also see response to point #5 below). Here, methionine strongly increases carbon flux into nucleotides in WT cells. Notably, this methionine dependent, increased flux through this pathway is strikingly lower in the thiolation mutants. This shows that for the full metabolic response due to methionine, leading to increased carbon flux towards nucleotide synthesis, tRNA thiolation is required. These data are now included in the new Figures 2G, Figure 2—figure supplement 1D), and are explained in detail in a new Results subsection (“Methionine induced carbon flux to nucleotide synthesis is dampened in thiolation mutants”), and Discussion. This data therefore more directly substantiates the coupling of tRNA thiolation with <italic>increased</italic> sulfur amino acid (methionine) availability, and in regulating the overall metabolic output mediated by methionine.</p><p>We note that sulfur starvation is a separate, far more complex phenomenon. Given the central nature of sulfur for a variety of essential biochemical functions, cells have a complex, coordinated response to this. This includes a downregulation of all methylation reactions due to reduced SAM, a strong induction of the MET regulon, and sulfur salvage/assimilation pathways, and a large reduction in growth (including low carbon metabolism), as has been demonstrated in different studies. When there is sulfur starvation, there is almost no thiolated tRNAs, or the enzyme required to make thiolated tRNAs, as has been demonstrated (Laxman et al., 2013). So a clear experiment in this condition to directly probe the coupling of tRNA thiolation with the <italic>absence</italic> sulfur amino acids, is not obvious, nor is it likely to clarify the question at hand.</p><p>We will separately also note that an earlier study (Boer VM et al., 2010) has made a connection between phosphate starvation (the experiment performed), and sulfur metabolism, where (we quote): “In phosphorus limitation, one of the most striking transcriptional patterns was, intriguingly, not directly related to phosphate metabolism, but instead to sulfate. SUL1, MMP1, MHT1, CYS3, MUP1, and SAM1 were strongly repressed by phosphorus limitation, with SUL1 in phosphorus limitation showing the most positive growth rate slope of any gene in any condition. This suggests a strong relationship between phosphate limitation and sulfur metabolism.”These data parallel our data (with sulfur metabolism as a starting point) where we note a coupling between sulfur metabolism and phosphate metabolism. If tRNA thiolation is indeed coupled with sulfur metabolism, then such a down-regulation of phosphate metabolism when tRNA thiolation is absent would therefore be a logical prediction.</p><p>Finally, in relation to this, and for the reference of the reviewers, we include some additional data. We and others have worked with conditions where reduced sulfur (methionine and related metabolites) are limiting (e.g. Xi and Tu BP MBoC 2011, Sutter et al. Cell 2013, Walvekar et al., 2018 etc.). We analyzed some transcription data sets from Walvekar et al., 2018, as well as some unpublished datasets (unrelated to this manuscript) from an ongoing study. Here, we find that in cells present in medium supplemented with methionine (compared to cells in somewhat methionine-limited conditions), several genes related to phosphate metabolism are induced. Here, in these condition phosphate is not limiting. While this correlates with observations made in this study, w.r.t the thiolation mutants, this also suggests a deeper coupling between sulfur and phosphate metabolism. This certainly deserves a more substantial investigation in future studies, well beyond the scope of this manuscript. We include this preliminary data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>. We feel it is premature (and distracting) to include these data in this manuscript, since it takes away from the primary point of tRNA thiolation integrating methionine/sulfur sensing with overall metabolic outputs, via phosphate regulation. We hope collectively, we have sufficiently clarified and addressed all concerns raised.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44795-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Cite the appropriate literature from the Rabinowitz and Broach labs (Boer et al., 2010 and Klosinslka et al., 2011) showing that nucleotide levels are reduced on Pi starvation, to support the claim that the reduced nucleotide levels in the thiolation mutants can be attributed to the reduced Pi levels in these strains.</p></disp-quote><p>In our original submission, we had cited the Boer et al., 2010 and Klosinska et al., 2011 references, but had not fully described this important hallmark of Pi starvation, while describing how phosphate starvation phenocopied the metabolic switch observed in thiolation mutants.

This study shows that phosphate starvation itself results in a decrease in ribosomal genes. In the thiolation mutants, we also see slightly reduced ribosomal genes (RNA and ribo-seq), as shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 2C. Thus, this is an additional converging datapoint, where phosphate starvation phenocopies tRNA thiolation mutants. This is added to the Results subsection (“Phosphate depletion in wild-type cells phenocopies tRNA thiolation mutants”).</p><p>Summarizing additions in the text; in the result section where we show that phosphate starvation in the WT cells phenocopies thiolation mutants, we state that reduced nucleotides are a feature of phosphate starvation in WT cells (citing Boer et al., 2010, Klosinska et al., 2011), and that reduced ATP is a signature feature of phosphate starvation. We summarize our presented data where we show reduced de novo nucleotide synthesis (using both nitrogen and carbon labeling), as well as reduced steady state nucleotides, with an emphasis on the reduced ATP amounts observed in the thiolation mutants. This is summarized in the aforementioned Results subsection, and in the revised Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Measure the ATP/GTP levels (or at least AXP/GXP) in the thiolation mutants rather than relying on measurements of the much less abundant AMP/GMP.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point raised by the reviewers, therefore we would like to elaborate and clarify this point in detail. The reviewers are correct that at steady-state, the amounts of ATP/GTP are much higher than AMP/GMP. Indeed, nucleotides are synthesized as mono phosphates, and then eventually form di and triphosphates, and cycle between these states. Therefore, if measuring only steady state changes, it is essential to show levels of all these. However (in addition to steady-state levels of nucleoside monophosphates), we had included data from stable-isotope based flux analysis of nucleotide synthesis, using pulse-labels (of both nitrogen and carbon), using LC-MS/MS. Unlike changes observed in steady-state amounts of a metabolite (which can come due to decreased synthesis or increased utilization), this more directly addresses changes in rates of nucleotide synthesis, and since the di and tri phosphates are made from the monophosphates, presenting monophosphates alone is usually sufficient. Given this difference between steady-state measurements, and stable-isotope based flux experiments, it is now well accepted to show the synthesis of the nucleoside monophosphates, and to indicate carbon incorporation into nucleotides. This is commonly used in studies from cancer metabolism, where nucleotide synthesis is the focus (examples from the de Berardinis, Locasale, Vander Heiden and Maddocks groups: Huang F et al., Cell Metabolism 2018, 28(3):369-382.e5, Reid MA et al., Nature Communications 2018, 9: 5442, Lunt et al. Mol Cell 2015, Labuschagne et al. Cell Reports 2014). We have ourselves used this approach in other studies (e.g. descriptive methods paperWalvekar et al., 2018, Laxman et al. Sci Signal 2014, Walvekar et al., 2018 etc.). One reason for measuring NMPs alone; while using LC-mass spectrometry, resolving and detecting NXPs have different challenges. NMPs are easily detected in positive-polarity modes (MS/MS), and separated in aqueous-organic phases like 0.1% formic acid/methanol. NTPs however ionize and fragment best in negative polarity modes, and require different reverse phase columns/solvents to efficiently separate them. So it is difficult to get both NMP and NTP information within the same MS run.</p><p>However, since this was a particular point raised by the reviewers, we have carried out separate experiments and included ADP and ATP measurements. We compared steady-state ATP levels in WT and thiolation mutants using standard biochemical assays, and saw a similar reduction in steady state ATP as we did for steady state NMPs. This is included as a supporting figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B). Next, we developed/optimized a new LC-MS/MS method where AMP, ADP and ATP could all be reliably, quantitatively measured in the same run. This is now described in the Materials and methods section. Using this, we repeated a 13C-glucose stable-isotope based flux experiment (as we had done for NMPs), and measured relative label incorporation into ADP and ATP as well. Here, we clearly observed a significant decrease in the relative label incorporation into ADP and ATP in the thiolation mutants, largely mirrorring the data shown earlier for AMP and GMP. These data substantially strengthen the observation that the thiolation mutants have reduced nucleotide synthesis, and are now included as a new figure panel, now Figure 2C, D, and collectively summarized in the Results section primarily related to Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Expand the analysis of the RNA-Seq data of Figure 5 to show and discuss all of the transcriptional changes for genes in the PPP and trehalose and glycogen pathways.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We have included the analysis of transcriptional and ribosome-footprint changes in the genes related to the PPP, as well as trehalose/glycogen synthesis. This is now included as a new figure (Figure 4D), and also described in the text in the relevant Results subsection (“Loss of tRNA thiolation results in reduced phosphate homeostasis (PHO) related transcripts and ribosome-footprints”, third paragraph). As can be seen, there are very minor changes in either transcript or RPF for any of the genes in these pathways, in the thiolation mutants compared to WT cells. Indeed, including this data as a figure reiterates that the metabolic rewiring, in central carbon metabolism, is largely dictated by flux and mass-action. This strengthens our assertion that the causal control point in the tRNA thiolation mutants is the dampened <italic>PHO</italic> response. For summarizing and illustrating this overall point, we also now include a mega-violin plot, comparing both RNA and RPF (in WT vs. thiolation mutants), for genes related to <italic>PHO</italic>, the PPP, trehalose/gly synthesis, amino acid biosynthesis, nucleotide biosynthesis and ribosomal subunits (Figure 4—figure supplement 3C). This should address any concerns the reviewers might have.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Use the proper time frame for the experiment in Figure 2 in order to measure the flux in the PPP and glycolysis pathways in the thiolation mutants, to confirm the rerouting hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fair point raised by the reviewers, which requires some clarification. As explained earlier for point 1, this experiment itself was very challenging to carry out, for the following reason: Yeast cells have very high rates of glycolysis and the PPP in standard medium containing glucose as a carbon source. In yeast growing in glucose, because of the very high rate of glycolysis, label saturation is almost instantaneous (in a couple of minutes), immediately after addition of label, for most intermediates in glycolysis and the PPP. Hence, in yeast experiments to measure relative rates of newly synthesized early intermediates of the PPP, using pulse-labels of stable isotopes of glucose (and following labelled carbon incorporation) are challenging. This is due to the fact that it is difficult to label and properly quench metabolites/process samples in time-frames of &lt;5 min, and because most reliable measurements of metabolites require ~10 min post label addition for collection/processing. Indeed, even in more slowly growing, glucose addicted cancer cells, where flux is slower than yeast cells, and where longer time frames of sample collection after stable-isotope addition are used, changes in carbon label incorporation are usually seen with late PPP intermediates, e.g. ribose-5-phosphate. Therefore, even in these studies (performed in timescales of 30min-1 hour post label addition), carbon label incorporation into nucleotides (which come after ribose-5-phosphate) is accepted as an indicator of carbon flux via the PPP and one-carbon metabolism towards nucleotides (e.g., Reid MA et al., Nature Communications2018, 9: 5442, or Lunt et al. Mol Cell 2015). In yeast, given the even faster rates of glycolysis/PPP (compared to typical mammalian cells), it is therefore experimentally reliably possible to process samples only after a slightly longer time interval post label addition, which is why relative label incorporation into nucleotides is preferred. This was the reason we had initially presented data with carbon-label incorporation into NMPs, done ~5-10 minutes after labelled glucose addition. With the new data now included for carbon-label (from glucose) incorporation into ADP and ATP, as well as NMPs in Figures 2B, 2C and related text (also see response to point 3), we fully address this concern.</p><p>However, to directly address this point, we optimized even shorter time-points of metabolite extraction after 13C-glucose addition. In ~5 minutes, there already is substantial label saturation, so differences cannot be observed (shown inFigure 2—figure supplement 1B). Therefore, we attempted and reproducibly carried out experiments where metabolites were extracted/processed in &lt;2 minutes after 13C glucose addition. Here, we also observe a significant reduction in relative label incorporation into the late PPP intermediate (and nucleotide precursor) ribose-5-phosphate, in the thiolation mutants (new Figure 2D). This therefore nicely corroborates our conclusions made from the data shown reduced carbon label incorporation into nucleotides (AMP/ADP/ATP) (Figures 2B, C). Experimental note: This difference may be even larger if anyone manages to do such a label addition-quench-process experiment in &lt;1 minute, where label incorporation will be ideal, at &lt;20%. The <italic>only</italic> reference we found where such a flux experiment has been done in yeast in glucose medium, with such a rapid time-frame is (van Heerden et al., Science 2014). We hope all concerns are addressed now with these new data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Discuss the possibility that lower flux in the PPP might result in low NADPH and attendant diminished sulfate assimilation under conditions where sulfur is already limiting. Reduced sulfate assimilation could in turn limit thiolation and amplify the whole regulatory response.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for drawing this broader connection to NADPH, and allowing us to include a more nuanced discussion in this regard. We completely agree that nearly all of the thiolation mutant phenotypes can be explained based on NADPH flux and availability, and indeed believe this is so. We had not discussed this in the original submission, because any direct measurement and analysis of NADPH flux and pools in a rigorous, definitive way, is very difficult, and therefore it is difficult to obtain direct data to support this hypothesis. Demonstrated examples of reduction in NADPH flux, coming from decrease flux through the PPP and 1-carbon/folate cycles, have been shown only in rare studies like Fan J et al., Nature 2014, or Li Chen et al. Nature Metabolism (2019). Such studies require a combination of hydrogen-deuterium exchange and possibly mathematical modeling, and is beyond the capability of most labs in the world. Hence, we had cautiously avoided speculation and discussion in this regard. We have now included a nuanced discussion related to this point. As summarized earlier, the thiolation pathway allows a subtler, deeper coupling and integration of various nutrient cues, and modulation of metabolism, for enabling optimal growth. The collective result of the metabolic ‘squeeze’ exerted by the thiolation mutants, by restricting phosphate availability, is a reduction in flux through the PPP and one-carbon cycles, resulting in decreased nucleotide synthesis (as demonstrated). This will also decrease the production of NADPH, and reduce overall reductive biosynthesis capacity, and affect the assimilation of sulfates into sulfur amino acids. Conversely, in the presence of methionine, where there will be maximally thiolated tRNAs, we can connect two distinct observations. In an earlier study, we have shown that the presence of methionine itself increases flux through the PPP and carbon metabolism leading to nucleotide synthesis (Walvekar et al., 2018). We also show this more directly in this study (through measurements of carbon incorporation into nucleotide synthesis in the presence of methionine) (Figure 2G). Here, in the presence of methionine, the loss of thiolation results in a significantly smaller increase in this flux through this arm of carbon metabolism. Hence, the inferred amplified response in relation to tRNA thiolation would be as follows: in the presence of methionine, there is increased PPP and one-carbon flux towards nucleotide synthesis, which is amplified by the maximally thiolated tRNAs by ensuring sufficient phosphate availability. Conversely, reduced sulfate assimilation in turn limits thiolation, and thereby amplify the regulatory response, again using phosphate homeostasis as a control point. This is now an extended paragraph in the Discussion section (third paragraph).</p><p>For the information of the reviewers, we include a piece of data consistent with this interpretation: thiolation mutants show hydroxyurea (HU) sensitivity as shown in Figure 3E, and this would be as expected when there are decreased pools of nucleotides, and also explained by decreased NADPH pools available. Here, if this were true, one would predict a growth rescue in the presence of HU if excess reduced glutathione (GSH) is supplemented. This is because oxidized glutathione (GSSG) is reduced to GSH consuming two molecules of NADPH, and hence is a major sink of NADPH consumption. Further, GSH is itself made from sulfur amino acids, and is a major sink of reduced sulfur. By providing excess GSH, this sink can be relieved, and hence free up pools of NADPH. Notably, we now observe a rescue of HU sensitivity in the thiolation mutants upon supplementing GSH (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44795-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We however feel that including such data without directly showing changes in NADPH flux is premature. However, we are happy to include a measured Discussion section in this regard, to make a cautious, complete interpretation of our data.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined in each of the two reviews shown below.

Several of the original concerns have been satisfactorily addressed, but the following remain:</p><p>1) Perform new experiments to show that limitation for the sulfur-containing amino acids and/or inorganic sulfate, elicits the same key responses seen for the thiolation mutants, to support the claim that tRNA thiolation is used as a sensor for sulfur levels.</p></disp-quote><p>We optimized a simple sulfur-starvation experiment, and performed it as follows: We shifted WT cells growing in standard rich glucose medium, to either minimal glucose medium containing sufficient ammonium sulfate and other trace elements with inorganic sulfur, or to the same medium with sulfur limitation (where chloride salts replace the sulfate salts, as is described in Kankipati et al., 2015). Cells remained in this medium for ~2-4 hours (as described in the Materials and methods). At this time, we collected cells and measured sulfur amino acid related metabolites, and observed substantial decreases in the same, confirming sulfur amino acid limitation (now included as Figure 2—figure supplement 2A). Using this experimental set-up, we compared the key metabolic features of WT cells in this short-term sulfur limitation, with the thiolation mutants as a reference point. The key metabolic features of the thiolation mutants are (i) amino acid accumulation, (ii) decreased nucleotide amounts, and (iii) increased trehalose amounts (due to the re-routing of glucose towards storage carbohydrates). This is also accompanied by an induction of Gcn4 in the thiolation mutants. In WT cells subjected to short-term sulfur limitation, we observe (i) strong accumulation of amino acids (now included as Figure 2—figure supplement 2C), (ii) decreased nucleotides (decreased AMP is shown, now included as Figure 2—figure supplement 2D), and (iii) a strong increase in trehalose synthesis (now included as Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Finally, in a simple sulfur amino acid limitation shift experiment, we also see a strong induction of Gcn4 in the WT cells (now included as Figure 2—figure supplement 2F). For easy comparison, we show the results from the thiolation mutants side-by-side in these figures.</p><p>These data compellingly show that sulfur starvation phenocopies tRNA thiolation mutants.</p><p>After including these data, we make the following additions to the Results, stating:</p><p>“..Furthermore, in a converse experiment, we subjected WT cells to brief inorganic sulfur/sulfur amino acid limitation, to determine the metabolic signature of cells in this condition (experimental design shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2A).[…] Thus, WT cells subject to sulfur amino acid limitation phenocopied the metabolic signature tRNA thiolation mutants.”</p><p>Appropriate additions have also been made to the Materials and methods, and the supplementary figure legends.</p><p>We hope these data address all remaining concerns of the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2G shows that absence of methionine elicits a much stronger response than the thiolation mutant does. Indeed, the increased flux toward AMP in the presence of methionine is diminished in the uba4 mutant but stays much higher than in the absence of methionine (same for either WT or uba4) and similar partial effects were observed for GMP (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D). These results indicate that tRNA thiolation contributes (very) partially to the methionine (sulfur) signal (when purine synthesis is used as a readout) suggesting the existence of other (yet unknown) mechanisms connecting sulfur and carbon metabolism. This should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree that the tRNA thiolation does not regulate all methionine dependent responses. In fact we do not suggest these modifications as the sole regulators of methionine dependent responses. For absolute clarity, we have now included the following text stating “Notably, while the extent of this methionine-dependent induction of carbon flux into nucleotides was significantly reduced, it was not completely abolished in the thiolation mutant (Δuba4), indicating the involvement of additional as yet unknown pathways (Figure 2G, and Figure 2—figure supplement 1D).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Expand the analysis of the RNA-Seq data of Figure 5 to show and discuss all of the transcriptional changes for genes in the PPP and trehalose and glycogen pathways.</p><p>As now shown (Figure 4C and Figure 4—figure supplement 3C) and stated by the authors &quot;there are very minor changes in either transcript or RPF for any of the genes in these pathways&quot;.
