The disease is usually lethal, with patients rarely surviving more than a few years after diagnosis. There is no cure or effective treatment for the disease. It begins with the breakdown of the connections, or synapses, between the muscles and the nerve cells that connect with them. After this, the nerve cell itself breaks down. Many therapeutic approaches have focused on attempts to prevent the nerve cells from dying, but few target the initial degeneration of the synapse.</p><p>Cantor et al. asked if intervening when the synapse has already begun to break down could slow the progression of the disease in mice with ALS. Their approach involved using an antibody to bind to a receptor protein called MuSK, which plays an important role in maintaining the synapse between muscle and nerve cell. The antibody boosted the receptor’s activity, helping to preserve synapses, including those that connect nerve cells to the diaphragm muscle.</p><p>The experiments showed that the antibody treatment led to fewer synapses breaking down, and kept more of the nerve cells alive. Healthier connections between the nervous system and the diaphragm improved the function of this muscle. As a result, the mice given the antibody treatment had a slightly extended lifespan, compared with those given no treatment.</p><p>The findings suggest a possible new way to develop treatments for ALS, which could be used in combination with other therapies, such as those aimed at improving the health of the nerve cells. Together, this could improve quality of life for the majority of patients with ALS. Similar strategies could be used to develop treatments to preserve synapses in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease, as well as some kinds of dementia. Preserving synapses early on, before the significant loss of nerve cells, could help to slow the progression of these diseases, improve the patients' quality of life and extend their lifespans too.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</kwd><kwd>neuromuscular disease</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>motor neuron</kwd><kwd>agonist antibody</kwd><kwd>MuSK</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ALS Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burden</surname><given-names>Steven J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37 NS36193</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burden</surname><given-names>Steven J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 NS078375</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mentis</surname><given-names>George Z</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 NS86750</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cantor</surname><given-names>Sarah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An agonist antibody to MuSK, delivered after disease onset, decreases the loss of neuromuscular synapses, improves motor function and extends the lifespan of ALS mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that progresses relentlessly from a subtle decline in motor function to lethal respiratory paralysis within a few years of diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pasinelli and Brown, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Taylor et al., 2016</xref>).

Lrp4, a member of the LDL receptor family, is the muscle receptor for the critical neuronal ligand, Agrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Upon binding Agrin, Lrp4 associates with MuSK, a receptor tyrosine kinase, stimulating MuSK and leading to anchoring and enhanced expression of critical postsynaptic proteins, including Lrp4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burden et al., 2013</xref>). Clustered Lrp4 then signals back to motor axons to stimulate their attachment and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yumoto et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Recessive mutations in <italic>Agrin</italic>, <italic>Lrp4</italic> or <italic>Musk</italic> cause congenital myasthenia, a group of neuromuscular disorders, distinct from ALS, which compromise the structure and function of neuromuscular synapses and lead to muscle weakness and fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Engel et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, autoantibodies to Agrin, Lrp4, or MuSK cause myasthenia gravis (MG), which is likewise distinct from ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gilhus and Verschuuren, 2015</xref>). In MuSK MG, the pathogenic antibodies are usually directed to the first Ig-like domain in MuSK and reduce MuSK phosphorylation by impairing binding between Lrp4 and MuSK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huijbers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Koneczny et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Although defects in the MuSK signaling pathway are not associated with ALS, increasing <italic>MuSK</italic> gene expression stabilizes neuromuscular synapses in <italic>SOD1-G93A</italic> mice, reducing the extent of muscle denervation and improving motor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pérez-García and Burden, 2012</xref>). However, these experiments used transgenic mice to modestly increase <italic>MuSK</italic> expression from muscle, beginning during early development, several months prior to disease onset. Therefore, the therapeutic potential of increasing MuSK signaling as a strategy to reduce denervation and improve motor function in patients diagnosed with ALS remained unclear. Here, we sought to determine whether a pharmacological approach to increase MuSK activity in vivo would preserve neuromuscular synapses in <italic>SOD1-G93A</italic> mice when dosing was initiated after disease onset.

Currently, there is an unmet need for therapies that significantly alter the course of disease. Here, we describe a therapeutic approach designed to slow the loss of motor innervation to muscle by targeting a well-defined molecule and mechanism for forming and maintaining neuromuscular synapses. We show that an agonist antibody to MuSK, introduced after disease onset, decreases muscle denervation, improves motor system output, reduces motor neuron loss and extends survival in an aggressive mouse model of ALS. If this strategy, described here for an aggressive mouse model of ALS, were similarly successful in preserving innervation in sporadic and familial ALS, this therapeutic approach would have the potential to improve the quality of life for ALS patients, and as such warrants further study.</p><p>Anti-sense RNA directed toward <italic>SOD1</italic> is currently being tested as a promising therapeutic for ALS caused by mutations in <italic>SOD1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miller et al., 2013</xref>). A similar approach may ultimately be effective for other dominant, familial forms of ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Reddy and Miller, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">van Zundert and Brown, 2017</xref>). However, &gt;80% of ALS patients are diagnosed with sporadic ALS, so strategies to inactivate a single culprit gene are not tenable for most cases of ALS. Instead, multiple, concurrent therapeutic interventions that effectively address the pathology and symptoms of ALS will likely be necessary to alter the course of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brown and Al-Chalabi, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Because synaptic loss and muscle denervation are common to sporadic as well as familial forms of ALS, the approach described here has the potential to be effective for both forms of ALS. Moreover, increasing MuSK activity and retrograde signaling may also slow the deterioration of neuromuscular synapses in other neuromuscular diseases and during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Engel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gilhus and Verschuuren, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Valdez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Poort et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with this idea, adenoviral expression of Dok-7, an inside-outside activator of MuSK, not only extends longevity of <italic>SOD1-G93A</italic> mice but also provides benefit in other mouse models of neuromuscular disease, including congenital myasthenia and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Miyoshi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arimura et al., 2014</xref>). Further, there is increasing evidence that synaptic loss occurs early during disease progression in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and Frontotemporal dementia and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Henstridge et al., 2016</xref>), so similar strategies, designed to preserve synapses, may slow progression in these diseases as well.</p><p>Our proof of concept experiments were designed to determine whether boosting retrograde signaling in vivo with the MuSK agonist antibody might slow motor axon withdrawal and muscle denervation in <italic>SOD1-G93A</italic> mice. As such, we introduced the MuSK agonist antibody after denervation was already evident, during the early phase of denervation in female <italic>SOD1-G93A</italic> mice and mid-phase in male <italic>SOD1-G93A</italic> mice, but before <italic>SOD1-G93A</italic> mice exhibited overt and severe deficits in limb motor function. This timing for delivery of the MuSK agonist antibody may be pertinent and significant for ALS, as denervation is the cause of muscle fibrillations, an early clinical sign in ALS. Because MuSK-dependent retrograde signaling is likely to act focally on nerve terminals and axons that are near the postsynaptic membrane and to be less effective in promoting regeneration of axons that have fully withdrawn, early delivery of a MuSK agonist is likely to be more effective than later delivery in ALS.</p><p>However, ALS is a diagnosis of exclusion, leading to delays in diagnosis. Nonetheless, even at late stages of disease, a majority of synapses in <italic>SOD1-G93A</italic> mice are partially innervated, and the MuSK agonist antibody improved nerve terminal coverage at these partially innervated synapses. These findings suggest that the MuSK agonist antibody may also be effective if introduced later during disease. However, because overt motor deficits become evident in <italic>SOD1-G93A</italic> mice only a month before death, this aggressive mouse model of ALS may not be the optimal and most informative model to infer whether later introduction of the MuSK agonist antibody can stabilize synapses and slow motor dysfunction in ALS.</p><p>The loss of motor neurons during embryonic development is regulated, at least in part by synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hollyday and Hamburger, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tanaka and Landmesser, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Landmesser, 1992</xref>). The increased survival of motor neurons in MuSK agonist antibody-injected <italic>SOD1-G93A</italic> mice indicates that adult motor neurons can likewise receive trophic support from muscle. Thus, preserving neuromuscular synapses not only maintains the essential attachment of nerve to muscle but also provides the added benefit of promoting motor neuron survival.</p><p>Although we used an agonist antibody to MuSK to stimulate retrograde signaling from muscle, one can envisage other approaches to stimulate MuSK or enhance retrograde signaling in order to maintain attachment of motor axons to muscle. The MuSK agonist antibody is effective at maintaining neuromuscular synapses in <italic>SOD1-G93A</italic> mice up to P162, but within the next week, synapses are lost, and the mice die. Because the MuSK agonist antibody is designed to maintain neuromuscular synapses and does not directly target or address the underlying cause of the disease and other pathologies in <italic>SOD1-G93A</italic> mice and ALS, the benefit of increasing retrograde signaling from muscle to nerve and promoting nerve terminal attachment is limited. Nonetheless, although the antibody cannot override the many pathological pathways that occur in the motor neuron and in non-neuronal cells, this therapeutic approach has a potent effect on the course of disease, reducing synaptic loss, improving motor output and extending the lifespan of <italic>SOD1-G93A</italic> mice longer than riluzole, the long-standing FDA approved treatment for ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jablonski et al., 2014</xref>). Motor neuron cell death is a critical feature in ALS, but elimination of Bax, which prevents apoptotic cell death, fails to preserve neuromuscular synapses and increases survival of <italic>SOD1-G93A</italic> mice by only 20 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gould et al., 2006</xref>). Together with our studies, these findings give credence to the idea that combinatorial therapeutic interventions, including those that preserve neuromuscular synapses, will be necessary to fully address the complex pathology and symptoms of ALS and contribute to an improved quality of life for patient and family.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

id="s4-1"><title>Study design</title><p>The investigators were blinded from knowing whether mice were treated with the MuSK agonist or control antibody while acquiring and initially analyzing data. Data are presented as mean ±SEM. Statistical comparisons between groups were analyzed using an unpaired, two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, log-rank test (survival), linear regression (CMAPs), or two-way ANOVA (failures). Statistical analyses were conducted using Prism 7.0 software (GraphPad Software). The number (n) of mice used to calculate the mean, SEM values and the confidence limits (p values) are indicated in the figure legends.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Mice</title><p>The copy number of the human <italic>SOD1-G93A</italic> gene was routinely quantified by TaqMan real-time PCR and normalized to GAPDH (Life Technologies Assay# Mm00186822_cn). All mice included in this study had 21–26 copies of <italic>hSOD1-G93A</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). DietGel 76A (ClearH<sub>2</sub>0) was placed on the cage floor so that mice had ready access to nourishment. Others have measured the lifespan <italic>SOD1-G93A</italic> mice by placing mice on their side and sacrificing mice if they were unable to right themselves in 15 s. Because we were concerned that this assay reported on limb muscle function and may not be temporally aligned with the time of death, we used a variant assay, which provided an accurate measure of longevity. When mice were unable to right themselves to eat or drink over the course of several hours, they invariably succumbed within a day; we defined this time as disease end-point and sacrificed mice at this time. Mice were housed and maintained according to Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee (IACUC) guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Histology</title><p>Diaphragm muscles were stained with Alexa 594-conjugated α-bungarotoxin (α-BGT) (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) to mark AChRs and rabbit antibodies to Neurofilament-L (SYnaptic Systems, Goettingen, Germany) and Synapsin 1/2 (SYynaptic Systems, Goettingen, Germany) to label axons and nerve terminals, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jaworski and Burden, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Friese et al., 2007</xref>). At fully innervated synapses, nerve terminal staining completely overlapped with postsynaptic AChRs, whereas nerve terminals were absent from original synaptic sites, marked by AChRs, at fully denervated synapses. At partially innervated synapses, nerve terminals occupied only a portion of the postsynaptic membrane. We examined a minimum of 50 synapses in the diaphragm muscle from each mouse and designated each synapse as fully innervated, partially innervated, or fully denervated. At each partially innervated synapse, the percentage of AChR-stained postsynaptic membrane that was apposed by Synapsin-stained nerve terminals was quantified using Volocity imaging software (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). To visualize and quantify staining of the agonist antibody, containing human Fc, at the neuromuscular junction, we used an Alexa 647-conjugated anti-human secondary (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Whole mounts of muscles were imaged with a Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscope, and the fluorescent signal was quantified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jaworski and Burden, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Friese et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Spinal cords were dissected from mice perfused with 4% formaldehyde. Frozen sections (20 μm) of the lumbar region were stained with antibodies to choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) (AB144P-200UL from Millipore, Billerica, MA). We defined motor neurons as cells in the ventral horn of the lumbar spinal cord that were positive for ChAT, excluding ChAT-positive preganglionic and Pitx2-positive neurons. We only counted ChAT-stained cells with a clearly defined nucleus in order to avoid double-counting motor neurons in multiple sections. We analyzed ~10 sections, evenly spaced in the lumbar enlargement, which together contained &gt;50 motor neurons in each mouse.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Antibody-binding and MuSK phosphorylation</title><p>Chimeric antibodies were produced by transferring cDNAs encoding the variable regions of MuSK agonist antibody #13 to expression vectors containing the mouse kappa and IgG2a constant region. MuSK agonist antibodies were produced in CHO cells and purified by Protein A and size exclusion chromatography. The activity of the reverse chimera antibody for stimulating clustering of AChRs in C2 myotubes was similar to that for the human agonist antibody to MuSK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Fab fragments were prepared by protease digestion of human IgG1 followed by removal of uncleaved IgG and Fc fragments on a Protein A Sepharose column and size exclusion chromatography.</p><p>We used a solid-phase binding assay to measure binding between the MuSK agonist antibody and the extracellular (ecto) region (E22 to T494), the first three Ig-like domains (E22 to I103) or the Frizzled-like domain (D312 to K456) from mouse MuSK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). Maxisorp plates were coated with MuSK agonist antibody #13 (5μg/ml), and subsequently incubated with 8-His-tagged MuSK proteins, followed by a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated antibody to 8-His. Bound HRP was quantified by measuring HRP activity (Thermo scientific#34028).</p><p>C2C12 muscle cells were purchased from the ATCC and were not tested for mycoplasma prior to use. These C2C12 muscle cells, as well as immortalized wild type or <italic>Lrp4</italic> mutant muscle cells, were differentiated and treated with either neural Agrin (1 nM) or antibodies (10 nM). MuSK was immunoprecipitated from lysates, and MuSK expression and MuSK tyrosine phosphorylation were measured by probing Western blots, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Herbst and Burden, 2000</xref>). C2C12 cells were grown in 24-well culture plates in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) until myoblasts were 70% confluent. Myoblasts were then allowed to differentiate into myotubes by replacing the FBS with 2% horse serum. After 7 days, the cultures were treated for 16 hr with varying concentrations of rcMuSK antibody #13 or a Fab from antibody MuSK #13. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with Alexa 488 conjugated- α-BGT. Two to four images were collected from each well, and the number of AChR clusters was analyzed using imageJ software. Neural Agrin (10 nM) (R and D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was used as a positive control for AChR clustering (data not shown).</p><p>Hind-limb muscles were denervated by cutting the sciatic nerve, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Simon et al., 1992</xref>). Four days after denervation, mice were injected with MuSK agonist antibody #13, and we measured MuSK expression and MuSK tyrosine phosphorylation 3 days later. MuSK and Dok-7 were immunoprecipitated from lysates, and their expression levels were determined by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Herbst and Burden, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hallock et al., 2010</xref>). MuSK tyrosine phosphorylation was measured by probing Western blots with antibody 4G10, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Herbst and Burden, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hallock et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Recording and evaluation of compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) from the diaphragm muscle</title><p>To assess the function of neuromuscular junction in the mouse diaphragm muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), we developed an ex vivo phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation. We studied the diaphragm muscle from ~P140 male and ~P150 female mice, which is three to four weeks prior to end-stage, respectively. We did not use the in vivo preparation, described by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lepore et al., 2011</xref>), because we were concerned that in vivo stimulation of the phrenic nerve, at moderate to high frequencies, would lead to variable and unreliable CMAP recordings, likely due to changes in the electrode position caused by muscle contraction. Moreover, a related method, reported to record from the mouse diaphragm muscle, uses a surface recording electrode, and likely monitors the activity of multiple thoracic muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Martin et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, following anesthesia with 5% isoflurane, mice were decapitated, and the diaphragm muscle, together with the phrenic nerve, was quickly isolated and transferred to a customized recording chamber. The chamber was perfused continuously with oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) artificial cerebrospinal fluid solution (128.25 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 0.58 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 21 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 30 mM D-glucose, 1.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>) at a rate of ~10 ml/min at room temperature (~20–24°C). The phrenic nerve that innervates the left hemi-diaphragm muscle was stimulated by drawing the distal part of the left phrenic nerve into a suction electrode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We validated proper positioning of the stimulating electrode by visually inspecting muscle contractions following stimulation of the phrenic nerve. EMG activity was recorded using a suction electrode placed in the upper left quadrant of the muscle, 1 mm toward the costal side of the main intramuscular nerve and endplate zone in the middle of the muscle. A light suction was applied to the recording electrode to secure a tight seal between the tip of the electrode and the muscle fibers. In this manner, damage to the diaphragm muscle was avoided, which was confirmed by observing muscle contractions during stimulation. The phrenic nerve was stimulated with square pulses (0.2 ms in duration) at several frequencies (1 Hz to 50 Hz) for 60 s. The intensity of stimulation was progressively increased from the threshold, defined as the minimum response in three out of five trials, until the CMAP reached a maximal response.</p><p>The stimulation intensity was set at twice the intensity required for the maximal response to ensure a supra-maximal intensity of stimulation (25µA to 200µA). Recordings were accepted for analysis only when the CMAP amplitude (peak-to-peak) was unchanged following 1 Hz stimulation. The amplitudes of the evoked CMAPs at higher frequencies were expressed as a percentage of the first evoked CMAP for the entire duration of stimulation. Recordings were fed to an A/D interface (Digidata 1440A, Molecular Devices) and acquired with Clampex (v10.2, Molecular Devices) at a sampling rate of 50 kHz. Data were analyzed off-line using Clampfit (v10.2, Molecular Devices). We defined CMAP failures as the absence of an evoked response discernable from the background noise recorded prior to the stimulation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Martin Raff, Ruth Lehmann and Maartje Huijbers for their comments on the manuscript.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Didier Stainier (Senior Editor) and five reviewers, one of whom, Jonathan Glass (Reviewer #4), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Mark Rich (Reviewer #1); Victor Faundez (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Denervation of skeletal muscle is an early and prominent pathological feature of animal models as well as human ALS. Here, Cantor, et al., extend Dr. Burden's previous publication demonstrating that genetic manipulation of MuSK expression reduces progressive denervation in the <italic>G93A SOD1</italic> mouse model of ALS. The authors show that intraperitoneal administration of an agonist antibody to MuSK started at symptom onset (P90) delays denervation of the diaphragm, decreases motor neuron loss in the lumbar spinal cord, and modestly prolongs survival. The data are well-presented and compelling, providing nice proof of principle for this mechanism of action for further therapy development as a pharmacological approach to prevention of denervation in ALS and other denervating diseases. Furthermore, this intervention is agnostic to the underlying cause of denervation, and may be applicable to both genetic and non-genetic causes of ALS.</p><p>The reviewers were generally positive about the data presented, but raised some concerns. The importance of improving survival by only several days in this animal model was questioned. You mention in your final paragraph in the Discussion that &quot;this antibody cannot override the many pathological pathways that occur in the motor neuron and other non-neuronal cells&quot;, and that this would represent an addition to a &quot;combinatorial&quot; intervention. You might expand on this message by referring to the models that show little effect on survival when motor neuron cell bodies alone are protected without protection of NMJs.</p><p>There was also concern about the translational potential of this approach using repeated injections of an antibody. Specifically, there was a concern that repeated injections would generate an immune response to the antibody, causing a myasthenia-like disorder or even accelerated denervation. Please address this issue in your revised manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the Introduction, the authors state &quot;Although defects in the MuSK signaling pathway are not associated with ALS&quot;. However, it was recently reported that <italic>SOD1-G93A</italic> myofibers show reduced AChR clustering associated with markedly reduced MuSK and phospho-MuSK levels in vitro and in vivo (120 days, hind-limb muscles, Vilmont et al., 2016, Scientific Reports, doi: 10.1038/srep27804. It is not determined by Vilmont and colleagues whether the drop in MuSK is a cause or a consequence of denervation, nevertheless this may be a major factor in the limitation of MuSK agonist therapy as animals approach end-stage. The authors should discuss this and consider showing levels of MuSK and phospho-MuSK over time in treated vs. untreated animals if muscle tissue is still available from treated mice.</p><p>2) The authors initially present pharmacokinetic data using a human antibody, and then transition to a mouse reverse chimera for chronic dosing. The human PK data is used to guide the dosing strategy. While the potency of these antibodies is identical for inducing AChR clustering in vitro, the blood levels of mouse antibody achieved at 10 mg/ml are only in the range of 1-2 µg/ml (Figure 4—figure supplement 1), whereas the human antibody produced initial levels from 50-100 µg/ml (Figure 2). If this is the case, the authors need to show NMJ saturation levels and validate MuSK phosphorylation in vivo with the mouse dosing paradigm, as these levels are considerably lower.</p><p>3) The authors do not confirm that the reverse chimera antibody is triggering MuSK phosphorylation in the treated <italic>SOD1-G93A</italic> mice. If the blood levels achieved with the mouse antibody are really 50-100 times lower, it becomes quite important to validate that receptors are being saturated (straightforward immunostaining as was done in Figure 2, and phospho-MuSK vs. MuSK Western blot as was done in Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><p>4) Do the authors have any data on NMJ morphology or physiology in muscles other than diaphragm?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34375.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] The reviewers were generally positive about the data presented, but raised some concerns.

As suggested, we have added a statement and reference in the Discussion referring to models that show a similar effect on survival when motor neuron cell death is prevented without protecting neuromuscular synapses: “Motor neuron cell death is a critical feature in ALS, but elimination of Bax, which prevents apoptotic cell death, fails to preserve neuromuscular synapses and increases survival of <italic>SOD1-G93A</italic> mice by only 20 days (Gould et al., 2006). Together with our studies, these findings give credence to the idea that combinatorial therapeutic interventions, including those that preserve neuromuscular synapses, will be necessary to fully address the complex pathology and symptoms of ALS and contribute to an improved quality of life for patient and family.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There was also concern about the translational potential of this approach using repeated injections of an antibody.
