contributes to learning and memory, but how the coordination of action potentials of neuronal ensembles with the hippocampal local field potential (LFP) is reflected in dynamic calcium activity remains unclear. Here, we recorded hippocampal calcium activity with endoscopic imaging of the genetically encoded fluorophore GCaMP6 with concomitant LFP in freely behaving mice. Dynamic calcium activity was greater in exploratory behavior and REM sleep than in quiet wakefulness and slow wave sleep, behavioral states that differ with respect to theta and septal cholinergic activity, and modulated at sharp wave ripples (SWRs). Chemogenetic activation of septal cholinergic neurons expressing the excitatory hM3Dq DREADD increased calcium activity and reduced SWRs. Furthermore, inhibition of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) reduced calcium activity while increasing SWRs. These results demonstrate that hippocampal dynamic calcium activity depends on behavioral and theta state as well as endogenous mAChR activation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>calcium imaging</kwd><kwd>acetylcholine</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>freely behaving</kwd><kwd>sleep</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006592</institution-id><institution>Fidelity Biosciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hyman</surname><given-names>Bradley T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006592</institution-id><institution>Fidelity Biosciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gomperts</surname><given-names>Stephen N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01 AG054551</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gomperts</surname><given-names>Stephen N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dynamic calcium activity in the hippocampus changes markedly across behavioral and physiological states and depends on muscarinic acetylcholine receptor activation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Prominent oscillations in the hippocampal local field potential (LFP) entrain neuronal activity across behavioral states. The theta rhythm, a 5–12 Hz oscillation dependent on cholinergic and GABAergic inputs from the medial septum, predominates during exploratory behavior and characterizes REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Winson, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rawlins et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lawson and Bland, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buzsáki, 2005</xref>). In contrast, during quiet wakefulness and slow wave sleep, states of low cholinergic tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kametani and Kawamura, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marrosu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buzsáki et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zylla et al., 2013</xref>), the LFP transitions to irregular activity punctuated by sharp wave-ripples (SWRs), brief, high frequency oscillations in the local field potential associated with bursts of neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buzsáki et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buzsáki, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Recently, large scale imaging of neuronal somatic calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) activity in behaving animals has been employed as a proxy for electrical recording of action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dombeck et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dombeck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ziv et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sheffield and Dombeck, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hamel et al., 2015</xref>). However, the impact of these behavioral and electrophysiologic states on dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity is unknown. The tight relation between single action potentials and Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in reduced preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ohkura et al., 2012</xref>) supports the expectation that Ca<sup>2+</sup> events, like action potentials, would coordinate with theta and SWRs. However, neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels can be regulated by modification of ionic conductances and by release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores, the latter a process dependent on InsP3 and ryanodine receptor signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stutzmann and Mattson, 2011</xref>). As both of these mechanisms are subject to modulation, these observations raise the possibility that the coordination of hippocampal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity with LFP oscillations may depend on neuromodulators such as acetylcholine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lewis and Shute, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Teles-Grilo Ruivo and Mellor, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Medial septal cholinergic neurons densely innervate the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mizumori et al., 1990</xref>) where they play a key role in hippocampal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Teles-Grilo Ruivo and Mellor, 2013</xref>). Their ablation significantly impairs hippocampal dependent learning and memory, and this effect is recapitulated with muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Winson, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mizumori et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hasselmo, 2006</xref>). ACh has many actions in the hippocampus. It contributes to hippocampal theta, reduces SWR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vandecasteele et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Norimoto et al., 2012</xref>), and selectively enhances entorhinal cortex afferents relative to those from CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hasselmo, 2006</xref>). At the single neuron level, ACh depolarizes pyramidal cells and reduces both spike frequency adaptation and the slow afterhyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Teles-Grilo Ruivo and Mellor, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hasselmo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giocomo and Hasselmo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown and Adams, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernández de Sevilla and Buño, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cole and Nicoll, 1983</xref>). In addition, via a muscarinic mechanism, ACh has been shown to increase the rate of large somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients via release from InsP3-sensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Power and Sah, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2008</xref>) and to uncouple Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent K<sup>+</sup> conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Müller and Connor, 1991</xref>). These observations suggest that physiologic changes in cholinergic activity, across the sleep-wake cycle and across LFP states, might have profound effects on dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity.</p><p>To determine the relation between hippocampal physiologic state and Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity across behavioral states and the sleep-wake cycle, here we imaged dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in neurons of the CA1 pyramidal cell layer and acquired concomitant LFP recordings as mice performed a spatial task and subsequently slept. To evaluate a causal role for medial septal cholinergic neurons, we blocked mAChRs pharmacologically and drove ACh release via selective expression and activation of the excitatory DREADD hM3Dq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Roth, 2016</xref>) in medial septal cholinergic neurons. We found that neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity was markedly more robust during theta- and ACh-associated exploratory behavior and REM sleep compared to quiet wakefulness and slow wave sleep. In addition, somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity was strongly modulated around SWR events. Further, hM3Dq-mediated activation of medial septal ACh neurons increased dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity while reducing SWRs, and somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity - in both wildtype animals and in chemogenetically activated animals expressing hM3Dq in septal cholinergic neurons - was markedly suppressed with the muscarinic AChR (mAChR) antagonist scopolamine. Together, these results demonstrate that hippocampal dynamic calcium activity depends on behavioral and LFP state as well as on endogenous mAChR activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Coordination of hippocampal dynamic calcium activity across behavior</title><p>We imaged somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity from CA1 neurons and simultaneously recorded LFP as mice traversed a linear track and subsequently rested quietly and slept in a post-behavioral recording session (n = 5 mice, cells/session: 88, 119, 130, 134, 171; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Ca<sup>2+</sup> event rates were markedly higher in run behavior (&gt;3 cm/sec) than in all other states and were lowest in SWS (post-hoc comparisons with run: quiet wakefulness, p=0.007; slow wave sleep, p=0.003; REM, p=0.011; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Interestingly, with the advent of REM sleep, Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity increased from slow wave sleep to levels approaching those observed during wakefulness (REM <italic>vs.</italic> slow wave sleep, p=0.050; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). There was also a significant main effect of behavioral state on Ca<sup>2+</sup> event amplitudes (repeated measures ANOVA: F <sub>(3, 12)</sub>=4.488, p=0.025; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). In post-hoc comparisons, Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitudes were significantly smaller in slow wave sleep than in run behavior (p=0.042) or quiet wakefulness (p=0.032). Multiunit activity was not markedly modulated across behavioral states in these recordings (repeated measures ANOVA: F <sub>(2, 6)</sub>=0.591, p=0.544; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>), although a microscope-associated electrical noise artifact prevented contrasts of run behavior with other behavioral states. As expected, there was a significant main effect of behavioral state on theta power (repeated measures ANOVA excluding REM: F <sub>(2,8)</sub>=20.468, p=0.001), with higher theta power in exploratory behavior than quiet wakefulness and SWS (post hoc comparisons with run: quiet wakefulness, p=0.003; slow wave sleep, p=0.015; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Distributions of instantaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> event rates often had a small secondary peak above 0.5 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). The majority of these Ca<sup>2+</sup> event bursts, defined using this 0.5 Hz threshold, were movement-associated (p=6.5×10<sup>−5</sup>, paired t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). Even so, we did not detect a consistent relationship between animal speed and Ca<sup>2+</sup> event rates at the individual or group level. Thus, dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity varied dramatically with behavior and across the sleep wake cycle, with substantially higher rates of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events during the high theta conditions of running behavior and REM sleep.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39777.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Simultaneous dynamic calcium imaging and local field potential (LFP) recording in hippocampus across behavioral states.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic.

In SWR events, synchronized depolarizations drive large populations of CA1 neurons to fire. To determine whether such activity patterns are reflected in the coordination of neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity with SWRs, as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Malvache et al., 2016</xref>), we evaluated Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity triggered on SWR events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). There was a significant main effect of timing relative to SWRs on Ca<sup>2+</sup> event rates (repeated measures ANOVA: F <sub>(2, 14)</sub>=10.802, p=0.004; n = 8 mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, left). Interestingly, this approach detected a robust reduction in somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in association with SWRs, compared to baseline 2–5 s earlier and the immediate 1–2 s post-SWR period (post-hoc comparisons: Pre <italic>vs.</italic> SWR, p=0.022; Post <italic>vs.</italic> SWR, p=0.005; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F and J</xref>, left).

Place cells, cells with Ca<sup>2+</sup> event place fields on the track, showed a similar reduction of activity around SWR events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To refine the temporal relationship between Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and SWRs, we first accounted for the delay between Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient detection, defined as the time at which the event reached 20% of its maximum amplitude, and the start of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients on average (0.114 ± 0.001 s; n = 7 mice). Accounting for this delay, the maximal reduction in Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity preceded SWR onset by 0.189 ± 0.118 s. To enrich for dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity capable of reflecting SWR-associated synaptic activity, we took advantage of extra-somatic GCaMP6f expression in dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Consistent with the capacity for Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to detect the SWR-associated synaptic barrage with temporal fidelity, SWRs were associated with a time-locked (mean ± s.e.: −0.04 ± 0.10 s) change in the extra-somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluorescence of the neuropil, with a nonsignificant increase followed by a significant, delayed reduction (repeated measures ANOVA: F <sub>(2, 12)</sub>=15.627, p=0.003, n = 7 animals; post-hoc comparisons: Pre <italic>vs.</italic> SWR, p=0.130; Pre <italic>vs.</italic> Post, p&lt;0.001; SWR <italic>vs.</italic> Post, p=0.003; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and K</xref>, left). To independently assess the temporal alignment of the LFP and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluorescence data, we placed a stimulating electrode in contralateral CA3 to activate the commissural pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gruart et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dong et al., 2008</xref>) and evoke both a field EPSP and an associated change in GCaMP6f fluorescence in CA1 neurons. Stimulation evoked a field EPSP with mean latency 20.8 ± 0.7 ms and an associated increase in somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluorescence that started within 66.7 ± 16.7 ms (1.3 ± 0.3 samples) and peaked within 100 ± 0 ms (2 ± 0 samples; n = 3 animals; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Accounting for this offset and the ~190 ms offset delineated above further advances the timing of dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity relative to SWR onset. Together, these results support the observation that dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity transiently falls in the immediate pre-SWR period.</p><p>The unexpected absence of a detectable increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity at SWRs led us to consider the possibility that such an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity may depend on SWR dynamics. We therefore compared Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity triggered on single, isolated SWRs to Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity triggered on trains of discrete SWRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buzsáki et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>) anticipated to provide a more effective somatic depolarization. Transient reduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> event rates was preserved when triggered on SWR singlets (repeated measures ANOVA: F <sub>(2, 14)</sub>=9.628, p=0.005; post-hoc comparisons: Pre <italic>vs.</italic> SWR, p=0.033; Post <italic>vs.</italic> SWR, p=0.007, n = 8 animals; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F and J</xref>, Middle), without clear evidence for a subsequent increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> event rates (Post <italic>vs.</italic> Pre, p=0.11). In contrast, when selectively triggered on the last SWR in a SWR train, Ca<sup>2+</sup> event rates transiently increased (repeated measures ANOVA: F <sub>(2, 14)</sub>=9.145, p=0.003; post-hoc comparisons: Pre <italic>vs.</italic> SWR, p=0.447; Pre <italic>vs.</italic> Post, p=0.003; SWR <italic>vs.</italic> Post, p=0.010 n = 8 animals; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F and J</xref>, Right). SWR singlets and trains showed only trend level fluorescence changes in the neuropil (repeated measures ANOVA: Singlets: F <sub>(2, 12)</sub>=2.242, p=0.149; Trains: F <sub>(2, 12)</sub>=2.984, p=0.089; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and K</xref>, Middle and Right). These results show that while a transient suppression of dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity precedes SWRs, trains of temporally clustered SWRs are capable of eliciting a robust increase in dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity.</p><p>To further evaluate the relationship of SWR trains to Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity, we also performed an inverse analysis, in which we evaluated the LFP associated with synchronous Ca<sup>2+</sup> events across neurons. Synchronous events were relatively rare (10 ± 6 per recording, n = 6 animals). Even so, consistent with prior reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Malvache et al., 2016</xref>), 12.6 ± 5.6% of synchronous Ca<sup>2+</sup> events time coincided with SWRs. Compared to temporally shuffled data, 4.9 ± 3.1% of synchronous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities was associated with increased ripple power (p&lt;0.05, n = 5 animals). These data confirm the capacity for synchronous Ca<sup>2+</sup> events to coincide with SWRs.</p><p>Thus, the SWR-synchronized depolarization of neurons, which is associated with hippocampal sequence replay and is implicated in memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buzsáki, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gomperts et al., 2015</xref>), was only associated with robust increases in dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in vivo when SWRs clustered in sets. Together, these results suggest that an underlying association of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity with hippocampal theta state and modulation of activity at SWR events contributed to the marked effect of behavioral state on neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Role for acetylcholine in hippocampal neuron dynamic calcium activity</title><p>Previous work has shown that medial septum cholinergic neurons critically contribute to the hippocampal theta oscillation during exploratory behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Winson, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rawlins et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lawson and Bland, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vandecasteele et al., 2014</xref>) and that ACh can influence neuronal activity and drive release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stutzmann and Mattson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hasselmo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giocomo and Hasselmo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown and Adams, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernández de Sevilla and Buño, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cole and Nicoll, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Power and Sah, 2002</xref>). We therefore pursued the hypothesis that medial septal cholinergic inputs contribute to hippocampal dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in freely behaving animals. To determine whether medial septal cholinergic neuron activity was sufficient for the behavioral state- and theta- dependence of hippocampal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity, we injected AAV-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry into the medial septum of <italic>ChAT</italic>-Cre mice and prepared mice for hippocampal dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and LFP co-recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Immunohistochemistry confirmed selective expression of hM3Dq in cholinergic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>).

In contrast, hM3Dq activation of cholinergic cells did not increase the amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events (p=0.677, paired t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I,K</xref>) and did not change average hippocampal multiunit activity (p=0.461, paired t-test, n = 5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,L</xref>). In addition, CNO did not affect movement or other behaviors (p=0.3, paired t-test, n = 5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), including running velocity on the track (p=0.572, paired t-test, n = 5) or the proportion of time spent running (p=0.167, paired t-test, n = 5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). CNO was associated with a reduction in the rate of SWRs (p=0.035, one tailed paired t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref>), consistent with prior reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vandecasteele et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Norimoto et al., 2012</xref>), but did not significantly alter hippocampal theta power in quiet wakefulness or exploratory behavior (each contrast, p=0.290, paired t-tests, n = 5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O</xref>). Neither CNO-associated changes in SWR rates (p=0.4, Spearman) nor changes in theta power (p=0.7, Spearman) significantly correlated with CNO-associated changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> event rates.

We therefore directly injected CNO into the dorsal hippocampus ipsilateral to the microscope while imaging Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity. Compared to intra-hippocampal injection of vehicle, intra-hippocampal injection of CNO increased the rate of CA1 neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity (p=0.008, paired t-test; n = 5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3P,R,T</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>) without affecting Ca<sup>2+</sup> event amplitudes (p=0.810, paired t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3S,U</xref>) or animal behavior during quiet wakefulness (p=0.248, paired t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Q,V</xref>).

Compared to injection of vehicle, intra-hippocampal injection of scopolamine was associated with a significant reduction in both neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> event rates (p=0.043, paired t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M,O,Q</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>) and amplitudes (p=0.038; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4P,R</xref>), without significantly affecting behavior (speed in quiet wakefulness, p=0.081; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4S</xref>). Thus, hippocampal dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity was dependent on mACh receptor-mediated signaling in CA1. These data confirm a critical role for medial septal cholinergic neuron-mediated activation of mAChRs in hippocampal dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in freely behaving animals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We combined dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of hippocampal CA1 neurons with local LFP recordings in order to relate dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity to behavioral and hippocampal state. We found that dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity was greatest in exploratory behavior and secondarily in REM sleep, states characterized by strong hippocampal theta oscillations, with marked reductions in quiet wakefulness and slow wave sleep, both non-theta states. Although these findings resemble the state-dependence of pyramidal cell action potential firing rates, which are highest in active wakefulness and REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grosmark et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miyawaki and Diba, 2016</xref>), mean Ca<sup>2+</sup> event rates were comparable in quiet wakefulness and slow wave sleep. In addition, neuronal firing rates appear to change less markedly with state than dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity. These results contrast with wide-field calcium imaging in cortex, where Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity has been shown to fall in SWS compared to wakefulness, consistent with the present results, but with greatest reduction in REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Niethard et al., 2016</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that state-dependent and cholinergic effects on dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity may not be uniform across brain regions.</p><p>Whereas action potentials of CA1 neuronal populations coordinate robustly with SWR events in both wakefulness and sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buzsáki, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buzsáki, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grosmark et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miyawaki and Diba, 2016</xref>), dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity of imaged neurons detectably increased only in association with SWR trains and was not evident with SWR singlets or across SWRs on average. While it remains possible that neuronal firing during single SWRs increases cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, perhaps via Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients that follow LFP-detected SWRs, such activity was insufficiently robust to increase average Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient rates. This result may derive from the prominent contribution of inhibition during SWRs coupled with potential effects of SWR trains on the post-SWR hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hulse et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">English et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maier et al., 2011</xref>). These differences in Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity across SWR singlets and trains may reflect a distinct role for dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in trains, for example in binding together the representations of SWRs that comprise a train (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yamamoto and Tonegawa, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Analyses of SWR-associated Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity also revealed a reduction in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient rates prior to SWRs. Small systematic delays in detection of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling relative to electrophysiological events contribute to the estimated timing of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient suppression relative to SWRs. Studies linking the action potential to Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients suggest a lag less than 20 ms based on the rise time constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jaffe et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Markram et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sah and Clements, 1999</xref>). However, GCaMP6f’s rise time constant, ~50 ms at body temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ohkura et al., 2012</xref>), also contributes. This lag is offset by the ~2–4 ms delay associated with extracellular SWR detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hulse et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with these expectations, we observed a small (&lt;46 ms) delay between evoked fEPSP and somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluorescence increases, and in addition observed temporal coincidence of SWRs with neuropil-associated Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity within the resolution of the 50 ms imaging sampling interval. Accounting for this delay and the offset between Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient initiation and detection further advances the timing of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient reduction relative to SWR onset, suggesting that the SWR-associated reduction in dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity does indeed precede SWR onset. Modulation of hippocampal activity by a neocortical DOWN state that precedes SWR events may contribute to the observed suppression of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients prior to SWRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sirota et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Isomura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hahn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hahn et al., 2012</xref>); see also 53,54), as may reduced levels of acetylcholine.</p><p>As septal cholinergic neuron activity contributes to theta and reduces SWRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hasselmo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vandecasteele et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Norimoto et al., 2012</xref>), we evaluated the contribution of medial septal cholinergic neurons to hippocampal dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity. We found that chemogenetic activation of medial septal cholinergic neurons with hM3Dq increased dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity while reducing SWR rates. In contrast, inhibition of mAChRs markedly reduced dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity while increasing SWRs. Neither chemogenetic activation of cholinergic neurons nor mAChR inhibition altered hippocampal multiunit activity. Although this might be taken as further support of a dissociation between Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and action potentials, lack of isolated single units limits interpretation of this observation. Nonetheless, these findings are consistent with reports in reduced preparations showing that mAChRs contribute to somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Power and Sah, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Müller and Connor, 1991</xref>). They demonstrate that medial septal cholinergic activity through activation of mAChRs critically regulates hippocampal dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in vivo, in relation to behavioral and theta state.</p><p>Multiple factors may contribute to the apparent dissociation of dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and action potential-associated activity in slow wave sleep. The observed dependence of dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity on mAChR activation suggests that low cholinergic tone and thereby reduced mAChR activation may be a critical determinant. In addition, although instantaneous firing rates during theta and SWR events are comparable, differences in spike counts and in patterned activity between these hippocampal oscillations may also contribute. In this respect, it is notable that complex spiking, which has been observed in theta-associated exploratory behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Epsztein et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bittner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bittner et al., 2017</xref>), is particularly effective at driving somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grienberger et al., 2014</xref>), while cells typically fire only a few action potentials during SWRs which may be less effective at generating a detectable Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient. Finally, distinct spatial compartmentalization of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and differential kinetics and peak concentration of somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients during exploratory behavior and REM sleep compared to quiet wakefulness and slow wave sleep associated with SWR events may also contribute to the apparent dissociation, and the possibility remains that non-theta states are associated with somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> event amplitudes below the resolution of the in vivo microendoscopy technique used here.</p><p>ACh plays a critical role in memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Teles-Grilo Ruivo and Mellor, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hasselmo, 2006</xref>). The high levels of somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity observed during exploratory behavior-associated theta states that have been implicated in memory encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buzsáki, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hasselmo, 2006</xref>), coupled with the lack of a robust increase in association with most SWR events implicated in memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buzsáki, 2015</xref>), suggests that dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> events may contribute preferentially to theta-dependent processes such as memory encoding. As a result, Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent gene expression is likely to be enriched in theta-associated exploratory behavior and REM sleep relative to SWR-associated states of quiet wakefulness and slow wave sleep. Even so, the capacity for Ca<sup>2+</sup> events to coordinate differentially with SWR trains over single SWRs raises the possibility that Ca<sup>2+</sup> may participate in integrating the representations of extended replay across SWRs. Theta-associated mAChR-dependent cascades that require somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients may also contribute to hippocampal representations, including place field formation, gain of response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2017</xref>), and stabilization, via both direct effects on ionic conductances as well as effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent kinases, phosphatases, and gene expression. NMDA receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Silva et al., 2015</xref>) and (intracellular) complex spikes (also referred to as Ca<sup>2+</sup> plateau potentials; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Epsztein et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bittner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bittner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grienberger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Takahashi and Magee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harvey et al., 2009</xref>) may participate in this process. In contrast, in non-theta states, low levels of mAChR-dependent somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> would be anticipated to limit activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent intrinsic conductances and second messenger systems, favoring SWR-associated replay and reducing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent gene expression. In the hippocampal slice, activation of mAChRs has been shown to increase intracellular and nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup> through Ins-P3 dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Power and Sah, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2008</xref>).

Similar results were observed using a threshold of 3 Z scores. The start of each event was defined as the time at which the event reached 20% of its maximum amplitude. To compute the neuropil trace, a region of interest (ROI) was selected that contained all identified somas. From this ROI, we took the maximum intensity of each pixel across the set of normalized ICs to generate a distribution.

Channels with strong SWRs and unit activity were taken to be in the pyramidal cell layer and were used for analysis of ripples and multiunit activity. For linear probes, a contact in s. radiatum 100 μm below the cell layer was used for theta and delta. For stereotrode implants, a stereotrode below the cell layer was used for theta and delta. Methods for detecting SWRs and theta were the same for the different types of recordings. SWR events were identified in the sleep chamber and defined using a 3 Z score threshold of ripple power, with the start and end defined as the times at which ripple power returned to the mean, and with a 20 ms minimum duration. Trains of SWRs were identified when the interval between discrete SWRs was less than 1 s. Multiunit activity was selectively analyzed from sites estimated to be in the pyramidal cell layer. Because camera-associated high frequency (1.3 kHz) electrical noise variably contaminated some contacts, action potentials that exceeded threshold were screened on the basis of waveform, and events contaminated with at least 40 μV of 1.3 kHz noise were excluded. Action potentials thus filtered were aggregated as multiunit activity for further analyses. High frequency microscope-associated electrical noise was minimal in the post-behavioral session but was often substantial on the track, prohibiting multiunit contrasts between exploratory behavior and other behavioral states.

For SWR singlet versus train analyses, SWR-associated Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity was measured at SWR offset, and delayed Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity was measured within 3 s of the SWR in a 500 ms window centered around the maximum.</p><p>Synchronous Ca<sup>2+</sup> events (SCE) were identified when the number of cells with Ca<sup>2+</sup> event onsets within a 250 ms window exceeded the number expected by chance, as defined by &gt;3 s.d. after 1000 temporal shuffles of cell activity, and with a minimum of 5 participating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Malvache et al., 2016</xref>). The onset time of the first transient within the SCE was used to relate SCEs to ripples. A co-occurrence was identified when SCEs started within −100/+150 ms of ripples. Significant ripple-associated SCEs were identified when their ripple power exceeded the median + twice the interquartile range of the distribution of ripple power associated with 1000 temporal shuffles of SCE times.</p><p>For place field assessment, spatial tuning curves (3 cm bins) were constructed for each running direction using all detected Ca<sup>2+</sup> events that occurred during run behavior (&gt;3 cm/sec). Spatial information was measured for each spatial tuning curve and compared to spatial information distributions of 1000 shuffled versions of the data to test significance (Monte Carlo p-value&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Markus et al., 1994</xref>). In each shuffle, Ca<sup>2+</sup> events were reassigned to random times and spatial information was recomputed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All group values were represented as mean ± s.e.m.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Cholinergic modulation of hippocampal calcium activity across the sleep-wake cycle&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Frank as the Senior Editor.</p><p>All reviewers agreed that your study addresses important questions, namely how calcium dynamics depend on behavioral states, how calcium activity relates to hippocampal network states (i.e., theta vs. sharp wave-ripples), and how imaged calcium activity is affected by cholinergic neuromodulatory inputs from the medial septum. All reviewers agreed that your paper potentially shows important and interesting results and uses an impressive combination of techniques. However, reviewers also agreed that the conclusions are not convincingly supported by the results as currently described. A major concern is a lack of control animals receiving CNO injections in the absence of DREADD expression. Another major concern is whether the timing of calcium transients and sharp wave-ripples could be compared with sufficient temporal resolution in order to convincingly conclude that calcium activity decreases during extracellularly recorded sharp wave-ripples.</p><p>The essential revisions are listed below, roughly in order of importance, and these are the points that should be addressed. These essential revisions are followed by the three reviews in their entirety, for your information.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) An important control is missing from these experiments. The authors did not examine the effects of CNO alone, without hM3Dq receptor expression (Gomez et al., Nature 2017). CNO can also bind to other endogenous receptors. Thus, controls with only CNO injected (in absence of DREADDs) are needed to determine whether the reported changes in calcium activity in the chemogenetic manipulation experiments are not due to effects caused by CNO itself.</p><p>2) The possibility that transients are suppressed during SWRs could be very interesting, but there was insufficient accuracy and confidence in the temporal resolution to draw any conclusions. It is difficult to determine the exact onset of a calcium transient at the timescales necessary for any firm conclusions. Furthermore, one cannot be certain whether or not there is a systematic lag between electrophysiological and calcium events in the recordings. So, it remains possible that neuronal firing during SWRs produces calcium transients that are observed slightly after LFP-detected ripples.</p><p>3) How exactly were exploratory behaviors, slow wave sleep, and REM sleep identified and defined? The authors report that these states were associated with different theta/δ ratios, but theta/δ ratios are typically used to differentiate REM sleep from slow wave sleep, thus making this &quot;result&quot; a consequence of the method. Also, the theta/δ ratio in Figure 1 does not show a significant increase in the run versus rest behavioral state. This is important for the paper, and the authors should explain this apparently anomalous result. Moreover, the authors state in the Results section that &quot;As expected, both exploratory behavior and REM sleep were associated with a high theta/δ ratio, which diminished in quiet wakefulness and slow wave sleep (repeated measures ANOVA: F (3, 12) =3.965, p&gt;0.05; Figure 1I)&quot;; However, their statistical results do not seem to support this statement. The authors should show group-averaged or individual power spectrum analysis of theta power changes with behavior states along with theta/δ ratios and clarify these puzzling results.</p><p>4) Activation of either cholinergic cells in MS or their axonal inputs to hippocampus, reportedly leads to increased rates of calcium events during quiet wakefulness. However, even though both i.p and i.h injections of CNO to activate either the cholinergic cells in MS or cholinergic inputs to hippocampus, respectively, were reportedly done during quiet wakefulness, the running velocities in Figure 3L and Figure 3T are very different. Why is this? Also, running speeds greater than 5 cm/s, as shown in Figure 3L, are not typically considered quiet wakefulness. Similarly, mAChR inhibition carried out by either i.p or i.h injection in Figure 4 both resulted in decreases in the rate of calcium events. However, the measured running velocities shown in Figure 4H and 4P are significantly different. In which behavioral states were these manipulations carried out?</p><p>5) Since the central point of this manuscript is a link between behavioral states and calcium dynamics, it would be crucial to provide evidence of the behavioral state in which each of the manipulations were carried out to evoke changes in calcium dynamics. Thus, it would be useful to have pre-injection and post-injection comparisons of behavioral state and calcium dynamics. The measures and statistics shown are insufficient in this regard.</p><p>6) Related to the above point, the corresponding increase or decrease of theta power upon activation or inhibition of the cholinergic system would be useful to correlate with the various manipulations and calcium activity changes.</p><p>7) The details about electrophysiological recordings are unclear. The authors state that they used a 16-contact linear probe in some animals, or 8 independently drivable stereotrodes in other animals. It is unclear how many mice had each kind of recording. Also, which channels were used for analyses? Also, were the methods for detecting sharp wave-ripples and theta the same for the different types of recordings?</p><p>8) Related to the above point, the authors also state that a skull screw was used to obtain EEG recordings in animals with cannula. How were the authors certain that sharp wave-ripples and theta could be detected from a skull screw? The authors need to provide example recordings to demonstrate that these patterns could be detected.</p><p>9) Was multiunit activity recorded from all depths/recording sites of the probes or just those sites estimated to be in stratum pyramidale? This is important to assess the likelihood that multiunit recordings included mostly interneuron spikes or more likely picked up mostly pyramidal cell activity.</p><p>10) Related to the above point, MUA activity should be shown alongside the calcium transients throughout the figures in the paper.</p><p>11) The reported silence in calcium transients prior to SWRs is interesting, but seems to follow from prior observations by Sirota et al., 2003 and Isomura et al., 2006, where it was noted that SWRs are frequently preceded by DOWN states, which are in turn also known to modulate hippocampal activity (see also Hahn et al., 2007 and 2012).</p><p>12) The authors should include a Statistical Analysis section in the Materials and methods part with details of the tests used. The authors should also provide exact p-values, statistics, and associated degrees of freedom for all results, including non-significant results (i.e., not just p &gt; 0.5).</p><p>13) In Video 1, why was the background so much higher during RUN and were comparisons of calcium activity across states affected by these differences?</p><p>14) The experiment with CNO activation of MS cholinergic cells and then mAChR inhibition (Supplementary Figure 4) is very important to show that calcium activity increases with cholinergic activation is really mediated through mAChR. It should be in the main figures to support a major finding of the paper, namely the role of mAChR in Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity.</p><p>15) Why do some results refer to 5 mice and others refer to 6?</p><p>The separate reviews follow.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting study that uses simultaneous calcium imaging and electrophysiological recording of neuronal activity in CA1 of freely behaving mice to test how calcium activity differs across different states (i.e., theta and sharp wave-ripple-related states) and how such dynamics are affected by cholinergic projections from the medial septum. Although my enthusiasm for this unique study is high, the presentation of results is lacking in several regards. My specific comments are as follows:</p><p>1) How were exploratory behaviors, slow wave sleep, and REM sleep identified and defined?

In recent years, several studies have demonstrated the usefulness and importance of somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in behaving animals in real time studies of neuronal activity. Thus, it is important to understand the relation between this calcium activity and local field potentials during different behavioral states, and how this calcium activity is modulated. The studies presented in this manuscript demonstrate that behavioral states affect the dynamics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity of neuronal ensembles in the hippocampus in a mAChR dependent manner. Behavioral states that engaged the theta rhythm, like exploration and REM sleep, were characterized by higher rates and amplitudes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events, in contrast to behavioral states characterized by low levels of theta and higher levels of SWR, such as quite wakefulness (rest) and slow wave sleep. Furthermore, cholinergic inputs from medial septum, as well as endogenous mAChR activation in hippocampus, were shown to modulate dynamic calcium activity in hippocampal networks. These results are interesting and important, but the authors should address the issues outlined below:</p><p>a) Figure 1: The theta/δ ratio in the figure does not show a significant increase in the run versus rest behavioral state. This is important for the paper and the authors should explain this apparently anomalous result. Moreover, the authors state in the Results section that &quot;As expected, both exploratory behavior and REM sleep were associated with a high theta/δ ratio, which diminished in quiet wakefulness and slow wave sleep (repeated measures ANOVA: F (3, 12) =3.965, p&gt;0.05; Figure 1I)&quot;; However, their results do not seem to support this statement. They should show group-averaged or individual power spectrum analysis of the theta power changes with behavior states, instead of, or along with, the theta/δ ratios.</p><p>b) Activation of either cholinergic cells in MS or their axonal inputs to hippocampus, leads to increased rates of Ca<sup>2+</sup> event during quite wakefulness. However, even though both i.p and i.h injections of CNO to activate either the cholinergic cells in MS or cholinergic inputs to hippocampus, respectively, were done during quite wakefulness (rest) state, the running velocities in Figure 3L and Figure 3T are very different. Why is this?</p><p>c) Similarly, mAChR inhibition carried out by either i.p or i.h during exploratory behavior (run) state in Figure 4, both result in decreases in the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events. However, the results of the measured running velocities shown in Figure 4H and 4P are significantly different.</p><p>d) Since the central point of this manuscript is a link between behavioral states and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics, it would be crucial to provide evidence of the behavioral state in which each of the manipulations were carried out to evoke changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. Thus, it would be useful to have pre-injection and post-injection comparisons.</p><p>e) Similarly, the corresponding increase or decrease of theta power upon activation or inhibition of the cholinergic system would be useful to correlate with the various manipulations and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamic changes.</p><p>f) The experiment with CNO activation of MS cholinergic cells and then mAChR inhibition (Supplementary Figure 4) is very important to show that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> event increase with cholinergic activation is really mediated through mAChR. It should be in the main figures to support the major finding of the paper: the role of mAChR in Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamic activity. Additional controls with only CNO injected (in absence of DREADDs) are also needed to determine whether the changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> are actually due to changes in mAChR function and not to CNO itself.</p><p>g) Please include a Statistical Analysis section in the Materials and methods part with details of the tests used.</p><p>In summary: the premise of the studies presented is important and interesting. However, the authors need to address the issues listed above before their paper is ready for publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this work, Zhou and colleagues perform recordings that feature an impressive combination of calcium imaging, lfp and multi-unit extracellular recordings, chemogenetics, and pharmacology. They make a series of interesting observations: that calcium transients are suppressed prior to the onset of hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs), that injections of CNO activation in mice with septal Chat-hM3DQq receptors increases calcium transients, and that scopolamine injections blocked calcium transients. These observations are used to argue that muscarinic acetylcholine receptors play a critical role in hippocampal calcium activity. If convincingly presented, these are important findings as they point towards dissociations between calcium and extracellular activities and a specific role for mAchRs. However, I had concerns with the approach for each of the findings and at present I am not convinced that confounds cannot account for the various observations.</p><p>The silence in calcium transients prior to SWRs is interesting, but seems to follow from prior observations by Sirota et al., 2003 and Isomura et al., 2006, where it was noted that SWRs are frequently preceded by DOWN states, which are in turn also known to modulate hippocampal activity (see also Hahn et al., 2007 and 2012).</p><p><italic>The possibility that transients are suppressed during</italic> SWRs themselves could be very interesting, but there was insufficient accuracy and confidence in the temporal resolution to draw any conclusions here. It is difficult to determine the exact onset of a calcium transient at the timescales necessary for any firm conclusions. Furthermore, one cannot be certain that there isn't a systematic lag between electrophysiological and calcium events in the recordings. So from what I can tell, it remains possible that neuronal firing during SWRs produces calcium transients that are observed slightly after the lfp-detected ripple.</p><p>The CNO hM3Dq results are interesting, but an important control is missing from these experiments. The authors did not examine the effects of CNO alone, without the hM3Dq receptor expression (Gomez et al. Nature 2017) – CNO can also bind to other endogenous receptors. Effect of CNO with hM4DI could have provided a compelling contrast, but these were not performed.</p><p>In these and elsewhere it would be important that the MUA activity is shown alongside the Ca transients throughout the figures in the paper.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Cholinergic modulation of hippocampal calcium activity across the sleep-wake cycle&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

The legends indicate that PRE is 2-5 s before the SWR and POST is 1-2 s after the SWR. Perhaps -2 to +1 s around the SWR are considered the SWR period, but I could not be sure. In any case, it's not clear whether these periods are appropriate for the different analyses because the Ca rate and the Neuropil z-score have different dynamics. Ca rate drops in the ~1s before the SWR, while Neuropil peaks in the ~1s after the SWR. Using the same &quot;SWR&quot; windows for both analyses may obscure significant changes, potentially why the increase in Neuropil does not reach significance. The relevant time periods should be easily identified from the figure and its legends.</p><p>I am still confused by what the &quot;Neuropil&quot; z-score is really measuring. I had recommended a discussion of this measure, which the authors did not address. The only thing I can find about this is from the Materials and methods that &quot;from this ROI the 50% of pixels with below-average variance in fluorescence were used.&quot; It's not clear to me what exactly this is measuring. As defined, some of these pixels may in fact overlap with parts of somata. Is that appropriate? Is the neuropil also corrected for motion? I believe the authors should discuss and provide a rationale for what they believe this measure provides. The ROI and some sample &quot;neuropil&quot; pixels should be shown. Importantly, do the remaining 50% of pixels behave consistently with the neuropil pixels? It would also be helpful to illustrate the non-thresholded Ca activity for the somata used for event detection, as it remains possible that calcium events amplitudes are lower during SWRs and therefore that the transients are generally being missed. This possibility should be considered in the Discussion section as cells typically show only a few action potentials during SWRs, perhaps not enough to produce a sufficiently large Ca transient.</p><p>I had also indicated previously, but that authors did not regard the Niethard et al., 2016 study. I still think it's important for the authors to cite and discuss this paper, in which they recorded Ca activity in the cortex of mice across awake and sleep states. Unlike the current study, they found the least Ca activity during REM, except in PV cells, with intermediate levels during SWS. Therefore, state-dependent and cholinergic effects may not be uniform across brain regions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39777.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>To address the request to evaluate LFP in relation to population calcium activity, we explicitly assessed the LFP associated with synchronous calcium events across neurons. Synchronous events were relatively rare (10 ± 6 per recording, n=5 animals). Consistent with the report of Malvache et al., 12.6 ± 5.6% of synchronous calcium events time locked to SWRs. Furthermore, compared to temporally shuffled data, 4.9 ± 3.1% of synchronous calcium activities were associated with increased ripple power (p&lt;0.05, n=5 animals). These data confirm the capacity for synchronous calcium events to coincide with SWRs. (These data are discussed in the fifth paragraph of the subsection “Coordination of hippocampal dynamic calcium activity across behavior”.)</p><p>To address the concern of a systematic delay between electrophysiological measurements and calcium measurements, we first accounted for the delay between calcium transient detection, defined as the time at which the event reached 20% of its maximum amplitude, and the start of calcium transients on average (0.114 ± 0.001 s; n=7 mice). Accounting for this delay, the maximal reduction in calcium activity preceded SWR onset by 0.189 ± 0.118 sec. Consistent with the capacity for calcium imaging to detect the SWR-associated synaptic barrage with temporal fidelity, as noted previously, SWRs were associated with a time-locked (mean ± s.e.: -0.04 ± 0.10 sec) change in the extra-somatic calcium fluorescence of the neuropil, with a nonsignificant increase followed by a significant, delayed reduction (repeated measures ANOVA: F (2, 12) =15.627, p=0.003, n=7 animals; post-hoc comparisons: Pre vs. SWR, p=0.130; Pre vs. Post, p&lt;0.001; SWR vs. Post, p=0.003; Figure 2G and K, left).</p><p>To independently assess the temporal alignment of the LFP and the calcium fluorescence data, we placed a stimulating electrode in contralateral CA3 to activate the commissural pathway and evoke both a field EPSP and an associated change in GCaMP6f fluorescence in CA1 neurons.

Accounting for this offset and the ~190 ms offset delineated above further advances the timing of dynamic calcium activity relative to SWR onset. Together, these results support the observation that dynamic calcium activity transiently falls in the immediate pre-SWR period, consistent with a down-state in the pre-SWR period, with a subsequent increase in calcium activity elicited by SWR trains.

No effect was observed on the rate of dynamic Calcium activity (Calcium event rates, p=0.496; amplitudes, p=0.710; paired t-test, n=5; Figure 3W and Figure 3—figure supplement 4). In addition, intra-hippocampal injection of CNO in animals lacking hM3Dq receptor expression did not alter on the rate of dynamic calcium activity (calcium event rates, p=0.637; amplitudes, p=0.128; paired t-test, n=4; Figure 3W and Figure 3—figure supplement 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The possibility that transients are suppressed during SWRs could be very interesting, but there was insufficient accuracy and confidence in the temporal resolution to draw any conclusions.

The authors report that these states were associated with different theta/δ ratios, but theta/δ ratios are typically used to differentiate REM sleep from slow wave sleep, thus making this &quot;result&quot; a consequence of the method.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified these definitions of behavioral state in the manuscript (Materials and methods, subsection “Calcium imaging and electrophysiology recording”). Exploratory behavior was defined as running behavior (&gt;3 cm/sec) on the linear track. Quiet wakefulness, slow wave sleep, and REM sleep were scored in the sleepbox. Quiet wakefulness was classified during periods of wakeful immobility (&lt; 0.5 cm/sec), both prior to sleep and following arousal events and postural changes. Slow wave sleep was classified by irregular activity and SWRs arising in the setting of prolonged immobility (at least 3 minutes) in a sleep posture. REM sleep was classified by high theta power (5-12 Hz) in the LFP arising out of slow wave sleep in association with persistent immobility, with each epoch of REM lasting at least 10 seconds. Where available (3/5 animals), EMG confirmed classification. We have modified Figure 1L to contrast theta across behavioral states excluding REM sleep.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the theta/δ ratio in Figure 1 does not show a significant increase in the run versus rest behavioral state.
