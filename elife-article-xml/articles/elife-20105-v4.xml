signal downstream of the T cell receptor. Using a platform that combines exhaustive point-mutagenesis of peptide substrates, bacterial surface-display, cell sorting, and deep sequencing, we have defined the specificities of the first two kinases in this pathway, Lck and ZAP-70, for the T cell receptor ζ chain and the scaffold proteins LAT and SLP-76. We find that ZAP-70 selects its substrates by utilizing an electrostatic mechanism that excludes substrates with positively-charged residues and favors LAT and SLP-76 phosphosites that are surrounded by negatively-charged residues. This mechanism prevents ZAP-70 from phosphorylating its own activation loop, thereby enforcing its strict dependence on Lck for activation. The sequence features in ZAP-70, LAT, and SLP-76 that underlie electrostatic selectivity likely contribute to the specific response of T cells to foreign antigens.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20105.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20105.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20105.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A class of enzymes known as tyrosine kinases relay signals in cells by adding phosphate groups onto specific sites (called 'tyrosine residues') in other proteins. Most tyrosine kinases can phosphorylate many targets (or 'substrates'); they can also phosphorylate and thereby activate themselves, when given the right signal. Many tyrosine kinases select their substrates on the basis of their location; once recruited to and activated at a specific site, these enzymes will typically phosphorylate many nearby proteins.</p><p>A tyrosine kinase called ZAP-70 is found in immune cells known as T cells. ZAP-70 works together with another kinase called Lck to activate T cells, which enables the cells to mount an immune response when they encounter foreign molecules. This pathway is precisely controlled, with Lck activated first, followed by ZAP-70. Unlike most other tyrosine kinases, ZAP-70 cannot activate itself, and it will only phosphorylate a narrow range of substrates. The origin of these constraints are not understood, but they are thought to be crucial for ensuring that T cells readily respond to foreign molecules but not to healthy cells.</p><p>Shah et al. developed a high-throughput technique to investigate which features ZAP-70 and Lck use to select their substrates. First, hundreds of different sequences based on natural substrates were genetically encoded and introduced into bacterial cells, with one type per bacterium. The bacteria displayed these sequence variants on their surface, and Shah et al. then treated the bacteria with either ZAP-70 or Lck. Cell sorting was used to isolate those bacterial cells with variants that were phosphorylated, and high-throughput DNA sequencing was used to identify the phosphorylated sequences. This approach revealed that ZAP-70 was deterred from phosphorylating sites that carry a positive charge and strongly preferred sites that are negatively-charged, such as those found in its two major substrates. Shah et al. also showed that Lck, which behaves like a typical tyrosine kinase, could not phosphorylate the substrates of ZAP-70 because of their substantial negative charge. This lack of cross-reactivity between Lck and the ZAP-70 substrates prevents premature signaling in T cells.</p><p>Using simulations, Shah et al. went on to show that a positively-charged region on ZAP-70 (which is more prominent than in other tyrosine kinases) helps ZAP-70 interact with negatively-charged substrates. This region also deters the kinase from activating itself, making it dependent instead upon Lck for activation. Together, these results identify the distinctive features of ZAP-70 that are important for ensuring that T cells are activated only when they sense foreign molecules on unhealthy cells. The work will lead to future studies exploring the tightly controlled signaling events carried out by tyrosine kinases in T cells in more detail.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20105.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20105.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>tyrosine kinase</kwd><kwd>T cell receptor</kwd><kwd>ZAP-70</kwd><kwd>LAT</kwd><kwd>Lck</kwd><kwd>bacterial surface display</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PO1 AI091580</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weiss</surname><given-names>Arthur</given-names></name><name><surname>Kuriyan</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Neel H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000884</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Qi</given-names></name><name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>Qingrong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A high-throughput technique to characterize the substrate specificities of tyrosine kinases identifies the key features of kinases and substrates that enforce accurate signaling from T cell receptors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Signal transduction by the T cell receptor (TCR) triggers the activation of three non-receptor tyrosine kinases: Lck, ZAP-70, and Itk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Smith-Garvin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Weiss and Littman, 1994</xref>). A notable feature of this pathway is a strict hierarchy in kinase activation, which is accompanied by highly specific phosphorylation of substrates by each kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). T cells must mount a strong and sustained response upon encountering a foreign peptide antigen bound to a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule on an antigen-presenting cell, without launching an immune reaction against self-antigens. The origin of this selectivity is not well understood, and it cannot be explained by the modest differences in affinities between self and foreign peptide antigens for the T cell receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Palmer and Naeher, 2009</xref>). The pattern of tyrosine kinase activity downstream of the T cell receptor is implicated in a kinetic proofreading mechanism that has been posited to underlie the fidelity of the T cell response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chakraborty and Weiss, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McKeithan, 1995</xref>). In such a mechanism, complexes formed between the T cell receptor and antigens must be sufficiently long-lived to propagate a biochemical signal through the sequential steps of kinase activation and substrate phosphorylation within the T cell.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20105.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>T cell receptor-proximal signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Initiating events in T cell receptor signaling (based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Au-Yeung et al., 2009</xref>).

This phosphorylation occurs on immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), which are conserved sets of sequences bearing two tyrosines separated by ten to twelve residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Love and Hayes, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reth, 1989</xref>). ZAP-70, a Syk-family kinase with tandem SH2 domains, is recruited to the membrane by binding these doubly-phosphorylated ITAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chan et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Iwashima et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wange et al., 1993</xref>). ZAP-70 is auto-inhibited before ITAM binding, and its activation requires that it be phosphorylated by Lck, both on its SH2-kinase linker and on the activation loop, a conserved regulatory segment in the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deindl et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yan et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Once activated, ZAP-70 phosphorylates two scaffold proteins, LAT and SLP-76 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bubeck Wardenburg et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Au-Yeung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>). These scaffolds are phosphorylated at multiple sites, leading to the formation of phosphotyrosine-dependent signaling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balagopalan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhu et al., 2003</xref>). In one such complex, the Tec-family kinase Itk binds to phosphorylated SLP-76 through its SH2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bunnell et al., 2000</xref>). Itk phosphorylates and activates phospholipase-Cγ1 (PLCγ1), which is bound to phosphorylated LAT. Signaling by PLCγ1 leads to a cytoplasmic calcium increase, thereby initiating part of the transcriptional response of the T cell to activation by antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Weiss et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>The order of these signaling events is now well established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and is thought to provide tight control over the T cell response. It is not clear, however, how this sequence of kinase reactions is enforced, given that tyrosine kinases are generally considered to be promiscuous and even 'sloppy' enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mayer, 2012</xref>). In this study, we focus on the key molecular features of ZAP-70, Lck, and their substrates that dictate the order of kinase activation and substrate phosphorylation in a T cell. Specifically, we examine why the substrate specificity of ZAP-70 is so narrow that it can only phosphorylate the scaffold proteins LAT and SLP-76 efficiently, and why ZAP-70 cannot phosphorylate and activate itself. We also ask why LAT and SLP-76 are not phosphorylated efficiently by Lck. The avoidance of phosphorylation of these two scaffold proteins by Lck is critical for ensuring that the more tightly regulated kinase, ZAP-70, propagates the signal downstream only after it is activated by Lck.</p><p>To answer these questions, we utilized a high-throughput mutagenesis and screening platform to measure kinase activity towards a large number of substrates simultaneously. Our approach generates sequence-activity relationships for variants of specific peptide substrates by genetically encoding scanning point-mutagenesis libraries of peptides into a bacterial surface-display system that has been developed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rice and Daugherty, 2008</xref>). Phosphorylation of individual peptides in these libraries is detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), coupled to Illumina DNA sequencing technology (deep sequencing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bentley et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>We applied this high-throughput platform to measure the effect of proximal mutations on the phosphorylation of several tyrosine residues in LAT and the T cell receptor ζ subunit (TCRζ). Our data show that the presence of multiple negatively-charged residues in the vicinity of tyrosines in LAT, and the exclusion of positively-charged ones, allows those tyrosines to be selected through electrostatic interactions with ZAP-70. This sequence pattern also prevents phosphorylation of LAT by Lck. Brownian dynamics and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that ZAP-70 detects the negative charge on LAT and SLP-76 by using a substrate binding region on its catalytic domain that is enriched in positively-charged residues to an extent that appears to be unique among non-receptor tyrosine kinases. Our analysis also suggests that the inability of ZAP-70 to undergo robust autophosphorylation is due to steric and electrostatic repulsion that blocks the adoption of the enzyme-substrate complex in which the activation loop of one kinase domain acts as the substrate for another. This feature appears to be a natural consequence of the specialization of ZAP-70 towards LAT and SLP-76 as preferred substrates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A high-throughput assay for tyrosine kinase specificity based on bacterial surface-display and deep sequencing</title><p>A widely-used approach to determine consensus sequences in kinase substrates relies on peptide libraries with random sequences surrounding a central tyrosine residue. In older versions of this technique, degenerate peptide libraries were treated with a kinase of interest, and the resulting phosphopeptides were separated and sequenced in bulk to determine the distribution of amino acid residues at each position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Songyang et al., 1995</xref>). Recent iterations of this technique utilize positional scanning peptide libraries where degenerate sub-libraries are created in which single amino acid residues are fixed at various positions flanking the tyrosine. All of the sub-libraries are phosphorylated in parallel and then immobilized on a membrane or microarray for high-throughput detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hutti et al., 2004</xref>). While these methods provide a reliable way to determine consensus motifs and can provide insights into kinase specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Begley et al., 2015</xref>), reliance on the analysis of degenerate mixtures prevents a direct comparison of the effects of specific mutations in particular substrate sequences.</p><p>To directly determine the importance of specific residues in substrates of ZAP-70 and Lck, we developed a high-throughput platform to measure the relative rates of phosphorylation for hundreds of individual peptides simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

DNA from both unsorted and sorted cells was isolated and deep-sequenced to determine the frequency of each peptide in the library before and after selection for high phosphorylation level.</p><p>For DNA corresponding to each peptide, an enrichment value was calculated as described previously for a high-throughput binding assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McLaughlin et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, the ratio of the abundance of DNA corresponding to a peptide in the sorted and unsorted samples was determined, and that enrichment ratio was normalized to the enrichment ratio for a reference member of the library. The normalized enrichment ratio for a particular DNA sequence in the library is a measure of the relative efficiency by which the corresponding peptide is phosphorylated by the kinase.</p><p>To test the validity of our approach, we first generated a small DNA library encoding the wild-type sequences of peptide segments from LAT, SLP-76, the putative ZAP-70 substrate p38α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Salvador et al., 2005</xref>), and TCRζ (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> for sequences of the peptides used). The peptide segments were 19–22 residues long, and this library was screened against the isolated kinase domains of ZAP-70 and Lck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; see the appendix for a discussion of variation in peptide surface-display levels). The results of the initial screens recapitulated known specificity trends observed in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Isakov et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Williams et al., 1998</xref>). They were also consistent with in vitro measurements of kinetic parameters obtained using purified kinases and peptide substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>). Specifically, we found that ZAP-70 efficiently phosphorylates LAT and SLP-76, but not TCRζ ITAMs, while Lck is an efficient kinase for ITAMs, but not for LAT or SLP-76. Aside from Lck phosphorylation of LAT Tyr 64, neither kinase readily phosphorylated the first five tyrosine residues on LAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), which are not known to be phosphorylated in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balagopalan et al., 2010</xref>). The relative phosphorylation rates for three of the phosphosites in our initial screen (Tyr 132 and Tyr 191 of LAT and Tyr 145 of SLP-76) have been measured in T cells, and those results are consistent with our peptide-based measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Houtman et al., 2005</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20105.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Phosphorylation by ZAP-70 or Lck of a variety of peptides based on LAT, SLP-76, p38α, and TCRζ.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequences surrounding the key tyrosine residues analyzed in this study.

By contrast, Lck substrates typically have both positively- and negatively-charged residues near the tyrosine, and they have a near-neutral net charge. This suggests that high negative charge is likely to be a key determinant of whether a potential target site is phosphorylated by ZAP-70, but the location and number of negatively-charged residues around each of the tyrosines in LAT and SLP-76 is not conserved. There may also be other roles for the negative charge on LAT and SLP-76 that are unrelated to kinase specificity. For example, it was shown recently that LAT phosphorylation results in clustering, and that the phosphatase CD45 is excluded from these LAT clusters because it is negatively-charged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bunnell et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Su et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To define the sequence determinants of efficient phosphorylation by ZAP-70, we created three scanning point-mutagenesis libraries based on LAT sequences spanning Tyr 127, Tyr 132, and Tyr 226.

In all three screens, mutation of the target tyrosine residues (Tyr 226, Tyr 127, and Tyr 132, respectively) resulted in a substantial depletion of DNA encoding those peptides after sorting (negative enrichment value relative to wild-type), setting a 'floor' for the detection limit of the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C and D</xref>). The relative magnitudes of the kinetic effects and the bacterial display selectivity effects (the slope of the line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) depend on the peptide being tested. The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> are for the peptide spanning LAT Tyr 226, a good substrate for ZAP-70, and individual substitutions only have a modest, albeit measurable, effect on phosphorylation rate. By contrast, for ZAP-70 phosphorylation of a poor substrate, such as the peptide encompassing LAT Tyr 132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), substitutions at Gly 131 result in as much as a 16-fold enhancement in phosphorylation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>A striking result from these screens is that the selection of substrates by ZAP-70 is controlled by an electrostatic filter, whereby the presence of a lysine or arginine residue anywhere within seven residues upstream or downstream of the substrate tyrosine severely compromises the efficiency of phosphorylation. A similar, but less dramatic, reduction in phosphorylation efficiency was observed when tyrosine-proximal residues were substituted by histidine. Replacement of native negatively-charged residues by neutral residues had a mild detrimental effect on phosphorylation efficiency, and introduction of acidic residues at neutral positions was often beneficial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Consistent with these observations, replacement of a single glutamate residue by lysine, either upstream or downstream of the tyrosine, resulted in a 30–40% reduction in the LAT Tyr 226 phosphorylation rate by ZAP-70 in kinase assays using purified peptide substrates, and mutation of multiple glutamates to alanine or lysine residues further reduced phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The deleterious effect of arginine and lysine residues at any position also explains the slow phosphorylation of LAT Tyr 191 by ZAP-70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Replacement of Arg 189 (at the −2 position) by alanine or aspartate residues successively improved the efficiency of Tyr 191 phosphorylation by ZAP-70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>In addition to revealing the exclusion rule for arginine and lysine, the screens also emphasize the importance of particular amino acid residues at three specific positions. ZAP-70 has a very strong preference for an aspartate residue at the −1 position relative to the tyrosine residue and a modest preference for a glutamate or hydrophobic residue at the +1 position, consistent with known preferences for the ZAP-70 paralog Syk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schmitz et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xue et al., 2012</xref>). There is also a preference for a hydrophobic residue at the +3 position in all three peptides, which is a feature common to other tyrosine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bose et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deng et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Given the strong preference for an aspartate residue at the −1 position, we were intrigued that the residue immediately before Tyr 132 in LAT is a glycine. Phosphorylation of Tyr 132 is essential for T cell differentiation and function, as it generates the docking site for PLCγ1, which initiates calcium signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Roncagalli et al., 2010</xref>). In our screen for Tyr 132 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), replacement of Gly 131 with virtually any other residue improved the efficiency of phosphorylation by ZAP-70, and the G131D mutation caused a 16-fold enhancement of phosphorylation by ZAP-70 in kinase assays using purified peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Gly 131 in LAT is highly conserved in mammals, and it is also common in other vertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). PLCγ1 binding sites on other proteins do not contain a glycine adjacent to the phosphotyrosine, indicating that this is not a requirement for SH2 domain engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jones et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leung et al., 2014</xref>). A slow rate of phosphorylation at Tyr 132 in LAT may be important for kinetic proofreading during T cell receptor signaling, the significance of which will be explored in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The substrate sequence preferences of Lck are distinct from those of ZAP-70</title><p>To understand why Lck readily phosphorylates ITAM peptides but not LAT- or SLP-76-based peptides, we screened three libraries against Lck in our high-throughput platform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

The two ITAM libraries have the tyrosine close to one or the other terminus of the peptide. Thus, each library provides information on Lck specificity either downstream or upstream of the tyrosine residue, respectively. We also screened one of the LAT point mutant libraries (LAT Tyr 127) against the Lck kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We chose this library because the sequence surrounding LAT Tyr 127 has the canonical features of most ZAP-70 substrates (many acidic residues, no lysines or arginines, and a −1 aspartate), but in vitro measurements indicated that it was still a modest substrate for Lck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20105.016</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Lck phosphorylation of TCRζ ITAM and LAT point mutant libraries.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Average enrichment values from two independent screens for phosphorylation by Lck of the TCRζ Tyr 111 library in a Y123F background.

This point is important for understanding the difference in autophosphorylation ability between the two kinases, as discussed below.</p><p>Lck has a strong preference for a bulky hydrophobic residue at the −1 position relative to the phosphosite, and it does not tolerate an aspartate residue at this position. This preference explains why Lck does not readily phosphorylate tyrosine residues in LAT and SLP-76 that contain an aspartate residue at the −1 position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). It also explains why Lck phosphorylates the first tyrosine residue in each ITAM faster than the second one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Housden et al., 2003</xref>), as the first tyrosine is typically preceded by a leucine while the second is preceded by a smaller aliphatic or polar residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>The lysine/arginine exclusion rule observed for ZAP-70 substrate sequences clearly does not apply to Lck. Mutation of acidic residues located upstream of Tyr 127 in LAT to virtually any other residue, including lysine and arginine, resulted in a slight, but significant, enhancement of phosphorylation efficiency by Lck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Downstream of the tyrosine, lysine and arginine residues were not tolerated at the +1 to +3 positions, but positively-charged residues were preferred at positions located further downstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This is consistent with the presence of several lysine and arginine residues located five to ten positions downstream of the phosphosites in TCRζ ITAMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and mutation of native lysine residues downstream of TCRζ Tyr 111 to aspartate or glutamate was detrimental for Tyr 111 phosphorylation by Lck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>To validate our conclusions, we measured the phosphorylation kinetics of purified mutant LAT peptides by Lck. Simultaneous mutation to alanine of several glutamates located five to seven residues upstream of LAT Tyr 226 had no measurable effect on phosphorylation by Lck, and mutation of those residues to lysine only reduced the rate of phosphorylation modestly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The same mutations to lysine in LAT reduced the rate of Tyr 226 phosphorylation by ZAP-70 by more than 80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Mutation of Glu 231 (+5 position) to alanine caused a two-fold increase in the Lck-catalyzed rate of LAT Tyr 226 phosphorylation, suggesting that a downstream negative charge on substrates might repel Lck, and this rate was further enhanced by mutation of that same glutamate residue to lysine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). By contrast, the E231K mutation had a negative impact on LAT Tyr 226 phosphorylation by ZAP-70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). These observations explain why Lck phosphorylates LAT Tyr 127 with moderate efficiency: this is the only ZAP-70 substrate without a negatively-charged residue downstream of the tyrosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>ZAP-70 substrate recognition is governed by a positively-charged region surrounding the kinase active site</title><p>Unlike Lck, ZAP-70 has a relatively large positively-charged patch surrounding the binding site for peptide substrates, which provides potential contact points for substrate residues both upstream and downstream of the tyrosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7A and B</xref>). This region in ZAP-70 has at least ten lysine and arginine residues and only three negatively-charged residues, one of which is required for catalysis (Asp 461). To identify interactions that might dictate substrate recognition, we ran molecular dynamics simulations of the ZAP-70 kinase domain bound to a peptide spanning LAT residues 219 to 233 (surrounding Tyr 226). Using the structure of the substrate-bound insulin receptor kinase domain as a guide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hubbard, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Parang et al., 2001</xref>), we built a model of the ZAP-70 kinase domain in an active conformation, bound to the LAT peptide, ATP, and two Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions (there are no crystal structures of substrate complexes of ZAP-70). The peptide was modeled into the active site by docking the tyrosine residue and the three residues immediately after it so that they form an antiparallel β sheet with the activation loop, as seen in tyrosine kinase-substrate co-crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bose et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hubbard, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Levinson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Parang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>).

ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">2</xref>). In all five simulations, the short antiparallel β sheet formed by the peptide and the activation loop persisted for the length of each trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Additionally, the phospho-acceptor tyrosine residue often adopted a configuration in close proximity to the catalytic aspartate residue (Asp 461) and the γ-phosphate of ATP, consistent with the requirements for phospho-transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>The molecular dynamics simulations revealed the formation of a stable ion pair between the −1 aspartate of the substrate (Asp 225) and Lys 504, a highly conserved residue in tyrosine kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). Located near the active site, and within a substrate-binding site that leads into it, is a loop connecting helices F and G of the kinase domain (the FG loop, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This loop presents four lysine residues towards the substrate (residues 538, 541, 542, and 544). The −1 Asp frequently formed an interaction with Lys 538 and made occasional contact with Lys 544 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). In Lck, the residues in the FG loop corresponding to Lys 538 and Lys 544 in ZAP-70 are isoleucine and threonine, respectively, which presumably removes the requirement for Asp at the −1 position of the substrate and enforces the preference for hydrophobic residues that has been noted previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Songyang et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>The molecular dynamics simulations show that the FG loop in ZAP-70 is also important for recognition of residues located at the −5 to −7 positions with respect to the tyrosine residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). For the LAT Tyr 226 peptide, the upstream residues Glu 219, Glu 220, and Glu 221 formed frequent but transient ion pairs with all four lysine residues on the FG loop as well as with Lys 504. These ion pairs typically persisted for 5 to 10 ns before breaking and forming again. While any specific ion pair was short-lived, the clusters of negative charges on LAT and positive charges on ZAP-70 ensured that at least one or more ion pairs were formed in at least 50% of the instantaneous structures sampled from each trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>The simulations also showed that ZAP-70 recognizes negatively-charged residues located downstream of Tyr 226. In the molecular dynamics trajectories, Glu 231, located five residues downstream of Tyr 226, frequently formed an interaction with Arg 514 in ZAP-70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s6">Figure 7—figure supplement 6</xref>). In Lck, the residue corresponding to this arginine is a glycine, which explains why Lck does not select for negative residues at this position in the substrate.</p><p>The results of the molecular dynamics simulations are consistent with a number of experimental measurements of kinase activity. We purified a ZAP-70 kinase domain construct in which three of the four lysine residues in the FG loop were replaced by alanine (a 'KKMK-to-AAMA' mutation in the FG loop). This mutant ZAP-70 displayed substantially reduced activity against most of the LAT and SLP-76 peptides in kinase assays, and also showed an increased ability to phosphorylate ITAMs, when compared to wild-type ZAP-70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s7">Figure 7—figure supplement 7</xref>). When upstream glutamate residues in a LAT Tyr 226-containing peptide were replaced by alanine or lysine, there was a marked reduction in phosphorylation efficiency by wild-type ZAP-70. By contrast, the phosphorylation rate for ZAP-70 bearing the KKMK-to-AAMA mutation was not affected by these charge-altering mutations in LAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s8">Figure 7—figure supplement 8</xref>).</p><p>Arg 514 in ZAP-70 interacts with negatively-charged residues downstream of the tyrosine, and the importance of this residue for the ability of ZAP-70 to phosphorylate LAT was validated by mutation of this residue to alanine and glutamate. Both mutations reduced the rate at which ZAP-70 phosphorylated LAT Tyr 226. Replacing Glu 231 (+5 position) in the LAT peptide with lysine reduced phosphorylation by wild-type ZAP-70, but the presence of the lysine in the substrate peptide had no effect on phosphorylation by ZAP-70 with Arg 514 mutated to alanine or glutamate, consistent with the removal of a repulsive interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s9">Figure 7—figure supplement 9</xref>). The E231K mutation in the LAT Tyr 226 peptide results in reduced phosphorylation by ZAP-70. In contrast, for Lck, this mutation results in increased phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is consistent with the opposite charge preferences of ZAP-70 and Lck downstream of substrate tyrosines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Brownian dynamics simulations suggest a role for long-range electrostatic effects in modulating the specificity of ZAP-70</title><p>While the molecular dynamics simulations point to interactions between ZAP-70 and LAT that are important once the peptide is bound, we wondered if long-range electrostatic interactions could also play a role in substrate recognition.

Peptides were modeled as rigid and extended β strands of 15 residues, with 7 residues on either side of the phospho-acceptor tyrosine, with sequences corresponding to various LAT phosphosites. For each kinase-peptide pair, 10,000 trajectories were initiated by randomly placing the peptide on the surface of a sphere of radius 150 Å, centered on the center of mass of the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). A Brownian dynamics trajectory was then generated for each initial configuration of the peptides. Trajectories were terminated when the peptide moved more than 250 Å from the center of mass of the protein. For analysis, coordinates were sampled from the trajectories every 200 ps, leading to ~1 million to ~100 million instantaneous structures for the different peptides (peptides that tend to stay longer in the vicinity of the protein lead to longer trajectories).</p><p>To visualize the Brownian dynamics trajectories for each peptide, we selected all instantaneous structures for which the Cα atom of the tyrosine residue is within 70 Å of the center of mass of the protein. A random sampling of 0.1% of these peptide positions is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> for six different systems, five for ZAP-70 with peptide segments corresponding to Tyr 127, Tyr 226, Tyr 171, Tyr 110, and Tyr 191 in LAT, and one for Lck with the peptide corresponding to Tyr 127 in LAT. The first three tyrosine residues are good substrates for ZAP-70, while Tyr 110 and Tyr 191 are relatively poor ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Tyr 127 and Tyr 226 both have a net charge of −6, with the charges on Tyr 171, Tyr 110, and Tyr 191 being −4, −3, and −2, respectively.</p><p>Comparison of the number of instantaneous structures within the 70 Å sphere for the different peptides is instructive – the greater this number, the longer the peptide stayed in the vicinity of the kinase domain before escaping beyond the 250 Å horizon. By this metric, Tyr 127, a good ZAP-70 substrate, is enriched around the ZAP-70 kinase domain by a factor of ~150 compared to Tyr 191, a poor substrate. Also, Tyr 127 is enriched around the ZAP-70 kinase domain by a factor of ~200 relative to the same peptide around Lck.</p><p>Within the 70 Å sphere, the good substrates for ZAP-70 are preferentially localized around the active site. This effect is particularly striking for Tyr 127 and Tyr 226 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, top-left and top-middle panels). Tyr 191, which is a poor substrate for ZAP-70, does not cluster around the ZAP-70 active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, bottom middle panel). A quantitative analysis of this feature is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>. Tyr 127, which is a good substrate for ZAP-70 and is also phosphorylated by Lck, does not cluster around the Lck active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, bottom right panel). Thus, long-range electrostatic steering appears to be a feature of the ZAP-70-LAT interaction that is not shared by Lck. The importance of electrostatics for substrate recruitment by ZAP-70 is substantiated by the fact that ZAP-70 activity against LAT peptides is strongly dependent on ionic strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). The role of electrostatics in substrate recognition by ZAP-70 contrasts with the previously appreciated role for electrostatics in controlling the activation of Src-family kinases, which is also salt dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ozkirimli et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>A model for tyrosine kinase activation loop phosphorylation</title><p>Src-family kinases, including Lck, are activated by <italic>trans-</italic>autophosphorylation of their activation loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cooper and MacAuley, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hui and Vale, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moarefi et al., 1997</xref>). ZAP-70, by contrast, requires Lck or another Src-family kinase for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Williams et al., 1998</xref>), as it cannot efficiently phosphorylate its own activation loop or SH2-kinase linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yan et al., 2013</xref>) (and data not shown). The molecular basis for activation loop phosphorylation in tyrosine kinases is still not completely understood. Early studies on Src-family kinases demonstrated that they could phosphorylate peptides based on their activation loop sequences, and that the primary sequence of the peptide impacted phosphorylation efficiency; however, activation loop phosphorylation was substantially faster with full-length protein substrates when compared to peptides, indicating a role for the tertiary structure of the substrate in autophosphorylation reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Casnellie et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hunter, 1982</xref>).</p><p>We carried out a comprehensive manual inspection of all crystal structures of tyrosine kinases in the Protein Data Bank to identify plausible autophosphorylation complexes that might be suggested by crystal lattice packing. We identified one crystal structure of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1-R) kinase domain in which two of the four molecules in the asymmetric unit interact in a manner that appears compatible with activation loop phosphorylation, with one kinase taking the role of the enzyme and the other that of the substrate (PDB code 3LVP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nemecek et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, this same autophosphorylation complex was identified independently in an automated survey of the Protein Data Bank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). We built homology models for Lck and c-Src autophosphorylation complexes based on the IGF1-R structure (PDB code 3LVP).</p><p>Several other <italic>trans</italic>-autophosphorylation complexes have been proposed for tyrosine kinases, including potential structures for activation loop phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Xu et al., 2015</xref>) and C-terminal tail phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). We considered these alternative proposals for <italic>trans</italic>-autophosphorylation complexes but favored the model based on PDB code 3LVP as it was consistent with our mutagenesis experiments (noted below, in this section and the following one). <italic>Trans</italic>-autophosphorylation complexes have also recently been defined for certain serine/threonine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oliver et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pike et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zorba et al., 2014</xref>). These structures do not provide suitable models for Lck and ZAP-70, because the shorter activation loops of the tyrosine kinases do not allow them to form the corresponding complexes.</p><p>In the Lck and c-Src models based on PDB code 3LVP, there were no clashes between the two kinase domains, and there were salt bridges at the interface that could plausibly stabilize it. The model for the Lck autophosphorylation complex is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, with one view showing the enzyme-kinase in a near-standard orientation and the other with the substrate-kinase in a similar orientation. In this model, as is also seen for peptide recognition by kinases, there is a short two-stranded antiparallel β sheet formed by the activation loop of the enzyme-kinase and the substrate. An obvious feature of the Lck and c-Src autophosphorylation models is that the FG loop of the enzyme-kinase is at the heart of the docking site of the substrate kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, top panels). The FG loop docks on a hydrophobic patch on the substrate-kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, bottom panels). This hydrophobic patch is formed between the G and EF helices of the substrate kinase, a known docking site on kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Depetris et al., 2005</xref>). This close packing is possible because the FG loop of the Src-family kinases, like that of IGF1-R, has small hydrophobic residues facing outwards.<fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20105.030</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>A structural model for activation loop phosphorylation of Lck.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic cartoons and structural renderings of a model for Lck activation loop <italic>trans</italic>-autophosphorylation.

This has an obvious consequence for <italic>trans</italic>-autophosphorylation of the activation loop. The highly charged FG loop in the enzyme-kinase is incompatible with docking on the hydrophobic patch in the substrate-enzyme in the models for the autophosphorylation complex. Additionally, in the models for the autophosphorylation complexes of Lck and c-Src, close contact between the enzyme-kinase and the substrate-kinase is enabled by the presence of a glycine residue in the FG loop (Gly 443 in Lck) of the enzyme-kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Gly 443 in Lck is conserved in many tyrosine kinases, including all other Src-family kinases as well as IGF-1R, which our model is based on. Gly 443 in Lck is replaced by Lys 542 in ZAP-70, one of the positively-charged residues in the FG loop, and Lys 542 cannot be accommodated within the autophosphorylation complex.</p><p>Two other glycine residues are also important in the substrate-kinase molecule. Gly 415 in the substrate-Lck packs close to the FG loop of the enzyme-kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), but this residue is replaced by Arg 514 in ZAP-70, a residue that is important for determining the specificity for negatively-charged residues downstream of the tyrosine in substrate peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). If ZAP-70 were to take the position of a substrate-kinase, then Arg 514 would be incompatible with the autophosphorylation complex, as it would come into close contact with Lys 504 in the FG loop of the ZAP-70 molcule playing the role of the enzyme. Gly 399 in the substrate-Lck is replaced by alanine in ZAP-70, which the model predicts would also lead to clashes.</p><p>One of the striking results of the specificity screens with Lck is the absence of strong selection upstream of the tyrosine residue in peptide substrates. This weak upstream selectivity in Lck is correlated with the presence of small, nonpolar residues in the FG loop in Lck and other Src-family kinases, which our modeling predicts is necessary for the formation of the autophosphorylation complex. Thus, the Src-family kinases appear to have traded upstream selectivity in substrates for the ability to undergo efficient autophosphorylation on the activation loop. In contrast, the ability of ZAP-70 to impose strong electrostatic selectivity upstream of the tyrosine residue appears to have negated its ability to undergo efficient autophosphorylation.</p><p>We tested whether mutations at positions that clearly impact substrate specificity in ZAP-70 would also affect autophosphorylation rates. The KKMK-to-AAMA mutation in the FG loop, which reduced LAT and SLP-76 phosphorylation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s7">Figure 7—figure supplement 7</xref>), caused a clear increase in activation loop autophosphorylation of the ZAP-70 kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Consistent with this observation, introduction of lysine residues at corresponding positions into the Lck and c-Src kinase domains reduced their autophosphorylation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>).

To do this, we made two chimeric constructs. One (Lck/ZAP-70) has the SH3 and SH2 domains of Lck fused to the kinase domain of ZAP-70. The other (ZAP-70/Lck) has the tandem SH2 domains of ZAP-70 fused to the kinase domain of Lck.

Simultaneous mutation of Lys 541, Lys 542, and Lys 544 in ZAP-70 to alanine (KKMK-to-AAMA mutant, denoted ZAP-70*) resulted in a reduction of LAT phosphorylation and an increase in TCRζ phosphorylation, even in the absence of Lck, suggesting that this mutant ZAP-70 can auto-activate. Conversely, mutation of the FG loop in Lck (PGMT-to-KKMK mutant, denoted Lck*) resulted in a loss of both Lck and TCRζ phosphorylation. No gain in LAT phosphorylation was observed for this protein.</p><p>The sequence of the FG loop in Syk resembles that of ZAP-70 but contains one glycine residue that is important for autophosphorylation in Lck (Gly 443 in Lck, Gly 575 in Syk, and Lys 542 in ZAP-70). Mutation of the FG loop sequence of Syk to that of ZAP-70 (RGMK-to-KKMK) decreased Syk activation loop autophosphorylation and also decreased the ability of Syk to phosphorylate TCRζ and LAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). These mutations also made Syk more dependent on activation by Lck. Mutation of the FG loop sequence of ZAP-70 to that of Syk (KKMK-to-RGMK) did not result in robust autophosphorylation, presumably because Arg 514 in ZAP-70, which is a tyrosine in Syk, inhibits formation of the enzyme-substrate complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Similar to Syk, however, this ZAP-70 mutant could phosphorylate both LAT and TCRζ.

To address this question, we analyzed a curated list of experimentally-determined substrates for human tyrosine kinases from the PhosphoSitePlus database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hornbeck et al., 2015</xref>). This dataset comprises roughly 1100 phosphosites for approximately 100 tyrosine kinases. We binned these sequences based on the net charge of the sequence surrounding the tyrosine and the identity of the −1 position with respect to the phosphosite, two key determinants of ZAP-70 specificity. On average, tyrosine kinase substrates have a near-neutral net charge in proximity to the phospho-acceptor tyrosine, and the residues at the −1 position segregate into three groups: bulky-hydrophobic, polar-neutral, and negatively-charged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). Lck substrates, such as the T cell receptor ITAM phosphosites, fall into each of these major categories and are thus representative of typical tyrosine kinase substrates. LAT and SLP-76 phosphosites, however, are distinctive in having both a −1 acidic residue and a substantially negative net charge. Both of these features are conserved in LAT sequences across different vertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>).<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20105.035</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Unique sequence features of ZAP-70 and its substrates.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Analysis of net charge and −1 residue distributions for 1100 tyrosine kinase substrates from the PhosphoSite Plus database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hornbeck et al., 2015</xref>).

Most of these residues are not conserved in other human non-receptor tyrosine kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>). The predicted isoelectric point of the ZAP-70 kinase domain is ~9, and it has a net charge of +7.

Thus, the degree and placement of positive charge on its kinase domain makes ZAP-70 an outlier among tyrosine kinases.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Our results provide a molecular explanation for the order of initial phosphorylation events during T cell receptor signaling. This sequence of events is largely dictated by the substrate specificities of the ZAP-70 and Lck kinase domains, which we have defined using a high-throughput assay to measure phosphorylation levels for hundreds of mutant peptides based on natural substrates of these kinases. Unlike Lck, and probably most other tyrosine kinases, ZAP-70 preferentially phosphorylates substrates that are enriched in negatively-charged residues, depleted of positively-charged residues, and have an aspartate at the −1 position relative to the phospho-acceptor tyrosine. These features are characteristic of the targets of ZAP-70 in LAT and SLP-76. In accommodating LAT and SLP-76, ZAP-70 not only became a highly specialized kinase but also lost the ability to activate itself by <italic>trans</italic>-autophosphorylation. This coupling between substrate recognition and autophosphorylation in ZAP-70, along with the electrostatic features of LAT and SLP-76, insulate these proteins from undesirable cross-talk with other signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>).<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20105.036</object-id><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Schematic depiction of the biochemical insulation of ZAP-70, LAT, and SLP-76.</title><p>Many tyrosine kinases, such as Lck, c-Src, and Itk, can activate themselves through <italic>trans</italic>-autophosphorylation of their activation loops (bottom panel, left side). These kinases can efficiently phosphorylate typical tyrosine kinase substrates, which have a near-neutral net charge (bottom panel, right side). ZAP-70 activation requires phosphorylation of its activation loop by Lck (top left panel). Once activated, ZAP-70 exclusively phosphorylates LAT and SLP-76, but not typical tyrosine kinase substrates, and LAT and SLP-76 cannot be phosphorylated by kinases like Lck, c-Src, and Itk (top right panel). Thus, ZAP-70 and its substrates are insulated from other proteins in the T cell receptor signaling pathway.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20105.036">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20105.036</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-20105-fig12-v4"/></fig></p><p>A critical aspect of this electrostatic selection mechanism is that it provides stringent control over kinase-substrate interactions without restricting the diversity of downstream signals. The evolution of ZAP-70 substrates has led to the incorporation of substantial negative charge both upstream and downstream of their phospho-acceptor tyrosines. The resulting electrostatic selection is sufficiently discriminatory to ensure exclusive phosphorylation of these sites in LAT and SLP-76 by ZAP-70, while allowing each of these phosphosites to have unique functional properties. Not only can each phosphosite on LAT and SLP-76 bind to distinct SH2 domain-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Houtman et al., 2004</xref>), but the rate of phosphorylation at these sites can also be tuned without compromising kinase specificity, as described earlier for LAT Tyr 132.</p><p>What evolutionary forces might have shaped the origin of the electrostatic features in LAT and SLP-76? They probably evolved not only through positive selection for efficient phosphorylation by ZAP-70, but also through negative selection against phosphorylation by other tyrosine kinases, including Lck. This type of system-wide negative selection has been noted previously for SH3 domain-ligand interactions in yeast, which are intrinsically promiscuous, but can achieve a remarkable degree of specificity in the cellular context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zarrinpar et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In the case of T cell receptor-proximal kinase signaling, negative selection was presumably crucial for establishing an insulated network in which Src-family kinases cannot phosphorylate LAT. Several studies have shown that there is an active pool of Lck in the T cell, even prior to receptor stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nika et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schoenborn et al., 2011</xref>), and the amount of active Lck establishes a threshold for responses to peptide ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Manz et al., 2015</xref>). Both Lck and LAT are membrane-bound, and they may cluster in the same membrane micro-domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>). Given this, if Lck could readily phosphorylate LAT, aberrant downstream signaling would result without T cell receptor stimulation by an appropriate antigen.</p><p>The tight regulation of ZAP-70 and its narrow substrate specificity are also important for faithful T cell receptor signaling, as they favor a T cell response to peptide antigens bound to MHC molecules. The MHC proteins on antigen-presenting cells are recognized by the CD4 and CD8 co-receptors, and Lck is tethered to these co-receptors at the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Upon peptide-MHC interaction with the T cell receptor and its co-receptors, Lck is repositioned near its favored substrates, the ITAMs within the cytoplasmic tails of the T cell receptor complex. This ensures not only the appropriate Lck-mediated phosphorylation of ITAMs but also the proper recruitment, phosphorylation, and activation of ZAP-70 by Lck. The strict dependence on Lck for ZAP-70 membrane recruitment and activation dictates that receptor triggering only occurs when peptide antigens are presented by MHC molecules.</p><p>B cells have an analogous pathway to the T cell receptor pathway that utilizes the Src-family kinase Lyn, the ZAP-70 paralog Syk, and the scaffold protein BLNK (or SLP-65). Unlike T cells, however, receptor activation in B cells does not require that antigens are presented on MHC molecules. Furthermore, B cell activation can be considered more flexible, because Syk can slowly auto-activate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tsang et al., 2008</xref>) and it can phosphorylate ITAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mukherjee et al., 2013</xref>), thereby making the Src-family kinase somewhat expendable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Takata et al., 1994</xref>). Src-family kinase participation in B cell signaling serves to speed up and increase the sensitivity of the response to B cell receptor stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mukherjee et al., 2013</xref>). These subtle differences between T and B cells underscore how signaling pathways and their corresponding molecules have evolved to achieve varying degrees of control. The techniques and findings we have presented here provide a framework to characterize the evolution and specialization of T and B cell kinases and to enhance our understanding of the design principles underlying lymphocyte signal transduction pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Preparation of DNA libraries for high-throughput specificity screens</title><sec id="s3-1-1"><title>LAT/SLP-76/p38α/TCRζ library</title><p>A pBAD33 vector containing the enhanced circularly permuted OmpX protein (eCPX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rice and Daugherty, 2008</xref>) was purchased from Addgene.

Finally, production runs were carried out under NPT conditions. Periodic boundary conditions were imposed, and particle-mesh Ewald summations were used for long-range electrostatic calculations. The van der Waals cut-off was set at 10 Å. A time step of 2 fs was employed and the structures were stored every 2 ps.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6-2"><title>Brownian dynamics simulations</title><p>Brownian dynamics simulations were performed using the Simulation of Diffusional Association (SDA) program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gabdoulline and Wade, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martinez et al., 2015</xref>), with the structures of the kinase domains of ZAP-70 (PDB ID 1U59) and Lck (1QPJ). A phosphorylated tyrosine residue at position 394 in Lck was replaced with an unphosphorylated tyrosine residue. The LAT peptides were built in an extended β conformation with the AMBER LEaP program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Case et al., 2014</xref>). The APBS program was used to compute the electrostatic potential grid around the protein and the respective peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2001</xref>). The solvent dielectric constant was set at 78.0 and the dielectric constant of the solute (protein) interior was set at 2.0. All of the simulations were run at an ionic strength corresponding to 100 mM NaCl and a temperature of 298 K. The effective charges on the surface of the protein and peptides were computed with the ECM module of SDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gabdoulline and Wade, 1996</xref>).</p><p>During the simulations the kinase domain was held fixed and trajectories for the rigid peptides about the protein were computed by solving the Ermak-McCammon algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ermak and McCammon, 1978</xref>) using SDA. We used mutual rotation and translation diffusion coefficients of the respective molecules, calculated from their hydrodynamic radius of gyration using the Stokes-Einstein relation. Each trajectory was started by placing the peptide at random positions on the surface of a sphere centered at the center of mass of the protein, with a radius of 150 Å. Each trajectory was run until the peptide moved to a distance greater than 250 Å from the center of the protein. 10,000 trajectories were generated for each peptide.</p><p>A time step of 1 ps was used when the distance between the peptide and protein was small (less than 64–68 Å, depending on the size of the sidechains of the peptide). Beyond this distance the time step was allowed to increase up to 20 ps. In order to avoid traps, the peptide was deliberately moved by 1 Å in an arbitrary direction if there was no change in position/orientation for over 150 steps.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6-3"><title>Molecular dynamics simulations of the model for the Lck autophosphorylation complex</title><p>Homology models of Lck and c-Src autophosphorylation complexes were built using the software Modeller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Webb and Sali, 2014</xref>), implemented in Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>). A crystal structure of IGF-1R (PDB code 3LVP), which contains four protein molecules in the asymmetric unit, was used as the template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nemecek et al., 2010</xref>). In this structure, chain C adopts the enzyme-kinase role and chain B adopts the substrate-kinase role. The Lck homology model was used as a starting structure for molecular dynamics simulations after docking ATP and one Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion into the active site of each kinase. MD simulations were set up and run analogously to those for the LAT-bound ZAP-70 simulations, except that the Gromacs 4.6.2 package was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pronk et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Bioinformatic analyses</title><sec id="s3-7-1"><title>Compilation and analysis of orthologous LAT sequences</title><p>The LAT sequences used to generate <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref> were compiled through a series of protein-protein BLAST searches in the NCBI non-redundant protein database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altschul et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pruitt et al., 2005</xref>). Initially, the human LAT sequence was used as the query, and in additional rounds of searches, sequences from non-mammal vertebrates were used to find sequences from more distantly-related organisms. Subject sequences identified in the BLAST searches were kept if they met three criteria: (1) the N-terminal ~30 amino acids should be predominantly hydrophobic and followed by a 'CXXC' lipidation motif, consistent with the membrane anchor in human and mouse LAT, (2) the C-terminal ~100 amino acids should contain at least 3 or 4 tyrosine residues, and (3) the tyrosine residues should be surrounded by sequences that resemble SH2 binding sites: for example, the Y[I/L]XV motif at Tyr 132 represents a PLCγ1 binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Songyang et al., 1993</xref>). Using this approach, we identified 43 mammalian LAT sequences and 16 non-mammalian vertebrate LAT sequences.

Two criteria were used to determine if a sequence should be retained: (1) the sequence should contain the canonical SH2-SH2-kinase domain architecture of Syk-family kinases, and (2) the sequence should have highest homology to ZAP-70, as opposed to Syk, when used as the query in a BLAST search against the human proteome. In total, 87 ZAP-70 orthologs were unambiguously identified in organisms ranging from cartilaginous fish to mammals. Sequences were aligned using the T-Coffee multiple sequence alignment program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Notredame et al., 2000</xref>), and the sequence logo was generated using WebLogo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Crooks et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The sequence logo for human non-receptor tyrosine kinases was generated by manually compiling all 32 kinase domain sequences followed by the same alignment and visualization protocol.

As of May 14, 2016, the dataset contained over 16,000 kinase-substrate pairs from a variety of organisms. This parent list was filtered to only select human kinase-substrate pairs in which a substrate tyrosine was the reported phosphosite, resulting in 1118 non-redundant substrate sequences. Each sequence comprised 7 residues upstream and 7 residues downstream of the tyrosine phosphosite. The net charge of each sequence was estimated by summing the number of lysine and arginine residues and subtracting the sum of the number of aspartate and glutamate residues. Sequences were sorted based on net charge and the identity of the −1 residue relative to the phosphosite. The −1 residue similarities were assessed based on the BLOSUM score relative to aspartate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Hector Nolla and Alma Valeros of the Flow Cytometry Core Facility at UC Berkeley for their assistance with cell sorting; Xiaoxian Cao for assistance with insect cell expression of kinases; Pradeep Bandaru for assistance with analysis of deep sequencing data; and Jeanine Amacher, Yongjian Huang, Yasushi Kondo, and Yamuna Krishnan for critically reading the manuscript.

surface-display levels for peptide libraries</title><p>The platform we have used to derive the efficiency of phosphorylation of peptides by ZAP-70 and Lck relies on the expression of a scaffold protein (eCPX), fused to individual peptides, on the surface of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. The eCPX scaffold allows us to display two peptides per scaffold on the bacterial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rice and Daugherty, 2008</xref>). In our experiments, the N-terminus of eCPX was fused to the substrate peptide, and the C-terminus was fused to a Strep-tag (with the sequence WSHPQFEK), which we can detect using a sequence-specific antibody and thus use as a marker for surface-display level. Here, we describe the variation in surface-display levels for different wild-type parent peptides, as well as mutant peptides in a scanning mutagenesis library. We first describe the results for different parent peptides.</p><p>To measure surface-display levels of individual peptides within a library, <italic>E. coli</italic> cells were grown and expression of the eCPX scaffold fused to the peptides was induced as described for the phosphorylation screens. After expression, cells were labeled with a Strep-tag-specific antibody conjugated to a FITC-like dye (IBA StrepMAB-Classic Chromeo 488 conjugate). The cells were analyzed by flow cytometry and divided into 5 or 6 bins spanning the distribution of surface-display levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). In a typical experiment, ~10<sup>6</sup> cells were collected from each bin. DNA from each bin of cells, as well as from an unsorted population, was isolated and deep sequenced as described for the phosphorylation screens.<fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20105.039</object-id><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Distribution of surface-display levels and sorting bins for a library of peptides based on segments of LAT, SLP-76, p38α, and TCRζ.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20105.039">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20105.039</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-20105-app1-fig1-v4"/></fig></p><p>To analyze the sequencing data, raw counts were determined for DNA corresponding to each peptide in each of the populations (5 or 6 sorted populations and one set corresponding to an input library before sorting). The frequency of each sequence in each sorted population (raw counts for that sequence divided by the total counts for that sample) was normalized to the frequency of the same sequence in the unsorted set. These normalized frequencies were then scaled by the fraction of total cells that the particular population represents (shown in the table in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>).

There have been many peptide library approaches to the primary substrate specificity of protein kinases in general and tyrosine kinases specifically, and these have generally been disappointingly inconclusive about predicting or clarifying physiologic substrate information. This manuscript though breaks new ground in generating methods and principles that seem likely to be reliable and of broad interest to the kinase field. There are several notable features. First, the manuscript convincingly confirms the role of local amino acids in influencing the specificity of ZAP-70 vs. Lck. Using a combination of bacterial display libraries and synthetic peptides, the authors make these distinctions clear and enlightening. Second, the authors uncover the structural basis for the Lck vs. ZAP-70 selectivity. This is probably the most novel and important part of the manuscript. Using computational methods, the authors predicted a basic cluster in the ZAP-70 catalytic domain, not present in Lck, which serves to repel basic residues in the vicinity of the target Tyr in substrates and is attracted to acidic residues in substrates. They elegantly confirm this using synthetic peptide substrates and cellular transfection assays. This is a triumph for molecular simulation. Third, taking these findings into account, the authors generate a model of how activation loop trans-autophosphorylation takes place. The basis of such autophosphorylation has been vexing for the field and the authors make a good case for why ZAP-70 cannot activate itself but Lck (and many other TKs) can. One of the highlights of the paper was the use of transfection experiments and chimeric tyrosine kinases that helped validate the model. Fourth, the authors use a Brownian motion simulation in a productive way to understand substrate specificity, not yet a mainstream endeavor in protein/enzyme analysis. Overall, this paper is rich with insight and novelty that should be of great interest to the readers of <italic>eLife</italic>, although we ask the authors to consider the points below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The plotting of peptide kinetics vs. bacterial display preferences in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> is odd in that the kinase kinetics is presented in a linear scale and the bacterial display data on a log scale. It is not clear what the physical basis for this is. In linear free energy correlations, it is customary to use a log-log plot. For that matter, it seems surprising that the kinetic effects with kinase assays and peptides seem much smaller than the bacterial display selectivity effects. Perhaps the authors could comment on this.</p><p>The authors point out that there have not been convincing structures reported that show how activation loop tyrosine kinase phosphorylations occur in trans. The reviewers are not aware of any examples either. However, in PMID: 19060208, Chen et al. make a good case that their crystal structure of the <italic>FGFR2</italic> kinase domain captures trans-phosphorylation state of one kinase molecule phosphorylating the C-terminus of the other. The authors should probably cite this study and briefly describe the similarities/differences between their findings and that of the <italic>FGFR2</italic> structural analysis of Chen et al.</p><p>Given the strong conclusion about long-range electrostatic steering as a critical aspect of the ZAP-70-LAT interaction, it would be interesting to determine the effects of varied salt concentration on the kinase reactions. Presumably, the phosphorylation rate should increase at low salt and decrease at very high salt. This type of salt dependence of the induction phase in kinetic assays was exploited to the role of an electrostatic network in a previous study (Ozkirimli et al. Protein Sci. 2008 Nov;17(11<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11"/>):1871-80). We recognize, however, that the authors have already included an extensive set of experiments in this manuscript. If they choose not to include additional measurements in this study, perhaps they could comment on this issue.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20105.045</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p> <italic>[…] Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>The plotting of peptide kinetics vs. bacterial display preferences in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> is odd in that the kinase kinetics is presented in a linear scale and the bacterial display data on a log scale.

We have converted our graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> to a log-log plot. Indeed, the correlation between in vitro phosphorylation rates and enrichment values from our screen fits better to a line when both variables are log-transformed.</p><p>The difference in the magnitudes of the kinetic effects and the bacterial display selectivity effects (the slope of the line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) is somewhat arbitrary, and it will be dependent on the screen. For example, the mutants shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> span a range of -1 to 1 in log<sub>10</sub>(enrichment), and this corresponds to a 2- to 3-fold change in phosphorylation rate. This reflects the fact that the wild-type peptide, surrounding LAT Tyr 226, is a good substrate for ZAP-70, and thus individual substitutions only have a modest, albeit measurable, effect. By contrast, for ZAP-70 phosphorylation of a poor substrate, the peptide encompassing LAT Tyr 132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), substitutions at Gly 131 have a log<sub>10</sub>(enrichment) of roughly 1, but this can correspond to a 16-fold enhancement in phosphorylation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). We consider the ability to accurately detect small effects from point mutants, even in the context of an optimal substrate, to be a strength of our specificity screening platform. We have modified the text, where the results of the screens are first introduced, to state this.</p><p><italic>The authors point out that there have not been convincing structures reported that show how activation loop tyrosine kinase phosphorylations occur in trans.

We have measured phosphorylation of a LAT-based sequence by ZAP-70 under varying salt concentrations, and these data are now included <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>. As expected, increasing the ionic strength of the reaction solution dramatically reduces the rate of LAT phosphorylation. The end of the section on Brownian dynamics and long-range electrostatics has been updated to reference these new data. The citation provided by the reviewer is interesting because it points to the importance of an electrostatic network in controlling the activity of Src kinases, such as Lck, and we now cite this work in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
