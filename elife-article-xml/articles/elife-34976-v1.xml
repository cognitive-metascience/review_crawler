In the olfactory system, this enhancement is thought to occur partially through the integration of adult-born inhibitory interneurons resulting in a refinement of the representation of overlapping odorants. Here, we identify in mice a novel and unexpected dissociation between passive and active learning at the level of adult-born granule cells. Specifically, while both passive and active learning processes augment neurogenesis, adult-born cells differ in their morphology, functional coupling and thus their impact on olfactory bulb output. Morphological analysis, optogenetic stimulation of adult-born neurons and mitral cell recordings revealed that passive learning induces increased inhibitory action by adult-born neurons, probably resulting in more sparse and thus less overlapping odor representations. Conversely, after active learning inhibitory action is found to be diminished due to reduced connectivity. In this case, strengthened odor response might underlie enhanced discriminability.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>olfactory bulb</kwd><kwd>olfactory learning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mandairon</surname><given-names>Nathalie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mandairon</surname><given-names>Nathalie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>While both implicit and explicit learning augment neurogenesis, adult-born cells differ in their morphology, functional coupling and inhibitory action impacting differentially the olfactory bulb output.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Brain representations of the environment constantly evolve through learning mediated by different plasticity mechanisms. Several lines of evidence suggested that adult neurogenesis is a plasticity mechanism mediating changes in representations of sensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lledo and Valley, 2016</xref>). Experience-dependent survival of adult-born neurons has received recent attention as a mechanism to modulate pattern separation and perceptual discrimination in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb (OB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sahay et al., 2011</xref>). In the OB, current hypotheses about the mechanism underlying this enhanced discrimination capability focus on increased inhibitory processes mediated by GABAergic adult-born neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Moreno et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso et al., 2012</xref>), with more integrating cells delivering more inhibition, leading to sparser odor representations. The data presented here challenge the current hypothesis by showing that the same rate of adult-born cell survival in the OB can enhance fine olfactory discrimination by either increasing or decreasing OB output sparseness. In the olfactory system, both passive (implicit perceptual learning in response to repeated exposure) and active (explicit associative learning in response to reinforcement) learning can improve discrimination between similar odorants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Mandairon et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Moreno et al., 2009</xref>). Both forms of learning have been shown to modulate neural activity in the OB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buonviso et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kay and Laurent, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Doucette et al., 2011</xref>), and to increase survival of inhibitory adult-born interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Moreno et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sultan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mandairon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sultan et al., 2011</xref>). However, exactly how adult-born neurons shape the output of the OB to support enhanced discrimination in these two paradigms is currently unknown. To address this question, we focused on how the number of integrated adult-born cells and/or the synaptic contacts established by adult-born neurons in the network could account for experience-induced changes in perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Moreno et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Daroles et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The data reported here, combining morphological analysis and optogenetic stimulation of adult-born neurons with mitral cells activity recording, indicate that both forms of learning similarly enhanced the number of adult-born neurons formed in the OB. However, these adult-born neurons showed higher density of dendritic spines compared to controls in implicit learning only, leading to stronger inhibition of mitral cells. In contrast, in explicit learning, adult-born neurons formed weaker connections to mitral cells, resulting in disinhibition of mitral cells in learning conditions compared to control. These experiments indicate that a same number of adult-born inhibitory neurons are able to positively or negatively modulate inhibition in the OB, depending on the synaptic integration mode and dictated by the behavioral significance of the odorant.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Implicit learning increased adult-born granule cell survival and spine density</title><p>To induce implicit learning, animals were exposed to two odorants, which are not spontaneously discriminated: +limonene (+lim) and - limonene (-lim). These were placed in two tea balls in the home cage for one hour per day over 10 days as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Moreno et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2012</xref>) (Enriched animals; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Enriched animals discriminated +lim and -lim at the end of the enrichment procedure as evidenced by increased investigation times between the last habituation trial (OHab4) and the test trial (OTest) (Wilcoxon test for discrimination p=0.004) whereas the controls did not (Wilcoxon test for discrimination p=0.74) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>We used Bromodeoxy-uridine (BrdU) incorporation to quantify adult-born neuron survival and lentiviral transduction to follow their morphological integration into the network (GFP encoding lentivirus was injected 8 days before enrichment to allow for adult-born neurons to migrate from the subventricular zone to the OB; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC) frequency recorded on M/T cells showed a trend toward increase after implicit learning (p=0.06, Kruskal-Wallis Anova followed by FDR-corrected permutation test, Enriched, n = 50 and Non-Enriched, n = 48) (for detailed statistics see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) with no change in amplitude (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, Enriched n = 48 and Non-Enriched, n = 46). To isolate the specific role of adult-born granule cells in the inhibition of M/T cells among the global granule cell population, we then optogenically activated channelrhodopsin expressing adult-born granule cells in OB slices (adult-born granule cells were transduced with Lenti-hSyn-ChR2EYFP 25- 30 days before testing) and recorded the evoked inhibitory post-synaptic current (eIPSC) in M/T cells (Enriched n = 27 cells from three mice; Non-Enriched n = 25 cells from three mice) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, left). Data analysis indicated an overall effect of light stimulation of granule cells on M/T cells eIPSC frequency (light effect, parametric Anova, F(1,198)=4.37, p=0.037, paired t-tests for light versus pre light: p=0.0025 in the enriched group, p=0.2 in the non-enriched group) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Besides, eIPSC frequency was higher in enriched compared to Non-enriched animals (learning effect, parametric ANOVA, F(1,198)=4.47, p=0.03, t-test for difference between Enriched and non-enriched under light stimulation, p=0.04) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). No change in eIPSC amplitude was observed (parametric ANOVA, light effect F(1,160)=2.66, p=0.1, learning effect F(1,160)=1.72, p=0.19) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). To identify the individual M/T cells actually responding to adult-born granule cell stimulation, we performed a statistical comparison of the pre- and post-light IPSC occurrence across repeated stimulations (see Materials and methods). Results indicated that the percentage of light-responding M/T cells is marginally increased in enriched compared to non-enriched animals (unilateral Chi squared, p=0.07; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> right and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Additionally, we showed that the biophysical properties of adult-born granule cells (resting potential, membrane resistance, membrane capacitance and input/output curves) were unaffected by learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thus, the results from these experiments suggest that increased structural and/or functional connectivity is responsible for increased granule-to-M/T cell inhibition in enriched versus non-enriched groups, rather than any modification of the intrinsic properties of adult-born granule cells. To assess the functional outcome of this increased inhibition, we investigated in vivo M/T cell responsiveness to the learned odorant (+lim). Enriched and non-enriched animals were exposed to +lim 7 days after learning, and the percentage of odor-activated M/T cells (co-expressing the specific M/T cell marker Tbx1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Imamura et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mitsui et al., 2011</xref>) and immediate early gene Zif268) was quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). We found that implicit learning decreased the number of odor-activated M/T cells compared to non-enriched controls (587 ± 29 M/T cells counted per animal; Enr, n = 5 and Non-Enr, n = 4; Bonferroni-corrected test p=0.02; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), resulting in a sparser representation of learned odorants at the OB output. This finding is highly consistent with the increased inhibition of M/T cells observed in slice recordings. Altogether, in the context of implicit learning, adult-born granule cells provide more inhibitory contacts on M/T cells, leading to increased sparseness of M/T odor responses. As a consequence, these findings strongly support the hypothesis that a decreased overlap between learned odor representations mediates the observed increase in odor discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chu et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Explicit learning increased adult-born granule cell survival but reduced spine density</title><p>Theoretically, discrimination could also be achieved through increasing the resolution of the odor representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aimone et al., 2011</xref>), in other words through increasing the response to the learned odorant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Doucette and Restrepo, 2008</xref>). Indeed, adding information to the representation of the stimulus could ultimately help discrimination, and we hypothesized that such a mechanism could be involved in associative learning where the odor is reinforced by a positive reward. We thus trained mice on a two odorized hole-board apparatus to associate +lim with a food reward while -lim was not reinforced (Conditioned group, Cond) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Mandairon et al., 2006a</xref>).

Using the habituation/cross habituation test, we confirmed that conditioned but not pseudo-conditioned animals discriminated +lim from –lim as they did with implicit learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). As with implicit learning, explicit learning induced an increase in the survival of adult-born granule cells (n = 6/group; Bonferroni-corrected test p=0.025; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) as well as an increase in their responsiveness to the learned odor (+lim), as assessed by BrdU/Zif268 co-expression (n = 7/group; Bonferroni-corrected test p=0.005; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). However, in contrast to implicit learning, analysis of the fine morphology of adult-born neuron dendrites showed a decrease in spine density on the apical dendrites after conditioning compared to pseudo-conditioning (Cond 106 segments, four mice and PC 56 segments, five mice; non-parametric corrected test p=0.0025; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>), while no such change was observed in the basal domain (Cond: 37 segments, four mice and PC: 43 segments, four mice; non-parametric corrected test p=0.09; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). 42 days after conditioning, when discrimination had returned to control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), the spine density had also returned to control values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

The functional outcome of this decreased inhibition was assessed using Tbx21/Zif268 co-expression in mitral cells (540 ± 20 mitral cells counted per animal; n = 5 animals/group), and showed a significant increase in mitral cell responsiveness to the learned odor, (Bonferroni-corrected test p=0.04; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) suggesting that in this case, odor representations at the OB output were not rendered sparser by learning.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Comparison between implicit and explicit learning</title><p>Using a two-factor Anova, we found that explicit and implicit learnings similarly increased adult-born survival (learning versus controls F(1,18)=19.72, p=0.0003), regardless of the type of learning (implicit versus explicit F(1, 18)=0.21, p=0.64 and no interaction F(1,18)=0.006, p 0.9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C)</xref>.

While the number of integrated adult-born granule cells was similar in both forms of learning, they differed in the synaptic integration mode of adult-born neurons and their effect on M/T cell responses to odor. Implicit learning increased spine density on adult-born granule cells (apical and basal dendritic domains), in agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Daroles et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>) and increased inhibition of mitral cells, consistent with reduced number of mitral cells responding to the learned odorant. Increased number of spine in the basal domain is suggestive of an enhanced connectivity between inputs from centrifugal projections and adult-born granule cells, possibly leading to more global excitation of adult-born granule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Moreno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lepousez et al., 2014</xref>). More apical spines increase feedback inhibition between M/T and granule cells increasing local inhibition. These data suggest that in response to implicit learning, structural plasticity of adult-born cells mediates an increased feedback and central inhibition on mitral cells to support perceptual discrimination of odorants. This view is strongly supported by our previous report of enhanced paired-pulse inhibition in the OB after implicit learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Moreno et al., 2009</xref>), and of the loss of learning upon blockade of neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Moreno et al., 2009</xref>). In addition to increased spine density, the increase in the number of adult-born cells after implicit learning is also likely contributing to the enhancement of inhibition on mitral cells.</p><p>In contrast to the effects of implicit learning, a decrease in spine density in the apical domain of adult-born neurons is accompanied by a decrease in sIPCS amplitude in mitral cells after explicit learning. In addition, an overall increase rather than a decrease of mitral cells activation was observed in response to the learned odorant compared to pseudo-conditioned animals. Reduced synaptic contacts on the apical dendrites of adult born neurons reduce local feedback inhibition leading to an enhanced response of M/T cells to the learned odorants.</p><p>To summarize, the effects of implicit and explicit learning on M/T odor responses are opposite: an overall sparser response to the learned odor after implicit learning and an overall increased response to the conditioned odor after explicit learning, while similar numbers of adult-born neurons are present. Because new adult-born granule cells replace older ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Imayoshi et al., 2008</xref>), replacing pre-existing granule cells by new ones with fewer synaptic contacts with mitral cells (in conditioned animals) would result in a global pool of granule cells delivering less local inhibition in response to the conditioned odor. In contrast, replacing granule cells by new cells making more local and global synaptic contacts with mitral cells (enriched animals) would result in a shift toward more inhibition in the network. This is consistent with the experimental observations. Computational modeling suggested that reinforced inhibition reduces the overlap between similar odor representations at the level of mitral cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mandairon et al., 2006b</xref>). As an alternative mechanism leading to behavioral discrimination, decreased inhibition could lead to enhanced representations of a conditioned odor only, improving the resolution of the representation of behaviorally significant stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aimone et al., 2011</xref>). This proposed mechanism that could be at play in explicit learning is consistent with the associative coding features of the OB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Doucette et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fletcher, 2012</xref>). While these evidences favor a prominent role of adult born neurons in shaping mitral cell activity in learning, the role of pre-existing interneurons in mitral cell response plasticity remains to be investigated.</p><p>In conclusion, the data presented here challenge current hypotheses by showing that the same rate of adult-born cell survival in the OB can enhance fine discrimination by either increasing or decreasing OB output, thus revealing a new facet of the adaptability of the network provided by adult neurogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Adult male C56Bl6/J mice (Charles River, L’arbresles, France) aged 8 weeks at the beginning of the experiments were used in this experiment.

The odors were presented simultaneously on two separate swabs containing 100 µl of pure odor placed in two separate tea balls hanging from the cover of the animal’s cage. The non-enriched control mice were housed under the same conditions except that the two tea balls were left empty.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Olfactory habituation/cross habituation test</title><p>We used a cross-habituation test to assess discrimination. Briefly, the task assesses the degree to which mice are able to discriminate between odorants by habituating them to an odorant (OHab) and measuring their cross-habituation to a second odorant (OTest). If the test odorant is not discriminated from the habituation one, it will not elicit an increased investigation time by the mouse. We presented each odor in a tea ball hanging on the cover of the cage containing 60 µl of the diluted odor (1 Pa) on filter paper (Whatman #1) for 50 s. There was a 5 min pause between presentations. Odors are renewed between each test. For each animal, each odorant of the pair was used alternatively as the habituation or test odorant. The amount of time that the mice investigated the odorant was recorded during all trials as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Moreno et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2012</xref>). We determined (1) if the investigation time decreased from OHab1 to OHab4 (habituation); and (2) if the investigation time during OTest was significantly higher than for OHab4 (discrimination). These behavioural experiments were conducted blind with regard to experimental group.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Explicit (associative) learning</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Experimental design</title><p>The mice learned to discriminate +lim and - lim by training them to associate +lim with a food reward (see below). This group of mice were compared to a pseudo-conditioned control group. After a 5-day period of conditioning, the mice were tested for their ability to discriminate between +limonene (+lim) and – limonene (- lim) using an olfactory cross-habituation test (see above). They were injected with BrdU or with GFP lentivirus 13 days before training and sacrificed 25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) or 60 days after injection. During the olfactory learning experiments, water was continuously available, but the mice were deprived of food (~20% reduction of daily consummation, leading to a 10% reduction in body weight) for 5 days before the shaping session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Shaping</title><p>The mice were first trained to retrieve a reward (a small bit of sweetened cereal; Kellogg’s, Battle Creek, MI, USA) by digging through the bedding. The mouse was put in the start area of the two hole-board apparatus and allowed to dig for 2 min. During the first few trials, the reward was placed on top of the bedding in one of the holes. After the mice successfully retrieved the reward several times, it was successively buried deeper and deeper in the bedding. Shaping was considered to be complete when a mouse could successfully retrieve a reward buried deep in the bedding.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Conditioning</title><p>Conditioning consisted of 5 sessions (1/day) of 4 trials (2 min/trial, inter trial interval 15 min). For each trial, the mouse was placed in the start area and had to retrieve a reward now systematically associated with the +lim (20 µl of pure odorant). To avoid spatial learning, the rewarded dish was randomly placed in one of the two holes; the other hole contained – lim (20 µl of pure odorant) and no reward. In the pseudo-conditioned group, the reinforcement was randomly associated with either the +lim or the - lim. For each trial, correct choices (first nose poke in the odorized hole) were recorded as indicative of learning.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Lentivirus injections</title><p>The mice were anesthetized by injecting a mixture of 50 mg/kg ketamine and 7.5 mg/kg xylazine (intraperitoneal) and then secured in a stereotactic instrument (Narishige Scientific Instruments, Tokyo, Japan). For the optogenetic experiments, they were injected bilaterally in the subventricular zone (AP +1 mm, ML ±1 mm, DV −2.3 mm) with a AAV5-hSyn-ChR2EYFP viral vector (150 nl per side; Addgene 26973P). This construct was a kindly donated by the Deisseroth laboratory and produced by the Penn Vector Core facility (titer 1,3 1013 UI/ml). For the neuronal morphology experiments, a Lenti-PGK-GFP (Addgene #12252; titer 2 10<sup>9</sup> UI/ml) viral vector was injected at the same coordinates (200 nl per site).

One hour after the end of the odor stimulation, they were deeply anesthetized (pentobarbital, 0.2 ml/30 g) and killed by intracardiac perfusion of 50 ml of fixative (4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). Their brains were removed, postfixed, cryoprotected in sucrose (20%), frozen rapidly, and then stored at −20°C before sectioning (40 µm for neuronal morphology and 14 µm for BrdU analysis) with a cryostat (Reichert-Jung, NuBlock, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Image analysis and quantification</title><p>Morphological analysis of adult-born cells was performed after GFP immunohistochemisty (chicken GFP antibody, 1:1000, Anaspec TEBU, ref: 55423).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Mandairon and colleagues examined the effects of two types of olfactory learning on granule cell neurogenesis, spine density of adult-born granule cells (GCs) and mitral cell (MC) activity and physiology. The learning paradigms compared are (1) presentation of two different odors [(+)- and (-)-limonene] in the home cage (1 hour/day, 10 days) (&quot;implicit learning&quot;), and (2) odor-reward associative learning using a food-digging task (explicit [associative] learning).</p><p>The data suggest that implicit learning increased inhibitory drive onto mitral cells (assessed based on the frequency of IPSC after a short pulse of ChR2 stimulation of adult-born GCs) and decreased odor-evoked activity of the mitral cells (as measured by immediate early gene expressions). These changes were accompanied by increased spine densities both at the apical and basal dendrites of GCs. In contrast, in explicit learning, the frequency of light-evoked IPSCs was decreased in MCs, and odor-evoked activity in MCs is increased. These changes were accompanied by a decrease in spine density at apical but not basal dendrites of GCs.</p><p>Although both implicit and explicit learning induced increased discriminability in the test phase as tested by the same assay (habituation paradigm), the authors found different morphological and physiological changes in GCs and MCs. All the reviewers agreed these are potentially very interesting findings. However, all pointed substantive concerns regarding the use of statistical methods and the robustness of the data. Specifically, some conclusions were made without correcting for multiple comparisons. Furthermore, statistical significance of some of the analyses appeared to be due to outlier points, raising the issue of robustness. After discussing these concerns, the reviewers thought that it is very likely that the authors need to perform additional experiments, or significantly change their conclusions (because some results might not be statistically significant after correcting for multiple comparisons). It was the consensus of the reviewers that addressing these issues will take more than 2-3 months. We therefore decided that we cannot consider the current manuscript further at least in the present form. If the authors improve their statistical arguments either by revising the manuscript to use more statistically sound analysis or by performing more experiments to increase the sample size, we are willing to consider a revised manuscript as a new submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All the reviewers raised their concerns regarding statistical analyses. Most importantly, the authors perform multiple pair-wise comparisons. In such cases, a significance criterion should be corrected for multiple comparisons (e.g. by using Bonferroni correction). When appropriate, a one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) followed by post-hoc pair-wise comparisons is preferred. Many conclusions do not appear to hold after these corrections. This would mean that some conclusions need to be revised or the authors need to perform additional experiments to increase the sample size. More detailed criticisms and suggestions can be found in the reviewers' comments appended below.</p><p>2) Some of the statistical significance appear to be due to some outlier points in the data (e.g. reviewer 1, point #1; reviewer 2, point #2). The authors need to consider whether the results hold even removing these points. To make these results more reliable, we expect that a larger sample size is required to draw statistically-sound conclusions. The reviewers also thought that the conclusion that adult-born neurons are mediating the enhanced inhibition onto MCs requires more work:</p><p>3) How do authors control for number of cells expressing ChR2 virus or normalize counts to interpret the ChR2 stimulation data (number of spines vs. number of cells)? Are equivalent numbers of cells infected in both groups? The increase in survival induced by learning should bias the number of Chr2 expressing GCs in OB.</p><p>4) Following reversal of changes in apical spine density (but with extra adult-born GCs still present), is the effect of ChR2 stimulation on MCs lost?</p><p>5) The link between behavior (higher discrimination) and the changes at the level of neurogenesis, morphology and physiology remain largely unclear. We understand that this study is not designed to examine the mechanisms that connect these changes with behavior, but the reviewers found some of the discussions very loose. We would like the authors to state these links more carefully, so that the manuscript becomes more scholarly. For example, the authors mention &quot;pattern separation&quot; multiple times and discuss that increased or decreased inhibition may be causally related pattern separations, and in turn, increased discriminability. However, whether pattern separation causally underlies increased discrimination or whether changes in inhibitory tones can lead to pattern separations remain totally unknown (also see point #4 by reviewer 3). The present study as well as existing literature does not specify specific mechanisms underlying increased discriminability after implicit or explicit olfactory learning.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, the authors describe bidirectional changes in the spine density of olfactory bulb adult-born granule cells (aGCs), that depend on learning paradigms which the authors have established previously.</p><p>The used paradigms appear subtle and physiological, since they rely on few odor exposures. Nevertheless, the changes can be observed in electrophysiological recordings in brain slices even though the relation of the investigated mitral cells to odor-activated glomeruli is not known. Thus, the phenomena might reflect a general response of an otherwise deprived olfactory system.</p><p>My general criticism is that there are counterintuitive results that would require stronger statistics to be firmly established. Therefore, the authors should increase sample size, try to sample cells more specifically (see below) and thoroughly discuss their results, possibly requiring a longer format.</p><p>1) Statistical significance appears to be an issue with some results – would unilateral naris occlusion be feasible, which might allow for pairwise comparisons across hemibulbs? Or a higher number of animals?</p><p>While the increased spine density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) looks fine, all the other changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) show highly overlapping distributions, perhaps because some MCs in the sample might not have been involved in limonene-evoked bulbar activation. Would it be possible to preferentially record from bulbar parts with strong limonene activation? Or even better fluorescently label MC/GCs expressing IEGs and record from them?</p><p>There is a substantial amount of eIPSC recordings with high frequency in the 30-60 Hz range in PC condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). This range is not observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, even not in the enriched case. Were the high frequency responses recorded in slices from the same animal? Strikingly, the very same issue arises also for the sIPSC frequency and amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) – for both there are several data points in the high range for PC that are not observed in non-enr or enr conditions. If we now doubt the PC data for this reason, what about the statistical comparison between non-enr and cond? Unfortunately, this comparison is missing from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> – by eye between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> almost certainly there is no difference for the apical spine density. Which casts doubt on the central finding of reduced connectivity – at least anatomically.</p><p>2) What is the effect of the increase in number of adult born GCs also in the associative learning – how exactly can an addition of interneurons reduce inhibitory drive? As mentioned above, the decrease in spine numbers on the apical dendrite is barely significant. Nevertheless, there is a striking overall decrease in inhibitory drive of mitral cells, especially substantially reduced sIPSC frequency and amplitude (please label the examples from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> top in the distributions shown below). If we believe these data (but see above), what is going on here? Synaptic plasticity – reduction in release probability and/or quantal size at the GC-MC contacts – also for preexisting GCs? Were the lost contacts located close to the MC somata and thus the efficiency is strongly reduced?</p><p>3) Missing of important reference: Zhang, Huang and Hu, (2016): increased spine density on GC dendrites following odor enrichment in <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadpoles.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This report by Mandairon and colleagues is a significant new look on the function of adult born GABAergic neurons in the olfactory bulb. The community as a whole thinks in two ways about the types of learning that occur with passive exposure and conditioning. On the one hand, we all know that these are different types of learning and on the other we often refer to them as if they are the same (under the umbrella term of Learning). Similarly, for learning-based effects on the survival and integration of new granule cells in the OB. This paper shows that the ability to discriminate hard-to-discriminate odors after the two types of learning may depend in opposite fashion on neurogenesis. For passive learning, it appears that adult-born GC connections with MCs are strengthened in the external plexiform layer (at the reciprocal synapse). The authors conclude that this may be related to the effect known as sparsening. For active learning, the effects are opposite. The adult born GC effects on MCs are decreased. The argument is rigorous and rational. My only major concern regards the many pairwise statistical tests (see below). The results reported here, if improved statistical methods confirm them, may constitute one of the most significant findings in the field of olfactory learning as it relates to neurogenesis.</p><p>1) There are many more implied comparisons than reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. With 4 groups of mice, this makes 6 total comparisons for each factor (cond vs. PC, cond vs. enr, cond vs. non-enr, PC vs enr, PC vs non-enr, enr vs non-enr). With the multiple comparisons within each factor, the threshold for significance should be 0.00833. There is a pretty good argument that all of the factors should be combined in a single analysis, which then multiplies the comparisons and lowers the threshold value, or at least that like-kind factors be grouped (spine density apical/basal as one group, e/sIPSP frequency as another). This would make the p threshold smaller by a factor of 2 at least. Please provide justification in the methods for not performing the multiple comparisons adjustment or do the analysis with the corrected p thresholds. In addition to lowering the threshold, a more conservative analysis might provide additional insight.</p><p>2) This is not a disagreement but rather a different interpretation. It is the adult born cells that show the effects reported (and assuming that the earlier born cells do not). In the passive condition, the result is that new GCs inhibit MCs more at the apical dendrites where primary processing happens. Also, we know that these new cells are relatively specific to the enriched odors (previous work by the first and second to last authors). Is it possible that these new connections serve to help the mice ignore the conditioned stimuli and that the enhanced discrimination ability is a side-effect of this now-active ignorance? On the other hand, in the case of active learning there are more cells born and integrated (perhaps associated with the learned odors). Because these cells survive, one assumes that the inputs from higher order areas are strong. The signal is amplified, so one might expect that the now meaning-based odor perception is accomplished in the AON or PC or both, rather than in the OB.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Mandairon and colleagues examined the effects of passive (odor exposure, habituation) and active (odor reinforced with reward) olfactory learning on granule cell neurogenesis, apical and basal dendritic spines of adult-born granule cells and mitral cell activity and physiology. The authors find/claim that passive learning increased neurogenesis and consequently, increased inhibitory drive onto mitral cells (assessed using ChR2 stimulation of adultborn GCs) and decreased odor-evoked activity of the mitral cells. In contrast, the authors show that active learning produces a decrease in apical dendritic spines without affecting basal spines. Interestingly, the decrease in apical dendritic spine density was reversed with restoration of discrimination levels to baseline over time.

They make various interesting findings. All the reviewers thought that the manuscript has greatly improved, but still raised some relatively minor concerns. We believe these points can be addressed without additional experiments, by revising the manuscript including adding discussions on some caveats or future directions. Please see below the individual points raised by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is a much improved paper that shows a striking difference in inhibition provided by adult-born GCs depending on the type of learning.</p><p>Is it possible that some part of the character of the effect is because of the odor similarity? Might it look different if the odors were easier to discriminate/less overlapping? I suggest the authors qualify the results under the class of fine odor discrimination. A nice follow-up study (not for this paper) would be to compare in each condition (implicit vs explicit), or at least the explicit condition, the effect of discrimination difficulty.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>I recommend the manuscript for publication.</p><p>Please discount the significance of the Daroles et al. study as evidence supporting a role for an increase in spine density in implicit learning. This is because FMRPcKO mice show an elevation in spine density at baseline (Figure 3) and therefore, it is not clear whether the failure to increase spine density further following learning or the elevation prior to learning is the culpable factor. Additionally, FMRP has numerous functions within neurons, that when disrupted, may be responsible for behavioral phenotype in implicit learning.</p><p>The authors acknowledge &quot;However, while these evidences favor a prominent role of adult born neurons in shaping mitral cell activity in learning, the role of pre-existing interneurons in mitral cell response plasticity remains to be investigated&quot;. However, this possibility is absent from discussion. Please address this concern in addition to acknowledging &quot;potential changes in mitral cell properties' also as a potential mechanism.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The major concerns have been addressed appropriately, including a careful point-by-point response to the reviewers' concerns.

This leads to the conclusion that the increased inhibition on M/T cells following implicit learning could be accounted for by an increased number of adult-born cells. This issue is now discussed in the manuscript (Discussion section).</p><p>However, this does not explain how the very same number ChR2 GCs turns out to produce decreased inhibition on M/T cells in animal subjected to explicit learning.

We understand that this study is not designed to examine the mechanisms that connect these changes with behavior, but the reviewers found some of the discussions very loose. We would like the authors to state these links more carefully, so that the manuscript becomes more scholarly. For example, the authors mention &quot;pattern separation&quot; multiple times and discuss that increased or decreased inhibition may be causally related pattern separations, and in turn, increased discriminability. However, whether pattern separation causally underlies increased discrimination or whether changes in inhibitory tones can lead to pattern separations remain totally unknown (also see point #4 by reviewer 3). The present study as well as existing literature does not specify specific mechanisms underlying increased discriminability after implicit or explicit olfactory learning.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this comment, we have focused and rewritten the Discussion section.</p><p>We suggest that differences specifically in apical dendrite synapses onto granule cells create more or less feedback inhibition, which leads to specific changes in M/T responses to a learned odorant. After implicit learning, overall inhibition would be increased, learning to sharper odor representations in the OB. In contrast, after explicit learning, inhibition in response to the conditioned odor would be decreased, leading to stronger odor responses to the conditioned odor.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this manuscript, the authors describe bidirectional changes in the spine density of olfactory bulb adult-born granule cells (aGCs), that depend on learning paradigms which the authors have established previously.</p><p>The used paradigms appear subtle and physiological, since they rely on few odor exposures. Nevertheless, the changes can be observed in electrophysiological recordings in brain slices even though the relation of the investigated mitral cells to odor-activated glomeruli is not known. Thus, the phenomena might reflect a general response of an otherwise deprived olfactory system.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer rightly points out that relation of the mitral cells recorded in the electrophysiological experiments to the odor-activated glomeruli is unknown. However, most odorants are documented to activate a rather large number of glomeruli (from 15 to 35 glomeruli (Vincis et al., 2012). Previous studies in our lab have shown that Limonene (and other odorants) evokes broad activation of the granule cell layer as reported using Zif268 expression (Mandairon et al., 2008; Moreno et al., 2014). Similarly, the pattern of addition of new neurons to the olfactory bulb show some degree of odor/spatial specificity but nevertheless also covers distributed regions of the olfactory bulb (Mandairon et al., 2006, Alonso et al., 2006, Sultan et al., 2010, Moreno et al., 2012). We thus agree that there is indeed a broad effect of the learning paradigms we used on the bulbar network that could be underlined by broadly distributed odor-responding cells. We also acknowledge that olfactory deprivation of laboratory mice may enhance the contrast between the learning condition and controls.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My general criticism is that there are counterintuitive results that would require stronger statistics to be firmly established. Therefore, the authors should increase sample size, try to sample cells more specifically (see below) and thoroughly discuss their results, possibly requiring a longer format.</p></disp-quote><p>As reported above we have substantially increased the number of animals/neurons for most experiments and performed the required better statistical methods (see Table A above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Statistical significance appears to be an issue with some results – would unilateral naris occlusion be feasible, which might allow for pairwise comparisons across hemibulbs? Or a higher number of animals?</p></disp-quote><p>Because of contralateral projections between olfactory bulbs via the anterior olfactory nucleus, and the fact that learning after unilateral occlusion transfers to the other side (Guthrie et al., 1990), we would not be confident that the occluded side of the brain would be a good control.

However, to our knowledge and appreciation, in the available inducible systems, tagging is irreversible and the time window allowing expression of the IEG (several hours) is still too long to enable specific labelling of the cells responding to the odorant stimulation of interest and not to other olfactory cues. Thus, even though these designs have proven highly valuable tools for investigating memory processes, they seem less appropriate for tracking cells responding directly to sensory stimuli in physiological environment (Reijmers et al., 2007, Guenthner, 2013, Denny et al., 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is a substantial amount of eIPSC recordings with high frequency in the 30-60 Hz range in PC condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).

The community as a whole thinks in two ways about the types of learning that occur with passive exposure and conditioning. On the one hand, we all know that these are different types of learning and on the other we often refer to them as if they are the same (under the umbrella term of Learning). Similarly, for learning-based effects on the survival and integration of new granule cells in the OB. This paper shows that the ability to discriminate hard-to-discriminate odors after the two types of learning may depend in opposite fashion on neurogenesis. For passive learning, it appears that adult-born GC connections with MCs are strengthened in the external plexiform layer (at the reciprocal synapse). The authors conclude that this may be related to the effect known as sparsening. For active learning, the effects are opposite. The adult born GC effects on MCs are decreased. The argument is rigorous and rational. My only major concern regards the many pairwise statistical tests (see below). The results reported here, if improved statistical methods confirm them, may constitute one of the most significant findings in the field of olfactory learning as it relates to neurogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for his/her very positive comment on the manuscript. We reply below to his/her specific comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) There are many more implied comparisons than reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. With 4 groups of mice, this makes 6 total comparisons for each factor (cond vs. PC, cond vs. enr, cond vs. non-enr, PC vs enr, PC vs non-enr, enr vs non-enr). With the multiple comparisons within each factor, the threshold for significance should be 0.00833. There is a pretty good argument that all of the factors should be combined in a single analysis, which then multiplies the comparisons and lowers the threshold value, or at least that like-kind factors be grouped (spine density apical/basal as one group, e/sIPSP frequency as another). This would make the p threshold smaller by a factor of 2 at least. Please provide justification in the methods for not performing the multiple comparisons adjustment or do the analysis with the corrected p thresholds. In addition to lowering the threshold, a more conservative analysis might provide additional insight.</p></disp-quote><p>Anova including the 4 groups (Cond, PC, Enr, non-Enr) followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests was performed for analyzing the BrdU, BrdU/Zif268, Tbx21/Zif268.

Also, we know that these new cells are relatively specific to the enriched odors (previous work by the first and second to last authors). Is it possible that these new connections serve to help the mice ignore the conditioned stimuli and that the enhanced discrimination ability is a side-effect of this now-active ignorance? On the other hand, in the case of active learning there are more cells born and integrated (perhaps associated with the learned odors). Because these cells survive, one assumes that the inputs from higher order areas are strong. The signal is amplified, so one might expect that the now meaning-based odor perception is accomplished in the AON or PC or both, rather than in the OB.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank to the referee for his/her stimulating comment. Although the proposed hypothesis cannot be ruled out based on our data, and if we understood well, we could argue that during enrichment, we previously reported that the locus Coeruleus is solicited (Rey et al., 2011, Moreno et al., 2012) suggesting that daily olfactory stimulation triggers arousal, a notion is rather opposite to ignoring stimuli. Now, whether “active” ignorance is a component of arousal remains an open question. Regarding associative learning, we agree that the AON or PC may play an important part in perceiving the meaning odorants. However, the OB is still crucial to implement this amplification as suggested by the present data, and to maintain it since forgetting correlates to the loss of adult-born cells (Sultan et al., 2010, Sultan et al., 2011 and present data).</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Mandairon and colleagues examined the effects of passive (odor exposure, habituation) and active (odor reinforced with reward) olfactory learning on granule cell neurogenesis, apical and basal dendritic spines of adult-born granule cells and mitral cell activity and physiology. The authors find/claim that passive learning increased neurogenesis and consequently, increased inhibitory drive onto mitral cells (assessed using ChR2 stimulation of adultborn GCs) and decreased odor-evoked activity of the mitral cells. In contrast, the authors show that active learning produces a decrease in apical dendritic spines without affecting basal spines. Interestingly, the decrease in apical dendritic spine density was reversed with restoration of discrimination levels to baseline over time. Furthermore, odor-evoked activity in MCs was increased and ChR2 light evoked IPSC frequency of the mitral cells was decreased.</p><p>This is an interesting study that begins to delineate how different kinds of learning affect GC-MC connectivity. Because passive and active learning may affect inputs and outputs of adult born and developmentally generated GCs and mitral cells (along with physiological properties of mitral cells), it is not clear how adultborn GCs are solely driving changes in inhibition onto mitral cells under these different learning conditions.</p><p>For example, does blockade of adult GC neurogenesis under active or passive learning conditions (over the learning period) eliminate the reported effects on mitral cells?</p></disp-quote><p>From our previous work on perceptual learning, we know that blocking neurogenesis abolishes the increase in paired-pulse inhibition of mitral cells and GAD expression in the OB (Moreno et al., 2009). In addition, blocking neurogenesis (Moreno et al., 2009) or structural plasticity in adultborn cell (Daroles et al., 2015) prevents implicit learning. Regarding associative learning, we have shown that blocking neurogenesis during learning altered recall of the discrimination task (5 days post learning, a delay similar to that in the present study). Finally, in the present work, we show that the morphological changes in spine density on granule cells return to pre-learning level after one month, consistent with the loss of the behavioral response. However, while these evidences favor a prominent role of adult born neurons in shaping mitral cell activity in learning, the role of pre-existing interneurons in mitral cell response plasticity remains to be investigated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) It is not clear why Mann-Whitney was used over a one-way ANOVA for comparisons of apical or basal dendritic spine density.</p></disp-quote><p>The statistical analysis was entirely revised.

This leads to the conclusion that the increased inhibition on M/T cells following implicit learning could be accounted for by an increased number of adult-born cells. This issue is now discussed in the manuscript (Discussion section).</p><p>However, this does not explain how the very same number ChR2 GCs turns out to produce decreased inhibition on M/T cells in animal subjected to explicit learning.

This is because FMRPcKO mice show an elevation in spine density at baseline (Figure 3) and therefore, it is not clear whether the failure to increase spine density further following learning or the elevation prior to learning is the culpable factor. Additionally, FMRP has numerous functions within neurons, that when disrupted, may be responsible for behavioral phenotype in implicit learning.</p></disp-quote><p>This part of the sentence has been removed from the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors acknowledge &quot;However, while these evidences favor a prominent role of adult born neurons in shaping mitral cell activity in learning, the role of pre-existing interneurons in mitral cell response plasticity remains to be investigated&quot;.
