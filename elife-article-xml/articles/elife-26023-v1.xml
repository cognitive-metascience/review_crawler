The arrangement of cells within organs endows higher-order functionality through a structure-function relationship, though the organizational properties of these multicellular configurations remain poorly understood. We investigated the topological properties of complex organ architecture by digitally capturing global cellular interactions in the plant embryonic stem (hypocotyl), and analyzing these using quantitative network analysis. This revealed the presence of coherent conduits of reduced path length across epidermal atrichoblast cell files. The preferential movement of small molecules along this cell type was demonstrated using fluorescence transport assays. Both robustness and plasticity in this higher order property of atrichoblast patterning was observed across diverse genetic backgrounds, and the analysis of genetic patterning mutants identified the contribution of gene activity towards their construction. This topological analysis of multicellular structural organization reveals higher order functions for patterning and principles of complex organ construction.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26023.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26023.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26023.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In plants and other multicellular organisms, cells work together in tissues and organs to achieve outcomes that they would not be able to accomplish on their own. For example, the cells that make up the stem of a plant hold the leaves, flowers and other organs in place, and provide a transport network that allows molecules to move around the plant. Mapping the locations of cells within tissues and analysing the connections between them will help researchers to understand how the organisation of tissues influences the tasks cells perform.</p><p>There are several different layers of tissue within a plant’s stem. The surface of the stem has a protective layer of tissue called epidermis. The epidermis contains two different types of cells known as trichoblasts and atrichoblasts, but it was not clear why these cells are organised the way they are.</p><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> is a small plant that is often used in studies of how plants grow and develop. Jackson et al. combined microscopy with computational techniques to study the stems of young <italic>A. thaliana</italic> seedlings. The experiments reveal that the two types of epidermal cells appear to adopt distinct roles. The trichoblasts form hair-like structures and acquire nutrients from the external environment, while their neighbours the atrichoblasts provide shortcut routes for these nutrients to be unloaded and moved up the stem. This pattern was not present in several other plant species including foxglove or poppy, suggesting it may be an adaptation in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants that helps them grow in the particular environments this plant faces.</p><p>The findings of Jackson et al. show that cells are carefully arranged in plant stems and suggest that there is an optimal way for a plant to make a stem depending on its environment. Further work is now needed to understand how different molecules use the shortcuts provided by the atrichoblasts during plant development, and whether alternative configurations are possible. In the future, such studies may help provide a framework to genetically engineer plants that are better adapted to grow in different environments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26023.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26023.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>network</kwd><kwd>multicellular complexity</kwd><kwd>organ design</kwd><kwd>poppy</kwd><kwd>foxglove</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/J017604/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stamm</surname><given-names>Petra</given-names></name><name><surname>Bassel</surname><given-names>George W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000275</institution-id><institution>Leverhulme Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RPG-2016-049</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bassel</surname><given-names>George W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/L010232/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bassel</surname><given-names>George W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/N009754/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Hao</given-names></name><name><surname>Bassel</surname><given-names>George W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M01116X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jackson</surname><given-names>Matthew DB</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The use of network science to quantify the properties of global cellular organization in the plant hypocotyl identifies higher-order properties and plasticity in epidermal cell patterning.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multicellularity arose multiple times across evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaiser, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Knoll, 2011</xref>), yet how selective pressures shaped and optimized the cellular configurations of these complex assemblies remains poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ollé-Vila et al., 2016</xref>). Multicellular organs are more than the sum of their cells, and the collective interactions between cells on a global scale confer higher order functionality to the system through a structure-function relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thompson, 1942</xref>). Cellular functionality therefore emerges from cellular associations and synergies, and is not cell autonomous. Understanding the emergent properties of complex multicellular assemblies, and the structure-function relationship between cell organization and organ function, remains an open challenge in both developmental and systems biology.</p><p>This question has been examined previously in the field of neuroscience in the investigation of the relationship between cellular organization and nervous system function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cajal, 1911</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">White et al., 1986</xref>). This was first systematically applied to the simple nervous system of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">White et al., 1986</xref>), and more recently the field of ‘connectomics’ has extended this approach to more complex nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</xref>). Here a distinction between structural and functional networks is drawn, the former being the physical associations between cells representing all possible routes of information flow, and the latter the paths which information is observed to follow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Uncovering the organizational properties of complex multicellular assemblies has not been performed previously at a whole organ or organism level. In plants, cells are glued together through shared cell walls and do not migrate with respect to one another, as in animal systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Green, 1969</xref>). This invariance between adjacent cells provides a simplified opportunity to examine multicellular complexity by looking at whole organ cellular interaction networks that remain topologically invariant following their formation. By viewing plant organs as a complex system of interacting cells, a systems-based approach to understanding organ construction and optimization at a cellular level can be undertaken.</p><p>Cellular interactions play a key role during plant development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benitez-Alfonso et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lucas and Lee, 2004</xref>). Mobile information in the form of proteins, RNAs and small molecules move locally through physical cell-to-cell interactions. These local interactions mediate patterning, self-organization and underlie cell identity in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leyser, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sabatini et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sena et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sugimoto et al., 2010</xref>). Genetically encoded patterning mechanisms mediate the self-organization process that leads to the creation of functional cellular interactions and patterns that constitute plant organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Besson and Dumais, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Di Laurenzio et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yoshida et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>While the importance of intercellular interactions is well established, much less is known about the global properties of these assemblies, and how they come together to form coherent organs. Previous efforts to understand local interactions between cells in two-dimensional cellular sheets have been explored using the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disk. Here a network consisting of nodes representing cell-cell junctions was generated, and cell shape based on polygon classes (or local connectivity) was generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gibson et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heller et al., 2016</xref>). In plants, local cellular interactions and their role in mediating cell division plane placement in neighbors has also been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gibson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sahlin and Jönsson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Willis et al., 2016</xref>). While these approaches are informative, they are limited to the local topological analysis within the immediate vicinity of a cell, and are also restricted to cells on the surface of organs.</p><p>Advances in whole organ 3D imaging at cellular resolution and computational image analysis enable organ-wide cellular interaction networks to be extracted and annotated by cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">de Reuille et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Montenegro-Johnson et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This multidimensional topological phenotyping pipeline captures global cellular interactions in whole organs and enables the simultaneous analysis of both higher-order and local properties of these complex cellular configurations. These structural networks provide cellular roadmaps of possible information flux through organs, and understanding the structure of these cellular communities provides insight into the function of the system as a whole, and individual cells within organs.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26023.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Computational workflow.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pipeline for imaging, annotating, quantitatively analyzing, and visualizing global cellular interaction networks.

To achieve robust topological analyses of cellular patterning in plant organs, we sought to generate fully represented and accurate cellular interaction networks. Every cell within the unexpanded embryonic hypocotyl was digitally captured using whole mount high resolution confocal microscopy and 3D segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">de Reuille et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Montenegro-Johnson et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Cell types within these samples were identified and annotated using 3DCellAtlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Montenegro-Johnson et al., 2015</xref>). Cellular connectivity networks were extracted by identifying shared surfaces between adjacent cells using 3D cellular meshes, representing intercellular associations. Organ-wide cellular connectivity networks that are annotated by cell type were generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Towards the achievement of accurate cellular interactomes, segments representing air spaces between cells were computationally removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Montenegro-Johnson et al., 2015</xref>). Relatively small interfaces (below 2 μm<sup>2</sup>) were filtered out due to their likely limited role in transport processes, and potential generation due to image processing artefacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bassel, 2015</xref>). Cells in the periphery of imaged organs were included in analyses, but only cells from the central regions of organs were reported in figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This provided a topological buffer to the boundaries introduced following image acquisition. Collectively, these processes yielded precise global cellular interaction networks annotated by cell type, enabling cell type specific topological analyses of organ patterning to be performed.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-26023-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26023.006</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Hypocotyl cell connectivity network of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Col.</title><p>Cell types are gradually removed to allow internal visualisation of the network.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26023.006">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26023.006</ext-link></p></caption></media></p><p>A persistent issue with analyses using biological network datasets is their completeness and accuracy.

Considering the importance of intercellular interactions within plant organ function, these networks may be viewed as a complex system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Newman, 2010</xref>). The spatial constraints of plant cells and their embedding in space mean these networks resemble 3D lattices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barthelemy, 2011</xref>). The properties of these undirected cell interaction networks can therefore be analyzed using quantitative network analyses to reveal the organizational properties of these multicellular assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barabási, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</xref>). Following topological analyses, node data can be visualized by importing cell properties back into MorphoGraphX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">de Reuille et al., 2015</xref>) as a heatmap for in situ 3D visualization within the cellular context of the segmented organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Finally, statistical analyses of data exported from network analysis software can be performed using standard statistical software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hagberg et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>This approach enables the capture, discretization and quantification of local and global cellular organization, or patterning, in whole organs.</p><p>A simple measure of the local properties of a cell (node) within an organ (network) is to count the number of neighbours it has (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This is termed the degree of a node, and is a local measure of how a cell fits within its immediate context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Newman, 2010</xref>).

A well-established measure of path length in networks is betweenness centrality (BC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barabási, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Freeman, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Newman, 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

This enables the integration of these two pieces of information by weighting edges in the network with the geometric size of their associated cellular interfaces. In this case, weighted node betweenness centrality was calculated using the reciprocal of the connecting cell wall area (edge weight), so that large cell-cell interactions generate small weights, which contributes more to the creation of short paths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Newman, 2010</xref>). The topological analysis of weighted hypocotyl networks generated a bias based on cell size whereby weighted BC identified large cortical cells as having the lowest path length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The superior size of cortical cells in the hypocotyl endow these cells with a geometrically facilitated reduction in path length in these weighted networks. Information flow which is limited by the size of cellular interfaces may therefore prefer to move through this cell type, however considering the scale of cellular interface sizes included in networks which is in the order of microns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), this does not likely represent a limiting factor in this context.</p><p>Increased surface area has biological relevance to mediating intercellular trafficking through molecular transport components, which occupy physical space.

Epidermal cells in the hypocotyl typically do not produce root hairs, despite having each trichoblast and atrichoblast cell identities. The observation of the passage of fluorescein along the hypocotyl occurs following molecular uptake in roots, where hairs are produced, and represents long distance transport along the length of the plant rather than local uptake.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26023.012</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Transport of the small fluorescent molecule fluorescein in the hypocotyl epidermis of different <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ecotypes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of the cells having reduced path length in the hypocotyls of Landsberg <italic>erecta</italic> (L<italic>er</italic>), Colombia (Col) and Cape Verdi Islands (Cvi) ecotypes indicated in green.

Considering plants do not produce fluorescein, no specific transporter for this molecule is likely to be present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barclay et al., 1982</xref>).

The reduced path length in the atrichoblast cells of L<italic>er</italic> and Col predict the preferential movement of small molecules through this epidermal cell type, while in Cvi where path length is equivalent between both epidermal cell types, no bias in molecular movement is observed. This suggests that BC can be used to predict the long range movement of molecules in this multicellular plant organ at single cell resolution. The construction of these conduits through the emergent property of global patterning therefore plays a functional role in optimized molecular transport across this organ. In the absence of active transport processes, molecules will preferentially move following these paths of reduced path length. Components participating in the active transport of molecules may also exploit these optimized routes by populating these cells with transport machinery.</p><p>This higher order property of multicellular organization may also have a functional role within the context of epidermal cell patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dolan et al., 1993</xref>). The acquisition of nutrients in the soil by root hairs (trichoblasts) is dependent upon the ability to import these into cells. The accumulation of imported solutes within a root hair would impede this process owing to increased concentration within a cell as compared with that in the soil. A solution to this could be to acquire nutrients in root hairs and to move these into the adjacent non-hair atrichoblast cell which enables the hair cell to acquire further solutes. The atrichoblast is in turn topologically poised to facilitate the optimized longitudinal movement of these nutrients along the root and up through the hypocotyl. This provides a functional division of labour in the two epidermal cell types, and may bridge the structure-function relationship in epidermal cell patterning owing to the global topological properties of this system.</p><p>Collectively, this experiment connects the topological analysis of global cellular connectivity using BC to molecular transport processes across the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> hypocotyl.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Comparison of topological features of diverse plant species</title><p>Plasticity in differential path length between epidermal cell types observed across <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ecotypes suggests this system is not an intrinsic property of all hypocotyls.

The number of local connections in each trichoblast and atrichoblast cells did not show any significant differences between this mutant and wild type, with trichoblast cells being more highly connected. The difference in path length between the two epidermal cell types is however lost in the <italic>cdka1;1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), while a significant reduction in endodermal path length is also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This demonstrates that <italic>MP</italic>-mediated patterning acts to generate longer paths in the hypocotyl epidermis during embryogenesis, but is not required for the path length asymmetry between the two constituent cell types. The consequences of lacking a vascular system in this mutant can be observed through the visualization of the spatial distribution of edge betweenness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Here a radial route of short path length interfaces between cells is observed through the center of this cellular assembly, a property qualitatively absent in other hypocotyl cellular interfaces.</p><p>The topological analysis of the <italic>laterne</italic> mutant revealed no significant difference in degree across all cell types, with the exception of the endodermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The control of path length in the hypocotyl is therefore largely independent of each cell size and the number of neighbours it has, and represents a property emerging from the global context within which a cell is situated in an organ.

In all instances <italic>monopteros</italic> samples showed a broad distribution of degree and BC values, highlighting the topologically unique nature of this mutant and a lack of robustness in its global pattern formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26023.027</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Cell type-specific topological principles of hypocotyl multicellular architecture.</title><p>(<bold>A–E</bold>) Scatterplots of mean degree and median betweenness centrality in (<bold>A</bold>) trichoblasts, (<bold>B</bold>) atrichoblasts, (<bold>C</bold>), the outer cortex, (<bold>D</bold>) the inner cortex and (<bold>E</bold>) the endodermis for each sample used in this study.

To address this we performed pairwise statistical tests for each degree and BC distribution, respectively, for all cell types to determine whether their topological properties were significantly similar or not. The test statistic obtained by comparing two distributions (chi-squared value for the discrete variable degree, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test value for the continuous variable betweenness centrality) was used as a measure of the distance between the distributions. These distances were used to generate a distance matrix, enabling their clustering.</p><p>Significant relationships between degree distributions were calculated and were placed into three clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Each wild-type atrichoblast and trichoblast cells clustered independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). All other cell types were present in the third group, with the exception of the poppy endodermis. This revealed that each epidermal cell type has a distinct local connectivity, while all other internal cell types share similar properties in this regard. Degree alone may therefore distinguish different epidermal cell types, and cells internal to the epidermis.</p><p>The clustering of significant similarities between BC distributions enabled the relationships between the higher-order properties of diverse cell types across genetic backgrounds to be established. Three clusters were selected to categorize these pairwise similarities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). All wild-type trichoblasts, with exception of poppy, cluster together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). This is likely a consequence of the stringent regulation of path length we previously identified to be present within this cell type, and increased path length within the poppy epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Conversely, atrichoblasts have greater plasticity in their path length across genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) and are more broadly distributed across the clustering diagram. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Cvi and Foxglove atrichoblasts remained in the trichoblast cluster as these do not show a significant path length differential between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4E</xref>). These relationships between epidermal cell path lengths reflect the previously observed higher-order properties of this cell type.</p><p>All wild-type outer cortical cells clustered together along with <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> endodermal cells, which have similar path lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>), supporting earlier conclusions relating to the topological relationship between these two cell types. Inner cortical cells also clustered together highlighting their topological uniqueness within the hypocotyl.</p><p>Collectively these results suggest that each epidermal cell type is topologically distinct from all other cell types, as is the inner cortex. The outer cortex and endodermis share global organizational similarities. These observations reveal general principles of multicellular architectural design within the wild-type plant hypocotyl. It is through these higher-order path length principles that the movement of molecules occurs, bridging a structure-function relationship between cellular patterning and the molecular processes which unfold within complex plant organs. Understanding these principles and the ability to calculate them at single cell resolution enables the mathematical prediction of intercellular and optimized molecular flux and intercellular communication which underlies plant growth and development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Extensive research into cellular patterning has been undertaken previously in diverse biological systems. In both plants and animals, rules governing the placement of cell division planes in a default state have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Besson and Dumais, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hofmeister, 1867</xref>) and are sufficient to explain pattern formation in contexts including the shoot apical meristem of plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sahlin and Jönsson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shapiro et al., 2015</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gibson et al., 2011</xref>). Deviations from this default rule have been considered to be actively regulated cell divisions that lead to the generation of novel patterns. In the context of plant embryo development, this has been reported to be mediated by the hormone auxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yoshida et al., 2014</xref>) and downstream factors controlling auxin-mediated patterning have been described to be involved in diverse aspects of this formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schlereth et al., 2010</xref>). In addition to genetically controlled events, a role for mechanical feedbacks in the control of cellular patterning have also been reported in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamant et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Louveaux et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>While the mechanisms underlying the creation of cellular patterns have been studied widely, bridging their structure-function relationship, and understanding of the functional role of these patterns in organ biology remains less clear. The network-based analysis of cellular patterning can bridge this gap by enabling cellular patterning to be captured and quantified. This approach was originally applied in the field of neuroscience where global neuronal connectivity was mapped in the worm <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">White et al., 1986</xref>). This approach has since been employed to more complex nervous systems in the growing field of connectomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</xref>). Methodological imaging and computational advances are now leading to the generation of cellular resolution connectomes in complex brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Economo et al., 2016</xref>), though that of <italic>C. elegans</italic> remains the only complete connectome to date.</p><p>The immobility of cells within plant organs simplifies the topological analysis of multicellular arrangements as cellular associations are maintained throughout development. The application of this approach to other biological systems where cell migration occurs is also possible, and would involve the analysis of 3D cellular interaction dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heller et al., 2016</xref>). The transient nature of edges in these systems will dynamically alter the topology of these cellular interaction networks. Analytical frameworks to analyze temporal network datasets such as these have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holme and Saramäki, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The analysis of animal epithelium development has also been studied using a network-based topological approach. Local epithelium cellular connectivity was sufficient to distinguish different species and organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Escudero et al., 2011</xref>). A separate study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs revealed cell degree to be tightly regulated during the development of this tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gibson et al., 2006</xref>). These same authors then extended this approach to identify a bias in the placement of the cleavage plane following the degree of adjacent cells during pattern formation, a phenomenon also present in the shoot apex of plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gibson et al., 2011</xref>). In each of these studies, local connectivity was examined, with the global higher-order principles of organ design remaining unexplored.</p><p>By viewing organs as a complex system of interacting cells, this study applied a systems-based approach to understand the quantitative principles of multicellularity and uncover their higher order properties. The capture and analysis of organism-wide cellular connectivity enabled both the local and global topological features of complex organism design to be investigated, revealing how multicellular assemblies operate as an integrated system and their emergent properties.</p><p>The application of cell-type specific topological analysis using BC identified the presence of a previously undescribed optimized transportation route in the atrichoblast epidermal cell files of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> hypocotyl in the Col and L<italic>er</italic> ecotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This cell type is uniquely poised to regulate information flow along the hypocotyl by lying on shorter paths, despite having fewer local neighbours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>). This property was not present in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Cvi, nor in other species studied including poppy and foxglove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This previously undescribed higher order property of epidermal patterning is therefore plastic across diverse genetic backgrounds.</p><p>The functional significance of these reduced path lengths was demonstrated by tracking the movement of the fluorescent small molecule fluorescein through <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). BC predicted the bulk flow of these small molecules through diverse epidermis topologies at single cell resolution. These patterns therefore provide optimized routes for molecular trafficking through organs, though they are not obligatory for organ function in light of the plastic nature of their presence. The reduction of epidermal path length may support rapid plant growth, or represent a recent evolutionary innovation of higher-order multicellular optimization that has not yet been widely adopted across diverse genetic backgrounds.</p><p>The topological analysis of patterning mutant hypocotyls revealed the quantitative contribution of genetically-encoded factors towards the creation of higher-order features at cell type-specific resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The construction of reduced atrichoblast path length was established to be mediated by the patterning activity of the <italic>CDKA1;1</italic> gene, and overall epidermal path length is limited by <italic>MONOPTEROS</italic> and promoted in <italic>laterne</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F</xref>). This approach provides a step change beyond qualitative descriptions of altered local cellular organization, and enables quantitative links between the molecular and cellular scales of complexity to be bridged.</p><p>The genetic contribution towards the regulation of consistent global path length in the hypocotyl epidermis also revealed an additional link between the activity of patterning genes and control over robustness in the generation of higher order path length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This provided novel insight into the role of <italic>MONOPTEROS</italic> in the control of topological robustness in cellular patterning during embryogenesis. These observations further demonstrated that while epidermal path length is plastic between genetic backgrounds, it is not variable across individuals.</p><p>The structural networks generated in this study may be considered the roadmaps upon which molecular events occur within the hypocotyl. The annotation of these structural templates with additional molecular information will lead to the creation of functional networks, which will provide multidimensional insight into the molecular complexity which unfolds in the context of multicellular organ development.</p><p>Uncovering the organizing principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sena and Birnbaum, 2010</xref>) of multicellular assemblies in extant organs provides insight into the cellular configurations which are each selected for in wild-type plants, and which are possible in the case of patterning mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avena-Koenigsberger et al., 2015</xref>). These cellular interaction networks result from pattern formation, and represent the topological output of the self-organizing processes which underlie plant organ formation.</p><p>Uncovering nature’s multicellular structural design principles and the functions they encode will provide fundamental insight into the evolutionary forces driving increased complexity and optimization following the transition to multicellularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ollé-Vila et al., 2016</xref>). This enhanced understanding of these properties establishes a framework for the rational re-design of multicellular configurations and organ functionality.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant growth conditions</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis</italic> wild-type plants of ecotypes Colombia, Cape Verdi Islands (Cvi) and Landsberg <italic>erecta</italic> (L<italic>er</italic>) and associated mutants <italic>laterne</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Treml et al., 2005</xref>), <italic>monopteros</italic> (<italic>mp</italic> B4149) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schlereth et al., 2010</xref>) and <italic>cdka1;1</italic> (ProCDKA;1::CDKA;1-T14D;Y15E) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dissmeyer et al., 2009</xref>) were grown in environmentally controlled cabinets using 16 hr light (light intensity 150–175 μmol m<sup>2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> at 23°C and 8 hr dark at 18°C).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Christian Hardtke (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work Jackson et al. provide a general framework to study cellular networks in plant tissues. They show that different cell types have different network properties in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and that this holds, to some extent, across different <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ecotypes and (to a lesser extent) between species. These results present an interesting methodological advance, and the potential to uncover previously unseen patterns, if a number or technical and presentation issues are addressed.</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>1) <italic>eLife</italic> papers describing new techniques or analysis approaches like this one should be accessible and interesting to a wide audience. Several reviewers felt that the authors did not yet make a persuasive case that they are discovering general principles here, and for this work to be useful for the developmental biology community, the connection between the detailed measurements and biological problems must be made very clearly. This &quot;Major issues&quot; section enumerates what they considered to be necessary changes to be made in the revision:</p><p>A) The connection between what is measurable and what can be interpreted as the biological significance of the measurement needs to be done with some care. For example, the authors interpret BC as meaning that &quot;atrichoblast cell files are topologically poised to mediate the optimized movement of information&quot; and &quot;having the capacity to control information movement through a limited number of local interacting partners&quot;. This is a leap. For example, BC may highlight nodes that form the sole pathway between two otherwise disconnected parts of the network. In that case the argument that BC signifies the potential to control flow (of information, or anything else) is justified. However, BC can be high in many other contexts. In the cellular contact network in particular there will be many ways that information can pass between cells, as this network resembles a lattice. A high BC node therefore could lie on a slightly shorter path, but there will be many other paths, perhaps even of similar length. The equivalence between high BC and a capacity to control is therefore much less obvious. The authors should put less emphasis on this interpretation of BC. They may still have a point here, but at present the manuscript is overstating the connection between BC and control. This is linked to a general feeling that the equivalence of cellular networks and networks of directed information flow (based on the evidence presented in this paper), is overstated.</p><p>B) Several reviewers felt there was not a clear path between the technique described here and genuine insight into developmental biology. The clearest way to show that this technique can lead to new biological insights is to provide such an insight. This may be achieved by revisiting old experiments in the literature that had some contradictory or hard to understand elements and showing how the approach presented in this paper can explain the discrepancy/discordance in the data. Alternatively, an observation made here should be predictive of a behavior; for example, the authors describe a difference in connectivity between atrichoblasts or trichoblasts: what would you predict are different properties of a hormone or Ca or physical signal sent through one or the other of these cell types? And how would you confirm this experimentally?</p><p>C) The rationale explaining how the authors picked the different plant species and the different mutants are not crystal clear. For the flow of the ideas and the understanding of the reader, it would be nice to include two paragraphs explaining the general concept and why the authors chose these plant species (first paragraph) and mutants (second paragraph).</p><p>D) There needs to be a more coherent section at the end summarizing precisely what principles hold across ecotypes, species, and mutants (backed up by statistical significance measures). A more rigorous set of conclusions of this kind would provide an adequate justification for the rather strong and general claims made in the abstract. The question that needs to be clearly answered in this summary is: What can network measures predict about plant cells?</p><p>E) There are some technical issues in the way data are presented or interpreted. For example, weighted BC (subsection “Topological analysis of the wild-type Colombia <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> hypocotyl”, tenth paragraph). Generalisations of BC to weighted networks are not entirely straightforward, as there is more than one way to interpret path length in weighted networks. One way for example is to use the reciprocal of the weight as the contribution that a link makes to the overall path length. The authors should clarify what version of weighted BC they are using. It seems that the inverse of the connecting cell wall area was used as the weight itself, but weighted path length calculations often use the reciprocal of the weight, which means that there might be a double reciprocal here? In any case the definition of the weight and the exact algorithm should be made explicit.</p><p>2) In general, arguments throughout the manuscript rely a lot on visual comparisons of distributions, which are not always convincing. There are plenty of rigorous statistical tools for comparing two distributions, which would return a measure of significance for the difference between the distributions. Calculating such significance values for all the relevant comparisons of distributions in the paper would make the authors' arguments much stronger (providing the statistics support their claims). In addition, since you are able to study many different parameters extracted from the plant tissues (e.g. cell characteristics, node characteristics and edge characteristics, the statistical relationships (correlation or else) between these values need to be provided; overall and within the different cell types. Certain parameters are likely to be trivially linked, but this may report important aspects of the cellular networks organizations that are currently ignored in this version of the manuscript. In particular, which are the local (cell parameters) that influence BC-is a cell able to control in some ways its own BC?</p><p>3) The Discussion is focused narrowly, and mostly on the authors own work. The Discussion would be more valuable if it were expanded to consider: a) other plant tissues and other work in the field of plant tissue patterning, b) animal cell organization (embryo patterning in <italic>C. elegans, D. melanogaster</italic>, Neurons…) where cell migration is operating and how the authors see cell networks in this dynamical context.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Topological analysis of multicellular complexity in the plant hypocotyl&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated. Improvements on the clarity of the writing, statistical measurements and inclusion of functional data on atrichoblast vs. trichoblast files have made this version much stronger.</p><p>We intend to recommend this manuscript be accepted, but a few changes to the explanation of the fluorescein experiment (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) would be helpful. The names of atrichoblast and trichoblast cell files (while not incorrect) are somewhat confusing because these files, in the hypocotyl, do not produce hairs. Experiments involving uptake of substances from the media will immediately make people think about hair and non-hair cells of the root, and it is natural to begin to think that. Rewording or putting in an additional sentence to explain that the difference in movement in the cells you are monitoring is <italic>not</italic> due to morphological differences in these cells themselves (and that they are some distance from the site of uptake) would eliminate this confusion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26023.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Major issues:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) eLife papers describing new techniques or analysis approaches like this one should be accessible and interesting to a wide audience. Several reviewers felt that the authors did not yet make a persuasive case that they are discovering general principles here, and for this work to be useful for the developmental biology community, the connection between the detailed measurements and biological problems must be made very clearly. This &quot;Major issues&quot; section enumerates what they considered to be necessary changes to be made in the revision:</italic> </p><p><italic>A) The connection between what is measurable and what can be interpreted as the biological significance of the measurement needs to be done with some care. For example, the authors interpret BC as meaning that &quot;atrichoblast cell files are topologically poised to mediate the optimized movement of information&quot; and &quot;having the capacity to control information movement through a limited number of local interacting partners&quot;. This is a leap. For example, BC may highlight nodes that form the sole pathway between two otherwise disconnected parts of the network. In that case the argument that BC signifies the potential to control flow (of information, or anything else) is justified. However, BC can be high in many other contexts. In the cellular contact network in particular there will be many ways that information can pass between cells, as this network resembles a lattice. A high BC node therefore could lie on a slightly shorter path, but there will be many other paths, perhaps even of similar length. The equivalence between high BC and a capacity to control is therefore much less obvious. The authors should put less emphasis on this interpretation of BC. They may still have a point here, but at present the manuscript is overstating the connection between BC and control. This is linked to a general feeling that the equivalence of cellular networks and networks of directed information flow (based on the evidence presented in this paper), is overstated.</italic> </p><p>This point is well taken considering the lattice-like structure of these spatially embedded networks. While experimental evidence demonstrating the preferential directional movement of small molecules along shorter paths within the hypocotyl epidermis has been provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the nature of these optimized paths in the control of this movement is less clear. Throughout the text we have de-emphasized the role of BC in controlling molecular movement across these networks to address this comment.</p><p><italic>B) Several reviewers felt there was not a clear path between the technique described here and genuine insight into developmental biology. The clearest way to show that this technique can lead to new biological insights is to provide such an insight. This may be achieved by revisiting old experiments in the literature that had some contradictory or hard to understand elements and showing how the approach presented in this paper can explain the discrepancy/discordance in the data. Alternatively, an observation made here should be predictive of a behavior; for example, the authors describe a difference in connectivity between atrichoblasts or trichoblasts: what would you predict are different properties of a hormone or Ca or physical signal sent through one or the other of these cell types? And how would you confirm this experimentally?</italic> </p><p>To more clearly link the topological analysis of global cellular connectivity and insight into developmental processes within the plant hypocotyl, we have performed two major changes to the manuscript.</p><p>The first is modifications to the figures and text to principally focus upon the analysis of the higher-order properties of epidermal cell patterning. The targeted analysis of this subset of cells within the hypocotyl describes the emergence of reduced path length specifically within the atrichoblast cell type in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and plasticity in the emergence of this property across different genetic backgrounds. This provides a clear message as to how a higher order principle of global cellular configurations can emerge in different genetic contexts.</p><p>The second major modification to the manuscript is the functional exploration of these contrasting path lengths within different epidermal cell types. A series of experiments examining the movement of fluorescent molecules across <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> hypocotyls was performed. Seedlings from the 3 ecotypes topologically analysed in this work were transferred to media containing the small fluorescent molecule fluorescein. Following an incubation period, the seedlings were imaged using confocal microscopy to quantify the abundance of fluorescein within the different cell types of the epidermis using quantitative 3D image analysis. In each Col and L<italic>er</italic>, where atrichoblasts lie upon shorter paths, fluorescein was significantly more concentrated in the non-hair cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). In Cvi where no difference in path length between epidermal cells is observed, fluorescein did not show a significant difference in its abundance between epidermal cells. Reduced path lengths can therefore provide optimized conduits for the movement of molecules across <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> hypocotyls. The topological proxy of BC can predict this long-range movement at single cell resolution in these complex organs.</p><p>We proposed this higher-order property of epidermal cell organization may bridge a structure-function relationship within epidermal cell patterning (subsection “Quantification of cell type-specific molecular movement through <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> hypocotyls”, fourth paragraph). The presence of a division of labour between nutrient-acquiring root hair cells and their adjacent non-hair cells may be present, such that newly acquired molecules are transferred from trichoblast to atrichoblast cells. By moving solutes out of root hairs, these cells can maintain low intracellular concentrations facilitating further nutrient uptake from the soil. Their adjacent atrichoblast cells receive these molecules, and are topologically optimized for long-range longitudinal movement up the plant axis. This organizational configuration between these two cell types provides a mechanism for the optimized uptake and transport from the root up through the hypocotyl. Plasticity in the presence of this property suggests this feature may play an adaptive role in certain contexts but not others, and is discussed further below.</p><p><italic>C) The rationale explaining how the authors picked the different plant species and the different mutants are not crystal clear. For the flow of the ideas and the understanding of the reader, it would be nice to include two paragraphs explaining the general concept and why the authors chose these plant species (first paragraph) and mutants (second paragraph).</italic> </p><p>We have added paragraphs describing the rationale for the selection of the species in this study in the subsection “Comparison of topological features of diverse plant species” and the selection of mutants in the second paragraph of the subsection “Topological analysis of cellular patterning mutants”.</p><p><italic>D) There needs to be a more coherent section at the end summarizing precisely what principles hold across ecotypes, species, and mutants (backed up by statistical significance measures). A more rigorous set of conclusions of this kind would provide an adequate justification for the rather strong and general claims made in the abstract. The question that needs to be clearly answered in this summary is: What can network measures predict about plant cells?</italic> </p><p>The question – “What can network measures predict about plant cells?” – is addressed in newly added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and 8. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> we demonstrate that path length, as determined using BC, can predict the movement of molecules across the hypocotyl epidermis at single cell resolution. This ability to understand intercellular communication on an organ level provides a developmentally relevant context for the topological measures used. The presence of plasticity in atrichoblast path length and the genetic factors that contribute towards the formation of this emergent property provide further insight into this important feature.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> explores the topological principles across genotypes, species and mutants used in this study, describing the overarching principles of hypocotyl design at cell type-specific resolution. This revealed that the topological properties of each epidermal cell type are distinct from all other cell types, while the outer cortical cells share the greatest similarity with the endodermis. Unexpectedly, the inner cortex is topologically distinct from all other cell types. These principles hold true for all wild-type genotypes with the exception of poppy, which has a distinct cellular topology from other samples examined. This basal eudicot is the most evolutionarily ancient species examined and also has the longest path lengths of all in this study. The emergence of shorter paths in the hypocotyl may therefore represent a novel evolutionary innovation (subsection “Comparison of topological features of diverse plant species”, last paragraph). The developmental significance of this higher-order property is highlighted by the demonstration that molecules and information preferentially follow these conduits altering the chemical composition and events, which occur across organs.</p><p><italic>E) There are some technical issues in the way data are presented or interpreted. For example, weighted BC (subsection “Topological analysis of the wild-type Colombia Arabidopsis hypocotyl”, tenth paragraph). Generalisations of BC to weighted networks are not entirely straightforward, as there is more than one way to interpret path length in weighted networks. One way for example is to use the reciprocal of the weight as the contribution that a link makes to the overall path length. The authors should clarify what version of weighted BC they are using. It seems that the inverse of the connecting cell wall area was used as the weight itself, but weighted path length calculations often use the reciprocal of the weight, which means that there might be a double reciprocal here? In any case the definition of the weight and the exact algorithm should be made explicit.</italic> </p><p>The double reciprocal was not used, and this has been clarified in the main text as: “In this case, weighted betweenness centrality was calculated using the reciprocal of the connecting cell wall area (edge weight), so that large cell-cell interactions generate small weights, and lead to the calculation of shorter paths (Newman, 2010).”</p><p><italic>2) In general, arguments throughout the manuscript rely a lot on visual comparisons of distributions, which are not always convincing. There are plenty of rigorous statistical tools for comparing two distributions, which would return a measure of significance for the difference between the distributions. Calculating such significance values for all the relevant comparisons of distributions in the paper would make the authors' arguments much stronger (providing the statistics support their claims). In addition, since you are able to study many different parameters extracted from the plant tissues (e.g. cell characteristics, node characteristics and edge characteristics, the statistical relationships (correlation or else) between these values need to be provided; overall and within the different cell types. Certain parameters are likely to be trivially linked, but this may report important aspects of the cellular networks organizations that are currently ignored in this version of the manuscript. In particular, which are the local (cell parameters) that influence BC-is a cell able to control in some ways its own BC?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion to perform statistical tests on all data presented as this has increased the strength with which statements have been made in this work, and clarified their interpretation.</p><p>For all distributions presented in both main and supplemental figures, we performed Kolmogorov–Smirnov significance tests. This establishes whether two distributions are significantly different from one another, and an asterisk is added in each figure to indicate where significant differences are present. Changes in the text throughout the manuscript accompany these significant tests.</p><p>The question – “which are the local (cell parameters) that influence BC-is a cell able to control in some ways its own BC?” – is explored through the addition of a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Here, mutual information using Shannon entropy enables the extent to which one variable is related to another (subsection “The relationship between geometric, local and global topological features of cells and cell networks”). This analysis demonstrated that the size of a cell has little to no bearing as to the length of the path that it lies upon. Similarly, the immediate number of neighbours of a cell and its path length are only weakly associated. Path length is therefore a property emerging from the global context within which a cell is situated in an organ, and is not associated with either cell geometry or local topology.</p><p><italic>3) The Discussion is focused narrowly, and mostly on the authors own work. The Discussion would be more valuable if it were expanded to consider: a) other plant tissues and other work in the field of plant tissue patterning, b) animal cell organization (embryo patterning in C. elegans, D. melanogaster, Neurons…) where cell migration is operating and how the authors see cell networks in this dynamical context.</italic> </p><p>A much broader discussion covering the topics suggested and others, in addition to a wide range of new references, has been added to the start of the Discussion section. This text describes broad aspects of cellular patterning research across both plant and animal systems. Included is also a discussion of dynamic cellular topologies observed in animal systems and a proposed mathematical framework to study these.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>We intend to recommend this manuscript be accepted, but a few changes to the explanation of the fluorescein experiment (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) would be helpful. The names of atrichoblast and trichoblast cell files (while not incorrect) are somewhat confusing because these files, in the hypocotyl, do not produce hairs. Experiments involving uptake of substances from the media will immediately make people think about hair and non-hair cells of the root, and it is natural to begin to think that. Rewording or putting in an additional sentence to explain that the difference in movement in the cells you are monitoring is not due to morphological differences in these cells themselves (and that they are some distance from the site of uptake) would eliminate this confusion.</italic> </p><p>To address your suggestion, we have added a couple of lines of explanatory text in relation to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> to help clarify the interpretation of these experimental data and the role of epidermal cell types in the hypocotyl: “Epidermal cells in the hypocotyl typically do not produce root hairs, despite having each trichoblast and atrichoblast cell identities. The observation of the passage of fluorescein along the hypocotyl occurs following molecular uptake in roots, where hairs are produced, and represents long distance transport along the length of the plant rather than local uptake.” We hope this clarifies any confusion on the part of the reader, and are happy to modify accordingly if not.</p></body></sub-article></article>
