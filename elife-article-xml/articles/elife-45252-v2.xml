The current paradigm focuses on APCs acquiring immunostimulatory material from phagocytosis of extracellular microbes or through the recognition of microbial molecules by surface receptors on the plasma membrane. However, there is evidence that this model is incomplete. It assumes that APCs only acquire intracellular pathogens during intermittent times when the microbes are extracellular. But immune cells can also acquire infectious material and antigen directly from infected cells through a few different pathways.</p><p>Here, we focus on a process where APCs directly acquire infectious material and generic cytosolic proteins from the cytosol of infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Steele et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Perez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cambier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Utter et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ramirez and Sigal, 2002</xref>). This occurs with a wide range of microbes and several lines of evidence suggest that cell-cell transfer of bacteria plays a critical role in pathogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup>1–3</sup>. But the underlying mechanism of bacterial transfer is unclear. Without understanding the mechanism, it is difficult to manipulate this bacterial transfer process to directly assess its role during infections.</p><p>We previously found that macrophages acquire microbes and cytosolic content from neighbouring cells and the acquired bacteria exploit this process to sustain infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Steele et al., 2016</xref>). Several possibilities for how the bacteria move between cells have been proposed. Here, we sought to identify how cell-cell transfer occurs. We found that macrophages phagocytose a small portion of a neighbouring cell. Importantly, only a piece of the initially infected cell is engulfed and the donor cell survives after a small portion is phagocytosed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Steele et al., 2016</xref>). To differentiate this process from phagocytosis of the entire infected cell, we propose the term merocytophagy (Greek for partial cell eating). After merocytophagy, the bacteria and cytosolic material acquired from the donor cell enter a unique, double-membraned endosome that is composed in part by the donor plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Macrophages phagocytose portions of infected cells to acquire both bacteria and cytosolic material</title><p>We previously found that bacterial transfer from infected to uninfected BMDMs requires cell-cell contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Steele et al., 2016</xref>).

Due to the similarities in the vacuole maturation kinetics between extracellular uptake and bacterial transfer, we hypothesized that the T6SS was also required for escape from the recipient cell endosomes after bacterial transfer. To test this hypothesis, we needed a strain that was fully functional in the initially infected cells, but was unable to escape the endosome in the recipient BMDM. To accomplish this goal, we put one of the T6SS structural protein genes (FTL_0119) under anhydrous tetracycline (ATc) induction in a FTL_0119 deletion background.

If more bacteria within the same FCV increased phagosomal escape, the percentage of cells with multi-bacterial FCVs should decrease over time. Instead, we found that the percent of LAMP-1<sup>+</sup> vesicles containing multiple bacteria was consistent across the time points that we examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These data indicate that having multiple bacteria in a vacuole does not substantially alter escape kinetics. It also suggests that vacuoles with several bacteria are not intrinsically different from vacuoles with a single bacterium.</p><p>For these assays, we used the live vaccine strain of <italic>F. tularensis</italic>. However, we observed identical structures following cell-cell transfer of the highly virulent Schu S4 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, these results are broadly applicable to virulent <italic>F. tularensis.</italic></p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Transferred bacteria are enclosed in a multi-membranous structure</title><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, the donor cell plasma membrane is enclosed inside of the plasma membrane of the recipient BMDM. This result suggests that vacuoles formed through phagocytosis of intact cells should have two membranes. We hypothesized that the transferred material would be inside of a structure that resembles an autophagosome, but is made from membranes of two different cells. The plasma membrane of the recipient cell should enclose the structure, just like a typical phagosome. Inside of that should be a portion of the donor cell plasma membrane that was pinched off during transfer. The transferred cytosolic content would be at the core of this structure.</p><p>We first tested if bacteria were enclosed in vacuoles containing plasma membrane from the donor cell. To do this, we biotinylated the proteins on the plasma membrane of donor, infected cells. We then synchronized bacterial transfer to uninfected BMDMs and purified the recipient BMDMs. We permeabilized the cell and stained with streptavidin, which will bind to biotinylated proteins that were on the infected donor cell plasma membrane prior to cell-cell transfer. This procedure allows us to track what happens to the donor cell plasma membrane following cell-cell transfer. We found that structures with multiple <italic>F. tularensis</italic> bacteria were within a vacuole that is at least partially derived from the plasma membrane of the originally infected donor cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>, donor cell example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>If phagocytosis of the donor cell occurs, then there should be at least two membranes surrounding the transferred bacteria. To test this, we purified recipient cells using the synchronized transfer assay described <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and examined them by TEM. Since wildtype bacteria will escape the FCV, we primarily used the T6SS inducible strain for our TEM studies. <italic>F. tularensis</italic> bacteria are the dark, electron dense structures with a small electron translucent clearing around them.</p><p>The inducible T6SS strain was only found inside of multi-membraned structures in all of the infected recipients that we identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). Similar to our confocal analysis, multiple bacteria were within the same vacuole and recipient BMDMs often contained several distinct vacuoles with bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Notably, we were able to find wildtype bacteria in similar, multi-membranous structures at 40 min post-transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). As expected, only a subset of wildtype bacteria were found inside of vacuoles due to phagosomal escape. From these results, we conclude that the FCV is a double-membraned structure composed of membrane from two different cells.</p><p>The morphology of these FCVs is unusual. The T6SS inducible bacteria were found within complex, membranous structures that most closely resemble residual bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Novikoff and Shin, 1978</xref>). Residual bodies are the undigested remnants of phagosolysosomes or autophagolysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Duve and Wattiaux, 1966</xref>). Since the mutant cannot escape, the vacuole likely matures down the normal degradative pathway. In comparison, TEM of wildtype <italic>F. tularensis</italic> indicate that the bacteria are in a more electron dense, less membranous compartment. This is likely due to modifications of the vacuole by the T6SS, which is essential for <italic>F. tularensis</italic> to escape the vacuole.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Cell-Cell contact is required for FCVs containing multiple bacteria to form</title><p>A possible alternative explanation for the formation of FCVs containing multiple bacteria is phagocytosis of extracellular vesicles that contain several bacteria. In theory, this structure would also form a double membraned compartment after phagocytosis that could enclose several bacteria. To assess the likelihood that extracellular vesicles explain our phenotype rather than contact dependent cell-cell transfer, we analyzed how many cells had FCVs containing several bacteria when the infected and uninfected populations were physically separated.</p><p>We only observed FCVs containing several bacteria under conditions where cell-cell contact was possible (assay from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). When infected and uninfected BMDMs were physically separated by 2–3 millimetres using a Transwell membrane, very few recipient BMDMs became infected and we did not find a single recipient cell with multiple bacteria in the same LAMP-1<sup>+</sup> vacuole in any of the experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). In this setup, bacteria and extracellular vesicles can pass through the membrane, but whole cells from the different populations could not touch. In contrast, uninfected cells that were able to physically touch infected cells had readily observable multi-bacterial FCVs. Thus, cell-cell transfer needs to occur for recipient cells to acquire multiple bacteria within the same FCV.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>FCVs containing multiple bacteria occur in a mouse infection model</title><p>To test if multi-bacterial FCVs form <italic>in vivo</italic>, we intranasally inoculated mice with the inducible T6SS strain.

As a control for our studies, we assessed the impact of the T6SS in <italic>F. tularensis</italic> following phagosomal escape. We found that that the T6SS had a negligible effect on intracellular growth as long as the bacteria escape the initial phagosome.

The assumption at the time was that the bacteria had re-entered autophagic vacuoles following replication in the cytosol. But more recent reports indicate that <italic>F. tularensis</italic> is very rarely targeted by autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Steele et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Case et al., 2014</xref>). Instead, our data suggests that at least a subset of these structures may have resulted from cell-cell bacterial transfer.</p><p>Similar structures have also been observed with other intracellular pathogens. When <italic>Listeria monocytogenese</italic> is propelled by actin into neighbouring cells, the bacteria are enclosed in a double membrane structure through a process termed paracytophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Robbins et al., 1999</xref>). One of the membranes is derived from the donor plasma membrane, and one is from the recipient. A key feature of paracytophagy is that it is a bacteria driven phenomenon. <italic>F. tularensis</italic> does not co-localize with actin or have homologs to known actin manipulating proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Steele et al., 2016</xref>). Instead, bacterial transfer of <italic>F. tularensis</italic> is host mediated and phagocyte specific, unlike paracytophagy which results from the activity of bacterial effector proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Steele et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Robbins et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, the underlying transfer mechanism is different between the two processes, but the resulting structure is similar.</p><p>In our previous report, we found that bacterial transfer strongly correlated with a phenomenon termed trogocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Steele et al., 2016</xref>). Trogocytosis is the transfer of plasma membrane proteins between cells in a way that the proteins remain functional in the recipient cell. Recent work suggests that trogocytosis strongly correlates with bacterial transfer but is not causative (data not shown). Part of the impetus for these experiments was to identify distinctive features that are specific to cell-cell transfer of bacteria. Trogocytosis was observed in some of our assays, but not explicitly tested or quantified. Based on our results, bacteria within multi-bacterial, double membrane endosomes directly indicate that bacterial transfer occurred.</p><p>Immune mediated phagocytosis of intracellular pathogens appears to be a widespread phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Steele et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Perez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cambier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Utter et al., 2017</xref>). This study suggests that bacterial transfer occurs when immune cells phagocytose a portion of intact cells. We propose the term merocytophagy to describe host-mediated phagocytosis of small portions of live cells without killing the donor cell. The resulting vacuole from merocytophagy is made from at least two membranes with one of the membranes originating from the donor cell plasma membrane. The resulting structure appears to be a degradative vacuole due to LAMP-1 association and that the vacuoles mature into a residual body when the bacteria are unable to escape. <italic>F. tularensis</italic> enters the merocytophagy pathway following bacterial transfer, but is able to escape with bacterial effectors secreted through the T6SS.</p><p>Our proposed term of merocytophagy designates that the acquired cellular material is in a degradative pathway. This distinguishes it from trogocytosis, which appears to be a plasma membrane-centric event. Some models of trogocytosis suggest the material is ingested, similar to merocytophagy, but the donor cell plasma membrane is then returned to and incorporated into the recipient cell plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dopfer et al., 2011</xref>). In this scenario, trogocytosis likely leads to the exocytosis of at least some of the material acquired from the cytosol of other cells. We speculate that the strong correlation between bacterial transfer and trogocytosis that we previously observed is because these processes initially acquire material from neighbouring cells using the same machinery. After acquisition, the material may be sorted and sent into different pathways, with trogocytosis being analogous to endocytic recycling and merocytophagy functioning similarly to endocytic degradation.</p><p>We focused on a bacterium that escapes the phagosome in this study, but pathogens that modify the vacuole may have a very different host-pathogen response. The double membrane in particular may pose problems for bacteria that modify and reside in vacuoles. Our studies point to this process being host mediated, so there must be a benefit to the immune response. Future studies are needed to resolve how the host benefits from this process.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>EEA-1 (goat monoclonal)</td><td>Santa Cruz Biosciences</td><td>clone N19, catalog number sc-6415</td><td>1:50 dilution, permeabilized in 0.1% saponin, 2% FBS in humidifier at 37 degrees Celcius for 30 minutes. <break/>Cells cannot be fixed for longer than <break/>7 minutes prior to staining.</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>LAMP-1 (rat monoclonal)</td><td valign="bottom">Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank</td><td>Clone 1D4B</td><td>1:500 dilution after <break/>stock mixed with 50% <break/>glycerol, permeabilized in <break/>0.1% saponin, 2% FBS in humidifier at 37 degrees Celcius for 30 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-rat secondary (goat <break/>monoclonal)</td><td>ThermoFisher Scientific</td><td>catalog number 26-4826-82</td><td>1:500 dilution in0.1% saponin, 2% FBS in humidifier at 37 degrees Celcius</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-goat secondary (donkey monoclonal)</td><td>ThermoFisher Scientific</td><td>catalog number PA1-28662</td><td>1:500 dilution in 0.1% saponin, 2% FBS in humidifier at 37 degrees Celcius</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (Mus musculus, female)</td><td>6–10 week old female C57Bl/6J</td><td>Jackson Labs</td><td>catalog number 000664</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Francisella tularensis,</italic> Live Vaccine Strain)</td><td><italic>F. tularensis</italic> or LVS</td><td>CDC</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Francisella tularensis,</italic> Schu S4)</td><td><italic>F. tularensis</italic> Schu S4</td><td>BEI Resources</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Francisella tularensis,</italic> inducibleT6SS mutant)</td><td>T6SS mutant</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td><italic>F. tularensis</italic> strain with an in-frame, <break/>markerless deletion of FTL_0119 (<italic>dotU</italic>) that is complemented with a pEDL17 plasmid containing <italic>dotU</italic> under the tetracycline inducible promoter and GFP on a constitutive promoter</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Francisella tularensis,</italic> Empty Vector Control)</td><td>WT</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td>wildtype LVS that is <break/>complemented with a pEDL17 plasmid containing a kanamycin resistance cassette under the tetracycline inducible promoter and GFP on a constitutive promoter</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Francisella</italic> <break/> <italic>tularensis,</italic> Empty <break/>Vector in Δ<italic>dotU)</italic></td><td>Δ<italic>dotU</italic></td><td>this paper</td><td/><td>A FTL_0119 deletion in LVS that is complemented with a pEDL17 plasmid containing a kanamycin resistance cassette under the tetracycline inducible promoter and GFP on a constitutive promoter</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>anhydrous tetracycline</td><td>Cayman Chemicals</td><td>catalog number100009542</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies and critical reagents</title><p>The EEA-1 antibody (N-19, sc-6415) and LAMP-1 antibody (1D4B) were acquired from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Dallas, Texas) and the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hughes and August, 1981</xref>) respectively.

ATc was removed prior to inoculation of host cells unless otherwise indicated. <italic>pEDL17-GFP empty vector had a slight but consistent delay in phagosomal escape compared to the pkk214-GFP plasmid used in most of our studies</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantification of bacteria after Cell-Cell transfer</title><p>BMDMs were synchronously infected with either infected BMDMs in the presence of gentamicin or extracellular bacteria. Extracellular bacteria were added at a multiplicity of infection of 5. This MOI was chosen because the donor BMDMs averaged five bacteria per cell based on bacterial colony forming units at 20 hr post inoculation and the initial number of BMDMs seeded.</p><p>After a 30 min incubation, the slide with infected cells in the cell-cell transfer sample was returned to its original well and 10 ug/ml of gentamicin in fresh media was added to all samples. At 2 hr after the start of transfer, the cells were scraped from the plate, lysed by vortexing, serially diluted and quantified.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Transfer of donor plasma membrane</title><p>BMDMs were infected for 19 hr with GFP-expressing <italic>F. tularensis</italic>. 10 ug/ml gentamicin added 2 hr post inoculation. The infected cells were labelled with biotin using an EZ-link sulfo-NHS- biotin labelling kit following the manufacturer’s protocol (ThermoFisher Scientific). The cells were washed with complete media and incubated for 30 min after biotin labelling. A coverslip with uninfected, unlabelled cells were placed onto the infected cells for 1 hr. The cells were then lifted off, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS followed by 50 mM ammonium chloride, stained with wheat germ agglutinin (cat# W32466 ThermoFisher Scientific) and imaged by confocal microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Microscopy</title><p>Microscopy results were acquired using a Leica DM4000 upright fluorescence microscope. For a bacterium or bacterial cluster to be counted as within an EEA-1 or LAMP-1 positive vacuole, the fluorescent marker had to completely surround the bacteria, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>. Bacteria that co-localized with these markers but where the markers did not form a coherent vacuole were not counted as being within a vacuole.</p><p>Occasionally, BMDMs will have bacteria in multiple vacuoles or some in vacuoles and some not within a vacuole. For these cells, if any of the bacteria were contained in a LAMP-1 or EEA-1 positive vacuole, they were counted as having bacteria inside of a vacuole. Likewise, for determining the percentage of cells with multiple bacteria within individual LAMP-1 positive vacuole, any cell with multiple bacteria in the same vacuole was counted, even if bacteria were not in a vacuole elsewhere in the cell.</p><p>Representative confocal images were acquired using a Leica SP-8 microscope and the same samples were used for representative images and data analysis where applicable.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Mouse cell to cell transfer analysis</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with avertin and intranasally inoculated with 10,000 colony forming units of the inducible T6SS strain. The bacteria were grown in chamberlains defined media containing 250 ng/ml ATc overnight and 250 ng/ml of ATc was added to the PBS containing bacteria that the mice were inoculated with.</p><p>At 24 hr post inoculation, the lungs were harvested. Single cell suspensions were made by finely chopping the lung with scissors and incubating the lung pieces in five units per ml of dispase (Stem Cell Technologies, Cambridge Massachusetts) for 30 min at room temperature. The lung homogenate was put through a 40 μm cell strainer to isolate individual cells. The sample was centrifuged at 250x g for 5 min and the supernatant was removed. RPMI with 10% FBS and supplemented with non-essential amino acids, Glutamax, and sodium pyruvate was added to the cells for the remainder of the incubation.</p><p>The lung cell samples were placed onto chamber slides and incubated at 37° for 1 hr to allow cells to adhere. The sample was then washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The samples were then stained for LAMP-1.</p><p>All animals were handled according to approved institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) protocol #4946 at Washington State University.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Transmission Electron Microscopy</title><p>BMDMs were inoculated with wildtype bacteria or Δ<italic>dotU</italic> ATc inducible <italic>dotU</italic> strain. 10 μg/ml of gentamicin was added to the BMDMs at 2 hr post inoculation. The cells were then incubated for a total of 20 hr. At 20 hr post inoculation, BMDMs seeded on a Nunc Thermomax plastic coverslip (ThermoFisher Scientific) were inverted onto the infected cells for synchronized transfer. The cells were incubated with recipient cells for 1 hr, purified and fixed for 1 hr with 2% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2).</p><p>The BMDMs were microwave fixed using a Pelco Biowave Pro 36500 Laboratory Microwave System for 1 min at 350 Watts with a temperature restriction set to 38°C. The cells were rinsed 0.1M Cacodylate buffer 2X, 10 min each and 1X in distilled water for 10 min. The cells were incubated in 2% OsO<sub>4</sub> and 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> in 0.05M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2). They were rinsed 3X in distilled water, 10 min each and dehydrated in progressive graded ethanol series (10 min each step). The ethanol was replaced with acetone and the cells were infiltrated in 1:1 acetone and Spurr’s resin overnight on a rotator. The acetone was evaporated over 6 hr. Fresh 100% resin was added and left to infiltrate overnight on a rotator, this step was repeated two more times. The cells were embedded and cured for 24 hr at 70°C.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article Francisella tularensis enters a double membraned endosome following cell-cell transfer&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Alain Charbit.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In the present study, you characterize in greater details the mechanism of trogocytosis that you reported previously where Francisella disseminates from macrophage to macrophage through exchange of cytosolic and membrane contents of infected cells with their non-infected neighbours. In this follow-up article, you describe that the recipient macrophages phagocytose parts of infected macrophages, through a process that you name &quot;merocytophagy&quot;, leading to the formation of a double membrane phagosome in recipient cells. Maturation of the Francisella containing phagosome is very similar after merocytophagy or phagocytosis of extracellular bacteria, and F. tularensis escapes from this membrane-bound compartment to reach the cytosol using its Type 6 Secretion System.</p><p>The reviewers all agreed that the findings are interesting and important for the researchers working on intracellular bacteria. However they request to see a few more experimental additions to your work and stylistic changes before it can be accepted for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The in vivo part of the work needs to be strengthened to prove the relevance of the phenomenon. Please provide additional images to Figure 6B and a quantification of such events vs. phagocytosis of extracellular Francisella.</p><p>2) Provide transmission electron micrograph images of wild-type (in addition to the already reported ones for inducible T6SS bacteria in Figure 5C-D) bacteria inside double membrane structures in purified recipient cells. Whereas the reviewers appreciated the elegant trick provided by the inducible T6SS, it would be worrisome if such events could not be captured for wild-type bacteria.</p><p>3) Improve clarity of the manuscript with an emphasis on how the experiments were carried out as opposed to focus solely on conclusions. For example, how were the recipient cells distinguished by EM? The paragraphs 'Multi-bacterial FCVs require Cell-Cell Contact&quot; and &quot;Transferred bacteria are enclosed in a double membrane structure containing membrane from the donor cells&quot; are confusing and should be rewritten. Moreover, it would be helpful if the authors could provide information in the text as to what allows them to identify the object being engulfed as a bacterium. Also, the authors should comment on the fact that the engulfed object appears fragmented in some sections.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45252.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The in vivo part of the work needs to be strengthened to prove the relevance of the phenomenon.

Instead, we estimated the minimum rate of merocytophagy to be about 20% based on the transfer of large clusters of bacteria that remain in the same vacuole. This estimate does not include merocytophagy of individual bacteria or cells where the LAMP-1 staining was not definitive. We anticipate that more accurate estimates will emerge as tools to study merocytophagy improve. This addition is in the subsection “FCVs containing multiple bacteria occur in a mouse infection model”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Provide transmission electron micrograph images of wild-type (in addition to the already reported ones for inducible T6SS bacteria in Figure 5C-D) bacteria inside double membrane structures in purified recipient cells. Whereas the reviewers appreciated the elegant trick provided by the inducible T6SS, it would be worrisome if such events could not be captured for wild-type bacteria.</p></disp-quote><p>We added transmission electron micrographs of wildtype bacteria inside of spacious, double-membraned vacuoles. We added images of the wildtype bacteria in vacuoles 40 minutes after transfer to both Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 5. The transferred cytosolic content of the vacuoles appears slightly different between the different strains. This is likely due to wildtype modifying the phagosome which is discussed in the last paragraph of the subsection “Transferred bacteria are enclosed in a multi-membranous structure”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Improve clarity of the manuscript with an emphasis on how the experiments were carried out as opposed to focus solely on conclusions.

The paragraphs 'Multi-bacterial FCVs require Cell-Cell Contact&quot; and &quot;Transferred bacteria are enclosed in a double membrane structure containing membrane from the donor cells&quot; are confusing and should be rewritten.

Also, the authors should comment on the fact that the engulfed object appears fragmented in some sections.</p></disp-quote><p>We made the requested editorial changes. We added a diagram (Figure 1F) to graphically explain the transfer assay and recipient cell purification used for the vast majority of our experiments. The two unclear paragraphs were rewritten for clarity (subsection “Transferred bacteria are enclosed in a multi-membranous structure” and subsection “Cell-Cell Contact is required for FCVs containing multiple bacteria to form”) and our interpretation of the TEM images showing bacterial transfer in the act has been added to the last paragraph of the subsection “Macrophages phagocytose portions of infected cells to acquire both bacteria and cytosolic material”. Our guideline for identifying bacteria are in the third paragraph of the subsection “Transferred bacteria are enclosed in a multi-membranous structure”. The title was changed as requested. The section describing how the type VI secretion system results fit into the field was re-written in the second paragraph of the Discussion. The specific coloring and orientation of images was also changed to fit the reviewers’ requests (Figure 1A and Figure 5B).</p></body></sub-article></article>
