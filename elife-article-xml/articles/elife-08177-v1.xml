The inner hair cells (IHCs) are the primary sensory receptors adapted for rapid auditory signalling, but they are not thought to be intrinsically tuned to encode particular sound frequencies. Here I found that under experimental conditions mimicking those <italic>in vivo</italic>, mammalian IHCs are intrinsically specialized. Low frequency gerbil IHCs (~0.3 kHz) have significantly more depolarised resting membrane potentials, faster kinetics and shorter membrane time constants than high-frequency cells (~30 kHz). The faster kinetics of low-frequency IHCs allow them to follow the phasic component of sound (frequency-following), which is not required for high-frequency cells that are instead optimally configured to encode sustained, graded responses (intensity-following). The intrinsic membrane filtering of IHCs ensures accurate encoding of the phasic or sustained components of the cell's <italic>in vivo</italic> receptor potential, crucial for sound localisation and ultimately survival.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><back><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interest</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: Animals were killed by cervical dislocation, under schedule 1 in accordance with UK Home Office regulations.
