tools in the investigation of the structure of supramolecular assemblies such as viruses. Here, we report on a new methodology which combines Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) with machine learning algorithms to image and classify the structure of large populations of biopharmaceutical viruses with high resolution. The method offers information on virus morphology that can ultimately be linked with functional performance. We demonstrate the approach on viruses produced for oncolytic viriotherapy (Newcastle Disease Virus) and vaccine development (Influenza). This unique tool enables the rapid assessment of the quality of viral production with high throughput obviating the need for traditional batch testing methods which are complex and time consuming. We show that our method also works on non-purified samples from pooled harvest fluids directly from the production line.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40183.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Viruses are like the Trojan horses of the biological world; they sneak their genetic code into a living cell and then hijack it, forcing that cell to produce their own viral proteins. Yet, if scientists replace the harmful genes in a virus with other genes, the virus can be transformed into a powerful tool for biology and medical science. For example, viruses can be turned into vaccines that prime the immune system to ward off future infections. Viruses could also be made to deliver the genetic code needed to repair faulty cells, and thus treat the cause of an illness from inside the body. Nevertheless, it is complicated to produce viruses like these on a large scale.</p><p>The individual viruses in one batch can be very different shapes and sizes; they can also end up displaying different proteins on their outer surface – which is the part of the virus that our immune system will see first. To optimise the production of standardised viruses, scientists need a way to test the viruses throughout the manufacture process. At the moment, the best way to do this would be with electron microscopes. Yet these microscopes cannot tell exactly which proteins are in the outer surface of the virus. Also, these methods often need purified samples of virus, so cannot be used to look at the viruses until the final stage of production.</p><p>Laine et al. now report a method that can test virus production at every step of the process. This new method uses a different type of microscopy called super-resolution imaging, which is quicker than electron microscopy and more able to deal with impurities, but can still see objects that are 500 times smaller than the width of a human hair. First, Laine et al. took pictures of many viruses with this new imaging technique, sorted the images into groups based on their appearance, and then trained computer algorithms with the pre-sorted groups (a technique called “supervised learning”). Next, the trained algorithms were shown new images of viruses and asked to classify them. The algorithms could separate images of a mixed population of viruses into six groups according to their shape and size, and then analyse each group in a specific way. For example, they would measure and report the length of filament-shaped viruses, the radius of spherical viruses and the length and width of rod-shaped viruses.</p><p>The first set of test images were of Newcastle Disease Virus, which is currently under development as a treatment for cancer. But further testing revealed that the algorithm also works for the influenza virus, which is used to make flu vaccines. The algorithm could classify the viruses in pure and impure samples, and the imaging technique could handle over 200 viruses each second.</p><p>This approach of combining super-resolution imaging with artificial intelligence could help scientists to understand what makes good vaccines and how best to optimise the production of viruses for medical purposes. It could also allow researchers to respond more rapidly to outbreaks of viral infections. The next step is to build this work into a system that can be used by the pharmaceutical industry.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Newcastle disease

to unravel details of the structure and replication of viruses was recognised early on in the development of the methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Betzig et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Müller and Heilemann, 2013</xref>). Since then, SRM has been used to provide unprecedented insights into viral protein architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Laine et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gray et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albecka et al., 2016</xref>). Previous work has focused on those SRM techniques that achieve the highest theoretical resolution, such as Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hell and Wichmann, 1994</xref>) and Single Molecule Localisation Microscopy (SMLM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rust et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Heilemann et al., 2008</xref>). Whilst offering high fidelity data, the downside is the associated long acquisition time required by these methods, limiting their application to the imaging of static samples at low throughput. A much faster technique, although inferior in spatial resolution, is Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gustafsson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heintzmann and Cremer, 1999</xref>) and this has been applied to study large viruses such as the prototypic poxvirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gray et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Horsington et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to understanding the structure of viruses, there is also a need to identify and analyse classes of structures within large viral populations, especially in the biotechnology industry where virus quality is often compromised by large scale production operations and the virus product is often characterised by significant morphological heterogeneities. In particular, campaigns of influenza immunization rely heavily on the timely and efficient production of specific virus strains. Similarly, a deeper understanding of the structural heterogeneity of oncolytic viruses such as Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ganar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lichty et al., 2014</xref>) would enable optimization of the production processes and in turn improve the development of viriotherapy. However, quantifying and understanding this structural heterogeneity and relating it to virus efficacy requires the imaging of large numbers of viruses at sufficient spatial resolution to reveal characteristic morphological details. Typically, this is achieved by extracting batches from the production process, with elaborate subsequent purification and preparation steps before characterisation by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gad, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Goldsmith and Miller, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brenner and Horne, 1959</xref>). Although TEM can achieve relatively high imaging throughput if the highest resolution is not necessary, its contrast remains unspecific and therefore does not typically permit discerning the presence of particular proteins in the virus envelope. Also, the typical signal-to-noise ratios achieved by TEM are not sufficient to permit automated, robust and efficient downstream analysis of structural features at the single particle level. It is therefore challenging for TEM to be of practical use during production operations.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that rapid high resolution imaging with Total Internal Reflection SIM fluorescence microscopy (TIRF-SIM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Young et al., 2016</xref>), combined with a machine learning (ML) approach to analyse and classify structures in virus batches offer a great opportunity to circumvent these problems. We present MiLeSIM (Machine Learning Structured Illumination Microscopy) as an efficient combination of SRM, ML-based classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Van Valen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sommer et al., 2011</xref>) and advanced image analysis for the quantification of morphological heterogeneities in large virus populations. We use ML algorithms to perform a classification of super-resolved images of a heterogeneous virus population into particle classes with distinct and characteristic structural features (e.g. spherical, filamentous). The classified subpopulations are then further analysed through image analysis pipelines that are specifically adapted for each structural class. We and others have shown that appropriate model fitting can lead to precision in structural parameters beyond the resolution of the images used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Laine et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Manetsberger et al., 2015</xref>). The method combines speed and specificity and allows an in-depth exploration of large virus populations that is unachievable by TEM. The method has potentials in the industrial production of viruses, for example for oncolytic viriotherapy and vaccine development.</p><p>First, we compare TIRF-SIM with alternative imaging modalities and show that it is the method of choice to investigate virus structure at high-throughput (~220 virus particles/s, see Supplementary Note 1) with a spatial resolution reaching ~90 nm. The large datasets obtained with TIRF-SIM are then fed into an ML algorithm for the automated classification of Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) and live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) vaccines, enabling further shape-specific quantitative analyses for a structural description of viral subpopulations. The purpose of our study is to validate the MiLeSIM approach as a powerful analysis tool for biotechnological processes involving virus production both in industry and in the research laboratory.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TIRF-SIM offers an optimal combination of throughput and resolution for the imaging of virus structure</title><p>First, we explored and compared three common SRM modalities for the structural investigation of purified NDV virus, namely direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, <italic>d</italic>STORM, stimulated emission depletion microscopy, STED and TIRF-SIM. NDV viruses were labelled for the envelope glycoprotein Hemagglutinin-Neuraminidase (HN) and imaged with all three SRM imaging techniques (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Labelling for HN allows us to directly and specifically observe the shape of the virus particles. For comparison, a conventional (non-super-resolved) TIRF wide-field image is also shown. Typical shapes observed with TIRF-SIM are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>. TIRF-SIM provides clear structural details to discern filamentous, spherical and rod-like structures in large NDV populations. A comparison of performance parameters (resolution and imaging speed) for the different methods is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1(a)</xref>. It is clear that improving resolution beyond the ~90 nm offered by TIRF-SIM (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1(b)</xref>) comes at a significant cost in acquisition times and throughput. Furthermore, although <italic>d</italic>STORM and STED offer theoretically higher resolution than SIM, the images obtained with these methods do not reveal additional structural details that are not also resolved by TIRF-SIM images. This indicates that the ~2 fold resolution improvement provided by TIRF-SIM is sufficient for the structural study presented here.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40183.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Super-resolution microscopy (SRM) for the study of NDV virus structure.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Representative images of purified NDV viruses with different imaging modalities.

We used a supervised ML algorithm (here a random forest algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breiman, 2001</xref>)) to ensure the robustness of the method and for ease of implementation. We identified six major structural classes in the NDV samples which we divide into long and short filamentous, small and large spherical, rod-like and unknown structures. The unknown class is made of clumps of viral material with no consistent and identifiable shapes. A control sample that was prepared identically to the other samples except without virus particles present allowed us to identify that non-specific bindings of antibodies appear as rare, dim and small point-like structures that could easily be discriminated and excluded from further analysis.</p><p>The filamentous (long and short) class is further analysed by automatic extraction of the linear backbone of structures and measurement of their length. The width of these filamentous structures appeared to be limited by the resolution of the imaging technique (~90 nm for TIRF-SIM, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, but also observed in higher resolution approaches such as <italic>d</italic>STORM) and therefore, we considered the filamentous class as 1D structures.

For the features from AlexNet and SURF a feature selection approach was designed based on maximising the standard deviation across the different structural classes. This approach constitutes a more rational choice compared to simple principal component analysis (PCA), which does not typically take the information regarding the classes into account, therefore our method selects for predictors that have high potential for class discrimination.

However, our high-throughput approach reveals subtle differences in the distribution of small spherical structures where the A/South Dakota viruses appear more heterogeneous (standard deviation ~10 nm), whereas the A/Bolivia viruses are sharply distributed (standard deviation ~4 nm).</p><p>We also investigated the potential of directly imaging pool harvested fluid (PHF). LAIV are commonly propagated in embryonated hens’ eggs where progeny viruses are released into the allantoic fluid of the egg. This fluid is harvested from numerous eggs and pooled. This constitutes a very basic and commonly used virus material. It is easy to produce and does not undergo any downstream purification. Consequently, PHF is impure, containing a variety of egg-derived impurities. The high molecular specificity of fluorescence microscopy allowed us to visualize the structure of the viruses with the same image quality directly in PHF despite the presence of a large amount of impurities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1(a)</xref>). The structural analysis of the B-Victoria strains from MVB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and PHF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1(b)</xref>) allows us to decipher the effect of purifications steps on the structural properties of the population. The fraction of unknown structures dropped from 23% to 8% between MVB and PHF respectively. This change in fraction of unknown structure may be a result of the different densities of viruses on the cover slip. We observed a lower density of virus particles in the PHF preparations, which may lead to fewer aggregated classes and therefore fewer unidentifiable structures. In addition, whereas the PHF shows a nearly equal amount of small and large spherical structures, the MVB preparation is missing a large population of small spherical compared to the PHF. This is also reflected by the larger average diameters observed in the MVB compared to the PHF (<italic>D<sub>SS</sub></italic> = 191 ± 12 nm and 198 ± 14 nm and <italic>D<sub>LS</sub></italic> = 241 ± 56 nm and 275 ± 49 nm for PHF and MVB respectively).</p><p>MiLeSIM therefore enables the study of unpurified samples and allows probing the virus production at any intermediate levels of production and purification. This constitutes a strong advantage over EMtechniques which require the use of highly purified samples and elaborate preparation protocols.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have demonstrated the potential of high-throughput imaging of virus structures, taking advantage of the optimal combination of speed and resolution afforded by the TIRF-SIM imaging method. TIRF-SIM provided sufficient resolution to identify, discriminate and analyse individual viral structural classes with high specificity, even in non-purified samples. Our approach combines machine learning to classify NDV viruses, followed by a model-based or direct quantification of virus structural parameters. The method yielded similar results both in purified samples and in samples from unfiltered PHF offering promise for use as an assay during virus production. We were able to image up to ~220 particles/second at 90 nm resolution, vastly increasing imaging throughput compared to alternative super-resolution methods, improving sensitivity and specificity in comparison to EM. Furthermore EM does not feature the specificity to analyse virus samples in their aqueous, unaltered unpurified forms. We were able to observe large structural variabilities in the NDV population and also between different strains of LAIV.</p><p>Our particular classification uses random forest with a selection of predictors from simple shape parameters, rotational and translational invariant image moments and features from AlexNet and common feature for image recognition such as SURF. The model accuracy is ~88.4% and the mis-classifications occur between classes that are similar (between small spherical and small filamentous for instance). The structural parameters that we extract from the model fitting are precise beyond the image resolution as they take into account the finite optical resolution. This therefore reveals subtle differences in populations such as the two sub-classes observed in the rod-shaped class. This approach will be beneficial especially when heterogeneous populations are present and need to be quantified. In future, such information can be correlated with functional characteristics of produced virus classes and production parameters can accordingly be optimised. The approach thus holds great promise for the production of virus-based therapeutics. We note, however, that the methods presented are generally applicable to other systems and they are not restricted to a particular type of fluorescence microscopy, SRM or not.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sample preparation</title><p>The purified NDV samples were prepared on cover slips as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Laine et al., 2015</xref>).

Hu’s image moments were computed from the 71 × 71 pixels particle image centred on the centre of mass of the particle. The absolute values of the logarithm of the moments were used in the classification. For the features obtained from AlexNet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krizhevsky et al., 2012</xref>), the individual 71 × 71 pixels images were resized to 227 × 227 pixels and used as all three color layers of the RGB images taken by AlexNet. Then, feature extraction was performed using AlexNet as a pre-trained network. 4096 features were obtained and data reduction was performed to limit the number of predictors used. For this, the features were averaged within each individual class and the standard deviation of every feature across the classes was computed. The six features with the highest standard deviation was selected. For the SURF features, first a bag of visual words was created from the training dataset, this bag was then used to check the presence of visual words in the 71 × 71 pixels images of individual particles. Similarly to AlexNet features, we selected only the six visual word features with the highest standard deviation across the different classes for classification. This allowed the computation of a total of 24 features for ML.</p><p>The classification was performed using a random forest algorithm. The training dataset was made of 370 manually labelled individual particles and was used to train the random forest across 60 epochs. The classification was validated by 10-fold cross validation on the same dataset. The confusion matrix obtained from this cross-validation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. At the training stage, the training dataset was augmented 5-fold by transforming the images with image translation and rotation randomly picked between 0 and 1 pixel and between 0 and 360 degrees respectively.</p><p>The accuracy of the model was estimated by calculating the fraction of correctly classified particles across all classes.<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Predictor scoring</title><p>The predictors were scored by computing the accuracy of the random forest trained on the training dataset but with only subsets of features.

The length of the rod could be adjusted by shortening the ends of the backbone or by extrapolating it outwards to lengthen it. The interior pixels of the image obtained were removed to leave the outline of the particle shape. This outline was then convolved with a Gaussian kernel in order to take into account the effect of the image resolution (here 90 nm).

The field-of-view achievable in our TIRF-SIM system is ~32 µm x 32 µm and a high quality sample preparation can yield a virus particle density of ~1 particle/µm<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, with an acquisition time of 200 ms/SIM raw frame (with a total of 9 frames), we assess that our single frame particle throughput can reach ~500 imaged particles/s. However, the acquisition of two consecutive fields-of-view are affected by imaging dead time as a consequence of stage movement and refocussing. In the study presented here, this step was done manually and took approximately 2–3 s. Therefore, a practical throughput achievable for the imaging is of the order of ~220 particles/s. We note however that both acquisition times and the stage movement time can be easily reduced by increasing illumination power and automation respectively. This makes the 500 particles/s not an unreasonable estimation for the achievable throughput of a further optimised acquisition. The throughput of the method can also be regarded as the time necessary to perform the complete study from sample preparation to analysis. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> indicates typical times necessary to perform the individual steps of the workflow.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structured illumination microscopy combined with machine learning for the high throughput analysis of virus structure&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Arup Chakraborty as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Peter Dedecker (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. We hope you will be able to submit the revised version within two months.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors describe the use of TIRF-SIM to visualize structural heterogeneity within populations of viral particles and use machine-learning approaches to classify the different morphologies. With the speed of data acquisition and the automated classification, the method is an interesting approach to introduce robust and fast quality control of production of viral particles in an industrial setting (e.g. vaccine production).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Since this manuscript is a submission for the Tools and Resources section of the journal, there is less of a requirement for new mechanistic insight, but an essential need for a clear justification of why the methodology will be better than what is currently used. The reviewers commented on a lack of clear justification of the work and the need to place it in context of methods that are currently used to characterise morphologies in heterogeneous populations of viral particles. Importantly, the work should provide a quantitative analysis of how the described workflow performs compared to established workflows (the authors mention electron microscopy).</p><p>2) Also, the manuscript lacks detail in many places to truly understand what the authors did and in what order.</p><p>Not until the Materials and methods does it become clear what was being imaged in the paper, and even then, a description of the primary antibodies is not very informative with respect to what structures are being identified (envelope, capsid…?). A brief mention of what is being measured early would greatly improve the readability of the paper.</p><p>More details regarding the high throughput nature of the measurements are needed. How do the authors achieve the 500 particles/second? Do they have 1000 particles in a field of view? (1000 particles/1.8 s data collection time). How long does it take to switch between fields of view? How long does the software need to extract the 500 super resolution particles?

The reviewers commented on a lack of clear justification of the work and the need to place it in context of methods that are currently used to characterise morphologies in heterogeneous populations of viral particles. Importantly, the work should provide a quantitative analysis of how the described workflow performs compared to established workflows (the authors mention electron microscopy).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a comparison between electron microscopy and our approach with a number of comments throughout the text and have also included a table summarising important performance parameters of the two methods (Table 1).</p><p>“Typically, this is achieved by extracting batches from the production process, with elaborate subsequent purification and preparation steps before characterisation by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) (Gad, 2007; Goldsmith and Miller 2009; Brenner and Horne, 1959.

[…] Also, the capability of investigating unpurified and aqueous samples makes TIRF-SIM ideally suited to the present application.”</p><p>“We were able to image up to ~220 particles/second at 90 nm resolution, vastly increasing imaging throughput compared to alternative super-resolution methods, improving sensitivity and specificity in comparison to TEM. Furthermore EM does not feature the specificity to analyse virus samples in their aqueous, unaltered unpurified forms.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Also, the manuscript lacks detail in many places to truly understand what the authors did and in what order.</p><p>Not until the Materials and methods does it become clear what was being imaged in the paper, and even then, a description of the primary antibodies is not very informative with respect to what structures are being identified (envelope, capsid…?). A brief mention of what is being measured early would greatly improve the readability of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We have worked on the main text to improve clarity and flow of information. Regarding antibodies, NDV viruses were labelled by targeting Hemagglutinin-Neuraminidase (HN) via primary/secondary antibody labelling. HN is a viral envelope glycoprotein and therefore identifies the outline and overall shape of the virus particles.

How do the authors achieve the 500 particles/second? Do they have 1000 particles in a field of view? (1000 particles/1.8 s data collection time). How long does it take to switch between fields of view? How long does the software need to extract the 500 super resolution particles? The authors should also mention how long the analysis takes (both for training and analyzing the data with the trained algorithm).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that aspects of imaging throughput should have been presented in more detail. We have now added a discussion on throughput achievable with our method in a supplementary note (Supplementary Note 1). The value originally quoted as 500 particles/s was based on an estimation of the maximal achievable throughput for the imaging conditions presented in the manuscript. As the reviewers point out, this estimation is based on ~1000 / field-of-view and a ~2s acquisition, conditions that are readily achievable in practice. In the examples shown, the microscope stage was moved and the field refocused manually, which took an average of ~2-3s. This therefore brings the actual imaging throughput to ~ 220 particles/s, which is what we now quote in the manuscript. However this value can be easily improved on through a reduction of acquisition times and automation of stage movement. This makes the 500 particles/s not an unreasonable estimation for a possible throughput.</p><p>Supplementary Note 1 also includes estimations of the time necessary for the different steps of the workflow proposed here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The described method for feature selection hinges on the evaluation of their predictive power, though no clear definition is provided of how this is calculated.</p></disp-quote><p>Here, we defined the predictive power as the accuracy of the model. This describes the fraction of correctly classified particles, which corresponds to the sum of the correctly predicted fractions in the confusion matrix shown in Figure 3C. We now name our metric “accuracy” (instead of predictive power) and give a definition at its first instance.</p><p>“The choice of algorithm and the set of features (often called predictors) extracted for each identified particle were optimised to maximise the overall accuracy of the model based on the training dataset (comprising of 370 manually annotated particles). Here, the model accuracy is defined as the fraction of correctly classified particles across all classes.”</p><p>We also explicitly define what we mean by accuracy in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>“The accuracy of the model was estimated by calculating the fraction of correctly classified particles across all classes.</p><p>accuracy=NumberofparticlescorrectlyclassifiedTotalnumberofparticles</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The main issue is with Figure 4C, showing the radii of large and small spherical particles.

The confusion came from extracting the radii for large and small spherical particles using different analysis methods and plotting them on the same graph. In the original manuscript, the radius obtained for the small spherical was extracted from an area analysis whereas the radius shown for the large spherical originated from the ELM analysis. The radii obtained by these 2 methods represent two different structural parameter for the images.</p><p>We have therefore changed Figure 4 to show only radius estimation by area analysis for both small and large spherical particles in Figure 4C.</p><p>The average diameters are now clearly separated: D<sub>LS</sub> = 338 ± 94 nm, D<sub>SS</sub> = 190 ± 10 nm.</p><p>We also added the following clarifications.</p><p>“The spherical structures were analysed by estimating their equivalent radius from the area of the particle.

Extraction of the size distribution is an interesting aspect of this work. However, it is problematic that the radius of the larger spheres is often smaller than the small spheres.

Could it be unspecific binding of the secondary antibodies to the surface or individual proteins that are not associated to the viruses in this class?</italic> </p><p>With the amended analysis, now using equivalent diameter for both large and small spherical particles, the two classes are clearly discriminated and, as expected, the radii of large spherical particles are distributed around a range of radii larger than those of the small spherical particles (see amended Figure 4C). The reviewers mention the possibility to extract radius with better precision than the resolution limit. This is the intention with the ELM analysis, which takes the PSF into account (to some extent in a similar way to a deconvolution operation, but here based on a parametric shape modelling of the sample). The ELM analysis is now shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 for both the large spherical of NDV and that of B-Victoria.</p><p>As for unspecific binding, we excluded this possibility of this by measuring a control sample (sample prepared identically to the virus samples but in the absence of virus particles) and having a thresholding step prior to further analysis to exclude background signal. This point was made clearer in the main text:</p><p>“A control sample that was prepared identically to the other samples except without virus particles present allowed us to identify that non-specific bindings of antibodies appear as rare, dim and small point-like structures that could easily be discriminated and excluded from further analysis.”</p><p>As well as in the Materials and methods:</p><p>“The particles that were judged too small or too dim to be real particles (based on criteria obtained from the control sample) were excluded from further analysis.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
