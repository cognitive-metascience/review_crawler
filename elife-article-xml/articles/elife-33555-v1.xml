However, during asymmetric division the role of phosphatidylinositol (PI) lipids and their regulators is not well established. Here, we show that the sole type I PI transfer protein, Vibrator, controls asymmetric division of <italic>Drosophila</italic>neural stem cells (NSCs) by physically anchoring myosin II regulatory light chain, Sqh, to the NSC cortex. Depletion of <italic>vib</italic> or disruption of its lipid binding and transfer activities disrupts NSC polarity. We propose that Vib stimulates PI4KIIIα to promote synthesis of a plasma membrane pool of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate [PI(4)P] that, in turn, binds and anchors myosin to the NSC cortex. Remarkably, Sqh also binds to PI(4)P in vitro and both Vib and Sqh mediate plasma membrane localization of PI(4)P in NSCs. Thus, reciprocal regulation between Myosin and PI(4)P likely governs asymmetric division of NSCs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33555.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Stem cells are cells that can both make copies of themselves and make new cells of various types. They can either divide symmetrically to produce two identical new cells, or they can divide asymmetrically to produce two different cells. Asymmetric division happens because the two new cells contain different molecules. Stem cells drive asymmetric division by moving key molecules to one end of the cell before they divide.</p><p>Asymmetric division is key to how neural stem cells produce new brain cells. Many studies have used the developing brain of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> to understand this process. Errors in asymmetric division can lead to too many stem cells or not enough brain cells. This can contribute to brain tumors and other neurological disorders. Fat molecules called phosphatidylinositol lipids are some of chemicals that cause asymmetry in neural stem cells. Yet, it is not clear how these lipid molecules affect cell behavior to turn stem cells into brain cells.</p><p>The production of phosphatidylinositol lipids involves proteins called Vibrator and PI4KIIIα. Koe et al. examined the role of these two proteins in asymmetric cell division of neural stem cells in fruit flies. The results show that Vibrator activates PI4KIIIα, which leads to high levels of a phosphatidylinositol lipid called PI(4)P within the cell. These lipids act as an anchor for a group of proteins called myosin, part of the machinery that physically divides the cell. Hence, myosin and phosphatidylinositol lipids together control asymmetric division of neural stem cells.</p><p>Further experiments used mouse proteins to compensate for defects in the equivalent fly proteins. The results suggest that the same mechanisms are likely to hold true in mammalian brains, although this still needs to be proven. Nevertheless, given that human equivalents of Vibrator and PI4KIIIα are associated with neurodegenerative disorders, schizophrenia or cancers, these new findings are likely to help scientists better to understand several human diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuroblast</kwd><kwd>Drosophila</kwd><kwd>asymmetric division</kwd><kwd>phosphatidylinositol lipids</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education - Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOE2016-T2-2-042</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koe</surname><given-names>Chwee Tat</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Hongyan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1GM112591</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lönnfors</surname><given-names>Max</given-names></name><name><surname>Hur</surname><given-names>Seong Kwon</given-names></name><name><surname>Bankaitis</surname><given-names>Vytas A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BE-0017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lönnfors</surname><given-names>Max</given-names></name><name><surname>Hur</surname><given-names>Seong Kwon</given-names></name><name><surname>Bankaitis</surname><given-names>Vytas A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Vibrator and PI4KIIIα that stimulate the synthesis of PI(4)P anchor non-muscle myosin II RLC (Sqh) to the plasma membrane and conversely Sqh associates with PI(4)P and facilitates its membrane localization during asymmetric division of neuroblasts.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Understanding how neural stem cells divide asymmetrically is central for stem cell and cancer biology. <italic>Drosophila</italic> neural stem cells (NSC), or neuroblasts, are an excellent model for understanding stem cell asymmetry and homeostasis. Each neuroblast divides asymmetrically to generate a self-renewing neuroblast and a differentiating daughter cell. It is the latter that ultimately produces neurons/glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Doe, 2008</xref>). Disruption of asymmetric division in neuroblasts may result in the formation of ectopic neuroblasts, leading to brain tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Caussinus and Gonzalez, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chabu and Doe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Asymmetric division of neuroblasts depends on the polarized distribution of proteins and their asymmetric segregation into different daughter cells. Apical proteins such as atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), Par-6 (Partitioning defective 6), Par-3/Bazooka (Baz), Inscuteable (Insc) and Partner of Inscuteable (Pins) control the localization of basal proteins, as well as the orientation of the mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Knoblich, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chang et al., 2012</xref>). Basal cell fate determinants Numb, Prospero (Pros), Brain tumor (Brat), and their adaptor proteins Partner of Numb (Pon) and Miranda (Mira) are critical for neuronal differentiation upon asymmetric segregation into the differentiating daughter cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gonzalez, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Doe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Knoblich, 2010</xref>). Asymmetric localization of Mira was thought to be achieved via a series of linear inhibitory regulations from aPKC to Mira via Lethal giant larvae (Lgl) and nonmuscle Myosin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kalmes et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barros et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Betschinger et al., 2003</xref>). aPKC was shown later to directly phosphorylate both Numb and Mira to polarize them in neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smith et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atwood and Prehoda, 2009</xref>), while Lgl directly inhibits aPKC in neuroblasts, rather than displacing Mira on the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atwood and Prehoda, 2009</xref>). However, how myosin regulates asymmetric division of neuroblasts remains not well understood.</p><p>Despite having identified phosphatidylinositol (PI) lipids as critical components of cellular membranes important for cell polarity of various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Krahn and Wodarz, 2012</xref>), the role of PI lipids and their regulators are not well established in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts. Phosphoinositides are phosphorylated derivatives of PI, and their synthesis is catalyzed by lipid kinases; specially, phosphoinositide 4-phosphate [PI(4)P] production is catalyzed by PI 4-OH kinases (PI4K). Interestingly, these lipid kinases are inherently inefficient enzymes and production of biologically sufficient amounts of PI(4)P for efficient signaling requires the stimulation of these enzymes by phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITPs). PITPs leverage their lipid exchange activities to present PI as a superior substrate to PI4Ks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bankaitis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grabon et al., 2015</xref>). Classical PITPs bind to PI and phosphatidylcholine (PC) in a mutually exclusive manner, with PI being the preferred binding substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wirtz, 1991</xref>). Classical PITPs are also divided into two different subtypes, type I and type II, both of which contain PITP domains with type II PITPs containing additional N-termini of large membrane-associated modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nile et al., 2010</xref>). Loss of PITP function is associated with neurological disorders, including cerebellar ataxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hsuan and Cockcroft, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cockcroft and Garner, 2011</xref>). These deficits are consistent with the fact that PITPs are particularly highly expressed in the brain and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Utsunomiya et al., 1997</xref>). In mammals, type I PITPs consist of PITPα and PITPβ. Mouse hypomorphic mutants for PITPα/Vibrator exhibit a progressive, and ultimately fatal, whole-body tremor that reflects neurodegenerative disease, whereas mice with the PITPα structural gene deleted survive to term but die shortly after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hamilton et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alb et al., 2003</xref>). Attempted rescue of PITPα-null mice with a PITPα mutant specifically defective in PI-binding exhibit phenotypes indistinguishable from those of the null mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alb et al., 2007</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, a single type I PITP has been identified, named Vibrator/Giotto, which plays a prominent role in cytokinesis of spermatocytes and neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gatt and Glover, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Giansanti et al., 2006</xref>). However, the role of PITPs in neuroblast polarity is unknown.</p><p>Herein, we show that the type I PITP Vibrator regulates asymmetric division of neuroblasts through anchoring nonmuscle myosin II regulatory light chain (RLC), Sqh, to the cell cortex. We further demonstrate that depletion of PI4KIIIα(a PI4 kinase that is essential for PI(4)P synthesis) also leads to Sqh delocalization and asymmetric division defects. Thus, Vibrator and PI4KIIIα likely promote synthesis of a plasma membrane PI(4)P pool that, in turn, binds and anchors myosin to the cell cortex. Importantly, we show that Sqh is able to bind to phospholipid PI(4)P and facilitates its membrane localization in neuroblasts. Taken together, the data identify a reciprocal dependence between Myosin and PI(4)P localization in neuroblasts.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Vib controls homeostasis of larval central brain neuroblasts</title><p>To identify novel regulators of neuroblast homeostasis, we performed a genetic screen on a collection of chromosome 3R mutants induced by ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis (CT Koe, F Yu and H Wang, unpublished).

In wild-type larval brains, Sqh::GFP was largely cytoplasmic at interphase with 38% cortical localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1B</xref>, 38%, n = 95), while localizing uniformly to the cortex of neuroblasts at metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>, 100%, n = 53).

In wild-type mitotic neuroblasts, Sqh1P was seen at both the cell cortex (69%, n = 52) and as diffuse cytoplasmic staining at metaphase (31%, n = 52), and enriched at the cleavage furrow at telophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>, 84%, n = 25). By contrast, Sqh1P was cytoplasmic in the vast majority of metaphase neuroblasts (92.5%, n = 40) and it failed to enrich at the cleavage furrow in telophase neuroblasts (62.5%, n = 24) of <italic>vib<sup>133/j5A6</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>).

To test whether Vib is necessary for the correct localization and activation of Rok, we first determined localization of Rok-GFP in <italic>vib</italic> mutant neuroblasts. In controls (Ubi-Rok-GFP heterozygous), neuroblasts expressed cortical Rok-GFP at metaphase (93.5%, n = 46) and showed enriched Rok-GFP at the cleavage furrow in telophase (91.7%, n = 24). Similarly, in <italic>vib<sup>133/j5A6</sup></italic> we observed cortical Rok-GFP localization in 91.6% of metaphase neuroblasts (n = 24) and 85.7% (n = 14) of telophase neuroblasts showed enriched Rok-GFP at the cleavage furrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This result suggests that Vib is not essential for Rok localization in neuroblasts. Next, we explored whether increased Rok activity could rescue the asymmetric cell division defects observed in <italic>vib</italic> mutants. We overexpressed the catalytic domain of Rok (Rok-CAT), a previously characterized transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Winter et al., 2001</xref>) that is known to increase phosphorylation of Sqh, and found that it was unable to recuse Mira delocalization in <italic>vib<sup>133/j5A6</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>; metaphase, 85.7%, n = 42; telophase, 83.3%, n = 12), rather showing similar Mira delocalization to <italic>vib<sup>133/j5A6</sup></italic> trans-heterozygous mutant (metaphase, 90.2%, n = 34; telophase, 84.6%, n = 26).

The lipid headgroup binding cavity of PITPs comprised of several conserved residues that are important for interaction with PI and PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cockcroft and Garner, 2011</xref>). Among these residues, mammalian Threonine 59, the Thr63 equivalent in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Vib, has been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cockcroft and Garner, 2011</xref>). The Thr59 to Ala substitution of mammalian PITPα reduces PI binding specifically, whereas the Glu substitution specifically ablates the PI binding/transfer activity without affecting PC binding/transfer activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alb et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Morgan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cockcroft and Garner, 2011</xref>). We purified VibT63A (Thr63 to Ala) and VibT63E (Thr63 to Glu) and determined their PI and PC binding and transfer capacities in vitro. In vitro PI and PC binding and transfer activities were measured by monitoring the PyrPtdCho or [3 hr]-PtdCho and PyrPtdIns or [3 hr]-PtdIns transport from donor to acceptor liposomes as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Somerharju et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bankaitis et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schaaf et al., 2008</xref>). Similar to rat PITPα and PITPβ, wild-type Vib protein bound both PC and PI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). In addition, Vib transferred both PI and PC robustly, albeit with slightly lower capacity than mouse PITPs and the major yeast PI/PC-transfer protein Sec14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). By contrast, mutation of Thr63 to Ala abolished both PI and PC binding and transfer capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). While PI binding and transfer were abolished in VibT63E, the mutant protein retained reduced PC binding and transfer capability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>).

In wild-type larval brain neuroblasts, PI(4)P was barely detected using an anti-PI(4)P antibody in wild-type larval brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Forrest et al., 2013</xref>), presumably due to its low abundance.

Interestingly, PI(4)P appeared to be enriched at cleavage furrow in telophase neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>, 73.1%, n = 78).

Strikingly, PI(4)P-GFP in 44% of interphase <italic>vib<sup>133/j5A6</sup></italic> neuroblasts localized to the cytoplasm and forming large aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>, n = 157).

At metaphase, PI(4)P-GFP reporter in <italic>vib<sup>133/j5A6</sup></italic> was largely unaffected, likely due to its high abundance at this stage (data not shown). However, the enrichment of PI(4)P at the cleavage furrow was lost in 51.9% of telophase neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>, n = 54). This observation is supported by the measurement of PI(4)P-GFP pixel intensity. Normalized against the intensity at the apical cortex, wild-type neuroblasts showed an average of 2.07-fold enrichment (n = 34) of PI(4)P-GFP at the cleavage furrow, while in <italic>vib<sup>133/j5A6</sup></italic> telophase neuroblasts, enrichment of PI(4)P-GFP decreased to 1.44-fold (n = 18) at cleavage furrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

We analyzed the localization of PI(4)P-GFP in <italic>sqh<sup>1</sup></italic> hemizygotes, a hypomorphic allele of Sqh that survived to the third instar larval stage. Remarkably, 23.3% of interphase neuroblasts (n = 313) and 36.8% of metaphase neuroblasts (n = 19) displayed distinct PI(4)P-GFP aggregates in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

Due to Vib’s robust PI/PC transfer activity, it is likely that interaction of Vib with its interacting proteins will be transient. Therefore, we adopted bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gohl et al., 2010</xref>), a widely used method to probe protein-protein interactions that are transient or weak, due to the irreversibility of the BiFC complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shyu et al., 2008</xref>). We generated chimeric proteins, Vib-Myc-N termini of YFP (Vib-Myc-NYFP), and C-termini of YFP (CYFP)-HA-Sqh constructs. Expression of these constructs with their respective negative controls, comprising of the matching half-YFP (refer to the legend), in S2 cells by <italic>actin</italic>-Gal4 did not result in any fluorescence signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Remarkably, we observed intense YFP signals upon co-transfection of both constructs in S2 cells with <italic>actin-</italic>Gal4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). On the contrary, we did not observe YFP signals in S2 cells that co-express either Vib-Myc-NYFP with an unrelated control WAVE-HA-CYFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gohl et al., 2010</xref>) or CYFP-HA-Sqh with WAVE-Myc-NYFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gohl et al., 2010</xref>) (data not shown). As an additional control, Vib did not interact with Mira or Baz in BiFC assays (data not shown). This observation suggests that Vib and Sqh were in sufficiently close proximity to each other to allow the two-halves of YFP to merge in trans and reconstitute a functional fluorescence protein. To validate this interaction, we generated two truncated Vib proteins, Vib N-terminus (VibN) and Vib C terminus (VibC), and tested either truncated form of Vib abolished the interaction with Sqh in BiFC assays. Indeed, co-expression of either VibN-Myc-NYFP or VibC-Myc-NYFP with CYFP-HA-Sqh, driven by <italic>actin</italic>-Gal4 in S2 cells, did not result in any YFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). As expected, neither of the negative control for these truncated proteins displayed YFP in the same BiFC assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Next, to examine if Vib and Sqh interact in vivo, we generated transgenes expressing NYFP-Myc-Vib and CYFP-HA-Sqh. Co-expression of NYFP-Myc with CYFP-HA-Sqh (metaphase, n = 44; telophase, n = 8) and NYFP-Myc-Vib with CYFP-HA (metaphase, n = 32; telophase, n = 10) under the neuroblast driver, <italic>insc-</italic>Gal4, did not result in YFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Despite NYFP-Myc-Vib being observed in the cytoplasm and CYFP-HA-Sqh at both cell cortex and spindle envelope in neuroblasts, YFP was found in the cytoplasm during interphase, then localized to the cortex as early as prophase and concentrated at the cleavage furrow at telophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; metaphase, n = 44; telophase, n = 15).

To this end, we examined the localization of Sqh::mCherry in <italic>PI4KIIIα<sup>C</sup></italic> MARCM clones. Since Sqh::mCherry is mostly cytoplasmic during interphase, we focused our analysis on mitotic neuroblasts. In control MARCM clones, 46% of metaphase neuroblasts showed strong cortical localization of Sqh::mCherry, 23% was weakly cortical and 31% was cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, n = 11). However, a vast majority of metaphase neuroblasts from <italic>PI4KIIIα<sup>C</sup></italic> MARCM clones displayed either cytoplasmic (36.4%) or weakly cortical localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, 54.5%, n = 11). This observation suggests that similar to Vib, PI4KIIIαis important for anchoring Sqh to the cell cortex in dividing neuroblasts. Consistently, Sqh1P cortical localization also depended on PI4KIIIαin neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In the controls, while 12% were weakly cortical and the remaining 20% were cytoplasmic, 68% of metaphase neuroblasts showed cortical Sqh1P localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>, n = 25). By contrast, only 5.6% (n = 18) of metaphase neuroblasts of PI4KIII<italic>α<sup>C</sup></italic> showed obvious cortical localization and the rest of them were either cytoplasmic (44.4%, n = 18) or weakly cortical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1E</xref>, 50%, n = 18). At telophase, Sqh1P localization at the cleavage furrow was only observed in 44.4% of PI4KIII<italic>α<sup>C</sup></italic> neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>, n = 9), while majority of control telophase neuroblasts showed Sqh1P localization at the cleavage furrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1E</xref>, 84.2%, n = 19). These observations strongly suggest that PI4KIIIαplays an important role in localizing Sqh to the cell cortex in neuroblasts.</p><p>Next, we assessed the effect of pharmacological inhibition of PI4KIIIα on asymmetric division of neuroblasts by phenylarsine oxide (PAO), an inhibitor of PI4-kinases at a low concentration of 2.5 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bryant et al., 2015</xref>). In the mock treatment (DMSO) to wild-type larval brains, 82.4% of metaphase Sqh::mCherry were cortically localized and only 17.6% of neuroblasts showed cytoplasmic distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, n = 51). By contrast, with PAO treatment, Sqh::mCherry became cytoplasmic in 59% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, n = 117) of metaphase neuroblasts. Likewise, compared with basal Mira crescent (100%, n = 48) in the mock treatment, 25% (n = 64) of neuroblasts upon PAO treatment showed cytoplasmic Mira localization at metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), which was consistent with above observations in PI4KIII<italic>α<sup>C</sup></italic> neuroblasts. However, Rok-GFP localization was unaffected following PAO treatment. Similar to mock (DMSO treatment), 92% (n = 112) of metaphase neuroblasts with cortical Rok-GFP localization and 76.5% (n = 17) of telophase with Rok-GFP enriched at the cleavage furrow were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). This result suggests that Rok localization is likely independent of PI4KIIIα. Taken together, these observations reinforce the role of PI4KIIIα in Sqh localization to the cell cortex as well as asymmetric division.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we show a new role for <italic>Drosophila</italic> PITP, Vibrator/Giotto in asymmetric cell division and homeostasis of neuroblasts by interacting and anchoring non-muscle myosin II light chain, Sqh. Importantly, lipid binding/transfer activities, particularly PI binding and transfer activities of Vib, are critical for asymmetric division. We also show that Sqh binds to phosphoinositides including PI(4)P and that a pool of PI(4)P is localized at the cell cortex of neuroblasts in a Vib and Sqh-dependent manner. Finally, a PI4-kinase PI4KIIIα, an essential kinase for PI(4)P synthesis, is required for Sqh localization and asymmetric division, similar to Vib. Given the lipid-binding and transfer function of Vib, it is conceivable that it anchors Sqh to the cell cortex prior to the asymmetric localization of Sqh and basal proteins in neuroblasts, rather than directly regulating asymmetric localization of Sqh or basal proteins. In addition, Vib’s localization in neuroblast cortex lacks apparent asymmetry, while it is required for the asymmetric localization of apical proteins aPKC and Par-6, but not Baz. We speculate that Vib might also play a role in membrane localization of aPKC or Par-6 in neuroblasts. We also show that Vib likely interacts with Sqh to regulate asymmetric division through its stimulation of PI4KIIIα to produce a plasma membrane pool of PI(4)P that, in turn, specifies cortical targeting of Sqh in neuroblasts. This reciprocal regulation between Myosin and lipid transfer/synthesis may be important for asymmetric division of neuroblasts.</p><p>The asymmetric division defects of <italic>vib</italic>-depleted neuroblasts were not a consequence of cytokinesis failure, because the VibT63E mutation, which rendered Vib deficient in PI binding/transfer with reduced PC binding/transfer, was able to rescue the defects of cytokinesis, but not neuroblast polarity, observed in <italic>vib</italic>-depleted neuroblasts. This finding suggests that PC binding/transfer function of Vib may be more important for cytokinesis, while PI binding/transfer may play a more prominent role in neuroblast polarity. Therefore, the pleotropic functions of Vib may be separable by cooperating with different downstream proteins during cytokinesis and asymmetric division of neuroblasts. Supporting this notion, depletion of PI4KIIIαresulted in loss of neuroblast polarity without blocking cytokinesis. Thus, it is conceivable that Vib and PI4KIIIα-dependent cortical localization of Sqh regulates asymmetric division, but not cytokinesis.</p><p>PI(4)P is a functionally diverse inositol lipid in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gassama-Diagne and Payrastre, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hammond et al., 2009</xref>). Apart from being the major precursor of PI(4,5)P2 biosynthesis, PI(4)P also plays numerous crucial functions such as regulation of protein trafficking at the level of the Golgi complex, and sphingolipid and sterol biosynthetic trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Matsuoka et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blumental-Perry et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Olkkonen and Li, 2013</xref>). We show that PI(4)P can be detected on the cell cortex of neuroblasts with cleavage furrow enrichment at telophase. Moreover, we show that the distribution of PI(4)P on the plasma membrane is mediated by both Vib and Sqh in neuroblasts. Supporting this notion, Sqh binds to PI(4)P in vitro. Although the apical protein Baz, an apical protein, is known to be targeted to the plasma membrane via direct interactions with PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(4,5)P2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Heo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Krahn et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, the role of Vib in neuroblast asymmetric division that we report here is substantially independent of Baz function.</p><p>Mammalian PI4-kinases are responsible for the generation of PI(4)P within cells and exhibit different subcellular distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clayton et al., 2013</xref>). While type II PI4-kinases and type III PI4KIIIβ localize to intracellular membranes including trans-Golgi network (TGN), endoplasmic reticulum (ER), endosomal and trafficking vesicles, PI4KIIIα localizes to the plasma membrane, early cis-Golgi compartments and nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">D'Angelo et al., 2008</xref>). The known distribution of various PI4 kinases and the fact that PI4KIIIα is the major kinase responsible for plasma membrane PI(4)P biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roy and Levine, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balla et al., 2005</xref>) well support the unique role of PI4KIIIα among three <italic>Drosophila</italic> PI4-kinases in neuroblast asymmetry. <italic>Drosophila</italic> PI4kIIIα is also required for plasma membrane integrity and oocyte chamber polarity potentially through regulating actin organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tan et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, we found that actin localization labeled by Phalloidin was unaffected in both <italic>vib</italic> and <italic>PI4KIIIα</italic> mutant neuroblasts (data not shown), suggesting that both Vib and PI4KIIIα likely regulate neuroblast polarity independent of actin organization. Mammalian PI4-Kinases are associated with cancer and neurological diseases including schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Furuta et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jungerius et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clayton et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, our findings on the role of <italic>Drosophila</italic> PI4KIIIα in neuroblast asymmetric division may shed light on the mechanisms underlying these diseases.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> non-muscle myosin II RLC Sqh regulates asymmetric localization of basal cell fate determinants in neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barros et al., 2003</xref>). Similarly, <italic>C. elegans</italic> non-muscle myosin II exhibits polarized distribution and mediates asymmetric localization of Par-3 to the anterior cortex during the asymmetric division of the one-cell stage embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Severson and Bowerman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ou et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we show that Vib is critical for anchoring Sqh to the neuroblast cortex. The asymmetric localization of Sqh in neuroblasts has been shown to be dependent on apical protein Pins, but not aPKC, Baz or canonical centralspindlin pathway including Pavarotti (Pav) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gatt and Glover, 2006</xref>). The novel role of Vib in anchoring Sqh appears to be independent of Pins, since Vib is not important for Pins cortical polarity in neuroblasts. Together with our finding on the role of PI4KIIIα in Sqh localization, we demonstrate that the Vib and PI4KIIIα-dependent inositol lipid PI(4)P is important for Sqh cortical localization in neuroblasts.</p><p>Myosin is known to associate with lipids indirectly through F-actin and the direct link between myosin and lipids was unclear. Our data on the association between Vib and Sqh provides a novel link between PITP-dependent PI(4)P pools and myosin localization in dividing cells. In addition, we show the binding of Sqh to phospholipids including PI(4)P, directly linking myosin to phospholipids. Very recently, mammalian non-muscle myosin II was shown to bind to liposomes containing multiple acidic PIPs through its RLC-binding site, but not to liposomes that contain only PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Our finding that Sqh mediates membrane localization of PI(4)P suggests that Sqh may reinforce the cortical localization of itself through an interaction with Vib and PI(4)P in neuroblasts. Whether this reciprocal regulation between Myosin and lipid synthesis is similarly employed in other cell types will be of great interest in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks and genetics</title><p>Fly stocks and genetic crosses were raised at 25°C unless otherwise stated.

During ligation, connector oligos hybridize to PLA probes and T4 ligases catalyze to form a circularized template. DNA polymerase amplifies circularized template, which is bound by fluorescently labeled complementary oligos allowing the interaction to be observed as a PLA foci within cells (Adopted from Duolink PLA, Merck). Proximity ligation assay was performed on S2 cells that were transfected with the indicated plasmids using Effectene Transfection Reagent (QIAGEN). The plasmids used were: control Myc, control Flag, Flag-Vib and Myc-Sqh. S2 cells were washed thrice with cold PBS, fixed with 4% EM grade formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and blocked in 5% BSA in PBS-T (0.1% Triton-X100) for 45min. Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies at RT for 2 hr before proceeding with Duolink PLA (Sigma-Aldrich) according to manufacturer’s protocol. After primary antibodies incubation, S2 cells were incubated with PLA probes at 37˚C for 1 hr. Cells were washed twice with Buffer A for 5 min each at RT, followed by ligation of probes at 37˚C for 30 min. Amplification was performed at 37˚C for 100 min, followed by two washes with Buffer B for 10 min each at RT.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Yukiko M Yamashita is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Clemens Cabernard (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>All reviewers agreed that the paper is potentially interesting, as it investigates an unexplored area of asymmetric stem cell division, and thus the enthusiasm on the topic was high. However, at this point, the reviewers felt that specific data do not cleanly support the authors' claim (as detailed in the individual comments below). In particular, the existing gap between Myosin localization to spindle orientation/asymmetric neuroblast division was considered to be a weakness of the current manuscript. Therefore, per <italic>eLife</italic>'s policy to invite revision only when it is expected to be acceptable after a minor revision, we cannot offer publishing your paper at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Wang and colleagues identified vibrator (PITP) as a novel regulator of neuroblast polarity and division. They show that Vib is required for apical localization of Par6 and aPKC, basal localization of Mira, Pros, and Numb (without affecting the localization of Baz, Insc, Pins). Vib is also required for spindle orientation of the neuroblast. They show that Vib regulates the localization of non-muscle myosin II, Sqh, which is known to regulate neuroblast polarity in embryonic neuroblasts.</p><p>This is a well-done study to show the role of PI4P and its regulators in the asymmetric division of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblast. The relationship between PIPs and cortical domain/polarity itself is not novel, but its involvement in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblast has not been shown (to my knowledge). Also, the authors provide thorough characterization of how PI4P regulation (via function of Vib) contributes to known mechanism(s) of neuroblast polarity. Although I'd like to see the comments from other reviewers (better experts in the field), I think this is a good paper and worth publishing in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Asymmetric cell division generates cell diversity. Stem cells utilize this mechanism to self-renew itself while forming a differentiating sibling at the same time. The role and function of phosphatidolinositol lipids during asymmetric stem cell division is underexplored. Koe et al., characterize a new phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP) called Vibrator/Giotto in asymmetrically dividing <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> neural stem cells (neuroblasts). Vibrator/Giotto has been previously shown to be involved in cytokinesis. The authors propose that Vibrator is regulating asymmetric neuroblast divisions by anchoring non-muscle Myosin II's regulatory light chain (Spaghetti Squash in flies) to the neuroblast cortex. Based on a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay, Koe et al., propose that Vibrator and Sqh interact in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, the authors show that depletion of PI4KIIIalpha, a PI4 kinase, essential for PI(4)P synthesis, is also required for cortical Sqh localization and asymmetric cell division. Based on this data, the authors propose that Vibrator and PI4KIIIalpha promote the synthesis of a PI(4)P plasma membrane pool, which might be required for anchoring Myosin to the cell cortex.</p><p>Overall, the role and function of phosphatidolinositol lipids during asymmetric cell division and stem cell self-renewal would be of general interest. However, the connection between cortical Sqh localization, neuroblast polarity, spindle orientation and the reported neuroblast &quot;over-growth&quot; and homeostasis phenotypes remains unexplained. Both Vib and PI4KIIIalpha seem to compromise the localization of cortical Myosin but how cortical Myosin affects neuroblast polarity is underexplored in the manuscript by Koe et al. It seems to me that many of the reported neuroblast phenotypes cannot be understood without further exploring this connection. Also, since mutants, failing to localize Myosin to the cortex often do not enter anaphase, or are compromised in completing cytokinesis, I have difficulties to reconcile this observation with the here reported neuroblast phenotypes.</p><p>1) The authors report that vib133 type I and type II neuroblast MARCM clones show a neuroblast over-growth phenotype. What exactly is meant by this? Control clones usually contain 1 neuroblast/clone but vib133 clones seem to contain at least two neuroblasts in the pictures shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>. It seems to me that the term &quot;neuroblast over-growth&quot; does not apply here since it is more of a lack of differentiation phenotype.</p><p>2) Based on clonal analysis, the authors conclude that Vib is required for neuroblast homeostasis in type I and II lineages. Since Vib has been shown to be involved in cytokinesis – a phenotype the authors have also observed – I wonder whether they don't over interpret their clonal analysis data. For instance, it is possible that cytokinesis failure could form two Dpn positive nuclei in the same cytoplasm. Their pictures do not necessarily rule out this possibility. This point must be clarified.</p><p>3) Vib133 mutant clones either show an increase in neuroblast number, show an apparent neuroblast overgrowth (see above), lose neuroblasts and also have cytokinesis defects. How do the authors reconcile all these clonal phenotypes with the polarity and spindle orientation defects?</p><p>4) The authors claim that Vib::Venus is slightly enriched at the cleavage furrow in telophase neuroblasts. I suggest the authors support this claim with pixel intensity measurements since the provided images don't convince me that there is an increase at the furrow; Vib::Venus signal seems to be stronger also on the forming GMC cortex compared to the apical neuroblast cortex, which could mainly be due to cell-cell contacts.</p><p>5) How do the authors explain the observed spindle orientation phenotype? Is Mud mislocalized in <italic>vib</italic> mutant neuroblasts? Did the authors consider spindle architecture (e.g. loss or fewer astral MTs) or centrosomal defects?</p><p>6) The reference (Cabernard et al., 2010) should not be used in the context of Sqh::GFP restriction at the cleavage furrow in neuroblasts; Barros et al., reported the localization of Sqh::GFP before the cited study already.</p><p>7) The authors conclude that Vib is required for the localization of phosphorylated Sqh to the cell cortex. This conclusion is derived from the observation that Sqh1P staining in <italic>vib</italic> mutant neuroblasts is predominantly cytoplasmic. However, whether this cytoplasmic signal indeed corresponds to phosphorylated but mislocalized Sqh is unclear. Alternatively, it could simply be background signal. Thus, the alternative hypothesis that Vib is necessary for the correct localization and activation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rho kinase (Rock) should be tested.</p><p>8) The authors provide evidence that lipid binding and transfer activity is critical for neuroblast polarity and asymmetric cell division. However, given the previous Myosin localization data, the authors should test how this relates to Myosin localization. In other words, how is Sqh::GFP and Sqh1P localized when lipid binding and/or transfer activity are abolished.</p><p>9) The apparent loss of PI(4)P-GFP at the cleavage furrow should be verified with pixel intensity measurements.</p><p>10) The authors suggest that Vib directly interacts with Sqh in vivo based on a BiFC assay. This finding might be true but I am not convinced about the specificity of this signal. Potential pitfalls and drawbacks of this method should thus be stated and an alternative method to verify the interaction should be considered.</p><p>11) Similar to <italic>vib</italic> mutant neuroblasts, it should also be tested whether PI4KIII is involved in the localization and/or activation of Rock.</p><p>12) I do not see the benefit of pharmacological inhibition of PI4KIII. It does not seem to bring new mechanistic insight and appears rather redundant with mutant analysis. Thus, the authors might consider removing or at least shortening this section.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The study by Koe et al., describes a role for the type I phosphatidylinositol transfer protein Vibrator (Vib) and PI(4)P in promoting cortical localization of non-muscle myosin II regulatory light chain Spaghetti-squash (Sgh). In the absence of either vib or PI4KIIIα function, Sqh fails to properly localize to the cortex leading to defects in the establishment of cortical cell polarity in mitotic neuroblasts. While telophase rescue restores asymmetric localization of apical proteins, basal proteins fail to re-localize to the budding daughter, resulting in ectopic neuroblast formation. The discovery made in this study is potentially interesting but seems to just begin to unravel the insight into how specific lipid modifications can exert a regulatory role in controlling cortical cell polarity. Furthermore, some of the phenotypes shown in the mutant analyses appear to be extremely muddy, and it remains difficult for me to reconcile the reported polarity defects and the outcome of asymmetric neuroblast division. The wide spectrum of polarity defects exhibited by the vib or PI4KIIIα mutant neuroblasts potentially suggest that there are multiple additional downstream defects in addition to mis-regulation of apical-basal protein localization. As such, I am reluctant to support the publication of this study at its current state.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) The images showing the <italic>vib</italic> mutant neuroblasts throughout the figures appear extremely inconsistent. For example, the <italic>vib<sup>133</sup> </italic>type II neuroblasts shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> appears to significantly smaller than <italic>vib<sup>133</sup> </italic>type II neuroblasts shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>. Why are these mutant neuroblasts so much smaller than wild-type neuroblasts? Does Vib play a role in regulating cell size? In addition, the morphology of the <italic>vib<sup>133</sup> </italic>type II neuroblasts shown in the second column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref> appear to suggest that they might be polyploidy. Does Vib play a role in regulating cell division?</p><p>2) It is perplexing to me why loss of vib function simultaneously leads to ectopic neuroblast phenotype and neuroblast loss phenotype? My understanding of this system is that loss of basal proteins such as Numb and Brat always leads to ectopic neuroblasts.</p><p>3) The authors used &quot;% of marker localization&quot; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5D</xref>. It is unclear to me how this quantification is obtained. Please specify.</p><p>4) The BiFC image shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is fairly underwhelming and not very convincing. In addition, the image shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> appears to suggest the interaction might occur in the cytoplasm?</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Vibrator and PI4KIIIα Govern Neuroblast Polarity by Anchoring Non-muscle Myosin II&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Yukiko M Yamashita is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Clemens Cabernard (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is a revised manuscript of previously rejected manuscript by Wang and colleagues. The authors investigate the relationship between phosphatidylinositol lipids and asymmetric cell division. The authors show that loss of a phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP), called Vibrator, affects neuroblast polarity and Myosin localization. The authors propose that Vibrator is regulating asymmetric neuroblast divisions by anchoring non-muscle Myosin II's regulatory light chain (Spaghetti Squash in flies) to the neuroblast cortex through a direct interaction between Sqh and Vibrator. Finally, the authors propose that the PI4KIIIalpha, a PI4 kinase, essential for PI(4)P synthesis, is involved in anchoring Myosin to the neuroblast cortex, thereby regulating neuroblast polarity and asymmetric cell division.</p><p>Reviewers agreed that the manuscript has improved considerably over the last version and most of straightforward issues have been taken care of. With that said, they found that the major issues remained unresolved, making them 'cautiously supportive' of the publication. Consensus concern is that the phenotypes of <italic>vib</italic> mutant might not be explained by the model proposed by the authors, and uncertainties around their model must be resolved experimentally or by more cautious writing.</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>The pleiotrophy of the vib phenotype and its involvement in asymmetric cell division and neuroblast self-renewal remain unexplained. The newly added data only partially explain why <italic>vib</italic> mutant clones can both have ectopic neuroblasts but also lose neuroblasts, especially in light of the observed cellular phenotypes (see also below). Also, <italic>vib</italic> mutant's cytokinesis defect obscures the interpretation. We suggest to use the over-expression of Vib[T63E) in <italic>vib<sup>133/j5A6</sup> </italic>neuroblasts as the starting point. If Vib[T63E] indeed rescues the cytokinesis defect as they claimed, they should be able to more cleanly figure out the true polarity defects that lead to either ectopic neuroblasts or premature loss of neuroblasts in both type I and II lineages.</p><p>It is not entirely convincing that premature nuclear localization of Prospero is the cause of neuroblast loss in <italic>vib</italic> mutant clones. First, the level of nuclear Prospero shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>—figure complement 2B is so much lower than the Prospero+ cells in the same clone. Second, the authors acknowledged that type II neuroblasts do not express Prospero. These data strongly suggest that yet-to-be-identified factors contribute to premature differentiation of <italic>vib</italic> neuroblasts. If this is the case, the authors should openly acknowledge this possibility, and tone down their interpretation. Third, it seems that polarity is largely restored in telophase – which should actually be more carefully quantified and displayed in a main figure panel – and thus it is difficult to reconcile how neuroblast homeostasis is affected.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>The authors have tried to replace the word &quot;neuroblast overgrowth&quot; with &quot;ectopic neuroblasts&quot; but missed several. Please make the following corrections for consistency.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref> and the figure legend associated with it.</p><p>Introduction – The following statements should be modified: &quot;At telophase, nonmuscle Myosin II localizes to the cleavage furrow and regulates basal protein localization (Barros et al., 2003). &quot;The non-muscle myosin II regulatory light chain protein Spaghetti-squash (Sqh) regulates both asymmetric localization of basal cell fate determinants in neuroblasts and cytokinesis of dividing cells (Karess et al., 1991; Barros et al., 2003).&quot;</p><p>It is true that in sqh germ line clones, basal cell fate determinants are mislocalized. Similarly, the authors show here that both aPKC and Mira fail to localized to the apical and basal neuroblast cortex, respectively in sqh RNAi expressing neuroblasts. However, the authors should also state that Miranda's basal confinement is due aPKC mediated phosphorylation as shown by Atwood et al. Throughout the manuscript the authors should thus make a distinction between &quot;anchoring&quot; of polarity proteins to the cell cortex and &quot;asymmetric localization&quot; of the investigated polarity proteins. It seems to me, that the polarity proteins cannot be localized asymmetrically without the proper anchoring. Lack of Sqh and Vib seems to predominantly affect the anchoring but will not reveal new insight into the mechanism for polarized localization and subsequent asymmetric segregation of these proteins. Thus, the phenotype is more general and Vib and phosphatidolinositol lipids might not necessarily regulate asymmetric cell division specifically.</p><p>Considering recent publications (Roubinet, 2017; Montembault, 2017), the following statement should also be updated or changed: &quot;However, how myosin localization is regulated during asymmetric division remains unknown&quot;.</p><p>The authors claim that Vib is localized to the cell cortex with a basal enrichment. I am not convinced that the basal enrichment is specific for Vib; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> and E shows that Vib is also enriched on the apical side. It seems that Vib enrichment mostly occurs whenever other cells are in contact with the imaged neuroblast. In our experience, membrane markers tend to show basal enrichment due to GMCs clustered on the basal neuroblast side. Thus, if the authors want to show that basal enrichment is specific, they should generate primary neuroblast cultures expressing Vib::Venus of neuroblasts devoid of any attached GMCs.</p><p>The authors conclude that Vib is critical for asymmetric protein localization and segregation in dividing neuroblasts. I think this statement needs to be modified. I agree that the localization of polarity proteins is affected in metaphase. However, all provided images of the basal cell fate determinant Miranda show normal localization and segregation in telophase (despite some Mira signal on the spindle). Thus, I am confused why the authors conclude that Vib is critical for asymmetric protein segregation if Miranda and aPKC are normally localized in many <italic>vib</italic> mutant telophase neuroblasts.</p><p>The following statement &quot;the localization of Sqh::GFP at cleavage furrow was lost&quot; and the subsequent conclusions should be modified. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> shows that in <italic>vib</italic> mutant telophase neuroblasts, Sqh::GFP is still localized at the neuroblast cortex (especially with the 1105 allele) although a pronounced furrow enrichment is lacking. It seems as if the overall distribution of Sqh is changed compared to wild type. However, the provided image still shows it to be localized at the cell cortex.</p><p>I still don't understand the nature of vib133's pleiotropic phenotype. Vib133 mutant clones either show an increase in neuroblast number, lose neuroblasts and have cytokinesis defects.</p><p>I appreciate the new data showing that expression of Pros could lead to differentiation of <italic>vib</italic> mutant neuroblasts. However, how can that phenotype be explained considering the observed polarity defects? Loss of aPKC usually causes loss of neuroblasts and not an increase in Nb numbers. Similarly, I am unconvinced that the observed spindle orientation phenotype could result in ectopic neuroblasts; to this end, the authors should show telophase figures, demonstrating that misaligned metaphase spindles indeed give rise to symmetric neuroblast divisions, producing siblings with neuroblast fate. Given the relatively weak nature of the spindle orientation defects, I am not convinced that the authors could find this.</p><p>I am not an expert on the lipid strip assay, however, I feel that a positive control is missing in this experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>I am further confused by the role of PI(4)P in cortical Sqh localization. If PI(4)P is essential for cortical Sqh localization – which the authors claim is mostly lost in <italic>vib</italic> mutants – why is the localization of PI(4) in <italic>vib</italic> mutants only affected at the cleavage furrow in <italic>vib</italic> mutants? Overall, neuroblasts still contain robust PI(4)P localization in <italic>vib</italic> mutants. The same is also true for sqh mutants, which still contain robust levels of PI(4)P at the neuroblast membrane.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article &quot;Vibrator and PI4KIIIα Govern Neuroblast Polarity by Anchoring Non-muscle Myosin II&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

They show that Vib is required for apical localization of Par6 and aPKC, basal localization of Mira, Pros, and Numb (without affecting the localization of Baz, Insc, Pins). Vib is also required for spindle orientation of the neuroblast. They show that Vib regulates the localization of non-muscle myosin II, Sqh, which is known to regulate neuroblast polarity in embryonic neuroblasts.</p><p>This is a well-done study to show the role of PI4P and its regulators in the asymmetric division of the Drosophila neuroblast. The relationship between PIPs and cortical domain/polarity itself is not novel, but its involvement in the Drosophila neuroblast has not been shown (to my knowledge). Also, the authors provide thorough characterization of how PI4P regulation (via function of Vib) contributes to known mechanism(s) of neuroblast polarity. Although I'd like to see the comments from other reviewers (better experts in the field), I think this is a good paper and worth publishing in eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the review for her positive endorsement on our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Overall, the role and function of phosphatidolinositol lipids during asymmetric cell division and stem cell self-renewal would be of general interest. However, the connection between cortical Sqh localization, neuroblast polarity, spindle orientation and the reported neuroblast &quot;over-growth&quot; and homeostasis phenotypes remains unexplained. Both Vib and PI4KIIIalpha seem to compromise the localization of cortical Myosin but how cortical Myosin affects neuroblast polarity is underexplored in the manuscript by Koe et al. It seems to me that many of the reported neuroblast phenotypes cannot be understood without further exploring this connection. Also, since mutants, failing to localize Myosin to the cortex often do not enter anaphase, or are compromised in completing cytokinesis, I have difficulties to reconcile this observation with the here reported neuroblast phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the review for finding the topic of our study interesting and his constructive comments. In the revised manuscript, we provide new data showing that Sqh regulates PI(4)P localization on the plasma membrane in neuroblasts (subsection “Sqh binds to phosphoinositide PI(4)P and localizes it to cell cortex in neuroblasts”). We analysed the localization of PI(4)P-GFP in <italic>sqh1</italic> hemizygotes, a hypomorphic allele of Sqh that survived to the third instar larval stage. Remarkably, 23.3% of interphase neuroblasts (n=313) and 36.8% of metaphase neuroblasts (n=19) displayed distinct PI(4)P-GFP aggregates in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Knocking down <italic>sqh</italic> using <italic>insc</italic>-Gal4 also resulted in the formation of many distinct PI(4)P-GFP aggregates in interphase neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, 30%, n=40). Thus, Sqh likely regulates neuroblast polarity by facilitating the membrane localization of PI(4)P.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The authors report that vib133 type I and type II neuroblast MARCM clones show a neuroblast over-growth phenotype. What exactly is meant by this? Control clones usually contain 1 neuroblast/clone but vib133 clones seem to contain at least two neuroblasts in the pictures shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>. It seems to me that the term &quot;neuroblast over-growth&quot; does not apply here since it is more of a lack of differentiation phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s point is well taken. We have replaced the term of “neuroblast overgrowth” with “ectopic neuroblasts” throughout the manuscript to precisely describe the phenotype of <italic>vib</italic> mutant clones.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Based on clonal analysis, the authors conclude that Vib is required for neuroblast homeostasis in type I and II lineages. Since Vib has been shown to be involved in cytokinesis – a phenotype the authors have also observed – I wonder whether they don't over interpret their clonal analysis data. For instance, it is possible that cytokinesis failure could form two Dpn positive nuclei in the same cytoplasm. Their pictures do not necessarily rule out this possibility. This point must be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>In our analysis on neuroblast homeostasis in clones, neuroblasts with obvious cytokinesis defects (polyploidy cells) were excluded from our analysis. Neuroblasts with two (Dpn+) nuclei in the same cytoplasm were also excluded in our analysis. We only counted ectopic neuroblasts that were clearly separated cells based on CD8-GFP, which marked the outline of cells. We have updated our quantification methods in the revised manuscript (Discussion section). In addition, we have replaced the images that better represent our quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>vib<sup>1105</sup></italic>clone and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <italic>vib133</italic>).</p><p>In addition, we would like to point out that the expression of VibT63E::Venus rescued the cytokinesis defect in 98.7% of <italic>vib133</italic> clones (n=75), while excess neuroblasts persisted in these clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>; subsection “The lipid binding and transfer activity of Vib is critical for asymmetric division and homeostasis of neuroblasts”). This data suggests that ectopic neuroblasts observed in <italic>vib</italic> mutants are not due to cytokinesis failure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Vib133 mutant clones either show an increase in neuroblast number, show an apparent neuroblast overgrowth (see above), lose neuroblasts and also have cytokinesis defects. How do the authors reconcile all these clonal phenotypes with the polarity and spindle orientation defects?</p></disp-quote><p>Vib has a known function in cytokinesis, so it is not surprising to observe the cytokinesis defect in <italic>vib-</italic> neuroblasts. Besides cytokinesis defect, we report in this manuscript that <italic>vib133</italic> mutant also displayed phenotype of ectopic neuroblasts and loss of neuroblasts. We propose that the ectopic neuroblasts were due to a disruption of neuroblast polarity and spindle orientation defects. To explore the mechanism underlying loss of neuroblasts in <italic>vib</italic>mutants, we first examined cell death with active Caspase-3 staining and found that <italic>vib</italic>neuroblasts did not undergo cell death, similar to wild-type control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Next, we examined whether loss of neuroblasts was due to premature differentiation of neuroblasts. To this end, we examined the localization of Pros, a differentiation factor, in neuroblast lineages. Whereas none of type I neuroblast control clones had nuclear Pros expression (n=15), 66.7% of type I <italic>vib133</italic> neuroblast clones expressed nuclear Pros (n=12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Furthermore, we examined <italic>vib<sup>133/j5A6</sup> </italic>and <italic>vib<sup>133/j5A6</sup> </italic>trans-heterozygous neuroblasts. While none of control neuroblasts showed nuclear Pros expression (n=121), in <italic>vib<sup>133/j5A6</sup> </italic>and <italic>vib<sup>133/j5A6</sup> </italic>trans-heterozygotes brains, 50% (n=158) and 56.8% (n=243) of interphase neuroblasts exhibited nuclear Pros expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Therefore, loss of <italic>vib</italic> could disrupt Pros localization, resulting in earlier termination of proliferation as well as premature differentiation and hence loss of neuroblasts in some of the <italic>vib133</italic> mutants. We have included these results</p><p>in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, subsection “Vib controls homeostasis of larval central brain neuroblasts”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors claim that Vib::Venus is slightly enriched at the cleavage furrow in telophase neuroblasts. I suggest the authors support this claim with pixel intensity measurements since the provided images don't convince me that there is an increase at the furrow; Vib::Venus signal seems to be stronger also on the forming GMC cortex compared to the apical neuroblast cortex, which could mainly be due to cell-cell contacts.</p></disp-quote><p>To determine if Vib-Venus is enriched at the cleavage furrow, we measured the pixel intensity of Venus on the cell cortex of wild-type telophase neuroblasts and calculated the ratio of Vib-Venus intensity at the cleavage furrow to that at the apical cortex (termed VenusCF: VenusApical). Wild-type telophase neuroblasts had the average ratio of 1.33 (n=33) with 9% of telophase neuroblasts showed 2 times enrichment at the cleavage furrow. These data suggest that there is slight enrichment of Vib-Venus at the basal side and cleavage furrow of neuroblasts. We have included these results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E-F</xref>, subsection “Vib controls homeostasis of larval central brain neuroblasts”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) How do the authors explain the observed spindle orientation phenotype? Is Mud mislocalized in vib mutant neuroblasts? Did the authors consider spindle architecture (e.g loss or fewer astral MTs) or centrosomal defects?</p></disp-quote><p>We showed in our initial manuscript that Gαi was partially delocalized in <italic>vib-</italic> neuroblasts <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, C</xref>). This likely contributed to the spindle orientation phenotype in <italic>vib-</italic> mutants. We examined Mud localization in <italic>vib-</italic> metaphase neuroblasts and found that centrosomal Mud localization was largely unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>; 96.3%, n=27; Control, n=23). Unfortunately, the anti-Mud antibody we previously obtained from Dr. Fumio Matsuzaki was finished and the new aliquot obtained from his lab only decorated centrosomes but not apical cortex of neuroblasts. Thus, we were unable to directly determine whether the apical/cortical localization of Mud was delocalized in <italic>vib</italic>mutants. Nevertheless, given that Pins directly interacts with Mud and localizes Mud to apical/cortical neuroblasts (Bowman et al., 2006; Izumi et al., 2006; Siller et al., 2006) and that Pins is predominantly apically localized in <italic>vib</italic> loss-of-function mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), apical/cortical localization of Mud is unlikely to be disrupted in <italic>vib</italic>neuroblasts. Centrosomes in <italic>vib-</italic> neuroblasts were unaffected, as Cnn localization is normal in both control (n=24) and <italic>vib<sup>133/j5A6</sup> </italic>neuroblasts (n=47) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Likewise, the spindle architecture is unaffected in <italic>vib<sup>133/j5A6</sup> </italic>neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>; n=43; Control, n=25). They were able to assemble normal-looking mitotic spindle and astral microtubules that were labeled by α-tubulin. Taken together, GαI delocalization, but not spindle architecture or centrosomal defects, most likely caused the spindle orientation defects observed in <italic>vib</italic> mutants. We have included these results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E-G</xref>, subsection “Vib is important for apical-basal polarity and spindle orientation in neuroblasts”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The reference (Cabernard et al., 2010) should not be used in the context of Sqh::GFP restriction at the cleavage furrow in neuroblasts; Barros et al., reported the localization of Sqh::GFP before the cited study already.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors conclude that Vib is required for the localization of phosphorylated Sqh to the cell cortex. This conclusion is derived from the observation that Sqh1P staining in vib mutant neuroblasts is predominantly cytoplasmic. However, whether this cytoplasmic signal indeed corresponds to phosphorylated but mislocalized Sqh is unclear. Alternatively, it could simply be background signal. Thus, the alternative hypothesis that Vib is necessary for the correct localization and activation of Drosophila Rho kinase (Rock) should be tested.</p></disp-quote><p>(Rok) that phosphorylates and activates Sqh, we first determined the localization of Rok-GFP in <italic>vib</italic> mutant neuroblasts. In controls (Ubi-Rok-GFP heterozygous), neuroblasts expressed cortical Rok-GFP at metaphase (93.5%, n=46) and showed enriched Rok-GFP at the cleavage furrow at telophase (91.7%, n=24). Similarly, in <italic>vib<sup>133/j5A6</sup> </italic>we observed cortical Rok-GFP localization in 91.6% of metaphase neuroblasts (n=24) and 85.7% of telophase neuroblasts showed enriched Rok-GFP at the cleavage furrow (n=14) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>, subsection “Vib anchors non-muscle myosin II regulatory light chain Spaghetti-squash (Sqh) to the cell cortex in neuroblasts”). This result suggests that Vib is not essential for Rok localization in neuroblasts.</p><p>Next, we explored whether increase Rok activity could rescue the asymmetric cell division defects observed in <italic>vib</italic> mutant. We overexpressed the catalytic domain of Rok (Rok-CAT), a previously characterized transgene (Winter et al., 2001) could rescue Mira delocalization in <italic>vib<sup>133/j5A6</sup></italic>. Expression of RokCAT in wild type neuroblasts had no influence on Mira localization in neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E; n</xref>=27 for metaphase; n=13 for telophase). We found that ectopic expression of the RokCAT in <italic>vib<sup>133/j5A6</sup> </italic>did not significantly rescue Mira delocalization in neuroblasts (metaphase, 85.7%, n=42; telophase, 83.3%, n=12), rather showing similar Mira delocalization to <italic>vib<sup>133/j5A6</sup> </italic>neuroblasts (metaphase, 90.2%, n=34; telophase, 84.6%, n=26). These observations suggested that Vib regulates Sqh localization unlikely via localizing/activating Rok. We have included these new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D-E</xref> and subsection “Vib anchors non-muscle myosin II regulatory light chain Spaghetti-squash (Sqh) to the cell cortex in neuroblasts”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors provide evidence that lipid binding and transfer activity is critical for neuroblast polarity and asymmetric cell division. However, given the previous Myosin localization data, the authors should test how this relates to Myosin localization. In other words, how is Sqh::GFP and Sqh1P localized when lipid binding and/or transfer activity are abolished.</p></disp-quote><p>To test if the lipid transfer activity of Vib is crucial for the localization of Sqh, we first examined the localization of Sqh in <italic>vib<sup>133/j5A6</sup> </italic>transheterozygotes expressing either VibT63A or VibT63E. In wild-type controls, 81.3% (n=32) of metaphase neuroblasts exhibited cortical Sqh localization and 84.6% (n=13) of telophase neuroblasts enriched Sqh at the cleavage furrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). Expression of either VibT63A::Venus (metaphase, n=37; telophase, n=19) or VibT63E::Venus (metaphase, n=36; telophase, n=20) in wild-type controls had no significant effect on Sqh localization in neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). Consistent with earlier observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), 82.9% (n=41) of <italic>vib<sup>133/j5A6</sup> </italic>metaphase neuroblasts showed cytoplasmic Sqh localization and 64.3% of telophase neuroblasts (n=14) failed to enrich Sqh at the cleavage furrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>).

In wild-type controls, 88.5% (n=87) of metaphase neuroblasts exhibited cortical Sqh1P localization and 91.2% (n=34) of telophase neuroblasts showed localization of Sqh1P at the cleavage furrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>). Sqh1P localization in wild-type neuroblasts expressing VibT63A::Venus (metaphase, n=54; telophase, n=22) or VibT63E::Venus (metaphase, n=45; telophase, n=21) was similar to that of wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>;</p><p>quantifications are in figure legends). By contrast, 82.3% of <italic>vib<sup>133/j5A6</sup> </italic>metaphase neuroblasts (n=62) showed cytoplasmic Sqh1P localization and 50% of telophase neuroblasts (n=20) failed to enrich Sqh1P at the cleavage furrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>). Similar to Sqh1P delocalization in <italic>vib<sup>133/j5A6</sup> </italic>mitotic neuroblasts, 80% (n=65) of <italic>vib<sup>133/j5A6</sup> </italic>metaphase neuroblasts with VibT63A::Venus were cytoplasmic and only 45% (n=20) of telophase neuroblasts were localized at the cleavage furrow.

In the absence of either vib or PI4KIIIα function, Sqh fails to properly localize to the cortex leading to defects in the establishment of cortical cell polarity in mitotic neuroblasts. While telophase rescue restores asymmetric localization of apical proteins, basal proteins fail to re-localize to the budding daughter, resulting in ectopic neuroblast formation. The discovery made in this study is potentially interesting but seems to just begin to unravel the insight into how specific lipid modifications can exert a regulatory role in controlling cortical cell polarity. Furthermore, some of the phenotypes shown in the mutant analyses appear to be extremely muddy, and it remains difficult for me to reconcile the reported polarity defects and the outcome of asymmetric neuroblast division. The wide spectrum of polarity defects exhibited by the vib or PI4KIIIα mutant neuroblasts potentially suggest that there are multiple additional downstream defects in addition to mis-regulation of apical-basal protein localization. As such, I am reluctant to support the publication of this study at its current state.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for considering our work interesting and his/her constructive comments.

For example, the vib<sup>13 3</sup>type II neuroblasts shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> appears to significantly smaller than vib<sup>133</sup> type II neuroblasts shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>. Why are these mutant neuroblasts so much smaller than wild-type neuroblasts? Does Vib play a role in regulating cell size? In addition, the morphology of the vib<sup>133</sup> type II neuroblasts shown in the second column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref> appear to suggest that they might be polyploidy. Does Vib play a role in regulating cell division?</p></disp-quote><p>We measured the diameter of <italic>vib<sup>133</sup></italic> neuroblasts and found that some but not all of mutant neuroblasts showed reduced cell diameter. The average size of <italic>vib<sup>133</sup> </italic>neuroblasts (7.76μm, n=27) is smaller than neuroblasts from control MARCM clones (10.79μm, n=37) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1figure supplement 2D</xref>). We have replaced the image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> with a more representative image to show the reduced neuroblast size. Next, to investigate whether Vib plays a role in regulating cell size, we measured the ratio of nucleolar to nuclear size in neuroblasts, which is an indicator of cellular growth. With nucleolus: nucleus ratio in wild-type control neuroblasts normalized as 1 (n=29), the ratio in <italic>vib<sup>133</sup></italic> neuroblasts was reduced slightly to 0.81 (n=28) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>, subsection “Vib controls homeostasis of larval central brain neuroblasts”). This result suggests that cell growth in <italic>vib<sup>-</sup></italic> mutant neuroblast is mildly reduced. The reduced neuroblast size in some of the neuroblasts may be due to the nuclear localization of Pros (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B, C</xref> subsection “Vib controls homeostasis of larval central brain neuroblasts”), resulting in earlier termination of proliferation and premature differentiation.</p><p>Vib has a known role in regulating cell division, in particular cytokinesis (Gatt and Glover, 2006; Giansanti et al., 2006). We also observed cytokinesis defects in neuroblasts and showed the polyploidy cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref> to faithfully document the phenotypes. Interestingly, VibT63E, with deficient π binding and transfer activity but retain sufficient PC binding and transfer activity, almost completely rescued cytokinesis defects observed in <italic>vib</italic> mutants, but failed to rescue asymmetric division defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>; subsection “The lipid binding and transfer activity of Vib is critical for asymmetric division and homeostasis of neuroblasts”).

My understanding of this system is that loss of basal proteins such as Numb and Brat always leads to ectopic neuroblasts.</p></disp-quote><p>To explore the mechanism underlying loss of neuroblasts in <italic>vib<sup>-</sup></italic> mutants, we first examined cell death of neuroblasts by labelling active Caspase-3 and found that neuroblasts in <italic>vib<sup>-</sup></italic> mutants were not undergoing cell death, similar to wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Next, we examined whether loss of neuroblasts was due to premature differentiation of neuroblasts. To this end, we examined the nuclear localization of Pros, a differentiation factor, in neuroblasts. Because type II neuroblast do not express Pros, we focused our analysis on type I neuroblasts. Whereas none of type I neuroblast control clones had nuclear Pros (n=15), 66.7% of type I <italic>vib<sup>133</sup></italic> neuroblast clones expressed nuclear Pros (n=12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

Similarly, the authors show here that both aPKC and Mira fail to localized to the apical and basal neuroblast cortex, respectively in sqh RNAi expressing neuroblasts.

Loss of aPKC usually causes loss of neuroblasts and not an increase in Nb numbers.</p></disp-quote><p>The ectopic neuroblast phenotype in <italic>vib<sup>-</sup></italic> brains is likely caused by the mislocalization of multiple basal proteins (including cell fate determinants) Mira, Pros and Brat on the spindle as well as spindle misorientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B, C</xref>; subsection “Vib is required for asymmetric division of neuroblasts”).

If PI(4)P is essential for cortical Sqh localization – which the authors claim is mostly lost in vib mutants – why is the localization of PI(4) in vib mutants only affected at the cleavage furrow in vib mutants? Overall, neuroblasts still contain robust PI(4)P localization in vib mutants. The same is also true for sqh mutants, which still contain robust levels of PI(4)P at the neuroblast membrane.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer seems to be confused about the reciprocal regulations between Vib/Sqh and PI(4)P in neuroblasts. We conclude that both Vib and PI4KIIIα anchor Sqh to the neuroblast cortex, because Sqh cortical localization is compromised upon loss of Vib or PI4KIIIα <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B-E</xref>). Given that Vib transfers π to PI4KIIIα for the synthesis of PI(4)P and the binding of Sqh with PI(4)P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), PI(4)P is likely required for the anchoring of Sqh on neuroblast cortex. On the flip side, we also found that both Vib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B-C</xref>) and Sqh facilitate the membrane localization of PI(4)P, as cytoplasmic aggregates of PI(4)P-GFP were observed in neuroblasts upon depletion of <italic>vib</italic> or <italic>sqh</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B-C, E-F</xref>). Since PI(4)P was still observed on the plasma membrane, in addition to the cytoplasmic aggregates, in <italic>vib<sup>-</sup> </italic>and <italic>sqh<sup>-</sup></italic> mutant neuroblasts, we conclude that both Vib and Sqh facilitate the membrane localization of PI(4)P in neuroblasts (subsection “Sqh binds to phosphoinositide PI(4)P and localizes it to cell cortex in neuroblasts”).</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All reviewers have agreed that your work provides important new insights into asymmetric division of the Drosophila neuroblasts and thus merits publication in eLife.</p><p>However, before we can formally accept your paper, we would like you to make following textual edits.

Thus, as of now, this explanation is hand-waving. Although the authors do not need to add more experiments and quantification (unless it is easily possible by analyzing existing data), the authors should acknowledge this shortcoming in interpreting their data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified our statement to “Given that Mira/Pros/Brat was still observed at the basal side of the cortex, it is unclear whether the formation of ectopic neuroblasts is partially contributed by the reduced amount of basal determinants eventually segregated into basal daughter cell due to their mislocalization on the spindle.” (subsection “Vib is required for asymmetric division of neuroblasts”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Also, now that the authors do not claim that Vib is concentrated on basal side and state that Vib is (early) evenly cortical, it clearly leaves the readers wondering what Vib might be doing at the apical side. The reviewer acknowledges that testing 'localization-specific function' is difficult for anybody to do, and do not ask the authors to conduct such experiments: however, again, the authors should more carefully discuss about this, and at least propose possible models.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the following statement in the Discussion section “In addition, Vib’s localization in neuroblast cortex lacks apparent asymmetry, while it is required for the asymmetric localization of apical proteins aPKC and Par-6, but not Baz.
