differentiation inducing signals. It has recently been proposed that such heterogeneity exists during normal embryonic development to allow position independent patterning based on ‘salt and pepper’ differentiation and sorting out. However, the molecular basis of lineage priming and how it leads to reproducible cell type proportioning are poorly understood. To address this, we employed a novel forward genetic approach in the model organism <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>. These studies reveal that the Ras-GTPase regulator <italic>gefE</italic> is required for normal lineage priming and salt and pepper differentiation. This is because Ras-GTPase activity sets the intrinsic response threshold to lineage specific differentiation signals. Importantly, we show that although <italic>gefE</italic> expression is uniform, transcription of its target, <italic>rasD</italic>, is both heterogeneous and dynamic, thus providing a novel mechanism for heterogeneity generation and position-independent differentiation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01067.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01067.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01067.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>How genetically identical cells develop into distinct cell types is one of the fundamental questions in biology. Certain molecules are known to act as signals that tell progenitor cells what type of cell they should become. The position of a cell within an embryo can determine which of these signals it is exposed to and thus influence its fate. However, it is also possible for a group of cells to be exposed to the same signal, but for only a few to respond. This gives rise to ‘salt and pepper’ differentiation—in which the cells differentiate in an apparently random manner to produce a mixture of different cell types—but the molecular basis of this phenomenon is unclear.</p><p>An organism called <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>, commonly known as slime mould, is often used to study these processes. <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> has an unusual life cycle; existing as individual cells when its bacterial food source is plentiful, with the cells coming together when food is scarce to form a multicellular slug that can move around. Cells within the slug turn into spores or into stalk cells, which lift the spores above the ground so that they can disperse. Under the right conditions, a single cell hatches from each spore; upon finding a new food source, this cell begins dividing thus allowing the life cycle to begin again.</p><p>The formation of stalk and spore cells occurs in a ‘salt and pepper’ pattern. A chemical messenger called DIF triggers cells to become stalk cells irrespective of their position within the aggregated mass of cells. Now, Chattwood et al. have shown that this process depends on the activity of two proteins; GefE and its substrate RasD. Surprisingly, both proteins are expressed many hours before cells differentiate, when cells are still well fed and dividing. Although GefE is uniformly expressed in these cells, its substrate—a protein called RasD—is expressed in only a subset of cells, and it is these cells that will later respond to DIF and ultimately become stalk cells.</p><p>The variable expression of RasD explains how ‘salt and pepper’ patterning arises following uniform exposure of apparently identical cells to DIF. It is likely that similar mechanisms have been conserved in higher organisms, so these findings could lead to a better understanding of how progenitor cells develop into specific cell types in multicellular plants and animals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01067.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01067.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>cell fate choice</kwd><kwd>lineage priming</kwd><kwd>salt and pepper differentiation</kwd><kwd>heterogeneous</kwd><kwd>Ras</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Dictyostelium</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>095643/Z/11/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nagayama</surname><given-names>Koki</given-names></name><name><surname>Harkin</surname><given-names>Lauren</given-names></name><name><surname>Kamjoo</surname><given-names>Marzieh</given-names></name><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>Christopher RL</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chattwood</surname><given-names>Alex</given-names></name><name><surname>Nagayama</surname><given-names>Koki</given-names></name><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>Christopher RL</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Natural Environment Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NE/H020322/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kamjoo</surname><given-names>Marzieh</given-names></name><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>Christopher RL</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Royal Society Wolfson Merit</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WM120109</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>Christopher RL</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0900069</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>Christopher RL</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The probability of a cellular response to a differentiation inducing signal is correlated with the dynamic expression of a Ras protein, and produces a ‘salt and pepper’ pattern of cell differentiation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multicellular development requires the stereotypical and robust restriction of pluripotent cells to specific lineages. In many cases, this is dependent on positional information, where the relative position of a cell within the embryo determines the nature or amount of instructive differentiation signals received. However, there are also a growing number of examples of position independent patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kay and Thompson, 2009</xref>). In these, different cell types firstly arise scattered in a ‘salt and pepper’ fashion before sorting out. To understand this mechanism, it will be important to understand why some cells differentiate, whereas neighboring cells within the same environment do not. One possible clue comes from cell culture studies that have revealed that genetically identical populations of cells exhibit heterogeneous behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chambers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2009</xref>). When these cells receive identical doses of defined differentiation inducing signals, only a small fraction of ‘lineage primed’ cells actually respond. In this scenario, a higher inducer concentration increases the number of responding cells without affecting the magnitude of the response of individual cells. This suggests that cells exhibit different intrinsic response biases or discrete transcriptional activation thresholds to signals.</p><p>There is now evidence to support the idea that the mechanisms underlying heterogeneous responses observed in cell culture could in fact regulate differentiation and developmental patterning in multicellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaern et al., 2005</xref>). For example, in one of the earliest lineage choices made during mouse embryogenesis, cells of the inner cell mass (ICM) adopt either primitive endoderm (PrE) or epiblast (EPI) fates. This occurs in a position independent fashion with ICM cells exhibiting seemingly stochastic expression of PrE and EPI markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dietrich and Hiiragi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Plusa et al., 2008</xref>). It has been proposed that heterogeneity in responsiveness to differentiation inducing signals, such as the PrE inducer FGF, underlies this salt and pepper differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yamanaka et al., 2010</xref>). Crucially, in this model, it is not necessary for cells to receive different levels of FGF, only that they exhibit heterogeneity in their response thresholds to the signal. Finally, following this period of ‘symmetry breaking’, coherent tissues can emerge due to a process of sorting out. Sorting is likely caused by differential gene expression resulting in differential cell motility, which can be driven by chemotaxis or differential cell adhesion (with the elimination of misplaced cells also possible).</p><p>Pattern formation based on stochastic salt and pepper differentiation and sorting out is likely to be a fundamental and deeply conserved developmental patterning mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kay and Thompson, 2009</xref>). However, our knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanism, as to how heterogeneity affects responsiveness to differentiation signals, is still in its infancy. One route to understanding this phenomenon comes from the finding that initial cell fate choice and pattern formation in <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>, a genetically and biochemically tractable organism with a small number of easily recognizable cell types, is based on this mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thompson et al., 2004b</xref>). Upon starvation, <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells enter a developmental cycle that begins with the aggregation of several thousand cells to make a multicellular mound. Within the mound, cells differentiate intermingled into prestalk or prespore cells. After sorting out, the different cell types are organized into discrete tissues in the migratory slug. Prestalk cells occupy the anterior 25% of the slug, with anterior like cells also found scattered within the prespore zone. Upon culmination, prestalk cells undergo extensive rearrangements to populate distinct parts of the fruiting body, including the stalk and basal disc, as well as ancillary spore head supporting structures known as the upper and lower cup. Prestalk cells can further be subdivided into several major subtypes (pstA, pstO and pstB). Each cell type is defined largely by the pattern of expression of the classical prestalk specific transcripts <italic>ecmA</italic> and <italic>ecmB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jermyn et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Williams et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jermyn and Williams, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Early et al., 1993</xref>), and by their position in the migratory slug and final fruiting body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>There is now good evidence to suggest that heterogeneities during growth of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, such as nutritional status or cell cycle position, affect developmental fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leach et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gomer and Firtel, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thompson and Kay, 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chattwood and Thompson, 2011</xref>). Firstly, cells grown without glucose preferentially become stalk cells when mixed in chimeric development with glucose grown cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leach et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Noce and Takeuchi, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blaschke et al., 1986</xref>). Importantly, when cells from different growth conditions are compared, a hierarchy of biases results, where cells can be ‘stalky’ in one mixture but ‘sporey’ in another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leach et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thompson and Kay, 2000a</xref>). Therefore, growth history does not commit a cell to a given fate, but is instead context dependent and relative to the growth history of the entire population. Secondly, biases established during growth have been shown to affect the sensitivity of cells to differentiation signals experienced during development, such as the chlorinated alkyl phenone DIF-1 (hereafter termed DIF), which is primarily required for pstB cell differentiation, with a more minor role in pstO cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thompson and Kay, 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thompson et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhukovskaya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Keller and Thompson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saito et al., 2008</xref>). For example, ‘stalky’ biased cells are more sensitive to DIF in monolayer culture assays than ‘sporey’ biased cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thompson and Kay, 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kubohara et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, immediate-early gene responses to DIF exhibit all-or-none behavior, leading to population level heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stevense et al., 2010</xref>). This provides a basis for salt and pepper differentiation in vivo, where it is presumed all cells experience similar DIF concentrations.</p><p>From these studies it is clear that in order to understand patterning by salt and pepper differentiation followed by sorting, it will first be important to understand why some cells respond to differentiation inducing signals whereas others do not. To address this, we have used a novel genetic approach to identify genes involved in lineage priming. Here we describe the characterization of one such gene, <italic>gefE</italic>, and show that its expression during growth is specifically required to determine the number of cells that respond to DIF, both in cell culture and in vivo. Finally, we show that although expression of <italic>gefE</italic> itself is not heterogeneous during growth, expression of its target, <italic>rasD</italic>, is both heterogeneous and dynamic. These studies thus establish how salt and pepper differentiation in response to a uniform diffusible signal can be achieved through the stochastic expression of a Ras gene, the activity of which in turn is dependent on a ubiquitously expressed regulatory Gef. These studies therefore provide key insights into the basis of gene regulatory networks that can underpin patterning during a poorly understood but fundamental mode of pattern formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A genetic screen for modulators of lineage bias</title><p>The nutritional conditions under which cells are grown have previously been shown to bias lineage choice during <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leach et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thompson and Kay, 2000a</xref>). Consistent with these observations, we find that cells grown in the absence of glucose (G−) produce significantly fewer spores than cells grown in the presence of glucose (G+) when developed together in chimera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Importantly, our analysis of the patterning of cell types at the slug and fruiting body stages reveals that this is because G− cells are biased towards the DIF dependent pstO and pstB lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Each replicate pool was then grown separately in G− medium and developed in chimera with G+ wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). After each round of development, chimeric spore heads were transferred into growth medium containing blasticidin, thus killing all wild type cells and only allowing mutant spores to grow. This provides a selective pressure to enrich for mutants that adopt the spore cell fate. The selection was repeated on each pool for seven rounds. The success of the selection was assessed qualitatively by examining the distribution of mutant and wild type cells in chimeric slugs. As expected, in initial rounds, G− grown mutant cells were enriched in the pstO and pstB populations. However, in later rounds the distribution of mutant cells changed with a clear enrichment within the prespore zone, suggesting that mutants defective in bias imposed by G− growth were becoming enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>).</p><p>Inverse PCR revealed the pool of cells in later rounds of each pool selection to be largely composed of clones in which the REMI plasmid had integrated into a small 5′ 42 bp exon within the <italic>gefE</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). In one pool, <italic>gefE</italic> mutant cells were enriched by round 2, whereas in the second it was only strongly enriched by round 6. These differences could be due to the effects of random genetic drift caused by harvesting a finite number of spores after each round. Alternatively, it has recently been shown that when multiple clones are hatched and grown on bacteria, small differences in growth rate at the feeding edge can be amplified, leading to overrepresentation of some clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buttery et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We next performed a reconstruction experiment to verify that enrichment of <italic>gefE</italic><sup>−</sup> mutant cells was due to being overrepresented in the spore population, rather than the mutation simply conferring advantages during other stages of the selection process. For this, because the catalytic domain of GefE is encoded by the larger 3′ exon, we generated a mutant allele in which the catalytic domain was deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). For all subsequent studies, the catalytic domain disruption allele was used, but because both mutants exhibit identical phenotypes, both likely represent null alleles. Reconstruction experiments revealed no difference in the rate of growth of <italic>gefE</italic><sup>−</sup> mutant cells in either G+ or G− medium, although <italic>gefE</italic><sup>−</sup> mutant spores did, however, hatch at a faster rate than wild type spores, perhaps helping to explain the unexpectedly strong enrichment for this mutant within the pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3C,D</xref>). Most importantly, when wild type or <italic>gefE</italic><sup>−</sup> mutant G− grown cells were developed in chimera with G+ wild type cells, mutant G− cells were significantly overrepresented in the spore population of chimeric fruiting bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, p&lt;0.04), thus providing a simple explanation for the enrichment of this mutant in the genetic selection. This is because mutant G− cells do not show the strong overrepresentation in the collar and back populations of chimeric slugs seen when wild type G− cells are mixed with wild type G+ grown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>gefE</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup> mutant cells avoid DIF dependent prestalk cell fates</title><p>Growth in the absence of glucose specifically biases cells towards DIF dependent prestalk lineages.

A lineage bias gene is one that is not required for cell fate commitment per se, but required for the <italic>relative</italic> probability of commitment to one fate over another. If the <italic>gefE</italic> gene is involved in lineage priming rather than commitment, an effect on development will not be observed if all cells in the population have the same bias (e.g., normal clonal development). We therefore examined cell fate choice and patterning of the <italic>gefE</italic><sup>−</sup> mutant during clonal development, with all cells grown under identical conditions. Clonal development was found to be morphologically identical to that of the wild type. Furthermore, the number of prespore cells in <italic>gefE</italic><sup>−</sup> mutant slugs was found to be the same as that observed in wild type slugs, and the total number of spores produced in terminal fruiting bodies was the same for the <italic>gefE</italic><sup>−</sup> mutant as for the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). There was also no defect in prestalk cell specific gene expression in slugs or fruiting bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The only difference between the clonal development of the <italic>gefE</italic><sup>−</sup> cells and the wild type was a slight, although reproducible, delay in the initiation of aggregation (data not shown). These results are, therefore, consistent with the <italic>gefE</italic> gene being involved in lineage priming rather than lineage commitment. Furthermore, if the <italic>gefE</italic> gene is involved in lineage priming, rather than commitment, then the bias of the <italic>gefE</italic><sup>−</sup> cells to avoid a DIF dependent fate, that is observed when they are mixed with wild type cells, should be reversed when they are mixed with cells of a stronger bias. Consistent with this idea, the lineage bias of the <italic>gefE</italic><sup>−</sup> mutant cells was found to be dependent on the growth history of the partner genotype. For example, <italic>gefE</italic><sup>−</sup> mutant cells were strongly biased <italic>towards</italic> DIF dependent fates when grown in the G− medium and then mixed with mutant cells grown in G+ medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Therefore, we next tested whether <italic>gefE</italic><sup>−</sup> mutant cells also exhibit differences in DIF responsiveness when compared to wild type cells. We found that <italic>gefE</italic><sup>−</sup> mutant cells make fewer stalk cells than wild type across a 1000-fold range of DIF concentrations in the cAMP removal monolayer assay but exhibit similar sensitivity to changes in DIF concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Importantly, growth in the absence of glucose results in a similar increase in DIF sensitivity in both wild type and mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), thus suggesting that GefE is only required to set basal levels of DIF sensitivity. Similar results were seen when the effect of <italic>gefE</italic> disruption was observed on the expression of primary DIF target genes. In the first experiment, cells were transformed with <italic>ecmAO:lacZ</italic> or <italic>ecmB:lacZ</italic> reporter genes. DIF induced gene expression of these reporters was reduced in the <italic>gefE</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup> mutant compared to wild type at all DIF concentrations, but showed a similar sensitivity to changes in DIF concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

GATAc is a transcription factor that translocates to the nucleus minutes after DIF stimulation and is specifically required for DIF dependent pstB cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Keller and Thompson, 2008</xref>). In <italic>gefE</italic><sup>−</sup> mutant cells basal levels of nuclear GATAc were similar to wild type.

To test this idea further, we developed a novel FACS based approach that permits <italic>ecmA</italic> expression levels to be measured in individual wild type or <italic>gefE</italic><sup>−</sup> mutant cells in response to DIF. For this we replaced the endogenous copy of the <italic>ecmA</italic> gene with GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), and showed that GFP was expressed from the <italic>ecmA</italic> promoter in the same localization in slugs and fruiting bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) as has been previously described for <italic>ecmA</italic>-LacZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jermyn and Williams, 1991</xref>).

As <italic>gefE</italic> is predicted to encode a RasGEF, whose primary function is to activate Ras proteins by catalyzing the exchange of GDP for GTP, it therefore seemed likely that GefE would exert its effects on DIF dependent lineage bias through Ras regulation. Although the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> genome encodes 11 Ras proteins, only one, RasD, exhibits strong developmental expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reymond et al., 1984</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the level of both RasD expression and GTP bound activated RasD are significantly higher in cells grown in the absence of glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Finally, GefE and RasD mutant cells have previously been shown to exhibit identical slug phototaxis defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wilkins et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">2005</xref>), raising the possibility that RasD could be a target for GefE. To test this idea directly, we firstly compared the relative levels of RasD-GTP in wild type and mutant cells by Western blot, using a pull down assay and a specific antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wilkins et al., 2000</xref>). In 12 hr developed cells, the level of activated RasD was significantly lower in <italic>gefE</italic><sup>−</sup> mutant cells, although there was no difference in the total level of the RasD protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In addition, there was no corresponding decrease in the levels of activated RasG, RasB, RasC or Rap1 (data not shown). These results suggest that GefE is the predominant activator of RasD and is specific for RasD. We therefore next tested whether <italic>rasD</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup> and <italic>gefE</italic><sup>−</sup> mutants exhibit similar cell fate choice phenotypes. When labelled wild type cells were mixed with <italic>rasD</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup> mutant cells, the labelled cells accumulated in the pstO and pstB populations and were underrepresented in the prespore population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Firstly, we found that growth of cells in G− medium (conditions that increase the likelihood of DIF dependent lineage choice) resulted in a significant increase in the number of <italic>rasD:RFP</italic> expressing cells (73 ± 3% to 89 ± 5%) whereas no change was observed in <italic>gefE:RFP</italic> expressing cells. Secondly, growing <italic>rasD:RFP</italic> expressing cells were sorted by FACS based on their fluorescence and developed in chimera with wild type cells. Cells expressing lower levels of RasD were found to be less likely to differentiate as prestalk cells than prespore cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Surprisingly, however, cells expressing high <italic>rasD</italic> transcript levels can form both prespore and prestalk cells, as evidenced by their random distribution at both slug and culminant stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). So, while there is an increased likelihood that high RasD cells will become prestalk cells compared to low RasD cells, they do not sort to pstO and pstB regions as might be expected. One likely explanation for this discrepancy is that the stability of the RFP protein may be different to endogenous RasD. For example, if RasD protein has a shorter half-life than RFP, then cells expressing RFP may no longer express RasD. These cells would thus not exhibit the expected prestalk bias and could differentiate as prespore cells.</p><p>Population heterogeneity in gene expression, such as that observed for <italic>rasD</italic> expression, can be achieved if gene expression fluctuates stochastically or in response to other intrinsic or extrinsic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Raj and van Oudenaarden, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eldar and Elowitz, 2010</xref>). This often leads to the establishment of a dynamic equilibrium that allows populations to return to normal after perturbation or respond appropriately to environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eldar and Elowitz, 2010</xref>). In order to test whether RasD behaves in this fashion, <italic>rasD</italic> high or <italic>rasD</italic> low expressing cells were purified by FACS and then regrown in culture. Each population quickly returned to its pre-sorted equilibrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). It is interesting to note, however, that the low RasD expressing population exhibits slightly faster dynamics than the high RasD expressing population, thus supporting the idea that chimeric behavior may be affected by differences in RasD transcription/translation and RFP stability. Together these findings suggest that population heterogeneity is generated by dynamic <italic>rasD</italic> expression in vegetative cells and that extrinsic factors such as nutritional history affect the position of this dynamic equilibrium.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The molecular mechanisms and gene regulatory networks controlling cell fate bias and lineage priming remain largely unknown. Our work, which identifies two bias genes, <italic>gefE</italic> and <italic>rasD</italic>, in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> offers some insight. We find that transcription of <italic>rasD</italic> is heterogeneous in growing cells, whilst its activity is controlled by a ubiquitously expressed RasGEF, <italic>gefE</italic>. Expression of GefE is required to activate RasD in a subset of cells, which in turn sets the threshold at which these cells respond to the pstB/pstO differentiation inducer DIF.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ras signaling and cell fate bias</title><p>Studies on the possible role played by <italic>ras</italic> genes in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> development have not been conclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chubb and Insall, 2001</xref>). Initial studies carried out in cell lines expressing constitutively activated Ras(G12T) suggested Ras signaling played a key role in prestalk cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jaffer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jaffer et al., 2001</xref>). When these cells were developed in chimera with wild type cells, they were shown to occupy the collar and back of slugs, consistent with our present findings using RasD(G12T) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). However, disruption of the gene encoding RasD, the major developmentally expressed Ras protein, was reported not to affect cell fate specification during clonal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wilkins et al., 2000</xref>). This led to the suggestion that observations with constitutively activated Ras could be an artifact or that lack of RasD could be compensated by upregulation of other Ras genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wilkins et al., 2000</xref>). We found that there was indeed compensatory upregulation of the highly related RasG protein during development in both <italic>rasD</italic><sup>−</sup> and <italic>gefE</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup> mutant backgrounds (data not shown) but that this did not affect lineage bias in chimeras with wild type cells. This suggests that GefE-mediated activation of RasD is uniquely important to confer lineage bias in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>. Such bias can be viewed as giving some cells either a head start or handicap in a ‘race’ to adopt fates. Only a limited number of ‘winning’ cells will differentiate before feedback mechanisms restrict other cells from adopting this fate, a process akin to lateral inhibition. Indeed, an analogous form of cell competition has been observed during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development when a clone of slow growing mutant cells is surrounded by wild type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Levayer and Moreno, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vincent et al., 2013</xref>). In this case, slow growing mutant cells are often eliminated by the faster growing wild type cells, which overgrow and compensate for their absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Simpson and Morata, 1981</xref>). Like cell fate bias, cell competition is thus based on measurements of relative fitness between neighboring cells. Consequently, disruption of competition or bias genes only results in subtle defects during when all developing cells are the same genotype, such as a delay in the timing of cell fate determination.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Heterogeneous Ras activation</title><p>Ras signaling has been the subject of intense study, with upstream and downstream components of Ras signaling pathways now well defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Karnoub and Weinberg, 2008</xref>). However, we have less knowledge as to the possible importance of Ras regulation by transcriptional or post-translational control. Our studies using a reporter gene in which the <italic>rasD</italic> promoter drives RFP expression, reveals heterogeneous transcriptional activation of a <italic>ras</italic> gene within a population of growing <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells. Furthermore, this proportion increases when cells are transferred into medium lacking glucose. This indicates that there is a stochastic component to <italic>rasD</italic> gene expression that is influenced by external factors. In addition, when high or low <italic>rasD</italic> expressing cell populations are separated by FACS, they return to the pre-sorting equilibrium after a short period of growth. This suggests that cells freely transition between high and low <italic>rasD</italic> expressing subpopulations. Similar dynamic transcription has been observed in mammalian cell populations and is thought to represent slowly fluctuating transcriptomes that prime cell fate decisions both in the petri dish and during early embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Silva and Smith, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kalmar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Canham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abranches et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, growing <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells expressing low levels of <italic>rasD</italic> transcripts are primed to become prespore cells during development, whilst RasD hyperactivation is sufficient to drive cells towards a prestalk cell fate. Surprisingly, however, we found that cells expressing high <italic>rasD:RFP</italic> transcript levels only exhibit a relatively weak prestalk preference. One interpretation of this finding is that if RasD protein has a shorter half life than RFP, then not all cells that express RFP would actually express RasD. Consequently, not all RFP expressing cells would exhibit a prestalk bias and may be free to differentiate as prespore cells, thus hindering experimental observation of their behavior. It is interesting to note, however, that similar observations of cell populations behaving more promiscuously in their lineage restriction than might be expected, have also been seen when fluorescent protein reporters are used in studies of the early mouse embryo and in embryonic stem cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Canham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grabarek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morgani et al., 2013</xref>). Most importantly, all these observations highlight the need for faithful real time reporters of gene expression, which will permit future studies of the regulation of RasD promoter activity, the molecular basis of transcriptional heterogeneity and lineage priming in general.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>DIF sensitivity and cell fate bias</title><p>Immediate-early DIF responses have been shown to be digital, with the number of responding cells being strongly affected by changes in DIF concentration, whereas the magnitude of the response in individual cells is largely unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stevense et al., 2010</xref>). This observation implies that (1) a response is only triggered once an internal threshold is exceeded and (2) the position of the threshold varies across a population. Work described in this report provides further support for this idea and gives mechanistic insight into how the DIF response threshold is set and, thus, how cell fate choice is regulated in vivo. Specifically, we find that GefE dependent heterogeneous RasD activation during the growth phase is required to set the normal DIF response threshold. However, several major questions emerge. For example, DIF is a developmental inducer that is present only after cells have been starved; yet the DIF response threshold is set (by RasD levels) before DIF exposure, in the growth phase. Indeed, heterogeneity in <italic>rasD</italic> expression is independent of DIF, as RasD expression is unaffected by DIF treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jermyn et al., 1987</xref> and data not shown). One clue to how this heterogeneity is generated comes from our observation that RasD protein levels are higher in cells grown in medium lacking glucose. This suggests that heterogeneity in metabolic state between cells may play a role in <italic>rasD</italic> regulation. However, other growth phase heterogeneities, including differences in cell cycle position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gomer and Firtel, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Araki et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thompson and Kay, 2000a</xref>), intracellular calcium concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baskar et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azhar et al., 2001</xref>) and intracellular pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gross et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kubohara et al., 2007</xref>) have all also previously been shown to affect cell fate choice. However, the molecular basis underlying these heterogeneities, or whether they affect RasD expression, is currently unknown. It thus remains to be determined whether they are a cause or consequence of the observed differences in RasD levels. Furthermore, it is currently unknown how RasD activation affects the sensitivity of cells to DIF at the molecular level. Because <italic>gefE</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup> and <italic>rasD</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup> cells are capable of forming DIF dependent cell types during development and <italic>rasD</italic> transcription is not induced by DIF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jermyn et al., 1987</xref> and data not shown), these observations strongly suggest that RasD is not a central component of the DIF response pathway and that positive feedback through <italic>rasD</italic> transcriptional activation does not contribute to the binary switch. It thus appears that RasD only ‘tunes’ responses to DIF, rather than being integral to the DIF response per se. One clue to the molecular basis of this regulation, however, comes from the finding that the rapid (within 10 min) nuclear translocation of GATAc-GFP in response to DIF is affected in the <italic>gefE</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup> mutant. Consequently, it seems likely that the tuning effects of RasD act during the immediate-early phase of the DIF response. However, to fully understand how this tuning of DIF sensitivity occurs will require a greater knowledge of the DIF signaling pathway itself, and crucially how each component is regulated (as all components represent potential RasD targets). For example, to date, only a small number of transcription factors and one protein kinase have been shown to be crucial for DIF signal transduction and responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fukuzawa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thompson et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhukovskaya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Keller and Thompson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araki et al., 2012</xref>). However, the regulation of their activity is complex, requiring control by posttranslational modifications, as well as subcellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fukuzawa et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thompson et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhukovskaya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araki et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Keller and Thompson, 2008</xref>). It is therefore possible that RasD alters the activity of specific protein kinases or transcription factors or hitherto unknown DIF signaling components, making them more likely to be DIF induced. In this way, because the DIF signaling pathway is intact in <italic>rasD</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup> and <italic>gefE</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup> mutant cells, they would still respond to DIF (albeit less efficiently than wild type) when given prolonged exposure to the signal. Finally, it is unclear to what extent inputs from different signaling pathways are also integrated to modulate the sensitivity of cells to DIF in response to nutritional bias, or other modulators of cell fate bias. Indeed, it is likely that the effects of nutrition are only partially explained by GefE activity. For example, when <italic>gefE</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup> mutant cells are grown in the absence of glucose are compared to wild type cells grown in the presence of glucose, they do not produce as many spores in chimeric development. Furthermore, the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> retinoblastoma ortholog, RblA, is a cell cycle regulated protein whose expression level during the growth phase is correlated with both DIF sensitivity and cell fate preference during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">MacWilliams et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>rblA</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup> mutant cells display hypersensitivity to DIF and adopt collar and back cell fates when mixed with wild type cells in chimera, perhaps indicating a degree of antagonism between Ras and Retinoblastoma signaling. Similarly, knock out of the Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 homolog, <italic>gskA</italic>, results in DIF hypersensitivity and the <italic>gskA</italic><sup>−</sup> strain preferentially forms basal disc cells at the expense of spores when developed clonally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harwood et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schilde et al., 2004</xref>). Such similarities, as well as clear phenotypic differences (data not shown), suggest this level of complexity allows the DIF signal to be integrated into multiple fate choices during development.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title><italic>Dictyostelium</italic> as a model for lineage priming</title><p>Development in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> is unusual, being based on aggregation of separate cells, rather than division of a fertilized egg. However, remarkable similarities are emerging between this evolutionarily ancient organism and the behavior of embryonic stem cell cultures, and indeed lineage specification in the early mouse embryo. (1) Salt and pepper differentiation of prestalk and prespore cells: During mouse embryogenesis, the PrE and EPI lineages arise from the ICM. Each lineage can be clearly defined at later stages through specific gene expression profiles, as well as their position within the blastocyst. However, at the earliest stages cells expressing PrE and EPI lineage markers are intermingled, with active sorting out observed at later stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dietrich and Hiiragi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Plusa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yamanaka et al., 2010</xref>). (2) Dynamic expression of lineage priming/specific gene expression: observations in cell culture reveal expression of ICM cell fate markers such as Hex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Canham et al., 2010</xref>) and Nanog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chambers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kalmar et al., 2009b</xref>) is highly heterogeneous. When high or low level expressing cells are separated by FACS, the population structure returns to an equilibrium on time-scale of hours to days. Most importantly, differences in expression levels also correlate well with fate preferences in chimeric development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Canham et al., 2010</xref>). (3) Modulation of Ras activation affects lineage choice: although FGF activates multiple pathways, genetic studies indicate that the Grb2 &gt; Sos (RasGEF) &gt; Ras &gt; Erk axis is the most important during differentiation of both ES cells and PrE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chazaud et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lanner and Rossant, 2010</xref>). (4) Heterogeneous responses/thresholds to differentiation signals: FGF signaling is required for normal EPI/PrE differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yamanaka et al., 2010</xref>). However, it has recently been shown that salt and pepper expression pattern of EPI and PrE markers does not require FGF signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kang et al., 2013</xref>). Rather, activation of this pathway is associated with exit from pluripotent state and commitment to the PrE fate. Finally when FGF levels are manipulated, the proportion of PrE:EPI cells correlates well with FGF levels, implying existence of cell intrinsic threshold to FGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yamanaka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grabarek et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Understanding the molecular basis of lineage priming</title><p>While it is clear that multicellular development requires extreme precision, there is a growing realization that key decisions are biased by heterogeneous behavior between equipotent cells. Population level variation in sensitivity to a global signal is one way to generate diversity. However, our understanding of the mechanistic basis of lineage priming is still in its infancy. One reason for this is that mutants in lineage priming genes may only show subtle defects during clonal development. Importantly, our study highlights that testing chimeric effects can uncover important regulatory roles for these genes. Due to the relative ease with which chimeric development can be assayed in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, it seems likely that studies in this model system will lead to a better understanding of how lineage biases are acquired and potentially how they might be manipulated to increase the efficiency of stem cell based therapeutics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and development</title><p><italic>Dictyostelium</italic> strains were cultured on lawns of <italic>Klebsiella aerogenes</italic> or in HL5 medium with (G+) or without (G−) 86 mM glucose.

Your article has been favorably peer reviewed by a Senior editor and two other reviewers.</p><p>The Senior editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Senior editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers all agreed that this work has provided novel insights into the mechanisms whereby lineage segregation can arise in a seemingly homogeneous population of cells. The aggregating slime mold system provides an interesting model to explore this mechanism, which has relevance in many other developmental systems. Previous work established that differentiation towards stalk or spore cells could be biased by the past history of the cells – cell cycle position or growth with or without glucose – and that this bias was manifest as altered sensitivity to the morphogen DIF. However, there were no clues as to the molecular basis of the bias. Your use of a novel genetic screen to identify GefE (a RasGEF) as a key downstream component in the pathway has opened up new insights into to the role of Ras activation levels in establishing cell heterogeneity and lineage specification. The reviewers do have some major concerns that would need to be addressed, most likely by additional experimentation, before we could reconsider the article for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) The selection for biased mutants is much more effective than expected. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> around 20% of the input G-cells become spores (2% of 10%), and thus a mutant where all input cells become spores will only be enriched 5-fold per round of selection. If GefE<sup>-</sup> was present as 1/3000 of the input cells (according to the size of the REMI library) then after 2 rounds of selection it could maximally only comprise 0.8% of the population. Yet according to one of the figures it is nearly 40%. This could be explained in 2 ways: i) the REMI library was very heavily biased to GefE<sup>-</sup> cells; or ii) the selection does not work as expected. Perhaps spore germination in axenic medium is very asynchronous and GefE<sup>-</sup> cells are selected at the start of each cycle because they hatch quickly?</p><p>There should be an attempt to resolve this conundrum. For instance a reconstruction experiment to show how efficiently GefE<sup>-</sup> cells are selected; an idea of how complex the REMI library actually was (if possible) or whether repeat selections give different genes. Was GefE the only mutation isolated in the screen? Were multiple mutations in gefE isolated?</p><p>2) The heterogeneity of the RasD reporter is very interesting, but the chimera data appears somewhat confusing.

Does Dif affect the probability that a cell is RasD positive or the extent to which it expresses RasD? How does this fit in with the binary ecm switch?</p><p>3) It was not clear why you think that variations in transcription of RasD could relate to cell fate, given that it is the levels of activated Ras that seem to relate to cell fate bias. Does this imply that RasD must be limiting in wild type cells and that it is converted to the ATP bound form upon translation? Perhaps this could be tested by Western blot? Or perhaps they could try over expressing RasD in wild type and GefE mutants, and assess the extent of rescue and levels of RasD-ATP? What happens to RasD protein levels? The authors seems to have a good antibody to RasD (not a given in this field) and so they could ask questions about protein levels: for instance whether cells sorted for high RasD expression actually have high RasD protein, or whether G- cells have more RasD than G+ cells.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the revised manuscript was re-reviewed, with the following revision requests.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Developmental lineage priming by heterogeneous Ras activation” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

The authors claim that RasD levels are DIF independent and this would be very interesting, but I am still confused as to what they think the mechanism is?

Although it is impossible to accurately quantify the complexity of a REMI library (e.g., due to hot spots, etc.), we have performed several different experiments to resolve this issue as suggested. Firstly, we had already carried out a parallel selection on the same REMI library. Both selections resulted in an enrichment of mutants that can avoid the pstO and pstB cell bias imposed by glucose. We now include qualitative data showing this. Several mutants were isolated in both selections, however we were only able to confirm the gefE mutant through recapitulation experiments (i.e., the other mutants were caused by secondary mutations in addition to the identified REMI insertion). Most importantly, the <italic>gefE</italic> mutant was detected in both libraries, but at round 2 and round 6. We believe that these differences are likely due to the effects of random genetic drift caused by harvesting a finite number of spores after each round. Alternatively, it has recently been shown that when multiple clones are hatched and grown on bacteria, small differences in growth rate at the feeding edge can be amplified, leading to overrepresentation of some clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buttery et al, 2012</xref>). We have modified the text in the Results to include this.</p><p>Furthermore, as suggested, we have performed reconstruction experiments to verify that enrichment of <italic>gefE</italic><sup>-</sup> mutant cells is due to overrepresention in the spore population, rather than the mutation simply conferring advantages during other stages of the selection process (e.g., spore hatching, growth, etc). These reconstruction experiments revealed no difference in the rate of growth of <italic>gefE</italic>- mutant cells in either G+ or G- medium. However, <italic>gefE</italic><sup>-</sup> mutant spores did hatch at a faster rate than wild type spores, perhaps also helping to explain the unexpectedly strong enrichment for this mutant within the pools. These data are now included and are described in the Results section. We have provided a revised estimate of the REMI library composition based on these observations.</p><p><italic>2) The heterogeneity of the RasD reporter is very interesting, but the chimera data appears somewhat confusing. Is the high RasD population making spore cells?</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7B</italic></xref> <italic>seems to indicate that the high RasD population is good at making everything, but the low RasD population is excluded from the pre-stalk</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer is correct to point out that as ‘low RasD’ cells (as measured by rasD<sup>promoter</sup> driven RFP expression) make only prespore cells then cells expressing high <italic>rasD</italic> transcript levels might be expected to make only prestalk cells. The observation that cells expressing high <italic>rasD</italic> transcript levels can form both prespore and prestalk cells, as evidenced by their random distribution at both slug and culminant stages is thus surprising. We believe that these results are still consistent with the idea that there is an increased likelihood that high RasD cells will become prestalk cells compared to low RasD cells. One likely explanation for their failure to solely become prestalk cells is that the stability of the RFP protein may be different to endogenous RasD. For example, if RasD protein has a shorter half life than RFP, then not all cells that express RFP would actually express RasD. Consequently, not all RFP expressing cells would exhibit a prestalk bias and may be free to differentiate as prespore cells, thus hindering experimental observation of their behavior. One observation supporting this idea is that the low RasD expressing population exhibits slightly faster dynamics than the high RasD expressing population, thus supporting the idea that chimeric behavior may be affected by differences in RasD transcription/translation and RFP stability. We have now included expanded description and discussion of these ideas to clarify these issues within the Results and Discussion.</p><p><italic>Does Dif affect the probability that a cell is RasD positive or the extent to which it expresses RasD? How does this fit in with the binary ecm switch</italic>?</p><p>Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jermyn et al 1987</xref>), we find that <italic>rasD</italic> transcription is unaffected by DIF treatment, thus suggesting that positive feedback through <italic>rasD</italic> transcriptional activation does not contribute to the binary switch ((Jermyn, 1987) and data not shown). Consequently, it seems likely that Ras only acts during the immediate-early phase to set up DIF responses. We have now included a discussion of these observations in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>3) It was not clear why you think that variations in transcription of RasD could relate to cell fate, given that it is the levels of activated Ras that seem to relate to cell fate bias.

The authors seems to have a good antibody to RasD (not a given in this field) and so they could ask questions about protein levels: for instance whether cells sorted for high RasD expression actually have high RasD protein, or whether G- cells have more RasD than G+ cells</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer is correct that our model for the action of GefE and RasD assumes that the levels of RasD transcription are limiting. Based on their suggestions, we have now performed several additional experiments to strengthen the support for this important idea:</p><p>A) We have measured the levels of total and activated RasD in G+ and G- grown cells (it is impossible to prepare sufficient material from FACS samples). Consistent with the idea that RasD transcription is induced in G- medium, we find that the levels of total RasD protein are also significantly increased. Most importantly, we find that the levels of activated RasD are also similarly increased. These new findings are now described in the results section and presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>.</p><p>B) We have compared the effects of overexpressing wild type RasD and constitutively active RasD(G12T). In wild type cells, their effects are almost indistinguishable, resulting in a bias towards prestalk fates, suggesting that RasD transcription is limiting. Most importantly, however, this effect is only seen when constitutively active RasD(G12T) is expressed in <italic>gefE</italic><sup><italic>-</italic></sup> mutant cells, suggesting that GefE is required to activate the overexpressed RasD. These new findings are now described within the results section and presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the revised manuscript was re-reviewed, with the following revision requests.]</p><p><italic>With respect to the differences in the behavior of the RasD positive population the authors argue that the stability of the RFP explains the more promiscuous behavior of the RasD</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> <italic>cells. This has also been observed in ESCs, as populations marked by fluorescent proteins have less defined functional activity</italic>.</p><p>We have interpreted the observation of unexpected lineage promiscuity of RasD RFP positive cells as being due to stability of RFP protein, We have interpreted the observation of unexpected lineage promiscuity of RasD RFP positive cells as being due to stability of RFP protein. However, we are grateful to the reviewer for pointing out that such differences in behavior have also been observed in ESC cultures and the early mouse embryo, where this explanation has not been proposed. We have now noted this interesting parallel within the Discussion. Furthermore, we note the importance of the generation of faithful real time reporter genes to truly understand how differences in expression impact on lineage choice.</p><p>Surprisingly, however, we found that cells expressing high <italic>rasD: RFP</italic> transcript levels only exhibit a relatively weak prestalk preference. One interpretation of this finding is that if RasD protein has a shorter half life than RFP, then not all cells that express RFP would actually express RasD. Consequently, not all RFP expressing cells would exhibit a prestalk bias and may be free to differentiate as prespore cells, thus hindering experimental observation of their behavior. It is interesting to note, however, that similar observations of cell populations behaving more promiscuously in their lineage restriction than might be expected, have also been seen when fluorescent protein reporters are used in studies of the early mouse embryo and in embryonic stem cell cultures (Canham et al., 2010; Grabarek et al., 2012; Morgani et al., 2013). Most importantly, all these observations highlight the need for faithful real time reporters of gene expression, which will permit future studies of the regulation of RasD promoter activity, the molecular basis of transcriptional heterogeneity and lineage priming in general.</p><p><italic>However, However, I am still a little confused about the dynamics of RasD response. The authors claim that RasD levels are DIF independent and this would be very interesting, but I am still confused as to what they think the mechanism is? They argue that RasD is only a part of early response, rather than the switch itself. How would this work? How does a RasD- cell respond to Dif? Perhaps they could clarify these issues further</italic>.</p><p>To clarify these issues, we have:</p><p>A) Included a much clearer description of the evidence that RasD levels fluctuate during growth, when DIF levels are negligible. We also further state that DIF has no effect of RasD transcription during growth or development. Based on these observations, we now include a full discussion of the putative regulators of RasD expression during growth. For example there is extensive literature describing how growth heterogeneities (e.g., cell cycle position, intracellular calcium concentration) affect lineage choice. However, the molecular mechanism underlying these heterogeneities, or how they affect lineage choice is currently unknown. We therefore agree that a discussion of these earlier studies is important in the context of our findings. Most importantly, this will likely provide the intellectual framework for future studies into the molecular basis linking these heterogeneities to transcriptional heterogeneity (e.g., RasD) and thus lineage choice.</p><p>B) Included a clear discussion of how we believe RasD might feed into the DIF signaling pathway to affect DIF responses. We now fully describe the evidence supporting the idea that RasD is not a central component of the DIF signaling pathway and thus only affects the sensitivity of cells to the DIF signal (i.e., tunes DIF responsiveness). Consequently RasD deficient cells are ultimately able to respond to DIF when given prolonged exposure to the DIF signal. We thus provide a full discussion of the putative mechanism(s) by which RasD could affect the activity of the DIF signaling pathway. This is important, as it has enabled us to highlight what is known about the DIF signaling pathway, as well as allowing us to emphasize the gaps in our understanding. It is hoped that this will stimulate further research in this area, as it is only through understanding all components of a signaling pathway and their interactions will we be able to understand how subtle tuning of sensitivity is achieved at a molecular level.</p><p>Immediate-early DIF responses have been shown to be digital, with the number of responding cells being strongly affected by changes in DIF concentration, whereas the magnitude of the response in individual cells is largely unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stevense et al., 2010</xref>). This observation implies that 1) a response is only triggered once an internal threshold is exceeded and 2) the position of the threshold varies across a population. Work described in this report provides further support for this idea and gives mechanistic insight into how the DIF response threshold is set and, thus, how cell fate choice is regulated in vivo.</p><p>Specifically, we find that GefE dependent heterogeneous RasD activation during the growth phase is required to set the normal DIF response threshold. However, several major questions emerge. For example, DIF is a developmental inducer that is present only after cells have been starved; yet the DIF response threshold is set (by RasD levels) before DIF exposure, in the growth phase. Indeed, heterogeneity in <italic>rasD</italic> expression is independent of DIF, as RasD expression is unaffected by DIF treatment ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jermyn et al., 1987</xref>) and data not shown). One clue to how this heterogeneity is generated comes from our observation that RasD protein levels are higher in cells grown in medium lacking glucose. This suggests that heterogeneity in metabolic state between cells may play a role in <italic>rasD</italic> regulation. However, other growth phase heterogeneities, including differences in cell cycle position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gomer and Firtel, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Araki et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thompson and Kay, 2000a</xref>), intracellular calcium concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baskar et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azhar et al., 2001</xref>) and intracellular pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gross et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kubohara et al., 2007</xref>) have all also previously been shown to affect cell fate choice. In addition, the molecular basis underlying these heterogeneities, or whether they affect RasD expression, is currently unknown. It thus remains to be determined whether they are a cause or consequence of the observed differences in RasD levels.</p></body></sub-article></article>
