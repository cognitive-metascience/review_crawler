Advancing cognitive decline is accompanied by progressive impairment of cognition-relevant EEG patterns such as gamma oscillations. The endocannabinoid anandamide, a TrpV1-receptor agonist, reverses hippocampal damage and memory impairment in rodents and protects neurons from Aβ-induced cytotoxic effects. Here, we investigate a restorative role of TrpV1-receptor activation against Aβ-induced degradation of hippocampal neuron function and gamma oscillations. We found that the TrpV1-receptor agonist capsaicin rescues Aβ-induced degradation of hippocampal gamma oscillations by reversing both the desynchronization of AP firing in CA3 pyramidal cells and the shift in excitatory/inhibitory current balance. This rescue effect is TrpV1-receptor-dependent since it was absent in TrpV1 knockout mice or in the presence of the TrpV1-receptor antagonist capsazepine. Our findings provide novel insight into the network mechanisms underlying cognitive decline in AD and suggest TrpV1 activation as a novel therapeutic target.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Alzheimer Disease</kwd><kwd>amyloid-beta</kwd><kwd>TrpV1 receptor</kwd><kwd>neuronal network</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>gamma oscillations</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fisahn</surname><given-names>André</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008599</institution-id><institution>Alzheimerfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johansson</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>TrpV1 receptor activation rescues cognition-relevant network dynamics in mouse hippocampus in an acute Alzheimer disease model providing a novel therapeutic target.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an irreversible progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common type of dementia in the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brookmeyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Qiu et al., 2009</xref>). AD is characterized by a progressive deficit in cognition, principally in memory and learning and has become a major public health challenge. Today, there are several lines of evidence indicating that amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), the main component of senile plaques in AD, plays an important role in AD pathogenesis and is responsible for the early cognitive deficit observed in the disease with the Aβ1–42 peptide thought to be particularly disease relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lue et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Näslund et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Walsh and Selkoe, 2007</xref>). Aβ has also been shown to induce impairments in neuronal network functions that are important for cognition, such as network oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Driver et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nerelius et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balleza-Tapia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Villette et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gutiérrez-Lerma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kurudenkandy et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Neuronal network oscillations in various frequency bands are crucial for information processing in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buzsáki and Draguhn, 2004</xref>).

Since anandamide is also an agonist of the TrpV1 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso and Ferrer, 2014</xref>), we proceeded to investigate whether selective TrpV1 activation would result in protection against Aβ-induced impairment of functional network dynamics. In contrast to cannabinoid receptor activation, we found that incubation with 50 nM Aβ and 10 µM of the TrpV1 receptor agonist capsaicin (Cp, 15 min) completely prevented the Aβ-induced reduction of gamma power (control: 11.6 ± 1.7×10<sup>−9</sup> V<sup>2</sup>, n = 32; Aβ+Cp: 11.8 ± 1.8×10<sup>−9</sup> V<sup>2</sup>, n = 18; p = 0.2961; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>).

The resulting gamma oscillations remained depressed and were not significantly different from the results obtained with Cp alone (63.2 ± 7.0% reduction, Cp+Cz, power: 6.4 ± 1.2×10<sup>−9</sup> V<sup>2</sup>, n = 15, p = 0.0014 vs control, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our data show that Cp activates two different, independent pathways: a TrpV1-dependent one, which mediates the protective effect of Cp against Aβ-induced reduction of gamma oscillations, and a TrpV1-independent one, which mediates the reduction of gamma oscillations caused by Cp itself. It is also apparent that the effect of Cp via the TrpV1-dependend pathway occludes its TrpV1-independent action in the presence of Aβ.</p><p>Because of this dual effect of Cp, we decided to further test the preventive effect of TrpV1 activation on Aβ-induced gamma oscillation impairment. To do this, we used hippocampal slices from TrpV1 knockout mice (TrpV1 KO). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>, slices treated with 50 nM Aβ (15 min) displayed a 51.2 ± 11.1% reduction in gamma power compared to control slices (control: 3.5 ± 0.7×10<sup>−9</sup> V<sup>2</sup>, n = 10; Aβ: 1.7 ± 0.4×10<sup>−9</sup> V<sup>2</sup>, n = 9; p = 0.0394). This reduction was similar to the one observed in WT slices (59.4 ± 8.9%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). As expected 10 µM Cp treatment did not prevent the Aβ-induced reduction of gamma power (Aβ+Cp: 0.9 ± 0.4×10<sup>−9</sup> V<sup>2</sup>, n = 8; p = 0.0022 vs control, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>) supporting the above results on mediation of the Cp preventive effect via a TrpV1-dependent mechanism. Interestingly, TrpV1 KO slices incubated with Cp and Aβ displayed a greater reduction in gamma oscillations power (73.8 ± 11.8%) compared to Aβ-only incubation (Aβ: 1.7 ± 0.4×10<sup>−9</sup> V<sup>2</sup>, n = 9; Aβ+Cp: 0.9 ± 0.4×10<sup>−9</sup> V<sup>2</sup>, n = 8; p = 0.0296; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). It is likely that this further reduction in gamma power is due to the TrpV1-independent effect of Cp observed in WT slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), which in the absence of the receptor in TrpV1 KO slices is no longer occluded.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37703.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Capsaicin’s preventative effect is absent in hippocampal slices from TrpV1 KO mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative sample traces and power spectra of KA-induced gamma oscillations in hippocampal slices from TrpV1 KO mice showing that Cp does not display the same protective properties against Aβ-induced reduction in gamma oscillations as in WT slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–G</xref>).

Similarly to EPSCs, 1 µM Aβ induced a 34.4 ± 5.4% reduction of IPSC amplitude (control: 88.2 ± 15.8 pA, Aβ: 57.7 ± 10.3 pA, n = 9, p = 0.002, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, Aβ also induced a 32.5 ± 6.5% reduction of IPSC charge transfer (control: 1073.0 ± 183.8 pC, Aβ: 691.7 ± 101.1 pC, n = 9, p = 0.002, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

In contrast to EPSCs, Cp did not prevent Aβ-induced alterations of IPSC parameters. Our experiments evidenced a persistent 23.9 ± 9.4% reduction in IPSC amplitude (control: 71.37 ± 13.5 pA, Aβ+Cp: 55.4 ± 14.3 pA, n = 6, p = 0.0156, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and a 30.3 ± 10.3% reduction in charge transfer (control: 1214 ± 238.8 pC, Aβ+Cp: 858.9 ± 205.1 pC, n = 6, p = 0.0156, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Since the holding potential used to record the IPSC (V<sub>h</sub> = 0 mV) was similar to the TrpV1 receptor reversal potential when activated by Cp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Caterina et al., 1997</xref>), we decided to perform a second series of experiments with a high-chloride intracellular solution in order to shift TrpV1 reversal potential away from the recording V<sub>h</sub> (−70 mV). To control for possible differences in the Aβ-related effects by recording the IPSC under these conditions, we performed experiments with Aβ application alone. The results showed no differences in the Aβ-effect on IPSCs since a 26.8 ± 10.4% reduction was found in amplitude (control: 62.9 ± 8.0 pA, Aβ: 44.4 ± 7.2 pA, n = 5, p = 0.0313, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and a 29.7 ± 7.7% reduction in charge transfer (control: 713.0 ± 115.8 pC, Aβ: 507.8 ± 122.7 pC, n = 5, p = 0.0313, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

In addition, Cp partially prevented the Aβ-effect on amplitude since only a 12.7 ± 7.5% reduction was observed (control: 130.3 ± 26.1 pA, Aβ+Cp: 107.7 ± 20.4 pA, n = 6, p = 0.0313, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), in contrast to the 26.8 ± 10.4% reduction found with Aβ application alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

Our results demonstrate that Cp’s preventive effect on IPSC parameters was mediated by TrpV1 receptor activation since we observed a 34.3 ± 10.6% reduction in IPSC amplitude (control: 75.4 ± 22.2 pA, Aβ+Cp+Cz: 41.8 ± 6.8 pA, n = 5, p = 0.0313, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) and a 44.1 ± 7.5% reduction in charge transfer (control: 992.1 ± 457.3 pC, Aβ+Cp+Cz: 430.0 ± 126.8 pC, n = 5, p = 0.0313, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

This suggests that Cp treatment recovers the inhibitory input to CA3 PC via a postsynaptic mechanism involving Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through TrpV1 receptor activation since the Cp protective effect was absent when experiments were performed at V<sub>h</sub> = 0 mV. Taken together, our results suggest that Cp prevents the Aβ-induced shift in excitatory/inhibitory current balance in hippocampal gamma oscillations induced with KA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>TrpV1 receptor activation rescues Aβ-induced impairment of functional network dynamics</title><p>In the context of clinical treatment possibilities, it is important to establish whether a potential therapeutic approach is able to just prevent pathological damage or, more desirably, is also capable of rescuing impairment after pathological damage has already occurred. We therefore proceeded to investigate whether the preventive effect of TrpV1 activation by Cp demonstrated above extend to restorative capabilities. Specifically, we asked whether Cp could rescue the Aβ-induced impairment of functional network dynamics in the form of gamma oscillations. To assess this, continuous recordings of LFP gamma oscillation activity were performed in four different experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In three experimental groups, all slices were first incubated with 50 nM Aβ for 15 min and transferred to an interface recording chamber where gamma oscillations were induced by bath perfusion of 100 nM KA and allowed to stabilize for 20 min. The first Aβ-pre-incubated group was used to monitor, without any further treatment, the stability of the Aβ-impaired gamma oscillations.

While the function of TrpV1 in nociception and sensory transmission is well documented, its role in CNS is less well understood.

Conversely, TrpV1 activation by Cp displayed strong protective and restorative properties, preventing and rescuing the Aβ-induced degradation of hippocampal gamma oscillations and relevant cellular mechanisms. In contrast to the preventive role of TrpV1 activation found here, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benito et al. (2012)</xref> have reported that Aβ can induce a pathological inflammatory response in primary astrocyte cultures in which several membrane receptors, including TrpV1, are involved. These differing consequences of TrpV1 activation could be explained by the different Aβ preparations and concentrations used in both studies: our Aβ preparation contains a mix of different aggregation states (monomers, oligomers, fibrils; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kurudenkandy et al., 2014</xref>) while Benito and coworkers used a purely fibrillar Aβ preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benito et al., 2012</xref>), which is more toxic in our experimental model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kurudenkandy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cohen et al., 2015</xref>). Also, we use physiologically relevant concentrations of recombinant Aβ (50 nM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Roher et al., 2009</xref>) for LFP recordings while Benito and coworkers use a very high 5 µM of synthetic Aβ. Since TrpV1 is known to play an important role in anti-inflammatory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Devesa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tsuji and Aono, 2012</xref>) it is possible that the effect of 5 µM fibrillar Aβ induces a pathological activation of inflammatory mechanisms in the primary astrocytes culture. Hyperactivation of immune responses (neuroinflammation) induced by Aβ has also been shown in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blasko et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cai et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly to chronic inflammation, in which processes originally activated to restore system homeostasis become pathological due to an imbalance in the regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Devesa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Medzhitov, 2008</xref>), the 5 µM fibrillar Aβ used by Benito and coworkers could induce a pathological TrpV1 function.</p><p>On the other hand, similar to our study, TrpV1 activation as a therapeutic target has been tested in a mouse model of ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cao et al., 2014</xref>). Cao and coworkers found that TrpV1 activation leads to a decrease in the volume of affected brain tissue after the induction of cerebral ischemia. Furthermore, an improvement in a behavioral-neurofunction-test score was found in animals treated with Cp after brain ischemia. Another recent study has also reported that TrpV1 activation in astrocytes in a rat model of Parkinson’s disease is involved in the prevention of dopamine neuron degeneration in substantia nigra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nam et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, TrpV1 activation in astrocytes also led to behavioral rescue in this rat PD model since a reduction in the pathologically induced rotational behavior was observed after Cp treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nam et al., 2015</xref>). These data, together with the findings in this study, strongly suggest that TrpV1 receptor activation is a suitable therapeutic approach in the fight against neurodegenerative disorders and the cognitive decline associated with them.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>TrpV1 activation and gamma oscillations</title><p>Gamma oscillations emerge from synchronous postsynaptic currents and AP firing of different cell types as a result of the coordinated interaction between excitation and inhibition in a network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buzsáki and Wang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mann et al., 2005</xref>). Here, we found that TrpV1 activation by Cp prevented the reduction in AP firing rate of PCs and reversed the Aβ-induced increase in the AP gamma-phase firing window (desynchronization) suggesting that TrpV1 activation protects gamma oscillations by maintaining the synchrony of neuronal activity in hippocampus. Furthermore, our data show that TrpV1 activation protects the excitatory/inhibitory current balance against the Aβ-related impairment. Hence, it is possible that TrpV1 activation triggers synaptic mechanisms that offset the Aβ-induced shift of excitatory/inhibitory current balance and, consequently, sustains the synchrony of neuronal AP firing during hippocampal gamma oscillations. In support of this hypothesis, it has been shown that TrpV1 modulates excitatory transmission in CNS either presynaptically by modulating glutamate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marinelli et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marinelli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gibson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Musella et al., 2009</xref>) or postsynaptically through the internalization of AMPA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chávez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grueter et al., 2010</xref>). TrpV1 activation by Cp in hippocampus has been reported to depress EPSC and induce a form of long-term synaptic depression (LTD) in CA1 interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gibson et al., 2008</xref>) and granular cells in dentate gyrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chávez et al., 2010</xref>). These effects in excitatory transmission onto CA1 interneurons are related to a mechanism involving the presynaptic rise in Ca<sup>2+</sup>, calcineurin activation and the subsequent depression of neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jensen and Edwards, 2012</xref>) while in the dentate gyrus the postsynaptic rise in Ca<sup>2+</sup> and calcineurin activation mediates a clathrin-dependent internalization of AMPA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chávez et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, we found that TrpV1 activation reverses the Aβ-induced impairment of IPSC. Furthermore, this protective effect of TrpV1 activation was absent when IPSC were recorded at a holding potential near the TrpV1 reversal potential (0 mV) suggesting, firstly, that TrpV1 is located at the postsynaptic terminal and, secondly, that TrpV1 activation by Cp protects inhibitory transmission through a mechanism related to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the postsynaptic terminal. Taken together, the evidence cited above suggests that the regulation of synaptic function by TrpV1 receptor activation through the modulation of excitatory/inhibitory current balance on pyramidal neurons could be the mechanism by which Cp reverses the Aβ-induced desynchronization of AP firing and, thereby, protects hippocampal gamma oscillations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Aβ-induced neuronal metabolic dysfunction and choice of recording configuration</title><p>Another interesting finding of this study is that the Aβ-induced reduction of AP firing rate in PC of WT hippocampal slices is in contrast with our previously published results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kurudenkandy et al., 2014</xref>), where Aβ induced an increase in AP firing rate in PC while the desynchronization of AP-phase coupling observed after Aβ treatment is the same in both studies. These seemingly contradictory Aβ effects are explained by the differing recording conditions employed for these experiments in the two studies: here AP firing activity was monitored in the whole-cell configuration while the recordings in our previous study were performed in cell-attached configuration. We tested this in the present study by performing additional unitary spike recordings and found that Aβ application under these conditions increased AP firing rate as we previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kurudenkandy et al., 2014</xref>). The differing results depending on recording configuration are explained by unpublished data from our lab showing that Aβ reduces intracellular ATP levels and, in parallel, induces a membrane potential depolarization in neurons recorded in the perforated-patch but not in neurons recorded in the whole-cell configuration. This ATP deficit can be compensated with ATP contained in the intracellular recording solution. Hence, the reduction in AP firing rate observed using whole-cell patch recordings in the present study is likely caused by the metabolic dysfunction induced by Aβ and its compensation by ATP diffusing into the cytosol from the intracellular pipette solution. However, further experiments are needed to study this possibility in more detail.</p><p>Also, by performing concomitant experiments in TrpV1 KO hippocampal slices, we found that despite the Aβ-induced reduction of AP firing and gamma oscillation power, the Aβ-induced changes to the preferred AP phase-angle and PC fire window were no longer observed after Cp treatment. This suggests that Aβ-induced degradation of gamma oscillations in these slices may be caused by a mechanism involving just the decrease in AP firing rate. These results can explain why no effect of Aβ exposure on the coefficient of rhythmicity was found in TrpV1 KO slices and also suggests that TrpV1 function in the knockout mice could be compensated for another member of the TRP receptor family.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Pathology-selective activation of TrpV1-dependent vs TrpV1-independent mechanisms</title><p>Our data indicate that the TrpV1 preventive effect seems to be regulated by a mechanism triggered by Aβ since the protective effect was observed when Cp was applied together with Aβ. TrpV1 activation by Cp may only be possible under the pathological conditions created by Aβ while in physiological conditions a TrpV1-independent mechanism is activated. This hypothesis is supported by recent studies, which showed that TrpV1 expression is increased in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons of a rat model of epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saffarzadeh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saffarzadeh et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhaskaran and Smith (2010)</xref> found an increase in TrpV1 expression in the dentate gyrus of a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. These studies indicate that TrpV1 receptor function can be upregulated in pathological conditions and supports the hypothesis that Aβ can trigger the activation of a mechanism involved in the regulation of TrpV1 expression and/or function. In light of this, a possible explanation for our data arises from a recent study in which high-glucose concentration in the culture medium of a PC12 cell line increased <italic>TrpV1</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mohammadi-Farani et al., 2014</xref>). Accordingly, it has been reported that Aβ-induced pathological effects include glucose uptake reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Prapong et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Uemura and Greenlee, 2001</xref>), which concurs with our own unpublished data. Hence, in our experimental approach, extracellular glucose levels could be increased by the Aβ-induced reduction in glucose uptake and, thus, induce the expression of TrpV1 receptor.</p><p>This hypothesis can also explain the long-lasting effects of Cp we observed in this study despite the well-known desensitization of the TrpV1 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ho et al., 2012</xref>). Assuming that Aβ-driven increase in extracellular glucose concentration is constant, <italic>TrpV1</italic> mRNA expression could renovate the available pool of TrpV1 in the cell membrane. Similarly, since the rescue effect of Cp would depend on TrpV1 expression and translocation to the cell membrane, TrpV1 activation and its preventive effects would be expected to be time-dependent as observed in the slow Cp-dependent increase in gamma power displayed in the rescue experiments in the present study. Finally, as cited above, TrpV1 activation can induce a form of LTD on hippocampal interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gibson et al., 2008</xref>), indicating that TrpV1 physiological effects are long-lasting. Hence this mechanism could also explain the long-lasting protective effects of Cp we observed in this study.</p><p>Very limited data is available regarding TrpV1 receptor expression in the human central nervous system. Only Mezey and coworkers (2000) have reported that TrpV1 is expressed in the parietal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mezey et al., 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cavanaugh et al. (2011)</xref> have reported no detectable TrpV1 expression in the human hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cavanaugh et al., 2011</xref>). Although more studies assessing the expression of TrpV1 in the human brain under different conditions are needed, the lack of detectable TrpV1 expression in normal human hippocampus found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cavanaugh et al. (2011)</xref> supports our hypothesis that TrpV1 expression could be up-regulated under pathological conditions only. Potential induction of TrpV1 receptor expression can be studied using AD animal models and/or brain slice assays and, more importantly, TrpV1 activation as a therapeutic target can be assessed further.</p><p>Support for the TrpV1-independent mechanism activated by Cp reported here can be found in a study that shows Cp inducing a reduction in the amplitude of evoked EPSC in granule cells of the dentate gyrus in both WT and TrpV1 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benninger et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, this Cp effect on excitatory transmission seems to be related to a reduction in glutamate release from presynaptic terminals since a change in the paired-pulse ratio was observed with similar proportions in WT and TrpV1 KO mice. In our study, the activation of this TrpV1-independent mechanism was related to a reduction in gamma oscillation power. One possibility to explain this effect is the property of Cp to regulate the excitability of neurons through modulation of ion channel activity. Supporting this hypothesis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cao et al. (2007)</xref> have reported that Cp can regulate voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) activity in a TrpV1-independent manner. They found that high concentrations of Cp (&gt;10 µM) induced a reduction in the amplitude of VGSC currents and shifted the inactivation curve to more negative potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cao et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al. (2014)</xref> have found that Cp can regulate voltage-gated potassium channels (VGPC) responsible for the transient potassium current (I<sub>A</sub>) and sustained potassium current (I<sub>K</sub>) in cultured trigeminal ganglion neurons from TrpV1 KO mice. All together, these studies indicate that Cp can regulate the excitability of neurons independently of TrpV1 activation and, thus, through a mechanism involving the regulation of voltage-gated ion channels kinetics, Cp could induce the reduction in gamma power found in the present study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Activation state-selective effects on TrpV1-dependent vs TrpV1-independent mechanisms</title><p>Finally, similar to our findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benninger et al. (2008)</xref> have reported that the same concentration of Cp differentially regulates hippocampal activity depending on the activation state of the neural network. In the present study we found that 10 µM Cp can prevent Aβ-induced gamma impairment when hippocampal slices were treated before gamma oscillation induction (inactivated state). In contrast, the same Cp concentration failed to display protection when applied after gamma oscillations induction (activated state). In the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benninger et al. (2008)</xref>, the same Cp concentration we used (10 µM) induced a reduction in amplitude of evoked EPSC in dentate gyrus (activated state), but showed no effect on spontaneous EPSC (inactivated state) amplitude while significantly increasing their frequency. These results show how Cp can trigger different effects depending on the activation state of the network. This, together with our finding, suggests that Cp activation of TrpV1-dependent or TrpV1-independent mechanisms is influenced by the activation state of the network. Similarly, this dual effect of Cp has also been seen in trigeminal ganglion neurons in which Cp inhibition of VGSC and VGPC function has been shown to be mediated by TrpV1-dependent and TrpV1-independent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates that Cp treatment prevents the Aβ-induced impairment of hippocampal gamma oscillations through activation of the TrpV1 receptor. The cellular mechanism underlying the protective properties of TrpV1-activation involves the prevention of Aβ-induced alterations of excitatory synaptic input and desynchronization of AP firing of CA3 PC. Even more important from a potential treatment perspective is our finding that TrpV1 receptor activation by Cp can also rescue functional network dynamics in hippocampus by reversing the Aβ-induced reduction of gamma oscillations power back to physiological control levels. This restoration of cognition-relevant network function holds the promise of potential cognitive benefit, which is the focus of ongoing and future studies. Our data are the first report of a preventive and restorative effect of TrpV1 receptor activation against Aβ-induced cytotoxicity in the hippocampal neuronal network and strongly suggest that TrpV1 activation is a suitable therapeutic target in the fight against AD.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic <break/>reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>C57BL/6</td><td>Charles River <break/>Laboratories</td><td>Strain Code: 027</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M.</italic> <break/><italic>musculus</italic>)</td><td>TrpV1 KO</td><td>Jackson Laboratory</td><td>Stock No: 003770 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:003770">IMSR_JAX:003770</ext-link></td><td>PubMed: 10764638</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>Recombinant Aβ1–42</td><td>PMID: 25143621</td><td/><td>Prof. Jan Johansson (Karolinska Institutet, Sweden)</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Kainate Acid</td><td>Tocris Bioscience</td><td>Cat.

Interface chamber LFP were performed with a four-channel M102 amplifier (University of Cologne, Germany). Submerged chamber LFP and concomitant patch clamp recordings were performed using a Multiclamp 700B and Axopatch 200B amplifiers (Molecular Devices). Patch clamp (whole-cell) recordings were performed with borosilicate glass microelectrodes (4–6 MΩ) from visually identified CA3 PC using IR-DIC microscopy (Zeiss Axioskop, Germany and BX50WI Olympus, Japan). For AP firing and EPSC recordings (V<sub>h</sub> = −70 mV), a potassium-based intracellular solution was used (in mM): 122.5 K-gluconate, 17.5 KCl, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 0.4 NaGTP, 10 HEPES, 0.2 EGTA, 2 MgCl, set to pH 7.2–7.3 with KOH.

APs recorded as single units (submerged chamber) were done using standard ACSF in the glass microelectrodes. Data were recorded with MultiClamp 700B and Axopatch 200B amplifiers, sampled at 10 kHz, conditioned using a HumBug 50 Hz noise eliminator (LFP signals only; Quest Scientific), low-pass filtered at 2 kHz, digitized (Digidata 1440A, Molecular Devices, CA) and stored on a hard disc using pCLAMP 10.0 software (Molecular Devices). In all experiments, gamma oscillations were elicited by applying kainic acid (KA, 100 nM) to the extracellular bath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fisahn et al., 2004</xref>).

Gamma power was then calculated as the integrated power spectrum between 20 and 80 Hz. Auto-correlograms were calculated in Clampfit using a 100 ms lag from the same LFP trace used for gamma power calculation. All LFP traces were pre-processed by applying a bandpass filter set to 15–60 Hz (high-pass: RC-single pole, low-pass: Gaussian) using Clampfit software. Auto-correlograms are presented as the average value of all the experiments.</p><p>Coefficient of rhythmicity (Cr) was calculated as a measure of the quality of gamma oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cangiano and Grillner, 2003</xref>) and was defined as Cr=(α-β)/(α+β); α corresponding to the value of the height of the second peak and β to the first trough in the normalized auto-correlogram. Cr ranges between 0 and 1 in which the higher the coefficient, the more rhythmic the analyzed activity. Only recordings having a Cr ≥0.01 were considered rhythmic. In all cases, the frequency predicted by the auto-correlogram was confirmed by the power spectrum of each recording segment analyzed.</p><p>EPSCs and IPSCs were detected off-line using MiniAnalysis software (Synaptosoft, Decatur, GA). Charge transfer, event amplitude and inter-event-interval (IEI) were analyzed using Excel software (Microsoft Office) and GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software) with the results representing average values taken over 1 min period.</p><p>Spike phase-coupling analysis was performed on concomitant LFP and single-cell recordings using Matlab custom-written routines (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref>) in order to relate the PC spiking activity to ongoing gamma oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2012</xref>). To do this, 5-min-long segments from control and experimental condition recordings were used to perform the analysis. LFP were pre-processed using a band-pass filter set to 20–60 Hz (high-pass: RC-single pole, low-pass: Gaussian) in Clampfit. AP were detected by setting an amplitude threshold and the instantaneous phase of gamma oscillation was calculated using a Hilbert transform in order to determine the phase-angle at which each action potential occurred during ongoing oscillations. Phase-angles and gamma oscillation-phases were represented in polar-plots and expressed in radians with the peak of the oscillation cycle corresponding to 0π and the trough corresponding to ±π in the polar plots. In order to search for the synchronization level of AP firing, AP phase-angles frequency-distribution were normalized, a Gaussian function was fitted and the half-width at half-maximum (half-width) was then calculated as a measure of the synchronization level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kurudenkandy et al., 2014</xref>). Considering that the more AP are fired on the same phase-angle the more synchronized the neuronal activity is, an increase in the half-width of the Gaussian curve fitted to the phase-angle distribution indicates a desynchronization of AP firing. The preferred phase-angle was calculated by averaging the AP phase-angles distribution of all the experiments and is represented by an arrow in the polar-plots. To test whether neurons fired in a phase-related manner, all concomitant recordings were tested for circular uniformity using Rayleigh’s test. Only recordings with non-uniform circular distribution (p &lt; 0.05) were considered for the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism.

Your article has been reviewed by two experts, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.

The authors used a hippocampal slice system to investigate mechanisms underlying the β-amyloid-mediated impairments of hippocampal function and gamma oscillations. They report that activation of the TrpV1 receptor by capsaicin rescued those impairments. This study is of potential interest, even though its direct relevance for Alzheimer's disease is not clear. However, a number of points must be addressed satisfactorily, before this manuscript can be considered further.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) In Figure 1A, B, how was the dose (up to 1 μM) of the CB1/CB2 receptor agonist WIN determined? Could the lack of effect have been due to the low concentration of the drug? Was there any independent evidence showing activation of the receptors? Capsaicin, which did have an effect, was used at higher levels, up to 10 μM. What happened when WIN was used at 10 μM?</p><p>2) The effects of inhibiting TrpV1 on gamma power and rhythmicity should also be studied by including Aβ+Cz in Figure 1C-G.</p><p>3) The right-hand part of Figure 3E seems to show half-widths that are very similar between groups, except for one or two data points. Significance appears to rely on a single point. Can the authors please explain?</p><p>4) Figure 4 is confusing, in that capsaicin, which has been used at 10 μM before, is now used at 5 μM. Why this change in concentration compared to the previous experiments? Why do the authors say that they wanted to avoid an increase in concentration? Moreover, the message that Aβ causes desynchronisation of AP firing and that capsaicin can prevent this would be better supported by performing spike raster plots with PSTH/LFP, because this would make it possible to demonstrate more clearly the shift in synchronization.</p><p>5) Why was a different concentration of Aβ used in Figure 6? Please explain. In Figure 6C, the authors claim that TrpV1 activation rescued Aβ-induced degradation of gamma power. To better examine this, they may consider treating hippocampal slices with Aβ alone first, before adding capsaicin, to see if the latter can restore power back to wild-type levels.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37703.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major points:</p><p>1) In Figure 1A, B, how was the dose (up to 1 μM) of the CB1/CB2 receptor agonist WIN determined?

Capsaicin, which did have an effect, was used at higher levels, up to 10 μM. What happened when WIN was used at 10 μM?</p></disp-quote><p>We decided to test WIN at a low concentration (200 nM) because it has been reported that micromolar WIN concentrations (1, 10 µM) can reduce the power of gamma oscillations in the hippocampal area CA3 (Holderith et al., 2011), which would render our assay useless. In order to avoid such an effect on gamma oscillations we decided to use 200 nM WIN to test cannabinoid receptor activation since an even lower concentration (100 nM) had been reported to have cannabinoid receptor-dependent effects in hippocampal neurons (Straiker and Mackie, 2005).</p><p>Even though 1 µM WIN can impair gamma oscillations, we decided to test that concentration to investigate whether the lack of effect of WIN was due to the low concentration used (200 nM). As described in the Results section, this higher WIN concentration also failed to prevent the Aβ-induced degradation of gamma oscillations in our study.</p><p>We decided not to test even higher WIN concentration (for instance 10 µM) to avoid the impairing effect on gamma oscillations. Nonetheless, in order to corroborate our results gained using these low WIN concentrations, we tested two additional, sub-type-specific, cannabinoid receptor agonists: ACEA and JWH 133, which are CB1- and CB2-specific, respectively. As shown in Figure 1, by using these two specific CB1 and CB2 receptor agonists we found similar results compared to the CB1/CB2 agonist WIN and therefore concluded that cannabinoid receptor activation did not have any protective effect against the Aβ-induced degradation of gamma oscillations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The effects of inhibiting TrpV1 on gamma power and rhythmicity should also be studied by including Aβ+Cz in Figure 1C-G.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the requested experiments and have included the data description in the Results subsections “TrpV1 receptor activation prevents Aβ-induced impairment of functional network dynamics” and “TrpV1 receptor activation prevents Aβ-induced reduction of gamma oscillation rhythmicity”. Figure 1 as well as its figure legend were updated with the new Aβ+Cz data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The right-hand part of Figure 3E seems to show half-widths that are very similar between groups, except for one or two data points. Significance appears to rely on a single point.

As can be seen in the summary data sheet (Figure 3, source data files) in 5 out of 7 experiments Aβ increased the half-width.</p><p>To improve the ease of interpretation of this data set we have increased the n by adding 3 more experiments and excluded the experiment with the highest Aβ point value based on it now being a statistical out layer point according to the statistical analysis performed using Graph Pad Prism software. The figures and manuscript were updated in accordance with the new data: see textual additions in the subsections “Desynchronization of pyramidal cell action potentials and shift of excitatory/inhibitory current balance are responsible for impairment of functional network dynamics by Aβ” and “TrpV1 receptor activation prevents Aβ-induced desynchronization of pyramidal cell action potentials”, and new Figure 3 and legend. Please note that we reorganized Figures 3 and 4 following the additional experiments/analyses we performed in response to reviewers’ comment 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 4 is confusing, in that capsaicin, which has been used at 10 μM before, is now used at 5 μM. Why this change in concentration compared to the previous experiments? Why do the authors say that they wanted to avoid an increase in concentration?</p></disp-quote><p>We investigated whether TrpV1 receptor activation by Cp was able to prevent Aβ impairment of the cellular mechanisms responsible for the generation of gamma oscillations by testing first 10 µM Cp in the submerged recording chamber. In contrast with the experiments done using the interface recording chamber (Figure 1 and 2), we found that 10 µM Cp was not able to prevent the Aβ-induced degradation of gamma oscillations (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><p>As we mention in the Results section (subsection “TrpV1 receptor activation prevents Aβ-induced desynchronization of pyramidal cell action potentials”, second paragraph) even though the next approach would be to increase Cp concentration the literature indicates that higher Cp concentrations cause TrpV1-independent effects (Benninger et al., 2008; Boudaka et al., 2007; Cao et al., 2007; Lundbaek et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2014). We have provided an explanation and the references in the Results section (see the aforementioned subsection) and further strong arguments have been assessed in the Discussion section (subsection “Activation state-selective effects on TrpV1-dependent vs. TrpV1-independent mechanisms”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, the message that Aβ causes desynchronisation of AP firing and that capsaicin can prevent this would be better supported by performing spike raster plots with PSTH/LFP, because this would make it possible to demonstrate more clearly the shift in synchronization.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to address the reviewer´s comment we have included new analysis in Figure 3B and Figure 4B and F: A filtered LFP recording showing three cycles of gamma oscillations and the frequency distribution plot of the AP gamma-phase-angles below the LFP signal. The frequency distribution plot shows the AP gamma-phase-angles repeated three times to visualize the AP firing windows during an ongoing gamma oscillation.</p><p>We believe that this display shows more clearly the synchronization level of the PC firing during ongoing gamma oscillations in control and experimental conditions. We also attempted to construct actual raster plots but found the visual results inferior to the one we chose above: Our cells fire too frequently for a visually informative raster plot to be constructed and the data cannot be pooled because every hippocampal slice preparation has a gamma oscillation of different frequency distribution. Tracking phase angles as chosen above appeared better because it is independent of slice gamma frequency/frequency variance. For changes in the manuscript see the subsection “TrpV1 receptor activation prevents Aβ-induced desynchronization of pyramidal cell action potentials” and new Figure 4 and legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Why was a different concentration of Aβ used in Figure 6? Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>Aβ was used at 50 nM for experiments utilizing the interface recording chamber (Figures 1, 2 and 6 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1). When Aβ was applied acutely to the bath in experiments requiring the submerged recording chamber (Figures 3, 4 and 5, Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1) its concentration was increased to 1 µM in order to offset the method-dependent lower signal amplitude in submerged conditions. This approach was discussed and vetted in one of our previous publications (Kurudenkandy et al., 2014).</p><p>Briefly, the signal-to-noise ratio in a setting where the tissue slice is completely submerged in ACSF (typical submerged recording chamber of patch-clamp set-ups) is much lower compared to a setting where the tissue slice sits at the interface between ACSF and humidified air (typical interface recording chamber). In the interface condition the tissue is electrotonically more compact (denser; higher gravity exerted on tissue suspended in air compared to liquid) and the hippocampal network delivers a bigger LFP signal. In submerged conditions the tissue is less compact and the greater volume of surrounding ACSF can shunt part of the signal leading to overall lower signal-to-noise ratio.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 6C, the authors claim that TrpV1 activation rescued Aβ-induced degradation of gamma power. To better examine this, they may consider treating hippocampal slices with Aβ alone first, before adding capsaicin, to see if the latter can restore power back to wild-type levels.</p></disp-quote><p>The experimental approach we used to study the Cp rescue of Aβ-induced degradation of gamma power was performed exactly as the reviewer suggests. To make this clearer we slightly altered the writing in the manuscript to differentiate the various experimental groups we used for Figure 6. We have re-written the Results section relating to Figure 6 to better explain the experimental conditions used (subsection “TrpV1 receptor activation rescues Aβ-induced impairment of functional network dynamics”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
