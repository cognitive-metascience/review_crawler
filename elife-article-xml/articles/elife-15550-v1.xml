etiologically-diverse degenerative diseases linked to excessive extracellular protein misfolding and aggregation. Reprogramming of the ER proteostasis environment through genetic activation of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR)-associated transcription factor ATF6 attenuates secretion and extracellular aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins. Here, we employed a screening approach that included complementary arm-specific UPR reporters and medium-throughput transcriptional profiling to identify non-toxic small molecules that phenocopy the ATF6-mediated reprogramming of the ER proteostasis environment. The ER reprogramming afforded by our molecules requires activation of endogenous ATF6 and occurs independent of global ER stress. Furthermore, our molecules phenocopy the ability of genetic ATF6 activation to selectively reduce secretion and extracellular aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins. These results show that small molecule-dependent ER reprogramming, achieved through preferential activation of the ATF6 transcriptional program, is a promising strategy to ameliorate imbalances in ER function associated with degenerative protein aggregation diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15550.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15550.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15550.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Newly made proteins must be folded into specific three-dimensional shapes before they can perform their roles in cells. Many proteins are folded in a compartment called the endoplasmic reticulum before being transported to their final location. However, if a cell suddenly needs to make a large number of new proteins, it can overwhelm the endoplasmic reticulum and unfolded proteins may accumulate. The cell responds to this stress by activating the unfolded protein response, which increases the folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum to match the demand. However, if the stress persists, then the unfolded protein response instructs the cell to die to protect the rest of the body.</p><p>A protein called ATF6 is involved in one branch of the unfolded protein response. Endoplasmic reticulum stress causes ATF6 to move from the endoplasmic reticulum to another cell compartment where certain enzymes are able to cut the protein. A fragment of ATF6 then moves to the nucleus of the cell to activate genes needed to increase the cell’s capacity to fold proteins.</p><p>Errors in protein folding can cause serious diseases in humans and other animals. Drugs that target ATF6 might be able to regulate part of the unfolded protein response to treat these diseases. However, no drugs that act on ATF6 had been identified. Now, two groups of researchers have independently identified small molecules that specifically target ATF6.</p><p>Plate et al. used a new approach to screen over 600,000 small molecules and identified a small number that could activate ATF6-regulated genes without inducing global endoplasmic reticulum stress. Further experiments tested whether any of these ATF6 drug candidates could prevent the release of incorrectly folded versions of two particular proteins from cells that are associated with types of amyloid disease in humans. One of the small molecules tested effectively reduced the release of these proteins and prevented harmful deposits of the proteins forming in the spaces surrounding cells.</p><p>In an independent study, Gallagher et al. identified a type of small molecule that can inhibit the activity of ATF6. Together, these findings may lead to further development of new drugs for treating diseases associated with incorrect protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

of the human proteome is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for folding and trafficking to downstream secretory pathway environments, including the extracellular space. These secreted proteins engage ER-localized protein homeostasis (or proteostasis) factors such as chaperones and folding enzymes to facilitate their folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brodsky and Skach, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Powers et al., 2009</xref>). Proteins unable to fold in the ER are identified by ER proteostasis factors that direct them towards the proteasome (via ER-associated degradation) or lysosome for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brodsky and Skach, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2011</xref>). This partitioning toward degradation pathways prevents the folding and trafficking of destabilized, misfolding-prone proteins from the ER, which could aggregate into proteotoxic conformations in downstream secretory environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brodsky and Skach, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Powers et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Many degenerative diseases result from imbalances in ER proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hipp et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luheshi et al., 2008</xref>). The aberrant secretion of properly folded, but destabilized aggregation-prone proteins facilitates extracellular proteotoxic aggregation associated with many amyloid diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tipping et al., 2015</xref>). Examples include the transthyretin (TTR) or light chain (AL) amyloidoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blancas-Mejia and Ramirez-Alvarado, 2013</xref>). Similarly, the inability to efficiently degrade destabilized, aggregation-prone variants of secreted proteins such as rhodopsin and α-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) facilitates their proteotoxic intracellular aggregation linked to retinitis pigmentosa and liver disease, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gooptu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin and Lavail, 2010</xref>).</p><p>One strategy to ameliorate the above-mentioned and related diseases is to transcriptionally reprogram the ER proteostasis network (ER PN), which has the potential to increase the ER’s capacity to identify destabilized, misfolding-prone proteins and prevent their secretion to downstream secretory environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calamini and Morimoto, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gestwicki and Garza, 2012</xref>). ER PN remodeling can be achieved by activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), comprising three signaling pathways activated downstream of the ER stress sensing proteins IRE1, ATF6, and PERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). In response to the accumulation of misfolded proteins within the ER (i.e., ER stress), these sensors are activated, resulting in ER PN reprogramming predominantly mediated by the UPR-associated transcription factors XBP1s and ATF6. These transcription factors induce distinct, but overlapping, transcriptional programs that alter the composition of ER PN pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shoulders et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yamamoto et al., 2004</xref>). Intriguingly, preferential ATF6-mediated reprogramming of the ER PN offers a unique opportunity to alter the fate of disease-associated proteins. Genetic activation of the ATF6 transcriptional program attenuates intracellular accumulation of mutant rhodopsin and the Z-variant of A1AT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chiang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, stress-independent chemical genetic activation of a ligand-regulated ATF6 attenuates the secretion and extracellular aggregation of destabilized, amyloidogenic variants of TTR or immunoglobulin light chains (LCs), without significantly impacting secretion of stable, non-amyloidogenic variants of these proteins or the global endogenous secreted proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cooley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shoulders et al., 2013</xref>). These results suggest that small molecules that similarly induce preferential ER PN remodeling through pharmacologic activation of the ATF6 transcriptional program should attenuate the aberrant secretion and aggregation of these proteins linked to degenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Traditionally, UPR signaling is activated using small molecule ER stressors such as the SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin (Tg) or tunicamycin (Tm), an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). However, chronic addition of these ER stressors induces apoptosis, predominantly through activation of the PERK arm of the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hetz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tabas and Ron, 2011</xref>). Small molecule kinase inhibitors and ATP mimetics have been shown to activate the IRE1/XBP1s arm of the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mendez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Papa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2012</xref>).

These results highlight the need for further development of molecules that preferentially activate UPR-associated transcriptional programs, such as that regulated by ATF6, to define the benefit of ER PN reprogramming to ameliorate protein aggregation diseases and protein misfolding diseases.</p><p>A challenge in identifying such compounds is the difficulty associated with efficiently assessing the preferential activation of a sub-transcriptional pathway that is part of a highly integrated signaling network (e.g., the ATF6 arm of the UPR). An increasing proportion of failed clinical trials have highlighted the importance of the early elimination of compounds functioning through off-target effects, which can be achieved using multidimensional assays such as gene expression profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Verbist et al., 2015</xref>). The use of a transcriptional profiling approach early in the drug discovery process and before functional assessment allows for the identification of promising small molecules that preferentially activate a target transcriptional program, instead of global network activation. However this strategy has only been employed in a small number of drug development programs and has not been used to identify small molecule activators of a sub-UPR transcriptional program, such as that regulated by ATF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antipova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stegmaier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stegmaier et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Here, we employ a cell-based high-throughput screen (HTS) in combination with transcriptional profiling to identify non-toxic small molecules that preferentially activate the ATF6 transcriptional program, independent of global UPR activation. Small molecule ER proteostasis regulators identified by our screening strategy mimic the ER PN reprogramming afforded by chemical genetic ATF6 activation, through a process dependent on endogenous ATF6. Furthermore, our small molecule ER proteostasis regulators phenocopy the ability of chemical genetic ATF6 activation to preferentially decrease the secretion and proteotoxic aggregation of destabilized, amyloidogenic proteins without affecting the secretion of stable, non-amyloidogenic proteins or the global endogenous secreted proteome. These results highlight the utility of transcriptional profiling upstream of functional studies as part of a multi-tiered screening strategy to identify small molecule ER proteostasis regulators that can be employed to ameliorate imbalances in ER function involved in aggregation-associated degenerative diseases and possibly loss-of-function protein misfolding diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cell-based high-throughput screen to identify small molecule ER proteostasis regulators</title><p>We employed a three-tiered screening strategy to identify small molecules that preferentially activate the ATF6 UPR transcriptional program for ER PN reprogramming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

These results reveal a new strategy to identify small molecules that reprogram the ER PN and correct imbalances in ER function through preferential activation of a specific sub-UPR transcriptional program.</p><p>Our phenotypic screening approach sought to identify small molecule ER proteostasis regulators that activated the ATF6 transcriptional program, without placing a constraint for the compounds to act directly on ATF6. Nonetheless, prioritized compounds such as <bold>147</bold> and <bold>263</bold> function through a mechanism that requires endogenous ATF6. ATF6 is activated through a mechanism distinct to that utilized by the two other arms of the UPR. In response to ER stress, ATF6 traffics to the Golgi where it is endoproteolytically processed by S1P and S2P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ye et al., 2000</xref>). This releases the ATF6 bZIP transcription factor into the cytosol, facilitating its translocation to the nucleus where it promotes induction of the ATF6 transcriptional program. ATF6 is not known to contain any allosteric small molecule binding sites. Thus, it is likely that our molecules promote ATF6 activation through interactions with proteins that regulate its activity such as BiP and the PDIs. Both of these are predicted to be involved in initiating ATF6 trafficking to the Golgi, although their role in this process remains poorly defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nadanaka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shen et al., 2002</xref>). Our small molecules could also preferentially induce ATF6 activity by targeting or mimicking metabolites required for activation of this pathway. Previous work shows that PERK and IRE1 can be activated independent of ATF6 in response to alterations in cellular lipid composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Volmer et al., 2013</xref>) but no such mechanism has been reported for ATF6 to date.</p><p>Interestingly, ER proteostasis regulators identified in our screen appear to preferentially induce ATF6 activation through distinct mechanisms. This is evident for molecules such as <bold>263</bold>, which demonstrates varying levels of <italic>BiP</italic> induction in distinct cell types (e.g., <bold>263</bold> induces <italic>BiP</italic> in HEK293T and HepG2 cells, but not in ALMC-2 cells). This is in contrast to compound <bold>147</bold> that activates the ATF6 pathway in all cell types tested. This capacity to activate ATF6 in a cell type specific fashion could be harnessed to define the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in ATF6 activation and develop compounds that induce tissue-selective ER PN remodeling. As we continue to optimize the potency and ATF6 selectivity of these small molecule ER proteostasis regulators, new insights into the molecular pathways that regulate ATF6 activity will likely emerge.</p><p>One mechanism by which the ATF6 transcriptional program influences ER function is by increasing the stringency of ER protein quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Stress-independent ATF6 activation selectively attenuates the secretion and subsequent proteotoxic aggregation of destabilized, disease-associated proteins without affecting the secretion of the endogenous proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chiang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cooley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shoulders et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2011</xref>). Our top small molecule ER proteostasis regulators (e.g., <bold>147</bold>) phenocopy the ability of chemical genetic ATF6 activation to selectively reduce secretion of destabilized, disease-associated variants of amyloidogenic proteins such as TTR and immunoglobulin LC. This suggests that our small molecules could similarly phenocopy the ATF6-dependent reductions in the trafficking and intracellular aggregation of destabilized, aggregation-prone proteins associated with other gain-of-toxicity protein misfolding diseases (e.g., A1AT-Z aggregation in liver disease and rhodopsin aggregation in retinal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chiang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2011</xref>)). Thus, small molecule ER proteostasis regulators identified herein have the potential to broadly ameliorate degenerative diseases associated with aggregation of secretory proteins.</p><p>The long-term consequences of periodic pharmacologic activation of the ATF6 arm of the UPR are unclear. Mechanism-based toxicity associated with adapting ER proteostasis to ameliorate secretory protein misfolding and/or aggregation is possible. While some small molecule ER proteostasis regulators identified show mild toxicity, a subset of compounds, especially compounds that preferentially activate the ATF6 transcriptional program (e.g., <bold>147</bold>), show no significant toxicity across multiple cell models. This likely reflects the limited activation of the IRE1/XBP1s and PERK arms of the UPR afforded by these molecules, minimizing apoptosis signaling induced downstream of these two UPR signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hetz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tabas and Ron, 2011</xref>). The moderate levels of ATF6 activation achieved using our small molecule ER proteostasis regulators likely also minimize pathologic imbalances in ER function. It is known that high levels of ATF6 activation induce hepatic steatosis in zebrafish, whereas lower levels do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Howarth et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, the low molecular weight and structural simplicity of the small molecules identified by our multi-tiered screening strategy (e.g., <bold>147</bold>) provides a significant amount of chemical space that can be explored through structure-activity relationships to optimize potency, selectivity and dosing regimens, while minimizing toxicity.</p><p>Several of our prioritized molecules include functional groups found in pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baell and Walters, 2014</xref>), but given that these ER proteostasis regulators showed activity in multiple complementary screening assays, they are unlikely to act through off-target pathways. Consistent with this, the molecules depend on ATF6 and its canonical activation pathway for the induction of ATF6 target genes. Furthermore, the RNA-Seq and proteomics profiling analysis for <bold>147</bold> and <bold>263</bold> confirmed that these molecules exert very little off-target transcriptome changes and proteome remodeling apart from preferential ER PN activation. Both <bold>147</bold> and <bold>263</bold> contain functional groups that after metabolic oxidation to a quinone methide could modify proteins covalently. This suggests that the covalent modification of ATF6 or a protein involved in the regulation of ATF6 activity (e.g., BiP or PDIs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nadanaka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shen et al., 2002</xref>) by our small molecules could be involved in the activation mechanism. Future medicinal chemistry efforts will focus on exploring the mechanism of action of these compounds and the potential involvement of covalent protein modification for their activity.</p><p>The establishment of ER proteostasis regulators, such as <bold>147</bold>, provides a unique opportunity to define the underlying molecular mechanism(s) of ATF6 activation and to probe the involvement of ATF6 in regulating ER PN function. These molecules also represent a valuable resource to define the therapeutic potential of ATF6 transcriptional program activation to correct pathologic imbalances in ER proteostasis in cellular and animal models of protein misfolding and aggregation diseases. As we continue to develop our top small molecule ER proteostasis regulators through medicinal chemistry, we will establish second generation molecules that optimize ER PN reprogramming to ameliorate pathologic imbalances in ER proteostasis associated with diverse protein aggregation diseases such as the systemic amyloidosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Compounds</title><p>All compounds were obtained from the commercial vendors listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 3</xref> and were used without further purification by dissolving in sterile dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).

Fraction secreted was calculated using the equation: fraction secreted = [extracellular [<sup>35</sup>S]-TTR signal at t / (extracellular [<sup>35</sup>S]-TTR signal at t=0 + intracellular [<sup>35</sup>S]-TTR signal at t=0)]. Fraction remaining was calculated using the equation: [(extracellular [<sup>35</sup>S]-TTR signal at t + intracellular [<sup>35</sup>S]-TTR signal at t) / (extracellular [<sup>35</sup>S]-TTR signal at t=0 + intracellular [<sup>35</sup>S]-TTR signal at t=0)].</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Immunoblotting, SDS-PAGE and immunoprecipitation</title><p>For immunoblotting, cells were lysed in 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5 containing 0.1% TritonX (Fisher Scientific) and supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). For immunoblots of endogenous ATF6, cells were washed in PBS containing protease inhibitor cocktail and 10 µM MG-132 and subsequently lysed in 1x Laemmli buffer, supplemented in the same way, by repeating cycles of boiling and vortexing. Protein lysate concentrations were normalized by Bradford (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) or BCA assay (Thermo Fisher). Lysates or media were boiled for 5 min in Laemmli buffer + 100 mM DTT before loading onto SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were transferred from gel slabs to nitrocellulose, and the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences) was used to detect proteins of interest.</p><p>For immunoprecipitations, cells were washed with PBS then cross-linked with 0.5 mM Dithiobis(succinimidiyl propionate) (DSP) for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by addition of 100 mM Tris pH 7.5, then RIPA buffer was added to the cell pellets for lysis. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at centrifuged at 10000 x <italic>g</italic> for 15 min. Proteins were immunopurified using sheep polyclonal free λ LC antibody (Bethyl Laboratories A80-127A, Montgomery, TX) that was covalently conjugated to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare). After four washes in RIPA buffer, proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli buffer + 100 mM DTT and samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were probed with the following primary antibodies: monoclonal mouse M2 anti-FLAG (1:500, Sigma Aldrich), polyclonal rabbit anti-TTR (1:1000, Dako, Carpinteria, CA), rabbit polyclonal anti-human lambda light chain (1:1000, Bethyl Laboratories A90-112A), mouse monoclonal anti-Grp78 (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-166490, Dallas, TX), rabbit polyclonal anti-Grp94 (1:1000, GeneTex GTX103203, Irvine, CA), rabbit polyclonal anti-PDIA4 (1:1000, Proteintech Group 14712-1-AP, Rosemont, IL), mouse monoclonal anti-ATF6α (1–7) (BioAcademia, 1:1000, Osaka, Japan), rabbit anti-phospho eIF2α (CellSignaling Technologies #9721, 1:500, Danvers, MA), mouse anti-eIF2α (Abcam ab5369, 1:1000) and mouse monoclonal anti β-actin (1:10000, Sigma Aldrich).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Light chain ELISA</title><p>ALMC-2 or KAS-6/1 plasma cells were plated 100,000 cells/well in 150 µL of media in 96-well MultiScreen<sub>HTS</sub> filtration plates (EMD Millipore MSBVS1210, Billerica, MA). Triplicate wells were treated with DMSO or compounds at the indicated concentrations and incubated for 16 hr. Media was removed by filtration using a QIAvac 96 vaccuum manifold (Qiagen) and wells were washed two times with 150 µL media. Wells were then incubated with 150 µL of fresh media for 2 hr and the conditioned media was harvested into a 96-well plate using the vacuum manifold. Free LC and IgG concentrations were determined by ELISA in 96-well plates (Immulon 4HBX, Thermo Fisher). Wells were coated overnight at 37 ºC with sheep polyclonal free λ LC antibody (Bethyl Laboratories, A80-127A) at a 1:500 dilution or human IgG-heavy and light chain antibody (Bethyl Laboratories, A80-118A) at a 1:2000 dilution in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6). In between all incubation steps, the plates were rinsed extensively with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST). Plates were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST for 1 hr at 37ºC. Media analytes were diluted between 5 – 200 fold in 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST and 100 µL of each sample was added to individual wells. Light chain or IgG standards ranging from 3 – 300 ng/mL were prepared from purified human Bence Jones λ light chain or human reference serum (Bethyl Laboratories, P80-127 and RS10-110). Plates were incubated at 37 ºC for 1.5 hr while shaking. Finally, HRP-conjugated goat anti-human λ light chain antibody (Bethyl Laboratories, A80-116P) was added at a 1:5,000 dilution or HRP-conjugate IgG-Fc fragment cross-adsorbed antibody (Bethyl Laboratories, A80-304P, 1:30,000 dilution) was added in 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST, followed by a 1.5 hr incubation of the plates at 37 ºC. The detection was carried out with 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS, 0.18 mg/mL) and 0.03% hydrogen peroxide in 100 mM sodium citrate pH 4.0. Detection solution (100 µL) was added to each well and the plates were incubated at room temperature. The absorbance was recorded at 405 nm and the values for the LC standards were fitted to a 4-parameter logistic function. Light chain or IgG concentrations were averaged from at least 3 independent replicates under each treatment and then normalized to vehicle conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Conditioned media aggregation and blue-native PAGE</title><p>ALMC-2 plasma cells were plated 2 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/well in 1 mL of media in 12-well plates. Wells were treated with DMSO or 10 µL of compounds and incubated for 16 hr. Cells were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and washed two times in media. Small aliquots (10 µL) of cells were removed for a cytotoxicity assay as described above. Cells were resuspended in media (1 mL for DMSO treatment) and the volume was adjusted for each treatment based on cell viability. Cells were conditioned in the media for 8 hr and then were removed by centrifugation. The media samples were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 ºC with recombinant Protein A – Sepharose 4B resin (Life Technologies) to remove fully assembled IgGs that interfere with LC aggregate detection. Cleared media samples were then heated to 55 ºC for 8 hr to induce LC aggregation, added to Blue-Native PAGE loading dye (10% glycerol, 0.5% Coomassie G-250) and then loaded onto 3–12% Bis-Tris gradient gels (Life Technologies). The cathode buffer contained 50 mM Tricene and 15 mM Bis-Tris, pH 7.0 with 0.02% Coomassie G-250. The anode buffer contained 50 mM Bis-Tris pH 7.0. The gels were transferred onto PVDF membranes and LC was detected by rabbit anti-human λ light chain polyclonal antibody (Bethyl Laboratories), followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. The blots were imaged using a chemiluminescence substrate (Luminata Forte Western Luminescence Substrate, EMD Millipore) and imaged with a ChemiDoc XRS+ scanner (Bio-Rad).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Randal Kaufman for providing ATF6<sup>+/+</sup> and ATF6<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman as the Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Davis Ng, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors set out to discover small molecule modifiers of the mammalian unfolded protein response, with the ultimate goal of testing such compounds as therapeutics for some types of conformational disease. In this study, they wished to &quot;drug&quot; the ATF6 pathway of the UPR by specifically elevating it to enhance quality control mechanisms and prevent the secretion of amyloidogenic proteins. The approach is to screen compounds in cultured cells carrying an ATF6 specific reporter and filtering upregulation hits through secondary screens for quiescence of the other branches. In this way, no specific factor was targeted. Because the transcriptional programs of each pathway were already intensely studied, the authors use gene sets defined by previous studies to further categorize each compound. The authors screened over 600,000 compounds and found 281 that activated the ERSE reporter, with 200 of those displaying reduced activity for the IRE1 pathway. UPR target gene transcriptional profiling filtered out 79 compounds that more strongly activate the ATF6 pathway. Of those, 3 (<bold>132</bold>, <bold>147</bold>, <bold>263</bold>) were used for detailed analyses. Genome wide mRNAseq and proteomic profiling was performed on cells treated with these compounds. <bold>132</bold> is the strongest inducer but it activates all three pathways. <bold>147</bold> and <bold>263</bold> are more specific for the ATF6 pathway but does so more weakly than <bold>132</bold>. All three activate ATF6 processing and can reduce the secretion of TTR and ALLC amyloidogenic molecules. Co-immunoprecipitation and cyclohexemide chase experiments indicate that retention is not accompanied by enhanced ER-associated degradation.</p><p>In short, this is a carefully performed study that yielded a new class of small molecule modifiers that preferentially activate the ATF6 pathway of the mammalian UPR. For a complex screen, the experimental design is efficient and included detailed validation of the compounds' actions in cells. Although the identity of their direct targets remain unclear, these are important advances that will be of interest to the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This manuscript contains a vast amount of data, which is somewhat overwhelming in places. I see the only weakness of the manuscript in the presentation of the data, but a redesign of the manuscript should be sufficient to make this work accessible for a wider audience. Specifically, it is necessary to explain the overall screen design in a clearer fashion, and explain the selection of the &quot;preferential activators&quot;, especially since some of them do not match the criteria of the counterscreen, and don't show selectivity for ATF6 (e.g. compound 238). The third screening step (transcriptional profiling) needs to be explained in more detail. For the remainder of the manuscript it would be helpful if the authors then focus on just the compounds that are characterized in detail in the last parts of the manuscript (e.g. just <bold>147</bold> and perhaps additionally <bold>263</bold>).</p><p>1) One concern is that each of the prioritized compounds have known chemical liabilities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The phenolic groups of catechols are often associated with promiscuous protein interactions and they have known issues related to rapid metabolism. Similarly, the nitroso- groups (<bold>263</bold>, <bold>148</bold>) are prone to reduction and the N-N and N-O bonds (5, 145, 148, 258) have been recognized as problematic at multiple stages of probe discovery and a couple compounds (<bold>238</bold>, <bold>132</bold>) have predicted unsaturated ketone-based Michael acceptors. While a full structure-activity campaign for each chemical series is well beyond the scope of the study, it seems prudent to understand whether the liabilities are essential for activity. Can the phenolic groups be protected as methyl esters? Replaced? Is activity reversible after washout or are the Michael acceptors indicative of a covalent mechanism? This issue seems important because other groups might start using these compounds to preferentially activate the ATF6 arm in their own work, so one extra step of focusing on the most promising 1-2 chemical series seems appropriate. This is especially true because the ATF6 target has already been validated by the author's previous work, so the biology per se is not breaking new ground, creating an opportunity for more advanced medicinal/chemical biology as the focus of the work. Based on the number of chemical liabilities, it seems possible that 50% or more of the prioritized series will be pruned by the immediate next step of triage.</p><p>2) The ALMC-2 data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) shows some statistically significant and potentially exciting, effects on the secretion of light chain. To provide more confidence in the significance of the results and to understand the therapeutic window, it seems important to include dose dependence for both LC secretion, IgG levels and cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C</xref>).

To address this recommendation, we have substantially rewritten the Results section describing how we prioritized our top 8 small molecule ER proteostasis regulators. Notably, our ranking of compounds was based primarily on the MGE data, which provides a more thorough and rich dataset as compared to our reporter data.</p><p>Importantly, <bold>238</bold> was included in the MGE counterscreen because it was identified as one of the top 281 compounds that activated ATF6 in our primary and validation screening using the ERSE-FLuc reporter. While it did not show preferential activation of the XBP1-RLuc reporter, as indicated by the reviewer, it did show preferential activation of ATF6 target genes in our MGE data. This preferential activation of ATF6 target genes combined with the unique structure of this compound is the reason this molecule was prioritized as one of our 8 compounds selected for follow-up. The changes to the text of the revised manuscript relevant to this topic are found directly below:</p><p>“As a final filter, we performed multiplex gene expression (MGE) profiling in HEK293T-Rex cells treated with the 281 hits to directly monitor transcriptional changes and identify compounds that preferentially active the ATF6 transcriptional program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). […] Only catechols (cluster A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1 —figure supplement 1B-C</xref>) were mostly excluded, as these are known to be associated with adverse pharmacology (Baell and Holloway, 2010).”</p><p><italic>1) One concern is that each of the prioritized compounds have known chemical liabilities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The phenolic groups of catechols are often associated with promiscuous protein interactions and they have known issues related to rapid metabolism.

We also noted that many of our prioritized molecules contain functional groups found in pan- assay interference compounds (PAINS), including those highlighted in the above comment. The concern about these types of molecules primarily results from potential off-pathway effects that could compromise experimental analysis of their efficacy. Despite the presence of these PAIN functional groups, these compounds phenocopy genetic ATF6 activation in multiple complementary assays. In addition, RNA-seq and proteomic profiling confirms that these molecules exert very little off-pathway effects. This level of compound characterization provides a wealth of information to facilitate the efforts of researchers interested in using our molecules to ensure efficient ATF6 activation in their experimental systems. Consistent with this statement, we have distributed these molecules to &gt;10 laboratories already, all of whom have recapitulated the preferential ATF6 activation in a variety of cell systems including multiple mammalian cell lines, stem cells, and primary cells. We address the presence of these PAIN functional groups in the revised manuscript text found directly below:</p><p>“Several of our prioritized molecules include functional groups found in pan-assayinterference compounds (PAINS) (Baell and Walters, 2014), but given that these ER proteostasis regulators showed activity in multiple complementary screening assays, they are unlikely to act through off-target pathways. Consistent with this, the molecules depend on ATF6 and its canonical activation pathway for the induction of ATF6 target genes. Furthermore, the RNA-Seq and proteomics profiling analysis for <bold>147</bold> and <bold>263</bold> confirmed that these molecules exert very little off-target transcriptome changes and proteome remodelling apart from preferential ER proteostasis network activation.”</p><p>In addition, our top two molecules <bold>147</bold> &amp; <bold>263</bold> both contain functional groups that can be metabolically oxidized to a quinone methide, which can in turn form covalent adducts with proteins at nucleophilic residues such as Cys. In <bold>147</bold>, this functional group is the 2-amino-<italic>p</italic>-cresol. We have performed a substantial amount of medicinal chemistry to define the specific importance of this 2-amino-<italic>p</italic>-cresol in the <bold>147</bold>-dependent induction of ATF6 target genes. Removal of either the methyl group or hydroxyl substituent completely ablates compound-dependent activation of the ERSE-luciferase reporter. Furthermore, replacing the methyl group with a trifluoromethyl group – which will prevent oxidation to the quinone methide – also ablates ERSE-luciferase activation. These results demonstrate that the 2-amino-<italic>p</italic>-cresol of <bold>147</bold> is required for ATF6 activation.</p><p>Furthermore, these results support a mechanism for <bold>147</bold> activity involving oxidation and subsequent modification of proteins involved in regulating ATF6 activity. We have taken advantage of this covalent mechanism to identify targets of <bold>147</bold> involved in preferential ATF6 activation. We synthesized an active <bold>147</bold> analog that contains an alkyne handle. Using this compound, we can isolate <bold>147</bold>-protein adducts that have been subsequently identified by mass spectrometry. Initial experiments using this approach reveal that <bold>147</bold> covalently modifies only a few proteins, most of which localize to the ER lumen. We are currently using genetic approaches to identify the specific proteins whose modification is required for <bold>147</bold>-dependent ATF6 activation. In addition, we are using this alkyne modified <bold>147</bold> to compare the mechanism of action for other ER proteostasis regulators identified through this approach using a competition-based assay. A manuscript describing these results is currently in the latter stages of preparation.</p><p>While we appreciate the reviewer’s request to include some of this medicinal chemistry in this current manuscript, presenting only a portion of these results would probably frustrate the reader, especially since we are 1-2 months away from finishing the experiments required for this follow-up manuscript. Since our medicinal chemistry efforts are emerging as a highly cohesive story to explain the mechanism of action for one of our preferential ATF6 activators (<bold>147</bold>), we feel that these results should not be included in this current manuscript. Instead, this cohesive story is better suited for a fast following manuscript focused on the mechanism(s) of small molecule-dependent ATF6 activation, potentially as an <italic>eLife</italic> Research Advance to be paired with this current manuscript. We do discuss the potential involvement of quinone methide formation in the compound <bold>147</bold>-dependent ATF6 activation described in this manuscript. This new discussion is included in the revised manuscript as below:</p><p>“Both <bold>147</bold> and <bold>263</bold> contain functional groups that after metabolic oxidation to aquinone methide could modify proteins covalently. This suggests that the covalent modification of ATF6 or a protein involved in the regulation of ATF6 activity (e.g. BiP or PDIs) (Nadanaka et al., 2007; Shen et al., 2002) by our small molecules could be involved in the activation mechanism. Future medicinal chemistry efforts will focus on exploring the mechanism of action of these compounds and the potential involvement of covalent protein modification for their activity.”</p><p><italic>2) The ALMC-2 data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) shows some statistically significant and potentially exciting, effects on the secretion of light chain. To provide more confidence in the significance of the results and to understand the therapeutic window, it seems important to include dose dependence for both LC secretion, IgG levels and cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C</xref>). Single concentration / single timepoint comparisons are difficult to interpret or rank order.</italic></p><p>We agree, and we now include a dose-response curve for <bold>147</bold> treatment in ALMC-2 cells measuring both viability and ALLC secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Since <bold>263</bold> does not significantly influence ALLC secretion at the highest concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), we did not include a dose response for this molecule. Furthermore, since we have removed discussion of other molecules in this figure, as suggested by the reviewers, we do not include dose responses for these other molecules.</p></body></sub-article></article>
