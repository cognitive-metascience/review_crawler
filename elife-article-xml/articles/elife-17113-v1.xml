How the initial contractions are established and the downstream consequences of the earliest contractile function on cardiac differentiation and morphogenesis have not been described. Using high-resolution live imaging of mouse embryos, we observed randomly distributed spontaneous asynchronous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-oscillations (SACOs) in the forming cardiac crescent (stage E7.75) prior to overt beating. Nascent contraction initiated at around E8.0 and was associated with sarcomeric assembly and rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, underpinned by sequential expression of the Na<sup>+</sup>-Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (NCX1) and L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (LTCC). Pharmacological inhibition of NCX1 and LTCC revealed rapid development of Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling in the early heart and an essential early role for NCX1 in establishing SACOs through to the initiation of beating. NCX1 blockade impacted on CaMKII signalling to down-regulate cardiac gene expression, leading to impaired differentiation and failed crescent maturation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17113.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17113.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17113.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The heart is the first organ to form and to begin working in an embryo during pregnancy. It must begin pumping early to supply oxygen and nutrients to the developing embryo. Coordinated contractions of specialised muscle cells in the heart, called cardiomyocytes, generate the force needed to pump blood. The flow of calcium ions into and out of the cardiomyocytes triggers these heartbeats. In addition to triggering heart contractions, calcium ions also act as a messenger that drives changes in which genes are active in the cardiomyocytes and how these cells behave.</p><p>Scientists commonly think of the first heartbeat as occurring after a tube-like structure forms in the embryo that will eventually develop into the heart. However, it is not yet clear how the first heartbeat starts or how the initial heartbeats affect further heart development.</p><p>Tyser, Miranda et al. now show that the first heartbeat actually occurs much earlier in embryonic development than widely appreciated. In the experiments, videos of live mouse embryos showed that prior to the first heartbeat the flow of calcium ions between different cardiomyocytes is not synchronised. However, as the heart grows these calcium flows become coordinated leading to the first heartbeat. The heartbeats also become faster as the heart grows. Using drugs to block the movement of calcium ions, Tyser, Miranda et al. also show that a protein called NCX1 is required to trigger the calcium flows prior to the first heartbeat. Moreover, the experiments revealed that these early heartbeats help drive the growth of cardiomyocytes and shape the developing heart.</p><p>Together, the experiments show that the first heartbeats are essential for normal heart development. Future studies are needed to determine what controls the speed of the first heartbeats, and what organises the calcium flows that trigger the first heartbeat. Such studies may help scientists better understand birth defects of the heart, and may suggest strategies to rebuild hearts that have been damaged by a heart attack or other injury.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17113.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17113.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>heart</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>contraction</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>cardiomyocyte differentiation</kwd><kwd>cardiac crescent</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>4-year DPhil programme FS/12/69/3008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tyser</surname><given-names>Richard CV</given-names></name><name><surname>Miranda</surname><given-names>Antonio MA</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BHF Oxbridge Regenerative Medicine Centre RM/13/3/30159</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Srinivas</surname><given-names>Shankar</given-names></name><name><surname>Riley</surname><given-names>Paul R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>REI BB/F011512/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Srinivas</surname><given-names>Shankar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WTSIA 103788/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Srinivas</surname><given-names>Shankar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>105031/C/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Srinivas</surname><given-names>Shankar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CH/11/1/28798</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Riley</surname><given-names>Paul R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-12"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG/13/9/303269</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Riley</surname><given-names>Paul R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>High-resolution live imaging reveals how and when the mouse heart first starts to beat during development and how the onset of beating impacts on heart muscle cell maturation and heart formation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The heart is the first organ to form and function during mammalian embryonic development. In the mouse, mesoderm originating from the primitive streak forms a bilateral pool of progenitor cells that at E7.5 give rise to the cardiac crescent (CC). The CC subsequently expands and migrates to the midline whereupon, between E8.25 and E8.5, the two sides of the CC fuse and form the linear heart tube (LHT) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buckingham et al., 2005</xref>). The first cardiac contractions have been described during the transition from CC to LHT. Studies of heart development in model organisms have historically focused on the origin and spatial-temporal allocation of cardiac progenitors and cardiovascular lineage determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buckingham et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saga et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meilhac et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moretti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evans et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Devine et al., 2014</xref>). Whilst insight into the identification and regulation of cardiac cell types is important for improved understanding of congenital heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruneau, 2008</xref>), an anatomical and cellular bias has overlooked a role for the onset of cardiac function. Early descriptions of initial cardiac contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Navaratnam et al., 1986</xref>), including suggested pacemaker activity on either side of the embryonic midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goss, 1952</xref>), as well as optical mapping of spontaneous action potentials performed in both chicken (7 somite stage) and rat (3-somite stage) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujii et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hirota et al., 1985</xref>), have been informative, but lack resolution. Subsequent studies in mouse (3-somite stage) could only infer early electrical activity based on irregular fluctuations in basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nishii and Shibata, 2006</xref>). Given the forming heart contracts from an early stage, this raises the important question of when and how contractile activity of cardiomyocytes is first initiated during development and to what extent this influences the progression of differentiation and subsequent cardiac morphogenesis. This is especially important as the forces exerted by cardiac contractions have been shown in several models to be required for proper heart development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Granados-Riveron and Brook, 2012</xref>), and to modulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miyasaka et al., 2011</xref>) at later developmental stages.</p><p>In mature cardiomyocytes, coordinated electrical excitation is coupled to physical contraction in a process termed excitation contraction coupling (ECC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bers, 2002</xref>). ECC relies on changes in the intracellular concentration of the second messenger Ca<sup>2+</sup> via release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in a process termed Ca<sup>2+</sup> induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (CICR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fabiato and Fabiato, 1979</xref>). Increases in the concentration of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> result in cardiomyocyte contraction due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to troponin and myofilament activation. ECC involves a number of specific proteins including L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (LTCC, sarcolemmal Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx), ryanodine receptors (RyR2, SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release), the sarco (endo) plasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (SERCA, SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake) and the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (NCX, Sarcolemmal Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux). Targeted disruption of genes encoding ECC proteins in mice has shown that contractile activity of immature cardiomyocytes does not require ECC. Embryonic cardiomyocytes have a less developed SR and T-tubule system as well as an increased requirement for sarcolemmal Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conway et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Seki et al., 2003</xref>) and whilst they express a variety of ion channels and exchangers present in the adult heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seisenberger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cribbs et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Linask et al., 2001</xref>), the expression and activity of these proteins is distinct from that in mature cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liang et al., 2010</xref>). Using isolated cells as well as genetically manipulated animals, two contrasting mechanisms have been proposed for how Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are generated in the developing heart from approximately E8.5 onwards. Early studies suggested that myocyte contraction is triggered by sarcolemmal Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through voltage activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels with little or no contribution from the SR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nakanishi et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Takeshima et al., 1998</xref>). In contrast, more recently it has been shown that at ~E8.5–9, Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients originate from the SR, via RyR together with InsP<sub>3</sub> channels, to trigger electrical activity as well as contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Viatchenko-Karpinski et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Méry et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sasse et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rapila et al., 2008</xref>). Whilst these studies characterised SR function at ~E8.5–9, they did not investigate how Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are regulated at the earliest stages of cardiac crescent development when contraction is initiated, and relied on experiments performed using isolated cells cultured for between 12 to 70 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sasse et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rapila et al., 2008</xref>). Thus there is a lack of cellular resolution <italic>in vivo</italic> and no current mechanistic insight into the onset of Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling and its impact on differentiation and cardiogenesis.</p><p>We report here, for the first time, high-resolution live imaging of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients during the earliest manifestation of murine heart development well before any indication of spontaneous cardiac contractions. We employed the use of multiple pharmacological inhibitors to address the contribution of the NCX1 and LTCC Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels during this process and reveal an essential early role for NCX1-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling on downstream cardiac differentiation and morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Staging of early cardiac development and sarcomeric assembly</title><p>It is commonly stated that initiation of contraction begins with the formation of the LHT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruneau, 2008</xref>), and whilst cardiac contractions have been reported just prior to the ‘linear heart tube’ stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Navaratnam et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nishii and Shibata, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Linask et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kumai et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Porter and Rivkees, 2001</xref>), a precise study on the initiation of cardiac function has not been conducted. A difficulty with these reports is the use of ‘embryonic day’ or ‘somite number’ to stage the developing heart. Somite number is variable in its correlation to the overall embryonic stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaufman and Navaratnam, 1981</xref>), can depend on genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Méry et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Porter and Rivkees, 2001</xref>) and importantly, is not a sufficiently fine-grained proxy for the developmental stages of the heart. This can lead to ambiguities, as a ‘3-somite’ embryo may range from the cardiac crescent to early LHT stages. We, therefore, created a staging system specific to the early heart, from early crescent to LHT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1a</xref>), similar to studies at later stages when a more precise morphological characterization is necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biben and Harvey, 1997</xref>). On this basis, we defined four stages (0, 1, 2 and 3) of cardiac crescent development prior to the LHT stage, based on clear morphological differences. Stage 0 hearts represented the first discernible crescent structure situated beneath the developing head folds, being the widest (360–390 µm along the medio-lateral axis) and thinnest (70–80 µm along the rostro-caudal axis) of the crescent stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Whilst stage 1 was morphologically similar to stage 0, the cardiac crescent had become narrower (300–370 µm) and thicker (75–95 µm). By stage 2, folding of the cardiac crescent is evident based on the formation of a trough at the embryonic midline and two lobes on either side. As the embryo transitions to stage 3 this trough becomes less obvious with a rostral-caudal elongation of the heart as the LHT begins to form. Transition from stage 3 to the LHT was defined by the complete fusion of the two lobes and loss of the central trough (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1a</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17113.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sarcomeric assembly occurs in the forming cardiac crescent during heart development.</title><p>Maximum intensity projections of alternating myomesin (Myom) and sarcomeric alpha-actinin (α-Actinin) immunostaining from cardiac crescent formation to the linear heart tube stage (LHT; <bold>A</bold>–<bold>E</bold>; <bold>A</bold>, 11 stacks; <bold>B</bold>, 36 stacks; <bold>C</bold>, 35 stacks; <bold>D</bold>, 31 stacks; <bold>E</bold>, 36 stacks).

Both α-Actinin and Myomesin appeared in small clusters of cells at stage 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Sarcomeric banding of these proteins, indicative of contractile capability, only manifested later in discrete regions within stage 1 and 2 crescents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). This was surprising given that the crescent stages of early heart development are thought to correspond to non-differentiated cardiac mesoderm (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harvey, 2002</xref>), without prior reports of contractile machinery or functionality. By stage 3, sarcomere assembly and myofibrilar banding became more uniform, coincident with coalescence of the paired crescent primordia to the embryonic midline. This increased through to the linear heat tube stage, consistent with progressive cardiomyocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). To further characterize stage development in relation to sarcomere assembly, qRT-PCR was performed on isolated cardiac crescents, to assess the corresponding gene expression of <italic>Myom1</italic> (encoding Myom), <italic>Actn2</italic> (encoding α-actinin) and <italic>Tnnt2</italic> (encoding cTnT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). <italic>Myom1, Actn2</italic> and <italic>Tnnt2</italic> expression significantly increased between stages 0 and 1 and continued to increase until formation of the LHT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The onset of Ca<sup>2+</sup>handling in the cardiac crescent</title><p>Coincident with sarcomere formation at stage 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), we observed the onset of beating in discrete foci in the lateral regions of cardiac crescents of cultured mouse embryos, by differential interference contrast (DIC) imaging (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>), significantly earlier than previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Navaratnam et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nishii and Shibata, 2006</xref>). These foci generally contracted at the same rate, indicative of either synchronization or a shared intrinsic beat rate for nascent cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The earliest cardiac contractions had a frequency of approximately 30 beats per minute (BPM), which increased significantly by stage 3 (after approximately 5 hr) to around 60 BPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Contractile activity requires cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux, therefore, to investigate the earliest manifestations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling within the cardiac crescent, we loaded embryos with the fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Cal-520 followed by live imaging using confocal microscopy. From stage 1 crescents until late stage 3, lateral propagation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients was observed across the embryonic midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), even through regions of non-contractile tissue (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). As the cardiac crescent starts to fuse to form the LHT, the transients switch from a lateral to a more caudal-rostral propagation (data not shown). At stage 0 spontaneous asynchronous Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (SACOs) were observed within the forming crescent, in the absence of contractile activity and sarcomeric banding of cTnT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). SACOs were observed in all stage 0 cardiac crescents imaged (n = 35), propagated within individual cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D’’</xref>) and displayed a range of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics with variable frequencies and durations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D’</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). Compared to Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients at later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) SACOs were significantly slower, with fluorescence reaching peak intensity between 0.79 and 11.9 s and decreasing with a similar slow rate of efflux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). During a ~20 s recording period we observed only 10.3 ± 0.7 individual SACOs per embryo (n = 35) occurring in different sites. Consecutive SACOs in the same site were rarely observed within the 20 s imaging window and, therefore, we conclude that SACOs in individual cells occur at a frequency &lt; 3 bpm. The appearance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in the embryonic heart prior to beating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>) is consistent with the idea that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling within early cardiac progenitors may be important to promote sufficient differentiation for subsequent contractile function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mesaeli et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2002</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-17113-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17113.005</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Representative movie of beating regions in the cardiac crescent at Stage 1.</title><p>DIC imaging of a stage 1 embryo highlighting beating regions in the lateral regions (dotted circle) of the developing cardiac crescent.

Treated embryos were imaged for contractile activity by DIC imaging and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were recorded in parallel with confocal fluorescence imaging of Cal-520. Acute treatment (for a maximum of 30 min) with NCX inhibitors (CB-DMB and KB-R7943) or LTCC inhibitor (Nifedipine), affected the embryos in a stage dependent-manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Both NCX1 and the LTCC were required for Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients during stages 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and their inhibition led to an initial confinement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients to one side of the crescent (within approximately 5 min of treatment, which persisted through to 15 min) followed shortly afterwards by complete loss of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). At stage 3 and later, only the LTCC was required for Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Whilst NCX1 can function in both forward (Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux from the cell) and reverse (Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the cell) modes, our data suggested that NCX1 in the early cardiac crescent was functioning in reverse mode, as KB-R7943, that is reported to specifically inhibit reverse mode NCX1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoyt et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Iwamoto, 2004</xref>), recapitulated the results with CB-DMB and acted as a control for off-target effects of the latter. These data suggests that reverse mode NCX function may contribute to Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient generation at the earliest stages of cardiac contraction, potentially via inward Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux. The inhibitor experiments were repeated on day 7 and day 14 EBs. The relative effects of CB-DMB, KB-R7943 and nifedipine were consistent with those observed in stages 1 and 2 of the embryonic heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–G</xref>). Treatment with Ryanodine + 2-APB only affected more mature embryos that had already undergone both cardiac looping and embryonic turning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and did not prevent Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients within cardiac crescents at stage 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Whilst the embryos remained viable during the culture period, initiation of heart development was impaired in those treated with CB-DMB compared to DMSO controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This was in contrast to treatment with Nifedipine alone, in which the crescent developed normally and progressed to an equivalent stage as DMSO treated embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). More specifically embryos cultured in the presence of CB-DMB had reduced expression of cTnT compared to embryos cultured in other conditions. However, most cells were still positive for Nkx2.5, suggesting delayed or impaired differentiation likely accounted for the failure of crescent formation under conditions of NCX1 blockade. The relative effects of NCX1 and LTCC inhibition on developmental progression and crescent formation were supported by corresponding gene expression data from cultured embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>).

These data collectively support a role for NCX in cardiomyocyte differentiation and crescent formation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Previous studies have attempted to investigate how cardiac function develops within the early embryo. Whilst these studies are informative they rely on the dissociation and culture of embryonic cardiomyocytes to facilitate physiological measurements resulting in the loss of critical spatial and temporal information regarding Ca<sup>2+</sup>-handling and downstream changes in gene expression and morphology. Using a staging method based on morphological landmarks (stages 0–3), we characterized in detail the in vivo progression of physiological activity during early heart development. The stage series defined correlates with gradual expression of several cardiac related genes and sarcomere assembly. We observed spontaneous asynchronous Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (SACOs) at stage 0 in the developing cardiac mesoderm, before any detectable cardiac contractions. These transients appeared sporadically in individual cells within the forming cardiac crescent and did not appear to be synchronized. At stage 1, periodic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients began to be propagated laterally through the cardiac crescent, and traversed the midline of the crescent where there were no visible contractions. This was a rapid and dynamic process occurring through stages 0–3 that involved sarcolemmal ion channel and exchanger function. NCX1 was exclusively required for SACOs at stage 0, whereas both NCX1 and LTCC appeared to play equally important roles at stage 1 and 2. NCX1 was no longer required from stage 3 onwards when the LTCC channels maintained Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. We observed no contribution of the SR in regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients within the cardiac crescent, as assessed by simultaneous blockade of RyR2 and InsP<sub>3.</sub> However, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sasse et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rapila et al., 2008</xref>), our data did show that the SR becomes functional at later stages during cardiac looping (~E8.5). This may represent a period in which SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> filling is required before a threshold for Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the SR can occur, as has been proposed in the adult setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stokke et al., 2011</xref>). Overall our data reveals that during the time frame from the earliest cardiac morphogenesis (crescent maturation) to looping of the heart (approximately 18 hr) there is a rapid transition in the mechanism by which the intracellular concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is elevated, based on distinct channel and exchanger function.</p><p>The observation of spontaneous asynchronous calcium oscillations (SACOs) within the forming cardiac crescent was a surprising finding that, to the best of our knowledge, has not previously been reported in any type of excitable cell. The specific role of SACOs is currently unknown and we hypothesise that they are required in cells that need to optimally activate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signalling (via the CAMKII pathway) in order to up-regulate genes necessary for further differentiation and morphogenesis. This would explain why SACOs are present much earlier than complete sarcomere assembly. An alternative hypothesis is that SACOs are a by-product of cells that are already committed to specific cardiac lineages and, therefore, arise with the expression of specific channels required for future function. This could explain the variation in duration and frequencies of SACOs observed within the same embryo. At this point, quite how SACOs become synchronised transients is unknown. We speculate that release of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signal from a 'pacemaker' cell may entrain neighbours to have synchronised transient periodicity. To this end we observed highly variable Ca<sup>2+</sup> periodicity but also regions containing cells of similar periodicity (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Since blockade of NCX1 prior to the formation of the cardiac crescent, and chronic treatment in ESCs, leads to impaired cardiac differentiation it is also possible that SACOs may be present in mesoderm cells earlier than reported here, which we were not able to image due to the limitations of the current experimental set-up.</p><p>In the embryonic heart, Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling is assigned to sequential roles for the NCX and LTCC channels, whereby NCX has been assumed to compensate, at least in part, for the rudimentary (non-functional) SR in the developing mouse heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conway et al., 2002</xref>). In zebrafish embryos it has recently been demonstrated that Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling and not contraction per se is essential for regulating cardiomyocyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2015</xref>). Previous studies characterised functional expression of NCX from E8.5-E9.5 (post-LHT formation) in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Linask et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reppel et al., 2007</xref>) coincident with cardiac looping and significantly later than the onset of the first heat beat described herein. NCX1 knock-out mice have been generated by multiple groups, with conflicting results in regards to the phenotype, extent of mutant heart development and the stage at which embryonic lethality occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wakimoto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koushik et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reuter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2003</xref>). This suggests that loss of NCX1 may be compensated for at the level of early cardiomyocyte specification, differentiation and contraction. In mammals there are three different Na<sup>+</sup>-Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchangers (NCX1, NCX2 and NCX3), and it has been previously demonstrated that these three exchangers share similar physiological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Linck et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lytton, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, NCX1 has several splicing variants with exon 1 being mutually exclusive to exon 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lytton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Quednau et al., 1997</xref>). It is, therefore, possible that either a different NCX or an alternative splice variant will compensate for loss of the NCX1 variant targeted in the previous studies. Indeed, in all of the previous NCX1 generic loss-of-function studies, mutant mice were created by targeting exon 2, supporting the possibility that an alternately spliced variant may be able to compensate. Furthermore, precedent for genetic ablation being compensated for over the course of development exists, whereby patterning defects were muted over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloomekatz et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, our use of pharmacological channel blockers CB-DMB and KB-R7943, resulted in an acute stage-specific-loss of NCX1 function which attributed an essential role for NCX1 in generating SACOs, and potentially acting as a trigger to establish the onset of beating in the cardiac crescent and subsequent cardiomyocyte differentiation and morphogenesis. These findings are consistent with the situation in tremblor (<italic>tre</italic>) zebrafish which have a mutation in NCX1 leading to absence of normal calcium transients and cardiac fibrillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Langenbacher et al., 2005</xref>) as well as earlier findings in rodents demonstrating a requirement for elevated cytoplasmic calcium to drive cardiac myofibrillogenesis in developing cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Webb and Miller, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Parallel analyses on ESC-derived cardiomyocytes revealed that lowering the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the media had a similar effect on reducing the number of beating EBs as treatment with CB-DMB. This both reinforced the relative importance of NCX1 and also provided the first indication that the exchanger may be working in reverse mode, facilitating inward Ca<sup>2+</sup> as necessary for cardiomyocyte differentiation. Furthermore, our use of the inhibitor KB-R7943, previously reported to specifically inhibit reverse mode NCX1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brustovetsky et al., 2011</xref>), replicated observations made with CB-DMB, such that at stage 1 and 2 both LTCC and NCX1 are required for sufficient Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Whilst inhibition of NCX1 clearly blocked SACOs in stage 0 cardiac crescents, the mechanism by which NCX1 alone could lead to periodic oscillations in Ca<sup>2+</sup> is still unclear, and may require oscillations in other ions, such as Na<sup>+</sup>, and/or contribution of other sarcolemmal proteins, such as the Plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (PMCA), to regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux while NCX1 is working in reverse mode. Due to the slow nature of SACOs, oscillations in energy production along with adenosine triphosphate levels could also be involved in SACO generation, especially with reduced SR function. Whilst SR inhibition did not prevent stage 3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, we have not tested the involvement of SR function at stage 0 and, therefore, cannot fully exclude that periodic Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases from the SR are involved in the generation of SACOs. The latter has been reported in cultured E8.5–9 embryonic cardiomyocytes as a pace making mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sasse et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rapila et al., 2008</xref>) at later stages than were the focus in this study. To further understand the mechanism of NCX1 in SACO generation will require <italic>in vivo</italic> electrophysiological analysis to more accurately determine whether the inhibitory effect of NCX1 blockade with CB-DMB and KB-R7943 is due to effects on reverse mode NCX1 function (inhibition of translemmal Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx) or forward mode NCX1 function (inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux leading to Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload), imbalance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis or off-target effects. Although the existence of the NCX1 acting in reverse mode is contentious, and the precise function of KB-R7943 is still debated in the field, it is difficult to otherwise explain how inhibition of NCX1 can block SACOs. That said, regardless of mode of action, the observation that at stage 0 SACOs were abolished with both CB-DMB and KB-R7943 treatment, but persisted when treated with nifedipine, suggests that NCX1, and not the LTCC, plays a major role in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient generation within the early cardiac crescent.</p><p>As cardiomyocytes matured, transition to LTCC became the predominant mechanism for inward Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, as demonstrated by nifedipine-induced inhibition of beating at later stages in both the embryo and ESC-derived cardiomyocytes. NCX1 expression was further maintained at high levels during more advanced stages (stage 0-LHT), suggesting a later role in ensuring Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal via its forward mode of action. Of note, the early versus late roles for mammalian NCX1 and LTCC, respectively, are further supported by studies on <italic>tre</italic> zebrafish, whereby sarcomeric assembly defects in developing cardiomyocytes following loss of NCX1 function are not recapitulated by mutations in LTCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ebert et al., 2005</xref>). Increased expression of NCX1 has also been linked with pathological hypertrophy and heart failure (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sipido et al., 2002</xref>), whereby elevated NCX1 is thought to compensate for defective ECC and depressed function of SERCA but also produce arrhythmogenic-delayed after-depolarisations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gómez et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schultz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Venetucci et al., 2007</xref>). Transgenic mice over-expressing NCX1 within the myocardium exhibited a proportional decrease in contractile function and increased incidence of heart failure, suggesting a decompensatory mechanism with regards to Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Roos et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Delta isoforms of CaMKII predominate in the heart and are involved in multiple signalling cascades to regulate gene expression, as well as cardiomyocyte physiology including Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wagner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aiba et al., 2010</xref>). In this study, CaMKII activation was impaired following NCX1 inhibition in embryonic stem cells, and, moreover, canonical hypertrophy genes, including <italic>Mef2c</italic> and <italic>Myh7</italic> were down-regulated in response to impaired NCX function during development. Whilst changes in gene expression did differ between embryos and ESCs in response to treatment with different drugs, this likely reflects inherent differences between the in vitro versus <italic>in vivo</italic> models, as well as the timing and length of drug exposure. ESCs were exposed at a relatively earlier stage of cardiac lineage specification and for longer periods, which was not feasible in the live embryo cultures, resulting in a stronger down-regulation of the genes investigated. Overall though these findings suggest analogous roles for NCX1 in early heart development and adult hypertrophy, with regards Ca<sup>2+</sup>-handling and foetal cardiac gene induction to promote physiological or pathological myocyte growth, respectively.</p><p>There is recent precedent for a role for Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the establishment of other embryonic lineages; most notably Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are involved in the earliest steps of neurogenesis, including neural induction and the differentiation of neural progenitors into neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leclerc et al., 2012</xref>). Here we show that pharmacological inhibition of NCX1 and dysregulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling from the outset had an adverse effect on early cardiomyocyte differentiation and led to impaired cardiogenesis in the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, an early induction of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-handling preceding beating within cardiac muscle is pivotal for subsequent terminal differentiation and normal heart development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains, husbandry and embryo collection</title><p>All animal experiments were carried out according to UK Home Office project license PPL 30/3155 and 30/2887 compliant with the UK animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and approved by the local Biological Services Ethical Review Process.

Initial characterisation of cardiac contractions was performed using Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) imaging on a Spinning Disk Confocal microscope at 37°C and an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> + Air.

Inhibition was defined as the complete cessation as well as confinement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients to small regions of the cardiac crescent. For inhibitor experiments involving stage 0 embryos, imaging was carried out at baseline, 5 and 15 min post treatment. For all the experiments involving calcium imaging of embryo the overlying yolk sac endoderm had to be dissected out in order to allow proper drug and dye penetration, as well as better visualisation of the cardiac mesoderm. For experiments involving embryos Nifedipine (Sigma-aldrich) was used at a final concentration of 10 μM, CB-DMB (Sigma-aldrich) at 20 μM, KB-R7943 (Sigma-aldrich) at 30 μM, Ryanodine (Tocris Bioscience, England) at 100 μM and 2-APB at 200 μM, all diluted in DMSO (Sigma-aldrich). We found that most drugs had to be used at a higher concentration than previously used in studies involving isolated cells, presumably due to penetration difficulties inherent with using whole embryos. Control experiments for Nifedipine, CB-DMB and KB-R7943 were performed with 0.002% DMSO, and for experiments involving dual inhibition with Ryanodine + 2-APB with 0.6% DMSO. All experiments involving embryos were repeated with at least three different litters (6–10 embryos). Both embryo and ESC experiments were performed on at least three independent days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Embryo culture</title><p>Embryos were cultured in the presence of drug (CB-DMB or nifedipine) for 12 hr, from E7.5 to E8.0 using a rolling culture system. Embryos were cultured in a mix of 50% CMRL and 50% Knockout Serum Replacement at 37°C and with an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>+ Air. Only embryos at E7.5, prior to cardiac crescent and head fold formation were cultured. For these experiments embryos were cultured in the presence of either in 10 μM Nifedipine, 3 μM CB-DMB or 0.0003% DMSO. Experiments for immunostaining were performed on three independent days, while experiments for qRT-PCR were performed on four different days for Nifedipine treatments and five days for CB-DMB treatments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>ES cell culture and cardiomyocyte differentiation</title><p>Cardiomyocyte differentiation from ESCs was carried out as previously described using an <italic>Nkx2.5</italic>-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moretti et al., 2006</xref>) and <italic>Eomes</italic>-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2009</xref>) cell line. Briefly, ESCs were maintained in an undifferentiated state by culturing with KO-DMEM (Gibco, England) supplemented with glutamax (2 mM; Gibco), embryomax FBS (15%; Millipore), nonessential amino acids (0.1 mM; Invitrogen, England), penicillin (60U/mL; Gibco), streptomycin (60 μg/mL; Gibco), β-mercaptoethanol (0.1 mM; Sigma-aldrich) and Leukaemia inhibitory factor (1000 U/ml; Millipore, England). Cardiomyocyte differentiation was induced using the hanging drop culture method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kattman and Keller, 2007</xref>). Approximately 500 ESCs were plated in 20 μl drops of differentiation media (4.5 g glucose/DMEM, embryomax FBS (20%), nonessential amino acids (0.1 mM), penicillin (60 U/ml), streptomycin (60 μg/ml), β-mercaptoethanol [0.1 mM]) on the lids of petri dishes and cultured as hanging drops throughout the first four days of differentiation, allowing embryoid bodies (EBs) to form. At day 4, the EBs were transferred onto 0.1% gelatin coated plates for a further 10 days of culture before being collected at day 14 of differentiation. 1 μM CB-DMB and 10 μM Nifedipine were added to the differentiation media at day 0. For control experiments, DMSO was added at the same concentration as drug containing media. Once the EBs had been plated at day 4, drug-containing media was changed every two days up until day 14. To assess the percentage of EBs which were beating, drug containing media was removed 2 hr prior to assessment and replaced with fresh drug-free culture media. Culturing of ESCs in different Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations was achieved using Ca<sup>2+</sup> free DMEM (Gibco) with Ca<sup>2+</sup> being added back to the desired concentration (0.1 mM, 1.0 mM, 1.8 mM). For immunostaining, ESCs were cultured on 0.1% gelatin coated glass coverslips before being fixed with 3.7% PFA for 30 min on ice. For RNA isolation tissue samples were dissociated for 2 min using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA at 37°C prior to snap freezing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunostaining</title><p>Dissected embryos were fixed for 1 hr at room temperature with 4% PFA in PBS.

Samples were mounted using Vectashield mounting media with DAPI for at least 24 hr prior to imaging with either a 40x oil (1.36 NA) or water (1.2 NA) objective. Images were captured at a 512 × 512 pixel dimension and tiled 2x2 with a Z-step of 1.5 µm. For embryos each staining was repeated for at least three litters (6–10 embryos per litter). Both experiments involving embryos and ESCs were performed on at least three independent days and with two different secondary antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>RNA-extraction and qRT-PCR</title><p>RNA extraction of whole embryos, embryonic hearts, head folds and ESC samples was performed using an RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, England) according to manufacturer’s instructions: briefly, homogenisation was carried out with a 21G needle and the extract run through an on-column DNase I treatment. For P0 and adult heart samples, RNA extraction was performed using Trizol (Invitrogen, England), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, additional DNase I (Promega, England) treatment on Trizol-extracted RNAs was carried out to eliminate genomic DNA contamination. In order to collect enough RNA for isolated cardiac crescent and head fold development, each biological replicate was composed of 10 individual cardiac crescents or head folds. For both types of extraction, RNA pellets were dissolved in RNase-free water and the RNA quality and quantity determined by Nanodrop readings at 260, 280 and 230 nm wavelengths. cDNA was generated from 1 μg of RNA using random primers and SuperScript III polymerase (Invitrogen). The expression of mRNAs for genes of interest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1f</xref>), together with endogenous controls (treated embryos and differentiated ES cells, HPRT, GAPDH, 18 s; <italic>in vivo</italic> timecourse, GAPDH &amp; HPRT; ES cell differentiation, GAPDH &amp; 18 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Murphy and Polak, 2002</xref>) were measured in triplicate for each sample by quantitative real-time PCR using SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems, England). Each reaction contained: 8 ng cDNA, 0.5 μl of each primer, 6.5 μl water and 12.5 μl 2 x SYBR Green, made up with H<sub>2</sub>O to a final volume of 22 μl. Primers (Sigma-aldrich) were either designed using Primer-BLAST (National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Institutes of Health) or obtained from PrimerBank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank">http://pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank</ext-link>; Primer 3) or previous publications (primer sequences in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1f</xref>). Primers were designed to span exon-intron boundaries, have annealing temperatures around 60°C and generate amplicons between 50–200 bp. The reaction mixture and samples were loaded into either a MicroAmp Optical 96-Well Reaction Plates or MicroAmp Fast Optical 96-Well Reaction Plates and sealed with Optical Adhesive Films (Life Technologies). Quantification was performed on a ViiA 7 Detection System (Applied Biosystems) using a PCR programme of 95°C 15 min followed by 40 cycles of (95°C 15 s melting phase and 60°C 1 min annealing and extension). Amplification of a single amplicon was confirmed by obtaining dissociation curve (melt curve) profiles as well as using gel electrophoresis to separate the reaction product. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were generated using either Viia7 software (Applied Biosystems). Relative gene expression levels were obtained using the ΔΔCt method, in which expression of each gene of interest was normalised to endogenous controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schmittgen and Livak, 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Murphy and Polak, 2002</xref>), and presented as fold change over a reference sample. For time course data fold-change was calculated in relation to the earliest stages (E7.75 <italic>in vivo</italic>, D0 ESC models), whilst for drug treated experiments fold change was calculated relative to control (DMSO) samples. Non-template controls were performed by replacing cDNA with water, to test for non-specific amplification.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Protein was extracted on ice using direct lysis of cells with NP-40 extraction buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1.0% NP-40, 50 mM Tris (pH8.0)) and 1x protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche, England). Lysates were span at 10,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C and supernatant collected. An aliquot was taken for protein quantification using a DC protein assay (Bio-rad, England). Supernatants were prepared for SDS-PAGE with the addition of 4x Laemmli sample buffer and boiling at 95°C for 5 min. Western blotting was performed using standard SDS-PAGE methods using HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence detection (GE Healthcare, England).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistics</title><p>All data involving beat rate and qPCR gene levels was compared using one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey test for multiple comparisons. In cases where the raw data failed to map to a normal distribution with consistent variance, we applied Taylor’s law to choose the best transformation for the data. All data to be analysed passed the Shapiro-Wilk normality test and Bartlett test for homogeneous variances. To compare the number of affected embryos upon acute treatments, a Freeman-Halton extension of Fisher exact probability test was applied due to a smaller number of samples. To compare the effect of different treatments on the number of beating EBs, due to a large number of samples, a Chi Square test with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was performed instead. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was carried out to directly compare temporal gene expression data from EBs with that derived from embryos; each biological replicate for embryonic stage was composed of 5–6 embryos and for EBs was composed of 10–80 EBs, depending on the day of differentiation. The data from each sample was normalized by assessing the ratio with the maximum value of all samples. A log transformation was applied to the normalized data and the principal components were calculated using R environment. The 3D representation of the PCA was constructed by plotting the 3 first components given that these explained more that 95% of the observed variance. A hierarchical clustering analysis was performed using Ward’s minimum variance method as a more precise clustering algorithm to divide the samples in different groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ward, 1963</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Image analysis</title><p>A variant of absolute image filter was used to visualize and plot measurements of cardiac contractions in the developing cardiac crescent as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, pixel displacement, indicative of contractions, was visualized and represented by increased grey levels within the crescent. Change in pixel intensity was assessed in a selected region, to reveal the contraction dynamics. Background Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal was subtracted from all frames of a given time-lapse using ImageJ. To obtain the profiles for Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, regions of interest were plotted using the ratio between observed fluorescent and minimum fluorescent (F/F0) after background subtraction.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was generously supported by the British Heart Foundation (RCVT, AMAM, SMD; CH/11/1/28798 and RG/13/9/303269 to PRR) including core support from the BHF Oxbridge Regenerative Medicine Centre (RM/13/3/30159), the BBSRC (REI BB/F011512/1 to SS) and The Wellcome Trust (C-mC; WTSIA 103788/Z/14/Z and 105031/C/14/Z to SS).

The previous decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;Calcium handling precedes cardiac differentiation to initiate the first heart beat&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your full submission has been evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor) and three peer reviewers, as well as a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate the importance of this study on the establishment of calcium gradients and its implications for cardiogenesis. We also appreciate the technical advances in this paper which presents a multidisciplinary approach and includes functional studies. However, a number of points raised by the reviewers indicate problems with the paper as it stands. Notably new mechanistic insights are weak. There is a lack of data on LTCC Cav1.3. The mechanistic link between early NCX-1 dependent asyncronous activity and maturation of electrical activity and excitation contraction coupling is lacking – blocking experiments in embryo culture are inadequate. There is also a question about novelty. The Introduction is weak and does not adequately cover current available papers on the subject. Reconsideration of experimental approaches in the context of earlier studies should lead to the design of further experiments such as genetic ablation of key components or electrical measurements in embryo culture.</p><p>We consider that the issues raised by the reviewers cannot be addressed in the short time frame required by <italic>eLife</italic> for return of a revised manuscript. However, we would encourage you carry out further experiments and if you then feel that you have addressed all the issues, <italic>eLife</italic> remains open to receiving a revised manuscript in the future for consideration as a new submission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors present an interesting study demonstrating calcium-mediated contractile activity in the mouse cardiac crescent earlier than previously thought. The study is strengthened by the use of both embryonic data and ESC-derived cardiomyocyte data. The experiments follow a logical progression with the data and figures presented clearly. I recommend accepting the manuscript with revision and additional experiments.</p><p>While concise scientific communication is appreciated, the Introduction is a bit too concise (one paragraph composed of three sentences). The manuscript would benefit from additional background and justification for the current study.</p><p>Given the strength of the assertion that this study is a definitive analysis of early crescent contractility, the sarcomere immunostaining should be more thorough and expanded to include other sarcomeric proteins that spatiotemporally indicate sarcomere formation. Although the current data is supportive of the conclusions presented, cTnT alone is not sufficient in this regard. At minimum, immunostaining for α-actinin, a Z-disc protein would much improve and strengthen this data. Further, inclusion of staining for myomesin, an M-band protein would be much more definitive especially if double stained showing alternating actinin/myomesin.</p><p>The gene expression studies should be complemented by whole mount in situ hybridization. This is especially important for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> as neither Slc8a1 or Cacna1c are solely restricted to the heart and the gene expression was performed on whole embryos.</p><p>More information is needed to evaluate the gene expression studies. At minimum, primer details, amplicon details, replicates (both biological and technical) and PCR parameters should be reported. In the absence of validating the reference genes for qPCR, what is the rationale for choosing HPRT for in vivo samples and GAPDH for ESCs? How is fold change calculated? Is it in relation to E7.5 for embryos and D0 for ESCs? The following references should be helpful in this regard.</p><p>Johnson G, et al. Methods Mol Biol. 2014;1160:5-17.</p><p>Bustin SA, et al..

BMC Mol Biol. 2010 Sep 21;11:74.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript addresses the earliest stages of electrical activity in the mammalian heart and ES cell-derived EBs and in particular the relative requirements of the Na/Ca exchanger NCX1 and L-type Ca channel (LTCC). The main implications of the work are when Ca transients are established and how this relates to cardiogenesis. In general, the work is well written and the data interesting and relevant to the above issues. The functional and multidisciplinary approach to cardiac development is a strength. For the most part the experiments are carefully performed and results make a strong contribution.</p><p>1) The novelty of the findings are diminished somewhat by prior publications on genetic deletion of NCX and LTCC genes in mice and fish. The novelty of this study lies in the detailed assessment of beating, Ca transients, and relative requirements for NCX1 and LTCCs. I recommend that some of the material relegated to the Discussion come forward to the Introduction to make clear the state of the field including the broad findings relating to NCX1 and LTCC pharmacological and genetic inhibition in the context of embryogenesis, and the novelty of the present findings in a summary paragraph. Background studies should cover what has been observed in the chick embryo wrt beating and pacemaker function, and electrophysiology.</p><p>2) The text is not rigorous in defining the dose of drugs used and the duration of use in each experiment. Different doses and treatments are mentioned. In addressing the relative requirements for NCX1 and LTCCs, dose response data would seem important as different drugs may have different Ki etc. It seems important to address this formally throughout or to do specific experiments that incorporate dose responses.</p><p>3) Furthermore, rationale is not given for differing doses between experiments e.g. for CB-DMB is used at 20 μm in experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-F</xref> but at 1mM in those in Figure 6A-D. This is a massive difference. The authors must provide full rationale for these choices in light of the issue raised under point 2.</p><p>4) The experimental design in the experiment described at the end of page 8 onwards does not allow the stated conclusions to be drawn. First, duration of drug treatment is unknown. Second, the design of the sequential experiment is informative but does not allow the authors to conclude that the earlier NCX-1-dependent waves are essential for subsequent differentiation and beating.</p><p>5) In the last paragraph of the subsection “NCX1 is essential for the initiation of Ca<sup>2</sup> transients in the developing cardiac crescent”. the effects on GFP from Nkx2-5GFP should be quantified, preferably by FACS.</p><p>6. In the last paragraph of the subsection “NCX1 is essential for the initiation of Ca<sup>2</sup> transients in the developing cardiac crescent”. This is a key experiment that addressed an important theme for the paper; the response of the cardiac network to inhibition of NCX1 and LTCC was poorly analysed (only 4 genes analysed, two of these encoding the channels, and only at one time point). Effects could be secondary.</p><p>7) In the subsection “Inward Ca<sup>2</sup> via NCX1 and downstream CAMKII signalling promotes cardiomyocyte differentiation”; inhibition of beating in low Ca is not surprising. How do the results show that Ca is required for maturation and differentiation?</p><p>8) In the subsection “NCX1 is essential for cardiac crescent formation during development”. For such an important point, actin staining of embryos treated with inhibitors and PCR are insufficient to draw the broad conclusion that there is a lack of crescent cells. This experiment needs far more development. What happens to the pre-cardiac cells and cardiac progenitors over time needs to be analysed with appropriate markers?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript &quot;Calcium handling precedes cardiac differentiation to initiate the first heart beat&quot; by Tyser et al. tries to address the importance of calcium cycling for cardiac crescent formation in the embryonic heart by Ca<sup>2</sup> imaging, gene expression analysis and pharmacological blocking during culture of mouse embryos and embryonic stem cells. The main result is that the sodium-calcium-exchanger (NCX) is important for cardiomyocyte development and function because pharmacological block of NCX reduces Ca<sup>2</sup> transients and beating as well as lowers expression of cardiac genes and delays cardiac crescent formation.</p><p>Although the manuscript presents major technical advancements in this field including mouse embryo culture and recording of Ca<sup>2</sup> transients from the cardiac crescent prior to beating, the study remains descriptional and the proposed mechanism is based on over interpretation of results and assumptions including drug specificity of long term drug application.</p><p>Most importantly the authors have not measured or discussed the involvement of voltage signals in cardiomyocytes and several other known facts on the physiology of embryonic heart cells or on the pacemaking mechanism in the embryonic heart.</p><p>The authors write &quot;NCX1, have not previously been implicated in the initiation event of cardiac contraction, nor investigated at the earliest stages of heart development coincident with the onset of beating&quot; and in the Abstract &quot;how the initial contractions are established have not been described&quot;. This is incorrect. It is well known that in the embryonic heart cell, a periodic intracellular calcium oscillation (IP3-dependent) is driving pacemaking and translated into voltage fluctuations specifically by the NCX (forward mode of the electrogenic pump). These fluctuations can induce action potentials that synchronize the cardiac tissue and therefore NCX is essential for cardiac development (please see for instance: Excitation-Contraction Coupling of the Mouse Embryonic Cardiomyocyte&quot; Rapila R et al. 2008 and the other papers by the Tavi group or &quot;Intracellular Ca<sup>2</sup> Oscillations, a Potential Pacemaking Mechanism in Early Embryonic Heart Cells&quot; Sasse P et al. 2007).</p><p>Furthermore, it is well known that intact Ca<sup>2</sup> cycling is important for cardiac gene expression and heart development. The authors should clearly cite the previous work and specifically describe the novelty and mechanism of their study.</p><p>The main conclusion of the blocker experiments is that NCX reverse mode is important for Ca<sup>2</sup> entry and gene regulation but how this should induce periodic beating or pacemaking has not been addressed or discussed. NCX and can only work in reverse mode when intracellular Na concentration is excessively high during an action potential (although controversial if this really happens, or if the effect is only a less effective forward mode). This has not been shown for embryonic cardiomyocytes and is highly unlikely because of the lack of Na channels or Na driven action potentials at this stage.</p><p>The (confusing) idea of a reverse mode NCX comes from the literature that state that at low dosages (EC50 in the low µM range) KB-R is preferential blocking a reverse mode. Although oocyte experiments with non-physiological intracellular Na concentrations suggest this, other experiments on cardiomyocytes (e.g. &quot;Direction-independent block of bi-directional Na /Ca<sup>2</sup> exchange current by KB-R7943 in guinea-pig cardiac myocytes&quot; by Kimura, J et al. 1999) show that this specificity is not existent and other papers show that this is highly depending on intracellular Na concentrations and drug dosage used. Thus without electrophysiological analysis, it remains unclear, if the inhibitory effect on beating and cardiac crescent formation after block of NCX by KB-R or CB-DMB is due to effects on of Ca<sup>2</sup> oscillations, pacemaking, translemmal Ca<sup>2</sup> entry or exit, membrane potential fluctuation, synchronization by action potentials, imbalance of Ca<sup>2</sup> homeostasis or off-target effects that occur especially when applied long term.</p><p>In summary, the presented data, although in part novel and interesting, together with the known literature on embryonic cardiomyocytes and on the physiology of ECC, LTCC and NCX function does not allow to conclude a mechanism.</p><p>Specific major points:</p><p>The Introduction is too short and only very general. Specifically, several known facts on initiation of the first heart beat and the role of calcium gene regulation during embryonic heart development should be cited. For instance, several earlier publications have tried to address &quot;the important question of when and how contractile activity of cardiomyocytes is first initiated during development&quot; (see above). In addition to cite these earlier work in introduction it should be better pointed out, why these earlier studies are not sufficient and the current study is required (which is easy, because of the nice in vivo data).</p><p>Also the first paragraph of the section &quot;A role for the Sodium-Calcium exchanger…&quot; belongs to the Introduction. Please describe the well-known ECC in the adult heart a bit less but introduce more the known facts on ECC and the importance of NCX for pacemaking in the embryonic heart (see above).</p><p>Because of the low resolution of the supplied PDF file, the cardiac maturation and cross striation at the different crescent sages is difficult to review. Maybe providing inserts to highlight the specific patterns (especially stage 1 2) would help. Is cross striation completely absent in stage 0?</p><p>The finding of Ca<sup>2</sup> transients at stage 0 is fascinating. Maybe better call them &quot;spontaneous asynchronous Ca<sup>2</sup> oscillations&quot; also to highlight the difference semantically to the (action potential-based?) coupled transients at stage 1 . What is the average frequency and is there a correlation between frequency and TTP (maybe more interesting to show than TTP vs TT<sub>1/2</sub>M which lacks a conclusion)? Is there evidence that transients are coupled between individual cells (from the video this seems to be sometimes the case). Although not in the scope of the authors´ manuscript, recording of membrane potential is essential to understand the nature of cell-cell coupling of these fascinating data.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: Normalizing gene expression data to D0 or E7.5 (where most genes are not expressed) make less sense, adds noise and masks information. Please consider normalization to the time point of the highest value.</p><p>Unfortunately, Cacna1d (Cav1.3), which is the dominant isoform of LTCC in the early embryo (see &quot;Subtype switching of L-Type Ca 2 channel from Cav1.3 to Cav1.2 in embryonic murine ventricle&quot;. Takemura H et al. 2005) was not analyzed and therefore the expression data of Cacna1c does not suggest a minor role of LTCC, but just highlights the well-known isoform switch (see also &quot;Functional Embryonic Cardiomyocytes after Disruption of the L-type α1C (Cav1.2) Calcium Channel Gene in the Mouse&quot;). The analysis of other LTCC genes or western blot at different stages from heart tissue might help in this regard.</p><p>The establishment of an embryo culture for investigation of cardiac crescent or heart tube formation as well as for gene expression analysis is a definite plus and a main methodological advancement of this paper. Very nice! However, the fact that &quot;Embryos cultured in CB-DMB were delayed in terms of cardiac crescent formation&quot; is not supported by the one actin image shown (Figure 6O) although it is one of the main messages of the paper. Repeating of experiments, extensive histological analysis by specific crescent staining, and quantitation is suggested. Also a time course analysis of crescent formation with and without CB-DMB and KBR would enhance the paper. How many hours are the cardiac crescent forming delayed under NCX blockage?</p><p>Was the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B, E, F</xref> obtained from Ca imaging or from video microscopy? If here video microscopy was used, also data from Ca imaging should be added to see the acute (&gt;1-2 minutes) effects of the three blockers on Ca<sup>2</sup> transients and remaining Ca<sup>2</sup> oscillations (before all Ca<sup>2</sup> has left the cell and the impaired Ca<sup>2</sup> homeostasis is blocking pacemaking).</p><p>In the Discussion the authors have claimed to use &quot;two independent pharmacological channel blockers CB-DMB and KB-R7943, in embryo cultures&quot;, but only show CB-DMB data in Figure 6. Please also show the KB-R data on embryonic cultures.</p><p>The authors describe “sequential addition of CB-DMB to nifedipine-treated embryos after 15 mins, subsequently blocked the transients that were refractory to LTCC inhibition (not shown).&quot; Please provide the data and statistics and explain the mechanism. What is the percentage of transients that were not blocked by LTCC inhibition? Was this observed at all stages or is this stage specific?</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Calcium handling precedes cardiac differentiation to initiate the first heartbeat&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Janet Rossant as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript resubmitted after revision is much improved and is now under review with a view to publication of these interesting findings. The authors show that the sodium calcium exchanger (NCX) early, at what they define as stage 0, is essential for generating spontaneous asynchronous Ca<sup>2</sup> oscillations (SACO) in the cardiac crescent and that these are essential for cardiac gene expression and subsequent development. However, interpretation of the results and the proposal that reverse mode NCX, allowing Ca<sup>2</sup> to enter the cell, is involved in the mechanism are still problematic.</p><p>Firstly, in the experiments with inhibitors, the stage 0 experiments are critical. The authors use nifedipine to block voltage dependent Ca<sup>2</sup> channels (VDCC), which interestingly at stage 0 has less effect on SACO, in contrast to later stages when it blocks activity. CB-DMB, which blocks NCX, affects SACO at stage 0, but it also blocks Ca<sup>2</sup> exit mode. In the manuscript KB-R7943 is claimed to specifically block reverse mode NCX but it was not used at stage 0. This result should be shown. The finding that this inhibitor blocks activity at stages 1 and 2 is not so important because nifedipine does this too. In their interpretation the authors should be aware of controversy about the action of KB-R7943.</p><p>The SACO shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref> is one of the most important pieces of data and in fact is the major novelty. Please provide more data here including n-numbers, statistics and report reproducibility of these findings. Are SACO observed in every stage 0 embryo? What is the Ca<sup>2</sup> cycling frequency and amplitude and how often are single uncoupled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>´) and multiple coupled cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>´´) observed?</p><p>The experiments on blocking SACO with CB-DMB in contrast to nifedipine lead to one of the most important findings, however the analysis and statistics are very limited. Please provide absolute numbers of cells with SACO and original data (example traces, videos) to enable the reader to follow the analysis and statistics. Line 310: What does &quot;0.87 0.083, mean SEM&quot; refer to? How are cells without SACO identified if they do not show Ca<sup>2</sup> signals? How is the variance of cells with SACO per embryo? ANOVA comparisons are required to take these variations in control embryos into account.</p><p>The novel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref> on RyR/APD treatment is confusing as it does not follow the authors (very good) stage classification (stage 0, 1, 2, 3, LHT) but has a novel classification (turned/pre-turned embryo). Please label data as stage 0, stage 1 and LHT, at least. Please add statistics, error bars and original Ca<sup>2</sup> imaging traces. A DMSO control for stage 3 is missing.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 A, B, E, F</xref>: the error bars are missing. In fact, it is not even fully clear from the methods what% inhibition means. Please discriminate between complete block of beating (movement in DIC images), reduction of frequency, complete block of Ca<sup>2</sup> transients and reduction of Ca<sup>2</sup> transient amplitude. Also please provide time courses and report the delay of drug action (should be easy as Ca<sup>2</sup> imaging was performed at baseline and at 5, 15 and 30 minutes post drug treatment).</p><p>In general, in the text it is important to clarify what is meant by inhibition and partial inhibition.</p><p>Although the pharmacological block using CB-DMB shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I-L</xref> lets the authors conclude that Ca<sup>2</sup> entry though NCX is the basis for the SACO, the mechanism of how this could be periodic and lead to oscillations in Ca<sup>2</sup> is unclear. The authors are correct that NCX can (under special circumstances such as elevated intracellular Na or depolarized membrane potential) lead to Ca<sup>2</sup> entry, but once this occurs, the electrogenic nature of NCX (~3 Na for 1 Ca<sup>2</sup> ) will again hyperpolarize the cell and export Na until the equilibrium potential is reached and Ca<sup>2</sup> flux ceases. Thus it is not possible that the NCX can generate periodic Ca<sup>2</sup> oscillations alone. Reverse mode only occurs if periodic action potentials are depolarizing the cell but then cells should be synchronized (no SACO). Maybe Na levels are cycling or the Na/K-ATPase is involved? This could be clarified by testing whether SACO at stage 0 are blocked by RyR/2-APB or by SERCA blockers (Thapsigargin/CPA). These mechanistic considerations should be taken into account in the authors' Discussion.</p><p>On the mechanistic front, as it stands the paper does not permit definitive conclusions; the authors must be less dogmatic about the SACO/Ca<sup>2</sup> cycling mechanism and introduce notes of caution in their Discussion. The authors are encouraged to attempt electrophysiological analysis since without this it remains unclear if the inhibitory effect on beating and cardiac crescent formation of NCX by KB-R7945 or CB-DMB is due to effects on SACO, translemmal NCX reverse mode Ca<sup>2</sup> entry (mechanism unclear) or NCX forward mode Ca<sup>2</sup> exit (NCX block-based Ca<sup>2</sup> overload can also inhibit gene expression), imbalance of Ca<sup>2</sup> homeostasis or off-target effects. These analyses as well as straight forward siRNA experiments, proposed in the first reviews prior to resubmission, should be feasible with the elegant embryo culture technology set up by the authors.</p><p>A second aspect which requires further revision is the gene expression data. This should be normalised relative to housekeeping control genes. Normalising to E7.75 when most genes are not expressed and there is mainly noise is not informative, preventing meaningful comparison between genes. For instance, in the current presentation the time course of NCX and Cav1.3 seems to be superimposable. The data should be represented as dCT (normalised only to housekeeping genes) and then the meaningful differences in time course/relative levels discussed.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Calcium handling precedes cardiac differentiation to initiate the first heartbeat&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Before publication, the following remaining concerns of one reviewer will need to be addressed:</p><p>1) Please provide information on the frequency, duration and regularity of SACO at stage 0 as requested and as stated in the subsection “The onset of Ca<sup>2</sup> -handling in the cardiac crescent” (&quot;variable frequencies and durations&quot;). From the authors comment in the rebuttal and from <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref> (very nice) it is well understandable that precise numbers are difficult to give but at lease state something like &quot;Compared to Ca<sup>2</sup> transients at later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) the SACO were rare. During a ~20 s recording period we observed only 10.3 -x individual SACO per embryo (n=24) occurring in different sites. Consecutive SACO in a same site were rarely observed within the 20 s imaging windows and therefore we conclude that SACO in individual cells occur at a frequency &lt; 3 bpm.&quot;</p><p>2) Please describe the meaning of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref> with something like &quot;During a SACO, Ca<sup>2</sup> rises slowly and reaches the peak between 0.5 and 10 s. Cells with slow Ca<sup>2</sup> influx also showed similar slow Ca<sup>2</sup> efflux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).&quot;</p><p>3) Because of the very slow nature of SACO, also oscillations in energy production and ATP levels can be involved (in fact the most likely explanation of SR is not involved). Please add this to the Discussion (fourth paragraph).</p><p>4) The authors state that Ryanodine 2-APB only affected embryos that had already undergone cardiac looping but the earliest stage tested was stage 3. Although requested, the effect of Ryanodine 2-APB on SACO was not analyzed. Thus it seems to be fair to include in the revised Discussion on the SACO mechanism (fourth paragraph) something like: &quot;Because we have not tested the involvement of SR function at stage 0, we cannot fully exclude that periodic Ca<sup>2</sup> releases from the SR are involved in the generation of SACO as reported before as a pacemaking mechanism in early embryonic cardiomyocytes (cite adequate references).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17113.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the previous round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>We appreciate the importance of this study on the establishment of calcium gradients and its implications for cardiogenesis.

However, a number of points raised by the reviewers indicate problems with the paper as it stands. Notably new mechanistic insights are weak.</italic> </p><p>Regarding the editorial summary on mechanistic insight, our study is the first to identify the onset of cardiac function and physiology within the embryo at significantly earlier stages of heart development (during formation of the cardiac crescent) than previously described. Prior studies have focused on linear heart tube looping (E8.5) stages and have relied extensively on <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses of isolated cells (Sasse et al. 2007; Rapila et al., 2008). In revision, we have now added additional experiments using the inhibitors Ryanodine and 2-APB to target the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) as a source of Ca<sup>2</sup> and whilst we found these inhibited cardiac function at later stages of heart development (in turned embryos at ~E8.5), there was no effect at the earliest onset of Ca<sup>2</sup> handling and contractile function. This new data suggests that mechanistically the SR is not required for the initiation of spontaneous asynchronous calcium oscillations (SACOs) or Ca<sup>2</sup> transients within the cardiac crescent. A requirement for SR function develops at later stages and further supports the role of NCX in initiating the earliest Ca<sup>2</sup> influx and the generation of SACOs.</p><p>In this study we present the following:</p><p>We attribute a mechanism for the onset of Ca2 handling and cardiac function at significantly earlier stages of heart development than previously appreciated;</p><p>Our data from culture and imaging of live embryos is representative of the in vivo setting and avoids caveats associated with isolated cell preparations and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies;</p><p>We exclude an essential role for the SR and reveal that sarcolemmal Ca2</p><p>flux via NCX, and then sequentially LTCCs, predominates within the early developing heart as distinct from adult modes of Ca2 -handling;</p><p>NCX alone is required for the generation of SACOs prior to the initiation of contraction.</p><p><italic>There is a lack of data on LTCC Cav1.3.</italic> </p><p>We have now included detailed expression profiling of the LTCC subunit Cav1.3, in the revised manuscript. However, whilst this is of interest, our use of Nifedipine blocks all LTCC isoforms, inhibiting both Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 and therefore, is a viable reagent to assess a general role for LTCCs in early Ca<sup>2</sup> handling. Application of Nifedipine at stage 0, did not inhibit SACOs in the forming cardiac crescent, excluding an early role for both Cav1.2 and Cav1.3.</p><p><italic>The mechanistic link between early NCX-1 dependent asyncronous activity and maturation of electrical activity and excitation contraction coupling is lacking – blocking experiments in embryo culture are inadequate.

At minimum, immunostaining for α-actinin, a Z-disc protein would much improve and strengthen this data. Further, inclusion of staining for myomesin, an M-band protein would be much more definitive especially if double stained showing alternating actinin/myomesin.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions and have now included a developmental timecourse of sarcomeric α-actinin and Myomesin immunostaining, which has allowed us to more conclusively define sarcomere formation (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-E</xref>; subsection “Staging of early cardiac development and sarcomeric assembly”, second paragraph). In addition, we have performed qRT-PCR on the genes encoding cardiac troponin T, myomesin and sarcomeric α-actinin, which all revealed significant up-regulation in isolated cardiac crescents between stage 0 and stage 1 (See revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; and the aforementioned paragraph).</p><p><italic>The gene expression studies should be complemented by whole mount in situ hybridization.

All samples were run in triplicate to account for technical variability and figure legends now state the number of biological replicates. Reference genes were initially validated by qPCR and this was the rationale for not using HPRT as a housekeeping gene when assessing gene expression during ESC differentiation, given the HPRT Ct values decreased during differentiation, as previously reported (Murphy and Polak, 2002). We have now used multiple housekeeping genes for each experiment, to provide us with more comprehensive reference expression levels, as now stated in the revised methods. For time course data fold-change was calculated in relation to the earliest stages (E7.75 in vivo, D0 ESC models), whilst for drug treated experiments fold change was calculated relative to control (DMSO) samples; this is now included in the revised methods as requested.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>The manuscript addresses the earliest stages of electrical activity in the mammalian heart and ES cell-derived EBs and in particular the relative requirements of the Na/Ca exchanger NCX1 and L-type Ca channel (LTCC). The main implications of the work are when Ca transients are established and how this relates to cardiogenesis. In general, the work is well written and the data interesting and relevant to the above issues. The functional and multidisciplinary approach to cardiac development is a strength. For the most part the experiments are carefully performed and results make a strong contribution.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive comments and for highlighting both the strength of using a multidisciplinary approach to address cardiac development as well as the view that these results make a strong contribution to the field.</p><p><italic>1) The novelty of the findings are diminished somewhat by prior publications on genetic deletion of NCX and LTCC genes in mice and fish. The novelty of this study lies in the detailed assessment of beating, Ca transients, and relative requirements for NCX1 and LTCCs. I recommend that some of the material relegated to the Discussion come forward to the Introduction to make clear the state of the field including the broad findings relating to NCX1 and LTCC pharmacological and genetic inhibition in the context of embryogenesis, and the novelty of the present findings in a summary paragraph. Background studies should cover what has been observed in the chick embryo wrt beating and pacemaker function, and electrophysiology.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the novelty of our manuscript and have rewritten the introduction accordingly. In terms of this paper’s findings being diminished by prior publications on genetic deletion models in mice and fish, it is important to note that genetic loss of function for NCX1 has produced a wide array of embryonic heart phenotypes, despite the fact that all the published studies targeted the same exon of NCX1. The hearts of the various NCX1 mutants range from arresting at the linear heart tube stage to completed looping morphogenesis and there is no insight into a putative early role in establishing Ca<sup>2</sup> -handing and contraction given the varied lethality. There is also insufficient evidence in these prior studies to assess whether complete KO has occurred and/or whether compensation is occurring via NCX1 splice variants, other NCX isoforms or alternative mechanisms of Ca<sup>2</sup> influx. By using pharmacological inhibition (with two independent specific NCX-inhibitors) at defined stages of development, we are able to rule out any compensatory effects arising from germ-line genetic ablation and moreover, simultaneously target multiple isoforms to converge on a role for NCX during the onset of cardiac function.</p><p><italic>2) The text is not rigorous in defining the dose of drugs used and the duration of use in each experiment. Different doses and treatments are mentioned. In addressing the relative requirements for NCX1 and LTCCs, dose response data would seem important as different drugs may have different Ki etc. It seems important to address this formally throughout or to do specific experiments that incorporate dose responses.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the problems with using pharmacological inhibition and hope that the revised manuscript is more thorough in defining the doses used. Drugs were selected based on previous publications which also defined the optimal working concentrations as effective when applied to <italic>in vitro</italic> cell-based assays. We tended to use slightly higher concentrations, albeit within the same µm range, due to penetration issues when using whole embryos. It is reassuring to note that whilst NCX inhibitors blocked transients at early stages, the effect was lost at later stages, thus excluding non-specific effects such as impaired cell survival, etc.</p><p><italic>3) Furthermore, rationale is not given for differing doses between experiments e.g. for CB-DMB is used at 20 μm in experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-F</xref> but at 1mM in those in Figure 6A-D. This is a massive difference. The authors must provide full rationale for these choices in light of the issue raised under point 2.</italic> </p><p>We apologise for the confusion; 1mM was an error, which has now been corrected. The highest concentration of CB-DMB used was 20 µM in the acute inhibitor experiments. The reason why higher concentrations were used when working with whole embryos is due to the penetration issues, associated with performing in vivo embryo Ca<sup>2</sup> measurements. Unfortunately, we are unable to definitively measure the concentration of drug to which the tissue was actually exposed.</p><p><italic>4) The experimental design in the experiment described at the end of page 8 onwards does not allow the stated conclusions to be drawn. First, duration of drug treatment is unknown. Second, the design of the sequential experiment is informative but does not allow the authors to conclude that the earlier NCX-1-dependent waves are essential for subsequent differentiation and beating.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and have included new experiments in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and reworded the accompanying text (subsection “Ca<sup>2</sup> transients within the forming cardiac crescent are dependent upon NCX1”) to address this issue. From these new experiments we are able to definitively conclude that NCX1-dependent waves are required for the generation of SACOs which precedes LTCC function. Drug treatment was maintained for 15 mins and assessed at both 5 mins and 15 mins as now stated in the aforementioned subsection and the revised Methods.</p><p><italic>5) In the last paragraph of the subsection “NCX1 is essential for the initiation of Ca<sup>2</sup> transients in the developing cardiac crescent”. the effects on GFP from Nkx2-5GFP should be quantified, preferably by FACS.</italic> </p><p>We have now quantified Nkx2.5-GFP by assessing the percentage of GFP area across multiple images taken from different experiments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>, subsection “Ca<sup>2</sup> channel blockade inhibits ESC differentiation into cardiomyocytes”). We have carried out independent sets of experiments using two entirely distinct ESC lines and observed the same phenotypes.</p><p><italic>6. In the last paragraph of the subsection “NCX1 is essential for the initiation of Ca<sup>2</sup> transients in the developing cardiac crescent”. This is a key experiment that addressed an important theme for the paper; the response of the cardiac network to inhibition of NCX1 and LTCC was poorly analysed (only 4 genes analysed, two of these encoding the channels, and only at one time point). Effects could be secondary.</italic> </p><p>These experiments include four key cardiac genes, but also additional analysis of <italic>Slc8a1, Cacna1c</italic> and <italic>CamKIId</italic>. We initially focused on a single end point when control cardiomyocyte would have been expected to be at their most differentiated. In revision, we have now also included a time course of ESC differentiation with and without CB-DMB, to more carefully analyse the effect of inhibition. This new data reveals that inhibition of NCX occurs during the initiation of cardiomyocyte differentiation between day 4 and 7 and supports our previous conclusions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>).</p><p><italic>7) In the subsection “Inward Ca<sup>2</sup> via NCX1 and downstream CAMKII signalling promotes cardiomyocyte differentiation”; inhibition of beating in low Ca is not surprising. How do the results show that Ca is required for maturation and differentiation?</italic> </p><p>Percentage of beating embryoid body analysis was performed in media containing 1.8 mM Ca<sup>2</sup> , as stated in the Methods, therefore a reduced percentage of beating embryoid bodies would represent a decrease in cardiomyocyte formation and would not be just a physiological consequence of low Ca<sup>2</sup> .</p><p><italic>8) In the subsection “NCX1 is essential for cardiac crescent formation during development”. For such an important point, actin staining of embryos treated with inhibitors and PCR are insufficient to draw the broad conclusion that there is a lack of crescent cells. This experiment needs far more development. What happens to the pre-cardiac cells and cardiac progenitors over time needs to be analysed with appropriate markers?</italic> </p><p>We have now repeated these experiments for multiple embryos, using immunohistochemistry for the contractile protein cTnT as a marker of differentiation and the transcription factor Nkx2.5 as a marker of cardiac progenitors within the crescent (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>; subsection &quot; NCX1 is essential for cardiomyocyte differentiation and cardiac crescent formation”). By performing this more in-depth analysis, we are confident in concluding that inhibition of NCX by CB-CMB leads to a decrease in mature cardiomyocytes which is not observed with inhibition of LTCCs by nifedipine treatment.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>The manuscript &quot;Calcium handling precedes cardiac differentiation to initiate the first heart beat&quot; by Tyser et al. tries to address the importance of calcium cycling for cardiac crescent formation in the embryonic heart by Ca<sup>2</sup> imaging, gene expression analysis and pharmacological blocking during culture of mouse embryos and embryonic stem cells. The main result is that the sodium-calcium-exchanger (NCX) is important for cardiomyocyte development and function because pharmacological block of NCX reduces Ca<sup>2</sup> transients and beating as well as lowers expression of cardiac genes and delays cardiac crescent formation.</italic> </p><p><italic>Although the manuscript presents major technical advancements in this field including mouse embryo culture and recording of Ca<sup>2</sup> transients from the cardiac crescent prior to beating, the study remains descriptional and the proposed mechanism is based on over interpretation of results and assumptions including drug specificity of long term drug application.</italic> </p><p>We are grateful for the positive comment regarding major technical advancements in this field including mouse embryo culture and recording of Ca<sup>2</sup> transients from the cardiac crescent prior to beating. We have had to include detailed descriptions of what we observe at the very earliest stages of cardiac crescent formation, Ca<sup>2</sup> handling and contractility given this has not been described before and is attributed to our advanced live imaging of mouse embryos. The pharmacological blockade of NCX1 and LTCCs provides mechanistic insight into the requirement for the exchanger, acting in reverse mode, to initiate Ca<sup>2</sup> influx and the appearance of SACOs prior to full transients and contractility within the crescent. Any issue with drug specificity is significantly reduced by our use of two independent inhibitors for NCX and the fact that we observe consistent results across independent models of mouse embryos and ESC-cardiomyocyte differentiation.</p><p><italic>Most importantly the authors have not measured or discussed the involvement of voltage signals in cardiomyocytes and several other known facts on the physiology of embryonic heart cells or on the pacemaking mechanism in the embryonic heart.</italic> </p><p>Pace-making appears not to apply to stages earlier than the looping heart tube, consistent with our focus on the initiation of Ca<sup>2</sup> handling and asynchronous oscillations (without pacing) as precedes contractile function. We have not made any statements regarding voltage signals, as we have not developed the whole tissue approach to record them in early embryos and we respectfully suggest this is beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><p><italic>The authors write &quot;NCX1, have not previously been implicated in the initiation event of cardiac contraction, nor investigated at the earliest stages of heart development coincident with the onset of beating&quot; and in the Abstract &quot;how the initial contractions are established have not been described&quot;. This is incorrect. It is well known that in the embryonic heart cell, a periodic intracellular calcium oscillation (IP3-dependent) is driving pacemaking and translated into voltage fluctuations specifically by the NCX (forward mode of the electrogenic pump). These fluctuations can induce action potentials that synchronize the cardiac tissue and therefore NCX is essential for cardiac development (please see for instance: Excitation-Contraction Coupling of the Mouse Embryonic Cardiomyocyte&quot; Rapila R et al. 2008 and the other papers by the Tavi group or &quot;Intracellular Ca<sup>2</sup> Oscillations, a Potential Pacemaking Mechanism in Early Embryonic Heart Cells&quot; Sasse P et al. 2007).</italic> </p><p><italic>Furthermore, it is well known that intact Ca<sup>2</sup> cycling is important for cardiac gene expression and heart development. The authors should clearly cite the previous work and specifically describe the novelty and mechanism of their study.</italic> </p><p>We have now significantly expanded the Introduction to cite previous studies that have looked at early cardiac development and contractile function and more clearly highlighted the novelty of our data. The manuscripts mentioned in the comment above have looked at cells from later stages than us (linear heart tube stage or later) and moreover, have examined these cells in isolation from the embryo. We have done additional experiments with IP3 and RyR inhibitors and indeed, we have confirmed their findings of a later requirement of IP3 signalling (that serves as a positive control for our inhibitors), but have also made the novel finding that during the earlier stages that constitute the main focus of our manuscript, SR Ca<sup>2</sup> is not required for the earliest manifestation of SACOs which precedes pacemaking activity.</p><p><italic>The main conclusion of the blocker experiments is that NCX reverse mode is important for Ca<sup>2</sup> entry and gene regulation but how this should induce periodic beating or pacemaking has not been addressed or discussed. NCX and can only work in reverse mode when intracellular Na concentration is excessively high during an action potential (although controversial if this really happens, or if the effect is only a less effective forward mode). This has not been shown for embryonic cardiomyocytes and is highly unlikely because of the lack of Na channels or Na driven action potentials at this stage.</italic> </p><p>We are focusing on the earliest onset of Ca<sup>2</sup> influx, the establishment of Spontaneous Asynchronous Ca<sup>2</sup> Oscillations (SACOs) prior to beating, and how this impacts on cardiomyocyte differentiation and crescent morphogenesis. The presence of SACOs precedes pacemaker activity and synchronisation which, are outside the focus and scope of this manuscript.</p><p>NCX has been shown to act in both forward and reverse mode in embryonic cardiomyocytes (Reppel et al. 2007, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences) and the directionality of NCX1 activity is dependent on the concentration gradient of intra- and extra-cellular Ca<sup>2</sup> and Na in addition to the membrane potential (Reppel, Reuter, et al. 2007). The conditions that favour reverse mode NCX1 activity include less depolarised membrane potentials. Reversal potential, for NCX1 is around -26mV. In terms of NCX1 function this means that, if the membrane potential was lower than -26mV, “forward mode” activity (Ca<sup>2</sup> efflux) would occur, however at membrane potentials above -26mV “reverse-mode” activity (Ca<sup>2</sup> influx) would predominate. Resting membrane potential of immature cardiomyocytes is known to be significantly higher than the adult (-85mV). Embryonic cardiomyocytes at around E10.5 have been shown to have a resting membrane potential of around -40mV (Sasse et al. 2007; Rapila et al. 2008), with less differentiated cardiomyocytes potentially having an even greater than -40mV membrane potential, increasing the likelihood and potential functional relevance of “reverse mode” NCX1 activity as well as making it more susceptible to changes in the concentration of intracellular Ca<sup>2</sup> and Na. Thus NCX1 function within the stage 0 cardiac crescent could be responsible for both the Ca<sup>2</sup> influx and efflux, correlating with the slow dynamics of stage 0 Ca<sup>2</sup> transients, potentially regulating Ca<sup>2</sup> homeostasis until contraction is initiated.</p><p>We have qualified our interpretation of NCX1 acting in reverse mode in the revised text:</p><p>“While the existence of the NCX reverse mode is contentious, the observation that at stage 0 SACOs were abolished with CB-DMB treatment but persisted when treated with nifedipine suggests that NCX and not the LTCC plays a major role in Ca<sup>2</sup> influx at this early stage.”</p><p><italic>The (confusing) idea of a reverse mode NCX comes from the literature that state that at low dosages (EC50 in the low µM range) KB-R is preferential blocking a reverse mode. Although oocyte experiments with non-physiological intracellular Na concentrations suggest this, other experiments on cardiomyocytes (e.g. &quot;Direction-independent block of bi-directional Na /Ca<sup>2</sup> exchange current by KB-R7943 in guinea-pig cardiac myocytes&quot; by Kimura, J et al. 1999) show that this specificity is not existent and other papers show that this is highly depending on intracellular Na concentrations and drug dosage used. Thus without electrophysiological analysis, it remains unclear, if the inhibitory effect on beating and cardiac crescent formation after block of NCX by KB-R or CB-DMB is due to effects on of Ca<sup>2</sup> oscillations, pacemaking, translemmal Ca<sup>2</sup> entry or exit, membrane potential fluctuation, synchronization by action potentials, imbalance of Ca<sup>2</sup> homeostasis or off-target effects that occur especially when applied long term.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the concept of NCX working in reverse mode is controversial despite the fact that it has been reported that KB-R9743 preferentially blocks reverse mode NCX1 activity (Hoyt et al. 1998; Iwamoto 2004). To this end we have revised the manuscript to reflect this (see response to comment above).</p><p><italic>In summary, the presented data, although in part novel and interesting, together with the known literature on embryonic cardiomyocytes and on the physiology of ECC, LTCC and NCX function does not allow to conclude a mechanism.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive comments on our data being novel and interesting. Given the extensive new data and our revised interpretation we believe we have now converged on a mechanism whereby NCX1 is required for the establishment of SACOs within the earliest crescent stages as a pre-requisite for cardiomyocyte differentiation and crescent morphogenesis.</p><p><italic>Specific major points:</italic> </p><p><italic>The Introduction is too short and only very general. Specifically, several known facts on initiation of the first heart beat and the role of calcium gene regulation during embryonic heart development should be cited. For instance, several earlier publications have tried to address &quot;the important question of when and how contractile activity of cardiomyocytes is first initiated during development&quot; (see above). In addition to cite these earlier work in introduction it should be better pointed out, why these earlier studies are not sufficient and the current study is required (which is easy, because of the nice</italic> in vivo <italic>data).</italic> </p><p><italic>Also the first paragraph of the section &quot;A role for the Sodium-Calcium exchanger…&quot; belongs to the Introduction. Please describe the well-known ECC in the adult heart a bit less but introduce more the known facts on ECC and the importance of NCX for pacemaking in the embryonic heart (see above).</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestions and hope that the revised manuscript now incorporates more thoroughly previous literature (Introduction) as well as clearly stating the novelty of the studies presented herein.</p><p><italic>Because of the low resolution of the supplied PDF file, the cardiac maturation and cross striation at the different crescent sages is difficult to review. Maybe providing inserts to highlight the specific patterns (especially stage 1 2) would help. Is cross striation completely absent in stage 0?</italic> </p><p>We have now looked in more detail at cardiac maturation and sarcolemmal development within the developing cardiac crescent. In the revised manuscript we have now included analyses of two sarcomere related proteins (myomesin and sarcomeric α-actinin) as well as cardiac troponin T. In addition, we have performed qRT-PCR to assess the expression of these genes during crescent development. In both the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-E</xref>, inserts are provided highlighting the formation of sarcomeres from stage 1 onwards. From this more detailed analysis we have been unable to detect cross striation within the stage 0 cardiac crescent, as is now addressed in the subsection “Staging of early cardiac development and sarcomeric assembly”.</p><p><italic>The finding of Ca<sup>2</sup> transients at stage 0 is fascinating. Maybe better call them &quot;spontaneous asynchronous Ca<sup>2</sup> oscillations&quot; also to highlight the difference semantically to the (action potential-based?) coupled transients at stage 1 . What is the average frequency and is there a correlation between frequency and TTP (maybe more interesting to show than TTP vs TT<sub>1/2</sub>M which lacks a conclusion)? Is there evidence that transients are coupled between individual cells (from the video this seems to be sometimes the case). Although not in the scope of the authors´ manuscript, recording of membrane potential is essential to understand the nature of cell-cell coupling of these fascinating data.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive comments and have taken on-board the suggested terminology of &quot;spontaneous asynchronous Ca<sup>2</sup> oscillations&quot; (SACOs) to describe Ca<sup>2</sup> “transients” at stage 0. We have now edited the figure containing characterisation of stage 0 transients and no longer include the data relating to TTP and TT<sub>1/2</sub>M. The revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> now includes characterisation of SACOs within a 90 sec video and highlights the variation in frequency and oscillation dynamics. We believe there is evidence that transients are coupled between some individual cells and we are planning future studies to measure membrane potential within these cells. However, this requires extensive further experimentation which is beyond the scope of this submission, but will be important in understanding the progression of SACOs to synchronised/paced transients.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: Normalizing gene expression data to D0 or E7.5 (where most genes are not expressed) make less sense, adds noise and masks information. Please consider normalization to the time point of the highest value.</italic> </p><p>After analysing the qRT-PCR data in multiple different ways we do not find an increase in noise when comparing at time point 0. Within the ESC model, there is variation in the extent of differentiation between cultures, which becomes greater the longer the differentiation time-course, therefore comparing to the latest stage (e.g. D14), as befits higher expression values, incurs a greater variation between experiments. This same applies to the longer-term embryo culture experiments.</p><p><italic>Unfortunately, Cacna1d (Cav1.3), which is the dominant isoform of LTCC in the early embryo (see &quot;Subtype switching of L-Type Ca 2 channel from Cav1.3 to Cav1.2 in embryonic murine ventricle&quot;. Takemura H et al. 2005) was not analyzed and therefore the expression data of Cacna1c does not suggest a minor role of LTCC, but just highlights the well-known isoform switch (see also &quot;Functional Embryonic Cardiomyocytes after Disruption of the L-type α1C (Cav1.2) Calcium Channel Gene in the Mouse&quot;). The analysis of other LTCC genes or western blot at different stages from heart tissue might help in this regard.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have now investigated the expression of Cav1.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>; subsection “Ion channels are expressed during the earliest stages of heart development”). However, by performing pharmacological inhibitor studies using Nifedipine, we have effectively inhibited all LTCC isoforms and not just Cav1.2 (<italic>Cacna1c</italic>). The previous suggestion of a “minor role” for LTCC was based on the fact that the NCX inhibitor (CB-DMB) had a significant inhibitory effect on SACOs as compared to LTCC inhibition (Nifedipine) or control (DMSO). This is now further reinforced in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-K</xref> and we have revised the text to limit our conclusions, for relative roles of NCX versus LTCC, to the earliest manifestation of Ca<sup>2</sup> handling.</p><p><italic>The establishment of an embryo culture for investigation of cardiac crescent or heart tube formation as well as for gene expression analysis is a definite plus and a main methodological advancement of this paper. Very nice! However, the fact that &quot;Embryos cultured in CB-DMB were delayed in terms of cardiac crescent formation&quot; is not supported by the one actin image shown (Figure 6O) although it is one of the main messages of the paper. Repeating of experiments, extensive histological analysis by specific crescent staining, and quantitation is suggested. Also a time course analysis of crescent formation with and without CB-DMB and KBR would enhance the paper. How many hours are the cardiac crescent forming delayed under NCX blockage?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive feedback on the embryo culture experiments. As suggested, we have further expanded these experiments on multiple cultured embryos per treatment (DMSO, n=6; CB-DMB, n=8; Nifedipine, n=6) and performed immunostaining for Nkx2.5 to mark cardiac progenitors within the forming crescent and cardiac troponin T to mark the more differentiated cardiomyocytes. These experiments revealed a significant decrease in the number of cTnT cells in CB-DMB-treated embryos in comparison to control or Nifedipine treatment (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) and clearly show the inhibitory effect of pharmacological NCX blockade on cardiomyocyte differentiation, which also correlated with a decrease in cardiac specific gene expression (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Due to the clear and consistent decrease in cTnT staining after NCX inhibition, we have not quantified the immunofluoresence, particularly as quantification of immunostaining is of limited accuracy. However, we present quantitative data on changes in gene expression in the CB-DMB treated embryos through qRT-PCR. Whilst being able to study a developmental timecourse of cardiac crescent development with and without pharmacological inhibition would be ideal, it is not currently feasible due to issues associated with staging embryos, variations in extent of development between embryos and the technical limitations with the live-imaging.</p><p><italic>Was the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B, E, F</xref> obtained from Ca imaging or from video microscopy? If here video microscopy was used, also data from Ca imaging should be added to see the acute (&gt;1-2 minutes) effects of the three blockers on Ca<sup>2</sup> transients and remaining Ca<sup>2</sup> oscillations (before all Ca<sup>2</sup> has left the cell and the impaired Ca<sup>2</sup> homeostasis is blocking pacemaking).</italic> </p><p>Ca<sup>2</sup> imaging was used with differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy to obtain bright-field images. Imaging was conducted at 5 minutes after drug application to allow for diffusion and penetration of the embryo. Unfortunately, our current in vivo imaging setup does not allow us to image instantaneously after drug application, meaning we cannot currently observe acute changes in Ca<sup>2</sup> dynamics which would be informative. Attempts to continuously image a single embryo impacted on viability and cardiac function due to excessive photo- damage. Instead we have focused on imaging multiple embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-H</xref> (stage1/2: DMSO, n=4; CB-DMB, n=7; KB-R7943, n=6; nifedipine, n=6; stage3/LHT: DMSO, n=5; CB-DMB, n=14; KB-R7943, n=7; nifedipine, n=8) at specific time- points (5mins, 15mins and 30mins).</p><p><italic>In the Discussion the authors have claimed to use &quot;two independent pharmacological channel blockers CB-DMB and KB-R7943, in embryo cultures&quot;, but only show CB-DMB data in Figure 6. Please also show the KB-R data on embryonic cultures.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for this confusion. While CB-DMB and KB-R7943 were used for the acute, short term embryo culture experiments, only CB-DMB and Nifedipine were used in the long term embryo culture studies. Due to the difficulties associated with obtaining large numbers of embryos at the same development stage (dissection, handling and maintaining constant culture conditions) and the fact that during later stages the inhibitors seem to have the same effect, we focused on CB-DMB to reduce the number of animals used for the experiments and to enable comparisons to be drawn with the parallel experiments conducted in ESC- cardiomyocyte cultures.</p><p><italic>The authors describe “sequential addition of CB-DMB to nifedipine-treated embryos after 15 mins, subsequently blocked the transients that were refractory to LTCC inhibition (not shown).&quot; Please provide the data and statistics and explain the mechanism. What is the percentage of transients that were not blocked by LTCC inhibition? Was this observed at all stages or is this stage specific?</italic> </p><p>These sequential inhibitor experiments were initially carried out, but have since been superseded by a more rigorous focus on the independent inhibitor studies, in light of the evident early versus later roles for NCX1 versus LTCCs. We have since edited the manuscript to remove the sequential inhibitor data.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript resubmitted after revision is much improved and is now under review with a view to publication of these interesting findings. The authors show that the sodium calcium exchanger (NCX) early, at what they define as stage 0, is essential for generating spontaneous asynchronous Ca<sup>2</sup> oscillations (SACO) in the cardiac crescent and that these are essential for cardiac gene expression and subsequent development. However, interpretation of the results and the proposal that reverse mode NCX, allowing Ca<sup>2</sup> to enter the cell, is involved in the mechanism are still problematic.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers and editors for the assessment that the manuscript is much improved following the first round of revisions and for the progression towards review to publish our “interesting findings”. We have now toned down our interpretations on mechanism of reverse NCX1 function in the revised text as requested. In addition, we now include an additional set of KB-R7943 inhibitor experiments on stage 0 embryos and have re-normalised all of our real time qPCR gene expression data in line with the reviewer requests. Please find a detailed point-for-point response to the remaining issues detailed below.</p><p><italic>Firstly, in the experiments with inhibitors, the stage 0 experiments are critical. The authors use nifedipine to block voltage dependent Ca<sup>2</sup> channels (VDCC), which interestingly at stage 0 has less effect on SACO, in contrast to later stages when it blocks activity. CB-DMB, which blocks NCX, affects SACO at stage 0, but it also blocks Ca<sup>2</sup> exit mode. In the manuscript KB-R7943 is claimed to specifically block reverse mode NCX but it was not used at stage 0. This result should be shown. The finding that this inhibitor blocks activity at stages 1 and 2 is not so important because nifedipine does this too. In their interpretation the authors should be aware of controversy about the action of KB-R7943.</italic> </p><p>We have now performed follow-up experiments using KB-R7943 at stage 0, and have included this data in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>. Whilst we are aware of the controversy surrounding the mode of KB-R7943 action (addressed in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion), we have found that two independent NCX inhibitors block the SACOs observed at Stage 0, allowing us to conclude that NCX is required for their generation.</p><p><italic>The SACO shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref> is one of the most important pieces of data and in fact is the major novelty. Please provide more data here including n-numbers, statistics and report reproducibility of these findings. Are SACO observed in every stage 0 embryo? What is the Ca<sup>2</sup> cycling frequency and amplitude and how often are single uncoupled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>´) and multiple coupled cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>´´) observed?</italic> </p><p>We have now provided more data to describe the stage 0 SACOs including the number of stage 0 embryos assessed (n=35) as well as more data on the Ca<sup>2</sup> transient dynamics including the time to peak Ca<sup>2</sup> signal (Ca<sup>2</sup> influx) and the time to ½ maximum Ca<sup>2</sup> signal (Ca<sup>2</sup> efflux) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In general, as long as the endoderm was properly removed to allow penetration of the dye and better visualization of the cardiac mesoderm, SACOs were observed in every stage 0 embryo, revised text in subsection “The onset of Ca<sup>2</sup> -handling in the cardiac crescent”. We believe that further studies on SACO dynamics, especially in terms of uncoupled and coupled cells, is beyond the scope of this current manuscript but is something we are actively addressing by developing methodology to accurately quantify Ca<sup>2</sup> transient amplitude and synchronisation in live embryos, given this requires longer imaging periods than we are currently able to perform.</p><p><italic>The experiments on blocking SACO with CB-DMB in contrast to nifedipine lead to one of the most important findings, however the analysis and statistics are very limited. Please provide absolute numbers of cells with SACO and original data (example traces, videos) to enable the reader to follow the analysis and statistics. Line 310: What does &quot; 0.87 0.083, mean SEM&quot; refer to? How are cells without SACO identified if they do not show Ca<sup>2</sup> signals? How is the variance of cells with SACO per embryo? ANOVA comparisons are required to take these variations in control embryos into account.</italic> </p><p>Following on from the new experiments conducted with KB-R7943 at stage 0, we have reanalysed our data and now report SACO inhibition after drug treatment as the percentage inhibition of SACOs compared to baseline (subsection “Ca<sup>2</sup> transients within the forming cardiac crescent are dependent upon NCX1”, last paragraph). We have also included a supplementary table of the original data analyses to document absolute number of SACOs observed before and after treatment, ratio of SACOs maintained after treatment, percentage inhibition, area containing SACOs and length of imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H-J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1D</xref>). Regarding the statistics, we have chosen to perform Fisher Exact Probability Test (FEPT) and treat this data as categorical, i.e. presence or absence of SACOs, since the variance for CB-DMB and KB-7943 is virtually non-existent (almost all embryos had zero SACOs after treatment) and hence statistical tests which assume a continuous data model are not suitable and cannot be applied to data.</p><p><italic>The novel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref> on RyR/APD treatment is confusing as it does not follow the authors (very good) stage classification (stage 0, 1, 2, 3, LHT) but has a novel classification (turned/pre-turned embryo). Please label data as stage 0, stage 1 and LHT, at least. Please add statistics, error bars and original Ca<sup>2</sup> imaging traces. A DMSO control for stage 3 is missing.</italic> </p><p>We apologise that the later staging was confusing. This data was collected using embryos in which the heart had begun to loop, which is much later than the LHT stage and is why we cannot use our new staging method (applies to stages up to LHT). Stages later than the LHT represent a positive control for the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum inhibitor experiments, which we found had no effect at the earlier stage, (indicating the Ca<sup>2</sup> at the earliest stages is not SR dependent). The term ‘turned’ is well accepted within the mouse embryology field and refers to a specific morphogenetic event when the entire embryo turns to assume a more conventional ‘foetal position’ within the yolk sac, curled up around its ventral aspect. The missing statistics, original Ca<sup>2</sup> imaging traces and a DMSO control for stage 3 have now been included in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>. The data lacks error bars because in this instance it is binary (either it was inhibited or not) hence also why we applied a Freeman-Halton extension of the Fisher exact probability test.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 A, B, E, F</xref>: the error bars are missing. In fact, it is not even fully clear from the methods what% inhibition means. Please discriminate between complete block of beating (movement in DIC images), reduction of frequency, complete block of Ca<sup>2</sup> transients and reduction of Ca<sup>2</sup> transient amplitude. Also please provide time courses and report the delay of drug action (should be easy as Ca<sup>2</sup> imaging was performed at baseline and at 5, 15 and 30 minutes post drug treatment).</italic> </p><p><italic>In general, in the text it is important to clarify what is meant by inhibition and partial inhibition.</italic> </p><p>We have now included an explicit definition of what is meant by% inhibition in the Methods section (subsection “Live imaging – DIC, Ca2 561, Embryos and Cells”) and have removed the term partial inhibition as we appreciate this was misleading. The reason for no error bars is that our data is binary either – there were or were not Ca<sup>2</sup> transients – and hence we have performed a Freeman-Halton extension of the Fisher exact probability test as the correct statistical analysis for this data type. We have also edited the text so that all inhibition data is based on Ca<sup>2</sup> transient propagation as it is a clearer to assess the effect of pharmacological blockade. The Ca<sup>2</sup> imaging data has now been reanalysed and we have revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> to show the time-course of inhibition requested above. We are unable to determine Ca<sup>2</sup> transient amplitude given the method for imaging Ca<sup>2</sup> transients in intact tissue does not allow for ratiometric measurements.</p><p><italic>Although the pharmacological block using CB-DMB shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I-L</xref> lets the authors conclude that Ca<sup>2</sup> entry though NCX is the basis for the SACO, the mechanism of how this could be periodic and lead to oscillations in Ca<sup>2</sup> is unclear. The authors are correct that NCX can (under special circumstances such as elevated intracellular Na or depolarized membrane potential) lead to Ca<sup>2</sup> entry, but once this occurs, the electrogenic nature of NCX (~3 Na for 1 Ca<sup>2</sup> ) will again hyperpolarize the cell and export Na until the equilibrium potential is reached and Ca<sup>2</sup> flux ceases. Thus it is not possible that the NCX can generate periodic Ca<sup>2</sup> oscillations alone. Reverse mode only occurs if periodic action potentials are depolarizing the cell but then cells should be synchronized (no SACO). Maybe Na levels are cycling or the Na/K-ATPase is involved? This could be clarified by testing whether SACO at stage 0 are blocked by RyR/2-APB or by SERCA blockers (Thapsigargin/CPA). These mechanistic considerations should be taken into account in the authors' Discussion.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the precise mechanism for periodic oscillations of Ca<sup>2</sup> entry may involve other factors beyond NCX1, however, we have now shown, using two different inhibitors, that NCX is required for the generation of SACOs within the cardiac crescent at stage 0. We have taken into account the limitations on mechanistic insight as suggested and have addressed them within the revised Discussion, as well as detailing further experiments which would be of interest, but are currently beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>On the mechanistic front, as it stands the paper does not permit definitive conclusions; the authors must be less dogmatic about the SACO/Ca<sup>2</sup> cycling mechanism and introduce notes of caution in their Discussion. The authors are encouraged to attempt electrophysiological analysis since without this it remains unclear if the inhibitory effect on beating and cardiac crescent formation of NCX by KB-R7945 or CB-DMB is due to effects on SACO, translemmal NCX reverse mode Ca<sup>2</sup> entry (mechanism unclear) or NCX forward mode Ca<sup>2</sup> exit (NCX block-based Ca<sup>2</sup> overload can also inhibit gene expression), imbalance of Ca<sup>2</sup> homeostasis or off-target effects. These analyses as well as straight forward siRNA experiments, proposed in the first reviews prior to resubmission, should be feasible with the elegant embryo culture technology set up by the authors.</italic> </p><p>We have now reworded the text to be less dogmatic regarding the SACO/Ca<sup>2</sup> cycling mechanism as well as introducing notes of caution within the revised Discussion. The siRNA experiments suggested by the reviewer, though elegant, are not straightforward. They involve optimisation of a delivery method (e.g. by electroporation, or virus), followed by prolonged culture to ensure knock-down of transcript and clearance of protein through turnover, only after which can the experiments be attempted. It is not clear that embryos subjected to such interventions will retain normal electrophysiological behaviour and what level of knock-down is required to ablate function. Therefore, whilst such experiments would be of interest and something we plan to pursue in the future we believe they are beyond the scope of this manuscript given the aims of the current study: to understand the effects of Ca<sup>2</sup> handling and early contractile function on downstream cardiomyocyte differentiation and morphogenesis, during which we have provided strong evidence implicating a role for NCX1.</p><p><italic>A second aspect which requires further revision is the gene expression data. This should be normalised relative to housekeeping control genes. Normalising to E7.75 when most genes are not expressed and there is mainly noise is not informative, preventing meaningful comparison between genes. For instance, in the current presentation the time course of NCX and Cav1.3 seems to be superimposable. The data should be represented as dCT (normalised only to housekeeping genes) and then the meaningful differences in time course/relative levels discussed.</italic> </p><p>We have now repeated all the analysis of qRT-PCR data and expressed everything as deltaCT as well as normalising only to housekeeping genes as suggested above by the reviewer(s).</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>Before publication, the following remaining concerns of one reviewer will need to be addressed:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Please provide information on the frequency, duration and regularity of SACO at stage 0 as requested and as stated in the subsection “The onset of Ca<sup>2</sup> -handling in the cardiac crescent” (&quot;variable frequencies and durations&quot;). From the authors comment in the rebuttal and from <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref> (very nice) it is well understandable that precise numbers are difficult to give but at lease state something like &quot;Compared to Ca<sup>2</sup> transients at later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) the SACO were rare. During a ~20 s recording period we observed only 10.3 -x individual SACO per embryo (n=24) occurring in different sites. Consecutive SACO in a same site were rarely observed within the 20 s imaging windows and therefore we conclude that SACO in individual cells occur at a frequency &lt; 3 bpm.&quot;</italic> </p><p>The suggested sentences above are now included with correct values on page 6:“Compared to Ca<sup>2</sup> transients at later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) SACOs were significantly slower, with fluorescence reaching peak intensity between 0.79 and 11.9 s and decreasing with a similar slow rate of efflux(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). During a ~20 s recording period we observed only 10.3 ± 0.7 individual SACOs per embryo (n=35) occurring in different sites. Consecutive SACOs in the same site were rarely observed within the 20 second imaging window and therefore we conclude that SACOs in individual cells occur at a frequency &lt; 3 bpm.”</p><p><italic>2) Please describe the meaning of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref> with something like &quot;During a SACO, Ca<sup>2</sup> rises slowly and reaches the peak between 0.5 and 10 s. Cells with slow Ca<sup>2</sup> influx also showed similar slow Ca<sup>2</sup> efflux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).&quot;</italic> </p><p>We have incorporated an explanation similar to that suggested above about <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref> on page 6:</p><p>“SACOs were significantly slower, with fluorescence reaching peak intensity between 0.79 and 11.9 s and decreasing with a similar slow rate of efflux(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).”</p><p><italic>3) Because of the very slow nature of SACO, also oscillations in energy production and ATP levels can be involved (in fact the most likely explanation of SR is not involved). Please add this to the Discussion (fourth paragraph).</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting another potential mechanism of SACO generation and have now included this in the discussion on page 15:</p><p>“Due to the slow nature of SACOs, oscillations in energy production along with adenosine triphosphate levels could also be involved in SACO generation, especially with reduced SR function. Whilst SR inhibition did not prevent stage 3 Ca<sup>2</sup> transients, we have not tested the involvement of SR function at stage 0 and, therefore, cannot fully exclude that periodic Ca<sup>2</sup> releases from the SR are involved in the generation of SACOs. The latter has been reported in cultured E8.5-9 embryonic cardiomyocytes as a pacemaking mechanism (Sasse et al. 2007 and Rapilla et al. 2008), at later stages than were the focus in this study.”</p><p><italic>4) The authors state that Ryanodine 2-APB only affected embryos that had already undergone cardiac looping but the earliest stage tested was stage 3. Although requested, the effect of Ryanodine 2-APB on SACO was not analyzed. Thus it seems to be fair to include in the revised Discussion on the SACO mechanism (fourth paragraph) something like: &quot;Because we have not tested the involvement of SR function at stage 0, we cannot fully exclude that periodic Ca<sup>2</sup> releases from the SR are involved in the generation of SACO as reported before as a pacemaking mechanism in early embryonic cardiomyocytes (cite adequate references).</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that we have not tested SR inhibition within the stage 0 embryo and have, therefore, included the following statement: <bold>“</bold>we have not tested the involvement of SR function at stage 0 and, therefore, cannot fully exclude that periodic Ca<sup>2</sup> releases from the SR are involved in the generation of SACOs”.However, we respectfully disagree with inclusion of the “reported before” statement, since the two studies which have previously looked at the role of SR in pace making have studied cardiomyocytes cultured for 12 – 70 hours and collected at a significantly later time point (E8.5/E9) as stated in the Introduction. We, therefore, feel that referring to these studies directly against our early stage analyses is inappropriate; albeit our results recapitulate theirs when looking at the more mature hearts (i.e. looping at E8.5).</p></body></sub-article></article>
