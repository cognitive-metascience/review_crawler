An archaeal homologue of this highly conserved enzyme was shown to directly interact with the 20S proteasome. Here, we analyze the occurrence and phylogeny of a Cdc48 homologue in <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> and assess its cellular function and possible interaction with the bacterial proteasome. Our data demonstrate that Cdc48-like protein of actinobacteria (Cpa) forms hexameric rings and that the oligomeric state correlates directly with the ATPase activity. Furthermore, we show that the assembled Cpa rings can physically interact with the 20S core particle. Comparison of the <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> wild-type with a <italic>cpa</italic> knockout strain under carbon starvation uncovers significant changes in the levels of around 500 proteins. Pathway mapping of the observed pattern of changes identifies ribosomal proteins as a particular hotspot, pointing amongst others toward a role of Cpa in ribosome adaptation during starvation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34055.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells use proteins to carry out the biological processes necessary for life. If a protein becomes damaged or is no longer needed, cells must dispose of it, just as we might take out the trash.

Chaperones in the context of protein degradation form complexes with compartmentalizing protease cylinders and act by unfolding their protein substrates, translocating them into the proteolytic compartment for degradation. Mycobacteria and many other actinobacteria possess several independent chaperone-protease complexes: the canonical bacterial Clp protease system and membrane-bound FtsH protease as well as a eukaryotic-like proteasome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Imkamp et al., 2015</xref>). The existence of proteasomes in bacteria is an unusual feature restricted to actinobacteria, a diverse phylum with different members showing various examples of eukaryotic-like complexes or activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cavalier-Smith, 2002</xref>). Like in eukaryotes, the bacterial 20S proteasome core particle must associate with an activator to form the fully active proteolytic complex. The first activator described was ARC (ATPase forming ring-shaped complexes), also called Mpa (mycobacterial proteasomal ATPase) in mycobacteria, a divergent AAA+ family protein that catalyzes the ATP-dependent unfolding and translocation into the proteasome chamber of proteins post-translationally modified with prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein Pup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burns et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pearce et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Striebel et al., 2014</xref>). Proteomic studies on whole-cell purified ‘pupylomes’ (pupylated proteomes) identified hundreds of cellular proteins as pupylation targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Compton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Festa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Watrous et al., 2010</xref>). One of the best characterized pupylation targets and favorite in vitro substrates is ketopantoate hydroxymethyltransferase (PanB), the enzyme that catalyzes the first committed step of pantothenate biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chaudhuri et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pearce et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>More recently, a second proteasomal activator was discovered, the bacterial proteasome activator Bpa (also referred to as PafE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jastrab et al., 2015</xref>). Bpa acts in an ATP-independent manner and is thought to aid in proteasomal degradation of proteins damaged under stress conditions, since it supports degradation of the unstructured model substrate casein and is involved in degradation of the conformationally unstable transcriptional heat shock protein repressor HspR in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jastrab et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jastrab et al., 2015</xref>). The two non-homologous activators Mpa/ARC and Bpa both form ring-shaped complexes with a central pore and share as one additional important feature with eukaryotic proteasome interactors a C-terminal proteasome interaction motif featuring a penultimate tyrosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Imkamp et al., 2015</xref>). In eukaryotes, this motif is called HbYX motif, since the tyrosine is preceded by a hydrophobic residue. Mpa/ARC and Bpa on the other hand both carry the sequence ‘GQYL’, where Q can be mutated freely without changing association behavior of the activator with the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jastrab et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In eukaryotes, 20S proteasomes are found in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus, where they degrade proteins upon association with the 19S regulatory particle. The regulatory particle contains six ATPase subunits that form the hexameric basal ring stacking onto the 20S cylinder. However, the proteasome is also responsible for degradation of ER-resident proteins via the so-called ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway that requires retrotranslocation of substrate proteins out of the ER into the cytoplasm. In this context, the 20S proteasome additionally cooperates with another AAA+ protein, Cdc48 (also known as p97 or VCP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeLaBarre et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wolf and Stolz, 2012</xref>). Cdc48 has also been implicated in a multitude of other cellular processes like membrane fusion, autophagy and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yamanaka et al., 2012</xref>). The different Cdc48 functions are largely mediated by various adaptor proteins (&gt;40) binding to the N-terminal domain or C-terminal region of Cdc48 and aiding in recognition of different substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buchberger et al., 2015</xref>). Although the exact role played by Cdc48 during ERAD is not fully understood, it is involved in pulling proteins from the membrane or from ribosomes during co-translational degradation, and recent evidence suggests even a direct association with the 20S particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barthelme and Sauer, 2013</xref>). Such a direct role as 20S proteasome activator has been shown for the Cdc48 homolog from archaea in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barthelme et al., 2014</xref>). Archaeal Cdc48 forms a complex with the 20S proteasome that is capable of degrading ssrA-tagged model substrates, likely due to the disordered, extended nature of the ssrA-tag at their C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barthelme and Sauer, 2013</xref>). Eukaryotic Cdc48 on the other hand is not able to recognize ssrA-tagged substrates in vitro, which was proposed to be due to the absence of two hydrophobic residues in the entry pore loop. These residues must be involved in recognition of the ssrA tag, since their introduction into the eukaryotic p97 enabled it to unfold ssrA-tagged model substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barthelme and Sauer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rothballer et al., 2007</xref>). Although the ssrA-tag is not a bona fide degradation signal in eukaryots and archaea, the D1 pore-1 loops and the nature of the residues within these loops appear to play a general role in substrate recruitment. A recent study demonstrated that mutating residues in these entry loops in vivo deregulated cellular protein turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Esaki et al., 2017</xref>). In the mammalian homolog, the same residues are required for proper function of the ERAD pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeLaBarre et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we characterize the Cdc48-like protein of actinobacteria (Cpa) by a combination of bioinformatical analysis, genetic modification and biochemical characterization to explore ring formation of Cpa, to probe its ability to interact with the 20S proteasome as well as to map proteomic changes resulting from its deletion in <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> (Msm). We show that Cpa forms hexameric rings, their assembly strongly dependent on pH and ionic strength. Once formed, the rings are capable of interacting with the proteasomal core particle, identifying Cpa as a novel proteasomal interactor in actinobacteria. Moreover, we report the comparative proteomic profile of an Msm parent and <italic>cdc48</italic>-deficient strain, providing a basis for assessing the function of this AAA+ ATPase in mycobacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phylogeny of Cdc48-like protein from actinobacteria (Cpa)</title><p>Actinobacteria encode a number of AAA+ proteins that were shown to be involved in protein degradation pathways, amongst them the chaperone complexes of the Clp protease system, ClpX and ClpC, as well as the energy-dependent proteasome activator Mpa in mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Laederach et al., 2014</xref>). As Cdc48 in eukaryotes and archaea is amongst other functions also tied to protein degradation, we set out to investigate if its homolog might have an analogous function in actinobacteria. The <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) Cpa protein Rv0435c is annotated in the UniProt database as Cdc48 based on sequence homology to the eukaryotic Cdc48 (p97 or VCP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">The UniProt Consortium, 2017</xref>). In order to gain a better understanding of the position of the actinobacterial homolog within the family of Cdc48-like proteins we performed a multiple sequence alignment of 1167 sequences including members of five previously identified eukaryotic Cdc48 families (PEX1/6, NSF, Spaf, Spaf-like, p97) as well as archaeal and actinobacterial Cdc48-like proteins using the ClustalO algorithm. The alignment was used for construction of a phylogenetic tree using the approximately-maximum-likelihood method of the FastTree software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Price et al., 2010</xref>). As expected, all the sequences cluster into subgroups according to their previously assigned classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, mycobacterial Rv0435c, as well as its actinobacterial orthologs, form an independent cluster in the Cdc48-family tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, blue branch). In contrast, sporadically occurring Cdc48 homologs of bacterial species outside of the phylum <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> do not cluster with their actinobacterial counterparts, but rather with archaeal Cdc48 family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, grey branches within the green archaeal branch and lime-green group in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

A small N-terminal domain (referred to as N-domain), usually responsible for binding adaptors and/or substrates, is followed by two consecutive canonical AAA modules (D1 and D2, respectively). To visualize the location of the domains and residues within a predicted hexameric ring, we built a structural homology model for the rhodococcal Cpa sequence using human p97 as a template, for which a structure of the assembled complex was available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hänzelmann and Schindelin, 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The AAA modules each contain Walker A and B motifs required for ATP binding and hydrolysis; however, only the D2 module carries the so-called sensor asparagine (assisting the Walker B motif in coordinating water molecules) and arginine finger (stimulating the ATPase activity) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Unciuleac et al., 2016</xref>).

Incubation of <sup>Rer</sup>Cpa with the ATP-hydrolysis transition state analog ADP-AlF<sub>x</sub> prior to size exclusion resulted in a shift of the monomer/dimer elution peak to a position equivalent to just above 500 kDa (as indicated by the molecular weight standards), which is in good agreement with a hexameric assembly state (expected molecular weight: 450 kDa). An additional, smaller fraction elutes even earlier, at a position equivalent to larger than 700 kDa. In order to overcome the limitation of column calibration and obtain an accurate assessment of complex size, we also performed size exclusion chromatography with multi-angle light scattering detection (SEC-MALS). The light scattering signal revealed the mass of the assembled species in the main peak to correspond to 430 ± 39 kDa. This is in good agreement with the molecular weight of six monomers (75 kDa) in a hexameric assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). A fraction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> eluted at an earlier position which corresponds to the molecular weight of a dodecameric assembly (943 kDa) and is likely due to the high protein concentration which was used for this experiment. To assess the shape of the assembled complex, we recorded electron micrographs of negatively stained Cpa particles. A double Walker B variant of the rhodococcal enzyme (D312N, E566Q) capable of nucleotide binding but not hydrolysis was used in this experiment to allow observation of the complex in the presence of ATP rather than ADP-AlF<sub>x</sub>. The evenly distributed particles display as spherical shapes, most of which appear to be top views (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The 2D classification of the imaged particles revealed that most of the classes represent hexameric assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Some of the particles, however, look slightly distorted, suggesting either high flexibility (presumably of the N-domains) or ring instability leading to ring opening in some of the 2D classes. Nevertheless, the diameter of the particles is rather uniform with roughly 150 Å and the appearance and dimensions of the particles agree well with hexameric ring assemblies that were observed previously for archaeal or eukaryotic Cdc48.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34055.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cpa forms hexamers in presence of nucleotide.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Gel filtration profiles of 30 µM rhodococcal Cpa in absence of nucleotide (black line) and in presence of 2 mM ADP-AlF<sub>x</sub> (red line).

The elution profile clearly shows that mycobacterial Cpa also forms hexamers in the presence of nucleotide. Additionally, we tested the ATPase activity of the mycobacterial enzyme at two different temperatures (28°C – temperature at which activity for the rhodococcal enzyme was determined, and 37°C – optimum growth temperature of Msm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Although mycobacterial Cpa exhibits low ATPase activity at 28°C, we observed a five-fold increase in activity when the temperature was increased to 37°C (change from 7.9 ± 2.9 to 42.5 ± 3.2 min<sup>−1</sup> hexamer<sup>−1</sup>).

ATPase activity for these complexes is usually dependent on the formation of the assembled, hexameric ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kress et al., 2007</xref>). We therefore explored the dependence of ATPase activity on buffer conditions by varying pH and salt concentration, both factors known to affect assembly of AAA proteins. For example, ClpB/Hsp104 requires low-salt concentrations for assembly of the ring in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wendler et al., 2012</xref>). The rhodococcal Cpa exhibited a strong dependence of its ATPase activity on both, pH and KCl concentration, where increasing pH and decreasing salt concentration led to an increase in the measured enzyme activity by up to sevenfold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We hypothesized that this strong dependence of the ATPase activity on salt was the result of enhanced ring formation under those conditions rather than a direct effect on the ATPase activity. To test this, we recorded assembly time courses at different salt concentrations (0–400 mM KCl) while keeping the pH constant at 7.8. Assembly was triggered by addition of Cpa into the assembly buffer at the given salt concentration and containing ADP-AlF<sub>x</sub> as nucleotide to avoid complications from ATP turnover. Aliquots were taken from the assembly reaction and subjected to size exclusion to determine the elution peak area of assembled Cpa. Interestingly, increasing the salt concentration from 0 to 400 mM led to a strong deceleration of ring formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). When no salt was present in the sample the oligomerization was complete within a few minutes, while at the highest KCl concentration only 40% of Cpa was assembled into rings after 5 hr of incubation. This result indicates that during the time frame in which the ATPase assay is performed the assembly is still slowly ongoing with its velocity dependent on the initial KCl concentration. Therefore, the measured activity reports mainly on the protein assembly state and indicates that ring formation is indeed strongly dependent on ionic strength.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34055.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Cpa complex assembly and ATPase activity are strongly influenced by pH and ionic strength.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ATPase activity is enhanced with increasing pH and decreasing KCl concentration.

To test for interaction between Cpa and the proteasome core particle, we employed the bacterial adenylate cyclase two-hybrid assay previously used for identifying interaction between the actinobacterial proteasome and another activator, Bpa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Battesti and Bouveret, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delley et al., 2014</xref>). The assay is based on the reconstitution of adenylate cyclase activity from the individually inactive T25 and T18 adenylate cyclase subdomains, which are tethered to the two potential interaction partners. In this case, Cpa from Mtb (Rv0435c) was fused to the T25 subdomain, while the T18 subdomain was fused to the α subunit of the 20S proteasome. Plasmids encoding the two respective fusion constructs were co-transformed into an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain deficient in adenylate cyclase activity. In case the two subdomain-carrying proteins, <sup>Mtb</sup>Cpa and <sup>Mtb</sup>20S proteasome, physically interact, the active adenylate cyclase complex can be reconstituted from the two subdomains, leading to production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) that in turn activates the <italic>lac</italic> operon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To test for cAMP production, we therefore performed a β-galactosidase assay on cells permeabilized with SDS/chloroform. In addition to the wild type <sup>Mtb</sup>Cpa we also tested a variant where five C-terminal amino acids were removed. Although Cpa orthologs do not carry the classical HbYX proteasome interaction motif at their C-terminus, the C-terminus itself might nevertheless contribute to this interaction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> shows the results of the β-galactosidase assay, including the negative (T25 against T18-CP) control. The activity of around 60 pmol 4-methylumbelliferone produced per min per OD unit indicates that the full-length mycobacterial Cpa is capable of directly interacting with the proteasomal core particle in the context of a bacterial cell. Additionally, we observe that removal of the C-terminal amino acids does not change the interaction strength between Cpa and the 20S core particle, indicating that those residues do not significantly mediate this interaction. A milder contribution cannot be excluded on the basis of this assay due to the inherent positive feedback circuit that precludes precise quantification.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34055.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Cpa forms a complex with the 20S proteasomal core particle.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Principle of the bacterial adenylate cyclase two-hybrid system.

To test whether the cells differ in length between the two strains we estimated the average cell length using light microscopy images.

Due to the low number of changes during standard growth, many COG classes under this condition were represented by only one or two proteins. This changed, however, when the cells were starved for carbon. We found that many changes occurred in classes like ‘transcription’ (most represented, similarly to standard growth), ‘energy production and conversion’, ‘amino acid transport and metabolism’ and ‘lipid transport and metabolism’. From the perspective of Cpa acting in a protein degradation context, those proteins accumulating in the knockout strain could under the most simplistic interpretation be degradation substrate candidates. However, the fact that equal number of proteins accumulated as were depleted in the knockout strain suggests that this view is too simplistic. For example, degradation of a transcription factor that is present in the cell only with low abundance, could lead to significant proteomic changes. Indeed, as mentioned above, the most represented class in both our datasets is ‘transcription’, which could explain the observed changes in both directions.</p><p>To identify functional connections within the accumulating proteome, we performed a pathway enrichment analysis using STRING and DAVID tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Szklarczyk et al., 2017</xref>). The result of this analysis showed an unusually high number of structural components of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">2</xref>) accumulating in the <italic>cpa</italic>-knockout cells.

Only recently has it been established that archaeal equivalents of eukaryotic p97 are capable of directly interacting with the 20S proteasomal core and that they can support protein degradation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barthelme and Sauer, 2012</xref>). The only previous study of an actinobacterial Cdc48-like ATPase is for the ortholog from Msm, and it reports that the protein exists as a monomer in solution as well as in the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Unciuleac et al., 2016</xref>). Even though the authors suggest that the protein would need to undergo an oligomerization step in order to gain ATPase activity (due to ATP hydrolysis usually occuring at the interface between adjacent protomers), no evidence for assembly was presented.</p><p>In our study, we investigate different structural and functional aspects of Cdc48-like protein from actinobacteria (Cpa) using both rhodococcal and mycobacterial Cpa. In particular, the solubility and stability of the rhodococcal ATPase across a range of buffer conditions allowed us to study its oligomerization behavior by time-resolved size exclusion analysis and size exlusion chromatorgaphy coupled to a light scattering detection system. Our results clearly demonstrate that Cpa forms hexameric rings in the presence of nucleotide and that ATPase activity correlates with this assembly state. The most complete assembly into hexamers was observed in the presence of ADP-AlF<sub>x</sub>, an analog of ATP that mimics the transition state of ATP hydrolysis, suggesting particular stabilization of the ring during ATP turnover. At least in vitro, the assembly into hexamers occurred most readily at low ionic strength, indicating that electrostatic interactions are crucial for rapid oligomerization. Another tandem AAA+ protein, the chaperone ClpB, can even assemble in absence of nucleotide in vitro if the ionic strength is kept low enough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schirmer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schlee et al., 2001</xref>). It is possible that like its eukaryotic counterparts, Cpa in vivo associates with a range of adaptor proteins that could further stabilize the ring. Such adaptor-dependent assembly behavior was for example shown for ClpC from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kirstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schlothauer et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The assembly of Cpa into a hexameric, ATPase-active ring complex, which is clearly demonstrated by our in vitro analysis, opens up the possibility that the Cpa ring can stack to the 20S proteasome α-rings, thereby forming a complex with centrally aligned ring pores. Importantly, the occurrence pattern of the <italic>cpa</italic> gene in actinobacterial genomes lends support to this argument, as <italic>cpa</italic> is found only in those members of actinobacteria carrying the two proteasomal subunit genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Genomic co-occurrence can indicate a functional connection between the co-occurring gene products, as is for example the case for components involved in the two known proteasomal degradation pathways in mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barandun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delley et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, using a bacterial two-hybrid assay and electron microscopy we could demonstrate physical association between <sup>Mtb</sup>Cpa and the Mtb proteasome. This interaction occurs at the α-ring face of the proteasome, as can be seen in the negatively stained electron micrographs, and which is also supported by <sup>Rer</sup>Cpa competing with Mpa for binding to the proteasome in vitro, thereby inhibiting degradation of pupylated substrates. However, the molecular elements of this interaction differ from those employed by the other two actinobacterial proteasomal interactors, Mpa/Arc and Bpa, that both carry the canonical penultimate tyrosine motif, while Cpa does not. Interestingly, it has been shown for the archaeal and eukaryotic Cdc48 homologs, that an additional proteasome-interaction element exists that considerably contributes to the binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barthelme and Sauer, 2013</xref>). Our attempt to test whether the removal of this molecular feature, the so-called D2 pore-2 loop, from Cpa would abolish its interaction with the 20S CP was unsuccessful due to the fact that removal or replacement of this element resulted in assembly defects of the hexameric ring. Nevertheless, it remains unclear, why the actinobacterial Cdc48 homolog does not carry both interaction motifs like its archaeal/eukaryotic cousins. One possible reason might be that formation of the Cpa-proteasome should be transient in nature. Alternatively, the different molecular arrangement around the actinobacterial α-ring of the proteasome might not be optimal for interaction with the Cpa C-terminus and therefore its contribution to the interaction minor or non-existent, so that the penultimate tyrosine was eventually lost. In fact, it would not be the only known case in the family of proteasomal regulators lacking the penultimate aromatic residue: the eukaryotic 11S (PA28) activator also does not carry the HbYX motif: instead, the C-terminal residue of each subunit provides proteasome binding energy and the so-called ‘activation loops’ trigger gate opening allowing for substrate entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stadtmueller and Hill, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Whitby et al., 2000</xref>). However, our two-hybrid analysis showed that the last five C-terminal residues do not play a major role in proteasome binding, suggesting that instead other elements of Cpa must mediate the interaction.</p><p>Our in vivo analysis of a <italic>cpa</italic>-disrupted Msm strain suggests that Cpa plays a role during the adaptation to conditions where nutrients (carbon in particular) become limiting. In an attempt to better understand which aspects of cellular function Cpa might influence, we compared the proteomes of the parent Msm strain with the <italic>cpa</italic>-knockout strain grown in presence and absence of glycerol. Under both conditions, we identified proteins accumulating in the knockout strain as well as proteins with decreasing levels, indicating that the observed changes include not only potential degradation substrates but also proteins affected either through secondary effects like for example degradation of a regulatory protein or through Cpa functions independent of the proteasome. The proteins affected by the <italic>cpa</italic>-gene disruption fall into multiple functional categories, those involved in transcription, energy production/conversion, amino acid metabolism/transport and lipid metabolism represented the most. Given the hampered growth of the knockout and the increased protein level changes under starvation conditions, these results suggest that Cpa could be involved in adaptation of the cell to a lack of nutrients. The proteins accumulating in the <italic>cpa</italic>-knockout strain potentially could comprise substrates that are usually removed with Cpa-involvement, either by direct degradation or by secondary effects. Our functional analysis of the proteome changes upon starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>) combined with identification of Cpa binders in the wild-type cells under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>) could indicate that removal of Cpa from the cell more directly influences the level of ribosomal proteins compared to the other detected changes. In other bacteria it has been observed that nutrient stress (carbon starvation among others) results in ribosome disassembly and rRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zundel et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, another recent study reported that an excess of ribosomal proteins is removed from yeast cells by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sung et al., 2016</xref>). It is tempting to hypothesise that actinobacterial Cpa is involved in a similar process; however, more effort will be required to investigate whether the role played by Cpa in disassembly and/or removal of ribosomal proteins under nutrient limitation requires cooperation with the proteasome core or is mainly mediated by its AAA pore-threading activity.</p><p>At the same time, it is difficult to speculate about the substrate clientele based on the homology of Cpa to eukaryotic Cdc48. For example, eukaryotic Cdc48 is implicated in processing of ubiquitinated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Richly et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rumpf and Jentsch, 2006</xref>), a post-translational modification that does not occur in actinobacteria. Actinobacteria possess, however, the functionally analogous covalent modifier Pup that renders proteins as substrates for degradation by the Mpa-proteasome complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Striebel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Striebel et al., 2014</xref>). The well-characterized pupylation substrate PanB in fact accumulates in the <italic>cpa</italic>-knockout strain. However, in vitro degradation tests with recombinantly produced and in vitro pupylated PanB showed no degradation in presence of Cpa and the proteasome (data not shown). Similarly, although the archaeal Cdc48-CP assembly is capable of degrading an ssrA-tagged model substrate in vitro, archaea do not harbor the tmRNA, a crucial element of trans-translation encoding the ssrA-tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hayes and Keiler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Karzai et al., 2000</xref>). Actinobacteria feature a tmRNA and carry out trans-translation. However, no Cpa-mediated degradation of ssrA-tagged model substrates could be detected in vitro (data not shown). As the Clp protease system is responsible for ssrA-tagged substrate degradation in mycobacteria and related bacteria, this finding was not unexpected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Laederach et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raju et al., 2012</xref>). The search for substrates is likely further hampered by the fact that Cdc48 family members almost always act in the context of adaptor proteins. In the absence of these adaptors, the activity toward the adaptor-mediated set of substrates is simply not detectable. The co-expression of Cpa from a polycistronic mRNA together with Psd and PssA, two consecutively acting enzymes responsible for the synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine, might give an indication about the functional context of Cpa activity. Several studies indicate a functional link between phosphatidylethanolamine and cytokinesis, both in eukaryotes and bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Luo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mileykovskaya et al., 1998</xref>). This would suggest that Cpa might play a role in context of cell division. Removal of Cpa from the cells did not, however, show a significant effect on cell division as gauged by their cell size and morphology. Further investigations are clearly needed in order to gain a deeper understanding of the physiological role of Cpa in the biology of actinobacteria, including the search for adaptor proteins and analysis of their substrate recruitment clientele.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene</td><td>mKO2</td><td>Thermo Fisher <break/>Scientific</td><td>NCBI accession: <break/>AB359188</td><td>GeneArt synthetic <break/>construct</td></tr><tr><td>Strain <break/>(<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>E. coli Tuner(DE3)</td><td>EMD-Millipore</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain <break/>(<italic>Mycobacterium</italic> <break/> <italic>smegmatis</italic> mc(2) 155)</td><td>Wild-type strain <break/>(Msm WT)</td><td>ATCC</td><td>ATCC: 700084</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Mycobacterium</italic> <break/><italic>smegmatis</italic> mc(2) 155)</td><td>Msm ∆<italic>cpa</italic></td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Unmarked <italic>cpa</italic> deletion <break/>strain</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-RpoB<sup>Ec</sup></td><td>BioLegend</td><td>BioLegend clone: <break/>8RB13</td><td>Antibody against beta-subunit <break/>of RNA polymerase from <italic>E. coli</italic>;

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cdc48-like protein of actinobacteria (Cpa) is a novel proteasome interactor in mycobacteria and related organisms&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom was the Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by Andreas Martin as the Reviewing Editor and Ivan Dikic as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Andreas Martin (Reviewer #1); Andreas Matouschek (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript provides an important advance to our understanding of mycobacterial proteasome interactors by showing that the Cdc48-like protein of actinobacteria (Cpa) forms hexameric rings, hydrolyzes ATP, and may functionally bind to the 20S core peptidase. Furthermore, changes in the levels of ~ 500 proteins upon Cpa knockout in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> suggest a potential role of this AAA+ motor in proteome regulation and possible protein turnover, in particular of ribosomal components. This study, combining computational, biochemical, structural and microbiological approaches, will thus be of broad interest and generally appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers felt that some of the central findings are still preliminary or based on indirect evidence, and require further support by experimental data. Before acceptance, the paper will therefore need some essential revisions, as outlined below.</p><p>1) Cpa's interaction with the 20S proteasome is shown only indirectly, through a 2-hybrid system and the inhibition of Mpa-20S mediated substrate degradation. Moreover, the functional relevance of a potential Cpa-20S complex remains to be determined.</p><p>A concern for the 2-hybrid assay is the 20S fusion construct used. The T18 subdomain of adenylate cyclase was fused to the N-termini of the 20S α subunits, even though these N-termini form the gate to the 20S core and are right at the center of the predicted binding interface for the Cpa hexamer. Such an N-terminal fusion, even when using a long linker, would be expected to interfere with or prevent proper coaxial stacking of the ATPase and peptidase. Neither this manuscript nor the previous study by Delley et al., 2014 address this issue and explain why this fusion wouldn't be a concern.</p><p>Similarly, the competitive inhibition of Mpa-20S mediated substrate degradation by large amounts of Cpa does not directly prove a functional interaction between Cpa hexamers and the 20S core particle. Analogous results would be expected if Cpa non-specifically interacted with Mpa or the substrate, and there are currently no controls presented to rule this out. For this Mpa competition assay, the authors should at least consider using the pore-2 loop mutant of Cpa to strengthen this point about Cpa hexamers docking atop the 20S core.</p><p>Importantly, the authors should aim to provide more direct evidence for a Cpa-20S interaction, either by a binding assay, by structural methods, or through functional readouts, like 20S gate opening or a potential response of Cpa's ATPase activity to 20S binding.</p><p>An additional weakness of the experimental system presented in Figure 4B is that it relies on the use of an open-gate 20S mutant. Assuming that the observed competition indeed reflects interaction of Cpa with the peptidase core, it still remains unclear whether such an interaction also occurs with wild type 20S core. This should be tested.</p><p>Of course, it would be ideal to show Cpa-dependent degradation directly, but the reviewers certainly understand that such studies are beyond the scope of this manuscript due to the lack of a model substrate and knowledge about potential cofactors, recognition motifs etc. It may be worth investigating, however, whether Cpa can be mutated like its eukaryotic and archaeal counterparts to recognize and process ssrA-tagged substrates.</p><p>2) The identification of ~ 500 proteins whose levels change in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> upon Cpa knockout is a very promising finding, but it will require additional experiments to convincingly conclude that these protein levels are indeed affected by the AAA motor function of Cpa, either in a degradative Cpa-20S complex or by an isolated Cpa chaperone. In addition to the presented complete knockout, the authors should for instance consider analyzing strains carrying the pore-2 loop mutant or ATPase-deficient Cpa. Also, despite the lack of a conserved HbYX motif, it would still be worth investigating the contributions of Cpa's C-terminal tails to 20S core binding in order to get a more complete picture of this interaction. In case these tails contribute to 20S binding, mutating or truncating them would provide a very useful tool to disrupt 20S binding while maintaining normal Cpa motor function, which would allow to directly distinguish between unfolding/chaperoning versus degradative activities of Cpa in vivo.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34055.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Essential revisions:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers felt that some of the central findings are still preliminary or based on indirect evidence, and require further support by experimental data.

Otherwise the construct remained unchanged. Additionally, we included a Cpa variant with its C-terminus truncated by five amino acids in order to test whether the C-terminus is the main mediator of Cpa-CP interaction. Both the wt Cpa and the truncated variant generate an increase in β-galactosidase activity (as compared to the negative control) when co-transformed with the new prcBA fusion construct, indicating that the proteins interact in vivo (Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, the competitive inhibition of Mpa-20S mediated substrate degradation by large amounts of Cpa does not directly prove a functional interaction between Cpa hexamers and the 20S core particle.

After expression and purification, we tested the assembly state of either variant in presence of ADP-AlF<sub>x</sub>, similarly as we did previously for the wild-type Cpa. Unfortunately, both of the mutants displayed an assembly defect (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). In this context, a diminished activity does not allow any conclusions as to the interaction specificity, as it could be the result of the assembly defect instead. We therefore did not further pursue this line of experiments and also removed the ΔD2 mutant shown previously in the two-hybrid experiment, as we feel that the reduction of interaction strength could be caused by defective assembly and the experiment is therefore inconclusive.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34055.024</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34055-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Importantly, the authors should aim to provide more direct evidence for a Cpa-20S interaction, either by a binding assay, by structural methods, or through functional readouts, like 20S gate opening or a potential response of Cpa's ATPase activity to 20S binding.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to provide a more direct evidence of complex formation between Cpa and 20S core particle, we have recorded negatively stained electron micrographs of rhodococcal Cpa (pre-assembled in presence of ADP-AlF<sub>x</sub> and purified by gel filtration) in presence of rhodococcal closed-gate 20S CP (new Figure 4C). We could observe a small fraction of capped proteasomes alongside free Cpa and uncapped 20S, as shown in Figure 4C and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 (white arrows). Additionally, we used microscale thermophoresis to determine dissociation constants for the interaction of both closed- and open-gate proteasome with <sup>Rer</sup>Cpa. The dissociation constants for both complexes lie in the range of 0.4 and 0.6 μM. Taken together, our data support interaction between Cpa and the proteasome that likely is of transient and very dynamic nature. The functional link will require identification of substrates or substrate classes and will have to be established in future studies. We expect that as yet unidentified adaptor complexes might be required for substrate binding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An additional weakness of the experimental system presented in Figure 4B is that it relies on the use of an open-gate 20S mutant.

In an effort to show that Cpa can interact with the wild-type core particle, we have incorporated the full-length CP into the new interaction experiments provided in this revision, where experimentally possible. Importantly, the new electron microscopy micrographs present interaction between Cpa and full-length, wild-type proteasomes. Additionally, the microscale thermophoresis binding curves could be obtained for both proteasome variants, showing that they exhibit similar affinity. Furthermore, the two-hybrid experiment is also performed using the closed-gate variant of the mycobacterial proteasome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Of course, it would be ideal to show Cpa-dependent degradation directly, but the reviewers certainly understand that such studies are beyond the scope of this manuscript due to the lack of a model substrate and knowledge about potential cofactors, recognition motifs etc. It may be worth investigating, however, whether Cpa can be mutated like its eukaryotic and archaeal counterparts to recognize and process ssrA-tagged substrates.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this issue, we have cloned and expressed a Cpa mutant carrying a D1 pore-1 loop mutation that was previously shown to enable the eukaryotic Cdc48 to recognize ssrA-tagged substrates (TEAN → KYYG). Additionally, we removed the N-domain since its removal has been previously shown to enhance degradation activity. After confirming assembly behaviour similar to wild type Cpa (not shown), we carried out a degradation test using ssrA-tagged Mdh – the results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>. No degradation was observed.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34055.025</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34055-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The identification of ~ 500 proteins whose levels change in M. smegmatis upon Cpa knockout is a very promising finding, but it will require additional experiments to convincingly conclude that these protein levels are indeed affected by the AAA motor function of Cpa, either in a degradative Cpa-20S complex or by an isolated Cpa chaperone.

We hoped to identify Cpa binders in the wild-type cells that Cpa could be recognizing/processing at the time of starvation and the levels of which at the same time were detected as changed in the proteomics-wide approach. This would at least support direct physical interaction between Cpa and those proteins also identified in the co-immunoprecipitation. We performed the experiment in triplicate and took into consideration only those hits that occurred in at least two repetitions but not in the control co-IP (performed on the Msm Δcpa lysate). Interestingly, the results of these co-IP experiments are in line with the observation that ribosomal proteins accumulated in the <italic>cpa</italic>-deletion strain during carbon starvation. We observed that the co-IP elutions were also statistically enriched in ribosomal proteins (confirmed by both, STRING and DAVID tools). This would lend more support to our hypothesis that Cpa is involved in remodelling/disassembly of the ribosome under nutrient limitation.</p><p>Whether Cpa is involved as a degradative Cpa-20S complex or as an isolated chaperone or maybe a combination of both will have to be determined in a future study.</p><p><italic>Also, despite the lack of a conserved HbYX motif, it would still be worth investigating the contributions of Cpa's C-terminal tails to 20S core binding in order to get a more complete picture of this interaction.

We do agree, however, that it would be of great interest to investigate in future work the exact binding interface between Cpa and 20S CP in order to gain a better understanding of this transient/dynamic interaction.</p></body></sub-article></article>
