Here, we show that distinct subpopulations of astral microtubules exist, which have differential functions in regulating spindle orientation and division symmetry. Specifically, in polarized stem cells of developing mouse neocortex, astral microtubules reaching the apical and basal cell cortex, but not those reaching the central cell cortex, are more abundant in symmetrically than asymmetrically dividing cells and reduce spindle orientation variability. This promotes symmetric divisions by maintaining an apico-basal cleavage plane. The greater abundance of apical/basal astrals depends on a higher concentration, at the basal cell cortex, of LGN, a known spindle-cell cortex linker. Furthermore, newly developed specific microtubule perturbations that selectively decrease apical/basal astrals recapitulate the symmetric-to-asymmetric division switch and suffice to increase neurogenesis in vivo. Thus, our study identifies a novel link between cell polarity, astral microtubules, and spindle orientation in morphogenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02875.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02875.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02875.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A stem cell can divide in two ways. Either it can split symmetrically into two identical daughter stem cells, or it can split asymmetrically into a stem cell and a specialist cell. The structure that forms inside the dividing cell to separate pairs of chromosomes—called the mitotic spindle—also partitions the molecules that determine what kind of cell each daughter cell will become.</p><p>The mitotic spindle is made up of protein microtubules. Astral microtubules connect the spindle to a structure found at the inner face of the cell membrane called the cell cortex. This helps the spindle to orient itself correctly and control the plane of cell division. This is particularly important in cells that are different at their top and bottom, like polarized neural stem cells.</p><p>To divide symmetrically, these cells need to split vertically from top to bottom. Then, to divide asymmetrically they tilt the cell division plane off-vertical. Classical studies on neuroblasts from the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic> have shown that a big, 90° reorientation, from vertical to horizontal underlies this change. However, in the primary stem cells of the mammalian brain, subtle off-vertical tilting suffices for asymmetric divisions to occur. This tilting must be finely regulated: if not, neurodevelopmental disorders, such as microcephaly and lissencephaly, may arise.</p><p>Mora-Bermúdez et al. investigated how mammalian cortical stem cells control such subtle spindle orientation changes by taking images of developing brain tissue from genetically modified mice. These show that not all astral microtubules affect whether the spindle reorients, as was previously thought. Instead, only those connecting the spindle to the cell cortex at the top and bottom of the cell—the apical/basal astrals—are involved.</p><p>A decrease in the number of apical/basal astrals enables the spindle to undergo small reorientations. Mora-Bermúdez et al. therefore propose a model in which the spindle becomes less strongly anchored when the number of apical/basal astrals is reduced. This makes the spindle easier to tilt, allowing neural stem cells to undergo asymmetric divisions to produce neurons.</p><p>The decrease in the number of apical/basal astrals appears to be caused by a reduction in the amount of a molecule that is known to help link the microtubules to the cell cortex. This reduction occurs only in the cortex at the top of the cell. Mora-Bermúdez et al. were also able to manipulate this process by adding very low doses of a microtubule inhibitor called nocodazole, which reduced the number of only the apical/basal astrals, increasing the ability of the spindle to reorient.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02875.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02875.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>asymmetric cell division</kwd><kwd>spindle orientation</kwd><kwd>neural stem cell</kwd><kwd>astral microtubule</kwd><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>nocodazole</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 1080-2007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mora-Bermúdez</surname><given-names>Felipe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 655, A2; TRR 83, Tp6</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huttner</surname><given-names>Wieland B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>250197</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huttner</surname><given-names>Wieland B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huttner</surname><given-names>Wieland B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fonds der Chemischen Industrie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huttner</surname><given-names>Wieland B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mammalian neural stem cells specifically regulate a subset of astral microtubules to govern the subtle changes in spindle orientation that underlie symmetric vs asymmetric cell division during embryonic cortical neurogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The fundamental functions of the mitotic spindle include not only the faithful partition of the genome into both daughter cells, but also controlling whether cell fate determinants are distributed symmetrically or asymmetrically to those daughters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gonczy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gillies and Cabernard, 2011</xref>). Cell division symmetry is controlled by orienting the metaphase spindle along a specific plane. Cytokinesis then segregates cell components symmetrically or asymmetrically, depending on their distribution on either side of that plane. Pioneering work in fungi and nematodes has shown spindle orientation to involve mitotic astral microtubules. These astrals dynamically link the spindle poles with the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pearson and Bloom, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Siller and Doe, 2009</xref>).</p><p>In polarized epithelial cells, the orientation of the mitotic spindle with respect to the apico-basal axis determines the distribution of components located differentially along this axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Knoblich, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gillies and Cabernard, 2011</xref>). A classic example is <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurogenesis, where neuroepithelial cells proliferate by dividing symmetrically, with a cleavage plane parallel to the apico-basal axis. Neuroblasts derived from them delaminate from the apical surface and divide in turn asymmetrically, to self-renew and produce neurogenic progenitors. The mitotic spindle in these asymmetric divisions is re-oriented by 90°, with the cleavage plane now perpendicular to the apico-basal axis. This leads to the asymmetric distribution of polarized fate-determinants to the daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Southall et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2010</xref>). This major spindle re-orientation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> requires interactions between cell cortical Gαi, a heterotrimeric G protein subunit, and Partner of Inscuteable (Pins), which are in turn linked to the Par polarity complex (Par3, Par6, aPKC) by Inscuteable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Knoblich, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brand and Livesey, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Spindle and cleavage plane orientation has also been implicated in the neurogenesis of vertebrates, including mammals (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lancaster and Knoblich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shitamukai and Matsuzaki 2012</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Das and Storey, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asami et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delaunay et al., 2014</xref>). Mammalian neurogenesis, however, shows major differences to <italic>Drosophila</italic> with regard to spindle orientation in symmetric vs asymmetric divisions of polarized neural stem cells. In the developing neocortex, neuroepithelial cells progressively become radial glia, and both of these highly related subtypes of neural stem cells exhibit a characteristic polarized, apico-basal architecture and undergo apical mitosis, hence the collective term ‘apical progenitors’ (APs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kriegstein and Götz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Götz and Huttner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller and Gauthier, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corbin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martynoga et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, the switch of APs from symmetric proliferative to asymmetric neurogenic divisions occurs mostly without large and defined re-orientations of the spindle, but with only subtle deviations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huttner and Brand, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haydar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kosodo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Konno et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shitamukai et al., 2011</xref>). These can nonetheless tilt the division plane enough to no longer bisect, but rather bypass the small apical end-foot, leading to its asymmetric distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kosodo et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, subtle spindle deviations can also influence the inheritance of the basal process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shitamukai et al., 2011</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kosodo et al., 2008</xref>). The proper regulation of these symmetry changes is thought to be an important determinant in neocortical neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Götz and Huttner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miyata et al., 2010</xref>), and its perturbation can lead to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feng and Walsh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fish et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yingling et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gauthier-Fisher et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Godin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lizarraga et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>However, it is unknown how the subtle spindle orientation changes that occur in the switch of mammalian APs from symmetric proliferative to asymmetric neurogenic divisions are generated and controlled. Proteins evolutionarily conserved between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals, such as Inscuteable and the Pins homologue LGN, have been shown to be involved in the regulation of AP cleavage plane orientation and AP daughter cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Konno et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Postiglione et al., 2011</xref>). Despite these findings, it remains to be elucidated how alterations in these or other spindle regulators actually lead to the spindle orientation changes that switch the cell division mode of APs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buchman and Tsai, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lancaster and Knoblich, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here we show that the spindle orientation that controls symmetric vs asymmetric division of polarized neural stem cells in the developing neocortex is not determined by all astral microtubules, as previously assumed, but by a distinct subpopulation of these microtubules, the apical/basal astrals. Specifically, a decrease in apical/basal astrals causes the subtle spindle orientation deviations that lead to the switch of mammalian APs from symmetric proliferative to asymmetric neurogenic divisions. Moreover, we find that a selective down-regulation of LGN at the basal cell cortex, rather than a general reduction of cell cortical LGN, explains the specific decrease in apical/basal astrals. Our study, which combines live and immunofluorescence microscopy of neocortical tissue from transgenic mice, provides a new model for the control of symmetric vs asymmetric cell division in cells that maintain spindle orientation perpendicular to the apico-basal axis, such as cortical neural stem cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>More dynamic spindle orientation deviations from the apico-basal axis in neurogenic than proliferating progenitors</title><p>During metaphase, the orientation of the mitotic spindle of mammalian APs dynamically deviates from the apical, ventricular surface of the developing cortical wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chenn and McConnell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haydar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roszko et al., 2006</xref>). Crucially however, whether such deviations are different in proliferating vs neurogenic progenitors is unknown. To ask if the amplitude of spindle deviations is involved in neurogenesis, a transgenic mouse was used where neurogenic divisions are identified by EGFP driven by the promoter of the pan-neurogenic marker Tis21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Iacopetti et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haubensak et al., 2004</xref>) and thereby distinguished from proliferative divisions. Specifically, embryonic day (E) 14.5 mouse dorsolateral telencephalon in organotypic slice culture stained with a vital DNA dye was analysed by dual-colour live 3D imaging. Consistent with previous studies, the metaphase spindles of most progenitors, as reported by the chromosome plates, continuously changed their angles with respect to the apical–basal axis until anaphase, and did so in apparently random fashion. Interestingly, these dynamic deviations increased in amplitude from Tis21::GFP– (proliferating) AP divisions to Tis21::GFP+ (neurogenic) AP divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B,D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1 media2">Videos 1,2</xref>). In neurogenic APs, the total amplitude of deviations was on average twice as high as in proliferating APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; AP proliferating 15.7 ± 1.4°, AP neurogenic 30.7 ± 4.3°). Importantly, the range of metaphase spindle orientations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>) was consistent with the previously reported cleavage plane orientations of fixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kosodo et al., 2004</xref>) and live (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Konno et al., 2008</xref>) mouse APs, which have been observed to be mostly perpendicular to the apical surface.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02875.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dynamic spindle orientation variability increases when progenitors become neurogenic.</title><p>Live tissue imaging of spindle orientation as reported by chromosome plate orientation in organotypic slice culture of coronal sections from E14.5 Tis21::GFP mouse dorsolateral telencephalon.

Considering the highly polarized architecture of APs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Götz and Huttner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mora-Bermúdez et al., 2013</xref>), the progenitor soma was divided into three regions, to count the astrals reaching the cell cortex in each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and ‘Materials and methods’): the central region, defined by the presence of the centromeres and containing most of the spindle—including some astrals—and an apical and a basal region, both containing only astrals. Surprisingly, the decrease in astrals was specific to the apical and basal regions. The number of astrals reaching the apical or basal region of the cell cortex (apical/basal astrals) was lower in neurogenic than in proliferating APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>; neurogenic 7.2 ± 0.36, proliferating 11.8 ± 0.43). By contrast, the number of astrals reaching the central region of the cell cortex (central astrals) did not change significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 2I</xref>; neurogenic APs 8.8 ± 0.7, proliferating APs 9.1 ± 0.6).</p><p>To compare APs and BPs, the apical, basal, and central populations of astrals from APs were compared to the apically, basally, and centrally oriented populations of astrals in BPs (see ‘Materials and methods’). In contrast to APs, BPs showed a general decrease, with fewer astrals than APs for both populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>, apically/basally oriented 5.5 ± 0.28, centrally oriented: 6.1 ± 0.46). Together with our data on spindle orientation variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), this suggests that a higher abundance of apical/basal astrals increases the stability of spindle orientation.</p><p>The numbers of basal and apical astrals were then compared. Surprisingly, in proliferating APs, basal astrals were more abundant than apical ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, 6.7 ± 0.31 vs 5.1 ± 0.25). By contrast, in neurogenic APs, the numbers of both basal and apical astrals were lower than in proliferating APs, but were not significantly different from each other (basal 3.7 ± 0.2, apical 3.4 ± 0.2). This shows that the number of basal astrals is initially higher in proliferating APs, but their decrease is such that neurogenic APs have a homogeneously low number of apical and basal astrals. This trend continued in BPs, where the number of apically and basally oriented astrals further decreased homogeneously (basally oriented 2.7 ± 0.2, apically oriented 2.6 ± 0.2).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Fewer apical/basal astral microtubules as neurogenesis progresses</title><p>In mammals, the proportion of neurogenic divisions of APs increases throughout embryonic neurogenesis, which in the mouse goes from around E10 to E17. Therefore, the total number of apical/basal astrals could decrease as neurogenesis progressed, from E11.5 to E14.5 to E16.5 (early, mid, and late neurogenesis, respectively). Indeed, the number of astrals in APs decreased 2.5-fold from early to late neurogenesis, from 15.2 ± 0.4 at E11.5 to 9.4 ± 0.5 at E14.5, and further to 6.2 ± 0.3 at E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

LGN is enriched in the cell cortex, especially around the central part of the cell, where it participates in spindle orientation in non-neural cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Du and Macara, 2004</xref>). Also, upon LGN perturbation in neural progenitors in vivo, spindle orientation variability increased, changing progenitor identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Konno et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shitamukai et al., 2011</xref>). How LGN regulates spindle orientation in neurogenesis remains unknown. LGN could control spindle orientation in neural progenitors by regulating the number of astrals that anchor the spindle to the cell cortex.

LGN-C has the GoLoco motifs that bind to Gαi at the cell cortex, and its overexpression saturates the Gαi anchoring sites for microtubules. However, it lacks the TPR motifs in the N-terminal region and cannot interact with microtubules via NuMA and dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shitamukai et al., 2011</xref>).

No major differences in overall levels of LGN immunoreactivity were observed, but the subcellular distribution of the signal was different between proliferating and neurogenic E14.5 APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). In proliferating APs, cortical LGN increased from the apical to the central region of the cell cortex and remained high in most of the central and basal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,E</xref>). In neurogenic APs, cortical LGN levels were similar to proliferating APs at the apical and central regions, but markedly lower at the basal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,E</xref>). These data show that neurogenic APs lose LGN enrichment in the basal region of the cell cortex, which could lead to less anchoring of basal astrals.

This shows that minimal nocodazole treatment recapitulates the selective reduction in apical/basal astrals observed in the transition of unperturbed proliferating APs to neurogenic APs, without affecting important cell and tissue features (see below for unaffected mitotic progression).<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02875.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Key spindle and cell features in APs are not altered by 30 pM nocodazole.</title><p>All measurements were performed on the same cell images from which the astral microtubule data were obtained (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figures 2 &amp; 4</xref>).

For this, BRO culture of E14.5 Tis21::GFP forebrains was performed for 2.5 hr with the microtubule stabilizer taxol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–H</xref>). The extremely low taxol concentration of 25 pM increased the mean number of apical/basal astrals in neurogenic APs to 10.5 ± 0.6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), similar to DMSO-only treated and untreated proliferating APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).

This suggests that the stabilization of spindle orientation variability produced by an increase in apical/basal astrals is specific of APs. This difference is not fully unexpected. BPs are substantially different to APs, as they have delaminated from the apical surface and therefore lack canonical apical–basal polarity features of APs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attardo et al., 2008</xref>). A consequence of this polarity loss is that, regardless of their mitotic cleavage orientation, most mouse BPs undergo terminal divisions, which are symmetric in that two neurons are produced (although the neurons could be of different type) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haubensak et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miyata et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Noctor et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, changes in spindle orientation are not predicted to significantly change the symmetry or outcome of BP divisions. Consistent with our results, it is thus plausible that BPs may naturally be less responsive to the microtubule and spindle changes that are here described as key for APs.</p><p>Together, these results show that, whereas in APs taxol alone is sufficient to increase the number of apical/basal astrals, it requires a concomitant overexpression of functional LGN to decrease spindle orientation variability and thus revert to a more proliferation-like mitotic behaviour. This is consistent with a model where a simple increase in the sub-population of apical/basal astrals is not enough and these astrals must be anchored to the cell cortex in order to exert a stabilizing effect on spindle orientation.</p><p>Conversely, a decrease in apical/basal astrals mediated by minimal nocodazole could lower spindle orientation variability in APs. Interestingly, using live imaging of organotypic slice culture, incubation with 30 pM nocodazole was sufficient to increase the amplitude of spindle orientation variability in proliferating APs to a level similar to control neurogenic APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media10 media11 media12 media13">Videos 10–13</xref>; Control proliferating 13.1 ± 1.7°, nocodazole proliferating 23.8 ± 3.8°, Control neurogenic 22.7 ± 2.7°).

An established assay was adapted to determine the proportion of symmetric vs asymmetric divisions with respect to the distribution of the apical domain, identified by the absence of cadherin staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kosodo et al., 2004</xref>). The previously published low percentage of asymmetric divisions was confirmed with BRO culture in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9H</xref> top bar, white = 12%).

(<bold>J</bold>) Conceptual model of mitotic spindle orientation control by local astral microtubule abundance, in proliferating vs neurogenic progenitors. We propose that mitotic astral microtubules that reach the apical or basal cell cortex (light green rods) of neural stem and progenitor cells regulate the dynamics of spindle orientation variability. Like guy ropes do for a camping tent, these astrals help anchor the spindle to the cell cortex, most likely through interactions with factors that have specific cortical enrichments, such as LGN (red; colour intensity indicates local abundance in the three progenitor types shown). In APs undergoing proliferative division (Tis21::GFP–), these apical/basal astrals at relatively high abundance minimize deviations in spindle orientation, thereby maintaining the canonical cleavage orientation, perpendicular to the apical (ventricular) surface, and thus favouring symmetric proliferative divisions. In neurogenic (Tis21::GFP+) APs, and even more so in BPs, a reduction in the number of these astrals decreases cortical anchoring and increases random deviations in spindle orientation. For APs, this favours asymmetric neurogenic divisions that can generate a BP or a neuron. By contrast, astrals that reach the central cell cortex (medium green rods) of neural progenitors may be more involved in the fundamental establishment of a centrally located and functional bipolar spindle that can congress, and then faithfully segregate, chromosomes. (Dark green rods are kinetochore microtubules; for simplicity, other microtubule populations, such as interpolar microtubules, are omitted.)</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02875.029">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02875.029</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-02875-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig10s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02875.030</object-id><label>Figure 10—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>BRO culture with 30 pM nocodazole increases Tis21-positive VZ cells and basal mitoses, but not apoptosis.</title><p>E13.5 forebrains from wt mice were incubated for 24 hr in BRO culture, either with solvent (DMSO) only (control) or with 30 pM nocodazole, followed by immunofluorescence of coronal sections of the dorsolateral telencephalon, acquisition of 0.9 μm confocal sections (<bold>A, B, D, E, G, H)</bold> and quantification (<bold>C, F, I</bold>).

Compared to controls, 30 pM nocodazole increased the proportion of Tis21::GFP-positive cells in the VZ (58.8 ± 5.1% vs 68.2 ± 2.4%). These cells may well comprise not only BP daughters but also AP daughters originating from Tis21::GFP-negative AP divisions that had become increasingly asymmetric. We conclude that minimal nocodazole-induced asymmetric AP divisions result in increased Tis21::GFP expression in daughter cells, consistent with these daughters being neurogenic progenitors.</p><p>Of note, the increase in newborn BPs in the VZ did not yet result in a detectable increase in interphase Tbr2-positive or Pax6-positive BPs in the subventricular zone (SVZ) after 24 hr (Tbr2, control: 80.1 ± 2.0%, nocodazole: 82.3 ± 5.9%; Pax6, control: 31.9 ± 8.2%, nocodazole: 28.9 ± 12.7%), despite the higher number of mitoses in the SVZ (see below). This presumably reflects known differences in cell cycle length between progenitor subtypes (see ‘Discussion’).</p><p>A prediction from the increase in newborn BPs after minimal nocodazole is that the number of basal mitoses would increase. Confirming this, more mitoses were found in the SVZ with 30 pM nocodazole than in controls (phosphorylated histone 3 (PH3) immunoreactivity; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D–F</xref>, 1.96 ± 0.16 vs 1.32 ± 0.029).

In addition, 30 pM nocodazole did not result in more apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1G–I</xref> and ‘Material and methods’). Also, all mitotic phases proceeded normally and at the same rate with 30 pM nocodazole as they did in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–D</xref>), and cellular morphology at mitosis was unperturbed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F,G</xref>). These data show that normal mitotic progression and the cell cycle were unaffected by 30 pM nocodazole.

Together, these results show that an acute reduction in the number of apical/basal astrals that leads to an increase in asymmetric AP divisions can increase BPs and neurogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study reports a novel concept regarding the composition and role of astral microtubule populations in the symmetric vs asymmetric division of polarized stem and progenitor cells. Specifically, we use the established model of mouse neocortex APs to show that the transition between symmetric and asymmetric neural stem cell division in cells with minor spindle variations is mediated by a reduction in the number of astral microtubules that reach the cell cortex. Strikingly, this reduction in astrals is not homogeneous, but happens only in the astrals that reach the basal and apical cell cortex. This shows that a distinct subpopulation of astrals, the apical/basal astrals, governs spindle orientation.</p><p>Our selective reduction in the number of apical/basal astrals, by using minimal nocodazole, mimics the reduction observed in vivo and increases the proportion of asymmetric AP divisions and the pool of BPs, ultimately leading to more neurogenesis. To the best of our knowledge, this reduction is also the earliest change reported thus far in the cytoarchitecture of APs that switch from proliferation to neurogenesis. A homogeneous decrease in astrals, including those reaching the central cell cortex, happens only in BPs, which, accordingly, have the highest spindle orientation variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10J</xref>). The spatial, temporal, and cell-type specific regulation of astrals is therefore key to maintain the population of proliferating APs for normal brain development.</p><p>A new model is therefore proposed to explain how spindle and cleavage plane variability increases during mammalian neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chenn and McConnell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haydar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kosodo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Konno et al., 2008</xref>). The subtle mammalian increase in variability is fundamentally different to the large and defined 90° re-orientation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Knoblich, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Siller and Doe, 2009</xref>). We show that, as mammalian APs switch to neurogenesis, the spindle becomes less restricted to an orientation precisely perpendicular to the apico-basal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sauer, 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smart, 1972a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">1972b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huttner and Brand, 1997</xref>) as a result of fewer apical/basal astrals anchoring the spindle to the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10J</xref>). The orientation of spindles that become less anchored is then more sensitive to intra- and extracellular forces that can induce tilts, including those resulting from the dense packing of dynamic cells in the developing cortical wall.</p><p>The increase in BPs upon increasing spindle orientation variability by minimal nocodazole treatment is consistent with previous studies showing more BPs in mice where spindles were tilted by perturbing the LGN binding partner Inscuteable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Postiglione et al., 2011</xref>), or LGN itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Konno et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shitamukai et al., 2011</xref>). The increase in mitotic BPs observed upon LGN perturbation was associated with an increasing appearance of Pax6-positive and of Tbr2-positive cells in the SVZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Konno et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shitamukai et al., 2011</xref>). Inscuteable overexpression increased the number of mitotic, Tbr2-positive cells in the SVZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Postiglione et al., 2011</xref>). The reduction in apical/basal astrals shown here generated more newborn Tbr2-positive BPs in the VZ and mitotic BPs in the SVZ. Thus, these three distinct approaches that tilt the spindle to increasingly deviate from an orientation perpendicular to the apico-basal AP axis yield similar (albeit not identical) phenotypes, that is, an increase in delaminated progenitors that exhibit BP features and undergo basal mitosis. The more specific differences could reflect the distinct types of manipulation, i.e., the genetic ablation of LGN vs Inscuteable overexpression vs pharmacological perturbation of apico/basal astrals. Taken together, our data decisively support the concept that a small change in cleavage plane orientation of APs can be sufficient to cause a fate change in their progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fish et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Postiglione et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, the delaminated progenitors increasingly observed upon minimal nocodazole treatment showed Tbr2 immunoreactivity and underwent basal mitosis, hence showing a number of features that are typical of BPs rather than APs. Nevertheless, these newborn Tis21::GFP-positive BPs, generated by just tilting the spindle, may still temporarily exhibit certain AP features, such as an AP-like cell cycle length, which is shorter than that of mature BPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arai et al., 2011</xref>). These newborn BPs may therefore undergo mitosis soon after arrival in the SVZ, which would explain its increased mitoses without a significant increase in Tbr2-positive interphase cells. A shorter than normal cell cycle of the BPs generated by minimal nocodazole would also be consistent with the newborn neurons increasingly observed after 24 hr of this treatment being derived not only directly from the asymmetrically dividing APs, but also indirectly from these BPs.</p><p>Spindle orientation studies have faced the challenge of establishing whether the phenotypes observed could be solely attributed to changes in orientation, or to other effects on the spindle and other cellular components. This study aimed at specifically perturbing spindle orientation while avoiding other effects. For this, a minimal concentration of the highly specific microtubule polymerization inhibitor nocodazole was identified that was several orders of magnitude lower than previously used in spindle studies. This minimal nocodazole decreased only the number of apical/basal astrals, those detected to change when APs switch from proliferation to neurogenesis, but did not affect other types of microtubules, notably the central astrals. This suggests that these astrals are more sensitive to depolymerisation, perhaps due to being highly dynamic. Moreover, this decrease was titrated to the physiological level observed in unperturbed neurogenic APs, and other effects, notably on progenitor and spindle features, mitotic morphology, and progression, were not detected. Consistent with this, a similarly low concentration of the specific microtubule stabilizer taxol showed the opposite effect, increasing the number of apical/basal astrals. Therefore, treatment with minimal concentrations of compounds acting specifically on microtubules constitutes an alternative approach to genetic manipulations, allowing direct probing of spindle orientation per se and of the symmetry of cell division in tissue.</p><p>Furthermore, LGN is here shown to regulate the spatial and temporal abundance of astrals that reach the cell cortex, and thereby the transition between proliferation and neurogenesis. Mammalian LGN has been shown to participate in the anchoring of the spindle to the cell cortex in cultured MDCK cells, as part of a complex with NuMA and dynein, by mediating the attachment of astrals to cell cortical Gαi subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Du and Macara, 2004</xref>). Consistent with this role, previous studies showed that LGN is important for normal cleavage plane and symmetric AP divisions in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Konno et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shitamukai et al., 2011</xref>) and the chick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peyre et al., 2011</xref>), but how LGN achieved this was unknown. Using an LGN KO mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Konno et al., 2008</xref>), LGN is now shown to be necessary for APs to have a normal number of apical/basal astrals. Importantly, lack of LGN did not affect the number of central astrals, corroborating that loss of apical/basal astrals is sufficient to increase spindle deviations and asymmetric divisions. These data were complemented by overexpressing a dominant-negative version of LGN that interacts with cell cortical Gαi, but cannot interact with NuMA and dynein to anchor microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shitamukai et al., 2011</xref>). This also reduced apical/basal astral abundance. Conversely, when wt LGN was overexpressed in the presence of the microtubule-stabilizing compound taxol, neurogenic APs could be switched back to a mitosis behaviour characteristic of proliferating APs. Together, these data show that LGN is required for maintaining symmetric AP divisions through cortical anchoring of apical/basal astrals.</p><p>Our data also show how different cortical localizations of LGN could regulate the abundance of astrals that reach different regions of the cell cortex. When APs switched to neurogenesis, the enrichment of LGN at the basal cell cortex was largely reduced, and it was further reduced all around the cell cortex in BPs. This closely corresponds to the abundance pattern of astrals and also to the levels of spindle orientation variability in these different progenitors. A spatially selective loss of cortical LGN could therefore reduce cortical anchor points and lead to fewer astrals in specific regions of the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10J</xref>).</p><p>The present study showing the crucial role of a specific subset of LGN-dependent astrals in the control of spindle and cleavage plane orientation also builds upon previous studies on another microtubule-interacting protein, the lissencephaly protein Lis1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sapir et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Faulkner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tsai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yingling et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bi et al., 2009</xref>). In the neural tube of mice without Lis1, cleavage planes of APs were more tilted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yingling et al., 2008</xref>). Also, cultured embryonic fibroblasts lacking Lis1 showed general defects in interphase and mitotic microtubules, including astrals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yingling et al., 2008</xref>). The present findings suggest that the altered cleavage plane orientation in Lis1-deficient APs could be due, at least in part, to a loss of apical/basal astrals.</p><p>If apical/basal astral microtubules are key to controlling spindle and cleavage orientation, what then is the role of the central astrals unaffected by the proliferation-to-neurogenesis transition of progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10J</xref>) and that remained constant upon minimal nocodazole treatment or functional LGN ablation? An intriguing scenario is that this baseline number of remaining astrals is required for the primary establishment and structural stability of a spindle. If so, our data suggest a way how cells differentially regulate core aspects of spindle function vs those that are cell type-specific, notably spindle orientation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All observations were performed in the dorsolateral telencephalon of mouse embryos, at a medial position along the rostro-caudal axis.

Flasks were connected to a whole-embryo culture incubator (RKI Ikemoto, Japan) and maintained at 37°C with an atmosphere of 60% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 35% N<sub>2</sub>, and at 30 rpm, allowing tissue rotation and nutrition without mechanical damage. After 1 hr of equilibration, pre-warmed brain culture medium containing 10 nM nocodazole or taxol and 1% DMSO, added from a 1 μm stock solution in DMSO, or brain culture medium containing 1% DMSO only (control), was added to the culture in amounts appropriate to obtain the indicated final concentration. To count astrals, E14.5 forebrains were incubated for 2.5 hr. To analyse differences in the populations of progenitors, mitotic cells, and neurons, E13.5 forebrains were incubated for 24 hr, during which the tissue remained intact without a significant cell death increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>).

E13.5 pregnant mice were fully anesthetized with isofluorane and received a subcutaneous analgesic injection. The uterus was then exposed by surgically opening the peritoneal cavity, maintaining moisture and 37°C temperature. Embryos were injected intraventricularly with a 0.1% solution of fast green (Sigma) in sterile PBS, containing 0.2–0.5 μg/μl of LGN plasmid, plus mCherry or GAP43-EGFP, driven by the CAGGS constitutive promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Niwa et al., 1991</xref>) to locate electroporated regions and cells. Electroporations were with six 50 ms pulses of 30 mV at 1 s intervals. Detection of LGN and the fluorescent reporter occupied two of the four available fluorescence channels, with DAPI and tubulin occupying the other two, so these experiments could only be performed with wt and not with Tis21::GFP mice. For consistency, this scheme was followed for the live imaging of organotypic slice cultures (see ‘Live tissue imaging’).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Microscopy</title><p>Images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 510 Duoscan laser-scanning confocal microscope or a Zeiss LSM 780 NLO 2-photon laser-scanning microscope with an automated tuning pulsed Ti:S Chameleon Vision II laser (Coherent), using 63× Plan-Apochromat 1.4 N.A. oil or 40× C-Apochromat 1.2 N.A.

The brightness and contrast of images were recorded and adjusted linearly. To analyse spindle and cleavage orientation dynamics by live tissue imaging, a measurement was made for each time point of the angle between the main axis of the chromosome plates, typically along the apico-basal axis of the tissue, and the plane of the local apical ventricular surface. At anaphase onset, this chromosome plate angle is also practically identical to the angle of cleavage of the cell soma, and therefore directly reports on the symmetry or asymmetry of the cell division with respect to cellular features. The angles are given as deviations from full orthogonality with the local apical surface, as seen from a coronal perspective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10J</xref>). The accuracy of angular measurements was corroborated along the 3D stack of optical sections. To quantitate the range of variability that spindle orientation can have in different progenitor types, the mean of the total angular amplitude of deviations from metaphase to anaphase onset was calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>To quantitate variations in the cell cortical distribution of LGN, a contour of per-pixel fluorescence intensity values was obtained along the cell cortex, in immunofluorescence images of a single central optical section per 3D stack (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). The start was at the centre of the apical region and continued clockwise around the cell soma. The cortical intensity values were obtained by subtracting the diffuse cytoplasmic signal from the intensities measured along the one pixel-wide contour. To compare equivalent values between different cells, 100 equidistant cortical intensity values along the normalized cell soma contours were calculated by linear interpolation. The area, fluorescence intensity, and standard deviation measurements of the spindle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>) were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mora-Bermudez et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantitation of distinct populations of astral microtubules</title><p>To distinguish and count populations of astrals according to their spatial distribution, each set of confocal sections of a metaphase cell soma was divided into three regions: an apical, a central, and a basal region. The apical region was defined from the apical surface lining the ventricle to the parallel plane just before the first centromeric region on the metaphase plate (below pink dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The central region that followed was defined to contain all centromeric regions, as revealed by the punctate DAPI staining of the centromeric and pericentromeric heterochromatin foci (between pink and blue dashed lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The basal region extended after the last centromeric region until the basal end of the cell soma (above blue dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>Comprehensive stacks of high-resolution serial confocal sections (see Microscopy) were examined from each progenitor in metaphase. All detectable astrals microtubules that emanated from the 2 centrosomes and reached the cell periphery were counted in each of the above-defined regions. These presumably are single microtubules, although bundles of microtubules cannot be excluded.</p><p>The apico-basal plane of the chromosome plates in APs can tilt with respect to the apical–basal axis of the tissue. However, it can also rotate around that axis, as seen from an ‘en face’ perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haydar et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, in coronal sections, it is possible to observe spindles in a ‘front’ view, where all or most of the length of the spindle is visible in one section, or in a ‘side’ view, showing only one side of the spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Spindles were therefore classified accordingly in these two, cell-biologically equivalent, perspective categories, a ‘Front’ view, when the main axis of the spindle was mostly parallel to the sectioning plane and fully visible within 1–3 confocal sections, and a ‘Side’ view, when the main axis of the spindle extended mostly along the sectioning axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>Astrals in the apical and basal regions could be reliably counted in cells with any such perspective. The central region of the spindle showed a dense α-tubulin staining, however, which in a ‘Front’ view made the distinction of many of its astrals very challenging. Therefore, astrals in the central region were counted in cells with a ‘Side’ view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This may have led to an underestimation of the total number of central astrals, especially short ones oriented along the optical axis, albeit equally in all progenitor types.</p><p>In most mouse BPs, canonical apical cell polarity markers are lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attardo et al., 2008</xref>) and cell cortex regions can no longer be reliably defined as ‘apical’ or ‘basal’. BPs were included in our analysis for comparative purposes, with the note that astrals that reach the region of the cell cortex facing mostly the ventricle are considered ‘apically oriented’, those that reached the region of the cortex facing mostly the pia ‘basally oriented’, and those that reach the region in between the previous regions ‘centrally oriented’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Datasets were tabulated and analysed using Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) and GraphPad Prism (La Jolla, CA).

Therefore, 30 pM was very unlikely to have general or nonspecific effects in the neural progenitors, spindles, or microtubules. Indeed, as described in Results, 30 pM nocodazole did not result in overt perturbations in mitotic morphology, mitotic progression, and general cell and tissue features.</p><p>Furthermore, no significant differences were found between spindles in untreated, control (DMSO-only), and 30 pM nocodazole-treated forebrains regarding spindle size, the relative amount of microtubules or the distribution and structure of the fluorescence signal of the microtubules (area, mean fluorescence intensity, and mean standard deviation (SD) of the per-pixel fluorescence intensity values, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). A further hypothesis was that, if the spindle, located in the central plane of the cell soma, was somehow affected, the soma diameter at the spindle plane of the cells may be changed in a tissue with high cellular density. This diameter represented also the length of the entire spindle, including some central astrals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). No significant differences were found, however, between APs in untreated, control and 30 pM nocodazole-treated forebrains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). In line with our in-organ observations, cell culture experiments have shown that a much higher nocodazole concentration (5 nM) did not disrupt the assembly of a functional bipolar spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thery et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The survival of cells in tissue under 30 pM nocodazole was also analysed, by counting the proportion of cleaved caspase 3-immunoreactive cells in cortical wall tissue. The occurrence of positive cells was overall very low, and also similar between control and 30 pM nocodazole (Control 1.49 vs Noc 1.59), showing that this concentration did not result in an apoptosis increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1G–I</xref>). Together, these observations strongly suggest that 30 pM nocodazole does not have general or nonspecific effects in the tissue examined.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Services and Facilities of the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics for outstanding support, notably Jussi Helppi and his team of the Animal Facility, and Jan Peychl and his team of the Light Microscopy Facility.

After showing that there is a correlation between the numbers of apical and basal astral microtubules and the spindle orientation variability, they then go on to manipulate the number of apical/basal microtubules and ask whether this influences the spindle orientation variability and, ultimately, symmetric versus neurogenic divisions. The study address a very interesting and timely question, the cellular mechanisms that determine asymmetric versus symmetric stem cell divisions and the paper is well-written and presented. In addition, the experiments, which are largely based upon live imaging approaches, are carefully performed and analyzed. However, the conclusions that the authors draw, while largely convincing, would be greatly strengthened by considering the following issues.</p><p>1) The major limitation of this study comes from the assumption that the small amounts of microtubule polymerizing/depolymerizing drugs that are used are specifically affecting the apical/basal astral microtubules. The authors show that features such as spindle area, amount of spindle microtubules, and cell diameter are unchanged. However, they need to ensure that cells progress through mitosis normally and at the same rate as controls. Of course some of the cells complete mitosis, since the authors followed the outcome of divisions after their treatments, but the question is whether drug treatment has reduced and biased the proportion of cells that complete mitosis normally, which would significantly affect their conclusions.</p><p>In this regard, two other important parameters that depend upon microtubules and that might be affected are the primary cilium, which acts as a signaling center in these APs, and the elongated bipolar morphology of the APs. The authors should characterize these two parameters to ensure that the drugs are not overtly affecting them.</p><p>2) While the authors' data support the proposed model for cells dividing slightly away from the plane of the neuroepithelium, it is less clear how the data could explain cells dividing with their spindle oriented completely perpendicular to the neuroepithelium. Although the authors tend to focus on divisions that deviate only slightly from the plane of the tissue, some more extreme deviations definitely take place in the cortical epithelium, as seen in the quantification of division orientations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>. It is hard to imagine there would be fewer apical/basal astral microtubules in this situation. How do the authors reconcile this observation with their data?</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) The authors often refer to “symmetric terminal divisions that produce two neurons”. This statement could be confusing to some readers, as even terminal divisions that generate two neurons could be asymmetric if these neurons are of different types. This should be taken into consideration throughout the text.</p><p>2) The LGN immunostaining data would be greatly improved by the addition of a control staining on LGN -/- cortical sections. This is particularly important to increase confidence in the quantification of LGN signal at the apical/central/basal cortex.</p><p>3) A recent paper by Juergen Knoblich's group (Juschke et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Jan 21;111(3):1014-9) argues that measuring spindle angles using centrosome labeling in 3D is essential to obtain an accurate representation of division orientation distribution. Here the authors use the cleavage plane as a measure of division orientation, which seems more prone to subjective calls as to where the cleavage line is traced, depending on the quality of the cadherin staining and section angle. The authors might want to consider including a discussion of their method relative to that of Knoblich et al., as this could lead to some controversies.</p><p>4) The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> can be interpreted by alternative possibilities such as changes in cellular distribution/location and selective proliferation of certain populations. The authors' previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Konno et al. 2008</xref>) showed that LGN KO changed the distribution of Pax6+ cells but not so much of their number. This apparent inconsistency needs explanation. The authors should add the data of cells in the SVZ (outside of the VZ) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>. It is also desirable to show the effect of Nocodazole treatment on the % of Tis21+ (neurogenic) cells among APs.</p><p>5) Why do the authors detect differences in Tbr1+ cell number in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10I</xref>, since most Tbr1+ cells (or cells destined to become Tbr1+) are likely to be postmitotic already in E13.5 cortices. Also, 24 h incubation may be too short a time to detect the effects of Nocodazole on progenitor cell fate in the VZ by examining mature neuronal markers in the cortical plate.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02875.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The major limitation of this study comes from the assumption that the small amounts of microtubule polymerizing/depolymerizing drugs that are used are specifically affecting the apical/basal astral microtubules.

Of course some of the cells complete mitosis, since the authors followed the outcome of divisions after their treatments, but the question is whether drug treatment has reduced and biased the proportion of cells that complete mitosis normally, which would significantly affect their conclusions</italic>.</p><p>The point raised by the reviewers is indeed a very important one. As requested by the reviewers, we have now significantly strengthened the control data showing that cells progress through mitosis normally and at the same rate as controls when exposed to minimal concentrations of the microtubule compounds, i.e. nocodazole and taxol, in the low picomolar range.</p><p>In the previous version of the manuscript, we showed that the total number of mitoses counted via phosphohistone 3 (PH3) immunoreactivity in the germinal zones (VZ+SVZ) did not significantly change after incubation with 30 pM nocodazole, compared to the controls with solvent (DMSO) only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D-F</xref>). This already strongly suggested a normal mitotic progression. We now provide additional data with a second and independent mitosis marker, namely phosphovimentin (pVim), which also shows no change in the total number of mitoses when compared to controls, corroborating a normal mitotic progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1 D-F</xref>).</p><p>This is also fully consistent with our time-lapse analysis of mitosis progression in live tissue, with high temporal resolution, following 40 cells in 3 independent experiments with minimal nocodazole or taxol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A-F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A-D</xref>). Compared to controls, this showed indistinguishable rates of normal progression through the mitotic phases, as well as unaffected live mitotic morphology and behaviour. Furthermore, this is in agreement with our detailed subcellular analysis of 40 progenitors incubated with minimal nocodazole or taxol, by immunofluorescence and high-resolution 3D confocal microscopy. This shows mitotic morphologies, as well as a set of quantified key spindle and cell parameters, that are indistinguishable from controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-D, F-G, I-J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B-D, F</xref>).</p><p>Together, these various sets of controls and the ones mentioned below in our response to the next point raised by the reviewers show that concentrations of microtubule compounds in the low pM range (which is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower that in other spindle studies with ‘low’ concentrations, see Material and Methods) do not significantly affect the normal kinetics and progression through mitosis, nor the general tissue, cellular and subcellular architecture of neural progenitors in the developing cortical wall.</p><p><italic>In this regard, two other important parameters that depend upon microtubules and that might be affected are the primary cilium, which acts as a signaling center in these APs, and the elongated bipolar morphology of the APs. The authors should characterize these two parameters to ensure that the drugs are not overtly affecting them</italic>.</p><p>These are great suggestions by the reviewers, and as requested, we have now also analysed the primary cilium as well as the elongated bipolar morphology of APs, incubated with 30 pM nocodazole, and found that those structures are also indistinguishable from the controls incubated with solvent only (DMSO) (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1 A,B and C-F</xref>, respectively).</p><p>In addition, we have included another relevant parameter and analysed the cytoarchitecture of the entire E14.5 cortical wall, as revealed by the pattern of microtubules, incubated with 30 pM nocodazole, and found no differences when compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G,H</xref>). These data further strengthen our conclusion that microtubule compounds in the low picomolar range do not significantly affect the general tissue architecture and the cellular and subcellular morphology of progenitors in the mouse developing cortical wall.</p><p>These new data are now described in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) While the authors' data support the proposed model for cells dividing slightly away from the plane of the neuroepithelium, it is less clear how the data could explain cells dividing with their spindle oriented completely perpendicular to the neuroepithelium.

How do the authors reconcile this observation with their data?</italic></p><p>Divisions of apical progenitors (APs, which undergo mitosis at the ventricular surface) in which the spindle is oriented completely perpendicular to the plane of the neuroepithelium are extremely rare under physiological conditions, as shown by our labs and others. AP divisions typically occur with the spindle oriented parallel to the plane of the neuroepithelium, or with the spindle deviating only slightly from that orientation. Our model of down-regulation of apical/basal astral microtubules primarily applies to these AP divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10J</xref>).</p><p>Cell divisions in which the spindle is oriented completely perpendicular to the plane of the neuroepithelium are mostly observed in basal progenitors (BPs, which undergo mitosis in the subventricular zone). In fact, the cells pointed out by the reviewers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C&amp;F</xref> are BPs, not APs. Although BP divisions are not the focus of our study, we do find that apical/basal astrals, and even central astrals, are lower in number in BPs than APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These data are therefore consistent with our model.</p><p><italic>Minor comments:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors often refer to “symmetric terminal divisions that produce two neurons”. This statement could be confusing to some readers, as even terminal divisions that generate two neurons could be asymmetric if these neurons are of different types. This should be taken into consideration throughout the text</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers are, of course, correct. As suggested, we have rephrased the relevant sentences to clarify this issue.</p><p><italic>2) The LGN immunostaining data would be greatly improved by the addition of a control staining on LGN -/- cortical sections. This is particularly important to increase confidence in the quantification of LGN signal at the apical/central/basal cortex</italic>.</p><p>We agree that a control immunostaining of LGN +/– vs. –/– is important. This has been previously published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Konno et al. (2008)</xref>, and we have here used the same mouse line, the same antibodies and similar protocols. To exclude that a different experimenter could produce significantly different results, we provide the requested LGN immunostaining below for the information of the reviewers. In short, the immunofluorescence we present is consistent with that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Konno et al. (2008)</xref>, as it shows the expected enrichment of LGN immunoreactivity in mitotic apical progenitors, in which it is concentrated at the basolateral cell cortex, for LGN +/– E13.5 dorsolateral telencephalon, consistent with the data presented in this manuscript, but no detectable signal in LGN –/– E13.5 dorsolateral telencephalon.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label> <caption><title>No LGN immunoreactivity in LGN –/– mice. </title><p>E13.5 LGN+/– (top) and LGN–/– (bottom) mice (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Konno et al, 2008</xref>). 1-μm confocal sections of immunofluorescences for endogenous LGN (red), together with DNA (DAPI, cyan) staining, of coronal sections of the dorsolateral telencephalon.

Here the authors use the cleavage plane as a measure of division orientation, which seems more prone to subjective calls as to where the cleavage line is traced, depending on the quality of the cadherin staining and section angle. The authors might want to consider including a discussion of their method relative to that of Knoblich et al., as this could lead to some controversies.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the paper by Juschke et al. (2014) is an important paper illustrating the crucial importance of 3D imaging to correctly determine the cleavage plane. In fact, as we describe in detail in Material and Methods and the relevant figure legends, all of our imaging sets, live and fixed, were 3D stacks, and therefore our tracing of the orientation of divisions is valid.</p><p>Furthermore, Juschke et al. focus exclusively on the potential difficulties faced when applying the method that uses the centrosome-centrosome axis to calculate cleavage orientation, and they describe important parameters that must be considered when calculating the orientations with this method. The method we used is not dependent on these parameters, as we determined the orientation of divisions by following the actual trajectory of the cleavage plane, in high-resolution and comprehensive 3D stacks of confocal images of dividing progenitors that are in an advanced cytokinesis stage, as we describe in detail in Material and Methods. This does not require the calculation necessary to infer division trajectories from the centrosome-centrosome axis. Therefore, we are confident that our method is equally valid to measure accurate division orientations as the approach of Juschke et al.</p><p><italic>4) The results in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10"><italic>Figure 10</italic></xref> <italic>can be interpreted by alternative possibilities such as changes in cellular distribution/location and selective proliferation of certain populations. The authors' previous paper (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31"><italic>Konno et al. 2008</italic></xref><italic>) showed that LGN KO changed the distribution of Pax6+ cells but not so much of their number. This apparent inconsistency needs explanation. The authors should add the data of cells in the SVZ (outside of the VZ) in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10"><italic>Figure 10C</italic></xref><italic>. It is also desirable to show the effect of Nocodazole treatment on the % of Tis21+ (neurogenic) cells among APs</italic>.</p><p>As requested by the reviewers, we have now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref> (new right panel) the Pax6 and Tbr2 data for the SVZ, which show no significant change between control and nocodazole. We have also included a discussion on the differences with previous studies with regards to the distribution and abundance of markers and progenitor types. These differences do not necessarily constitute an inconsistency and could result from the different targets of the perturbations (LGN vs. apical/basal astral microtubules) and from the experimental perturbations themselves (long-term genetic ablation of LGN vs. specific and acute pharmacological down-regulation of apical/basal astrals over 24 h).</p><p>Also, as requested by the reviewers, we have performed the experiments to analyse the effect of nocodazole on the proportion of VZ progenitors positive for Tis21:GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). Interestingly, the proportion of Tis21:GFP positive VZ progenitors increases by roughly 10%. This is consistent with similar magnitudes of increase in Tbr2 and of decrease in Pax6 in the VZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A-C</xref> left), as well as with the increase in Tbr1 in the developing cortical plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10G-I</xref>). Together, these data underscore a general increase in neurogenic progenitors upon incubation with 30 pM nocodazole as compared to controls.</p><p><italic>5) Why do the authors detect differences in Tbr1+ cell number in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10"><italic>Figure 10I</italic></xref><italic>, since most Tbr1+ cells (or cells destined to become Tbr1+) are likely to be postmitotic already in E13.5 cortices. Also, 24 h incubation may be too short a time to detect the effects of Nocodazole on progenitor cell fate in the VZ by examining mature neuronal markers in the cortical plate</italic>.</p><p>As we have now included in the Discussion, the increase in Tbr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10I</xref>) likely results from both, (i) direct neurogenesis from apical progenitors, caused by an increase in asymmetric divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F-H</xref>), and (ii) indirect neurogenesis via basal progenitors, may exhibit a sufficiently short cell cycle to produce neurons in the 24-h incubation performed). This is consistent with the newly added data that show an increase in the neurogenic marker Tis21::GFP in VZ progenitors (see previous point and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
