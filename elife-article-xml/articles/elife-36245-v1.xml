of the genome into transcriptionally active and inactive compartments. We studied the impact on the structure and expression of host chromatin by the human retrovirus HTLV-1. We show that HTLV-1 disrupts host chromatin structure by forming loops between the provirus and the host genome; certain loops depend on the critical chromatin architectural protein CTCF, which we recently discovered binds to the HTLV-1 provirus. We show that the provirus causes two distinct patterns of abnormal transcription of the host genome in cis: bidirectional transcription in the host genome immediately flanking the provirus, and clone-specific transcription in cis at non-contiguous loci up to &gt;300 kb from the integration site. We conclude that HTLV-1 causes insertional mutagenesis up to the megabase range in the host genome in &gt;10<sup>4</sup> persistently-maintained HTLV-1<sup>+</sup> T-cell clones in vivo.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HTLV-1</kwd><kwd>retrovirus</kwd><kwd>CTCF</kwd><kwd>chromatin looping</kwd><kwd>insertional mutagenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT100291MA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Melamed</surname><given-names>Anat</given-names></name><name><surname>Yaguchi</surname><given-names>Hiroko</given-names></name><name><surname>Miura</surname><given-names>Michi</given-names></name><name><surname>Witkover</surname><given-names>Aviva</given-names></name><name><surname>Bangham</surname><given-names>Charles RM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007428</institution-id><institution>Naito Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miura</surname><given-names>Michi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/K019090/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bangham</surname><given-names>Charles RM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute for Health Research Imperial Biomedical Research Centre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bangham</surname><given-names>Charles RM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The human leukemia virus HTLV-1 causes abnormal chromatin looping in tens of thousands of infected T cell clones in each host, and abnormal host transcription both flanking the integrated provirus and at distant loci in cis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The dynamics and higher-order folding of chromatin play a critical role in gene regulation. Higher-order chromatin structure <italic>is determined by</italic> several factors, among which <italic>the best characterized</italic> is CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ong and Corces, 2014</xref>). CTCF binds a non-palindromic 20-nucleotide DNA motif at ~50,000 sites in the human genome, and acts chiefly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Phillips and Corces, 2009</xref>) by regulating the formation of chromatin loops of ~100 kb to ~2 Mb, which control the contacts made between promoters and enhancers and so regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gibcus and Dekker, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schwarzer and Spitz, 2014</xref>). Aberrant higher-order chromatin organization can result in abnormal patterns of transcription, and mutations in CTCF are linked to human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corces and Corces, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flavahan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hnisz et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Recently we found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Satou et al., 2016</xref>) that CTCF binds to a nucleotide motif in the Human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1; also known as the human T-cell leukemia virus), when HTLV-1 is integrated - as the provirus - into the host cell genome. HTLV-1 is a primate retrovirus that infects ~10 million people in the tropics and subtropics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bangham, 2018</xref>). The infection is asymptomatic in ~90% of human hosts; the remaining 10% of HTLV-1-infected hosts develop either a chronic inflammatory disease, most commonly involving the central nervous system, or an aggressive malignancy of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells known as adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL). Unlike HIV-1 infection, there remains no satisfactory treatment for either the inflammatory or malignant diseases caused by HTLV-1.</p><p>A typical host of HTLV-1 carries between 10<sup>4</sup> and 10<sup>5</sup> clones of infected T cells, each clone carrying a single copy of the provirus in a unique genomic location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laydon et al., 2014</xref>). The large number of HTLV-1-infected clones appears to be established early in infection, after which persistent clonal proliferation maintains a stable hierarchy of HTLV-1-infected clones for the remainder of the host’s life. The viral regulatory proteins, Tax and HBZ (HTLV-1 bZIP), which are encoded respectively by the sense and antisense strands of the provirus, play indispensable roles in pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matsuoka and Jeang, 2011a</xref>). Tax is a transcriptional transactivator which dysregulates many host genes, while HBZ acts as a negative regulator of Tax-mediated host gene transcription and viral expression. Both Tax and HBZ contribute to persistent proliferation of the infected T cell in vivo, and it is now thought that the consequent accumulation of replicative mutations is a key driver in HTLV-1 oncogenesis. However, until recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cook et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kataoka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rosewick et al., 2017</xref>) insertional mutagenesis has not been considered important in causing ATL.</p><p>The observation that CTCF binds to the HTLV-1 provirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Satou et al., 2016</xref>) raised the hypothesis that CTCF bound to the provirus can form abnormal chromatin loops by dimerizing with CTCF in the flanking host genome. Using chromosome conformation capture (3C), we previously demonstrated the presence of a single CTCF-dependent chromatin loop in a long-term in vitro T cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Satou et al., 2016</xref>). In the present study we extended this analysis, using circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) and RNA-seq, to examine systematically the impact of the HTLV-1 provirus on the structure and expression of the host genome in T cell clones isolated from HTLV-1-infected subjects. We show that the HTLV-1 provirus forms reproducible abnormal chromatin contacts with sites in the host genome in cis as far as 1.4 Mb from the provirus. Some of these abnormal chromatin contacts depend on CTCF binding to the provirus. Further, we demonstrate clone-specific deregulation of host transcription in cis both immediately flanking the integrated provirus (up to 50 kb upstream and downstream) and at distant sites as far as 300 kb from the provirus. Since HTLV-1 is integrated in &gt;10<sup>4</sup> different genetic locations in a typical host, and there are tens of thousands of CTCF-binding sites (CTCF-BS) in the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krijger and de Laat, 2016</xref>), these results imply that HTLV-1 has the potential to cause deregulation of host transcription at a very large number of loci in each infected host.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In this paper, we refer to loci in the host genome relative to the orientation of the HTLV-1 provirus. Thus, a locus ‘downstream’ of the provirus is located 3′ to the 3′ LTR, whether the provirus is integrated in the positive or negative sense in the host genome.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>HTLV-1 forms chromatin loops with the flanking host genome</title><p>To test the hypothesis that HTLV-1 integration alters the host chromatin structure, we performed a genome-wide search for chromosomal positions that contact the HTLV-1 provirus, using a modified version of circular chromosome conformation capture (4C). 4C is a powerful tool to study the 3D chromatin looping between a specified genomic region (the 'viewpoint') with respect to the rest of the genome. The standard 4C protocol has limitations in that it is only semiquantitative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Denker and de Laat, 2016</xref>). To improve the quantification, we adapted our protocol for quantification of HTLV-1 integration sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gillet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gillet et al., 2017</xref>). We followed the 4C protocol described by van de Werken et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van de Werken et al., 2012</xref>), but instead of using a second restriction enzyme, we sonicated the library, added adapters and performed ligation-mediated PCR (see Materials and methods). This modification confers two advantages. First, it precludes the bias towards detection of chromatin contacts that lie near a given restriction site. Second, the amplicon length serves as a unique molecular identifier, enabling relative quantification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gillet et al., 2017</xref>) of the chromatin contacts. We refer to this modified method as quantitative 4C (q4C); a similar approach (UMI-4C) has been described by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schwartzman et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We applied q4C to test the hypothesis that the HTLV-1 provirus forms chromatin contacts with the host genome in a series of T cell clones isolated by limiting dilution from circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes of HTLV-1-infected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cook et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Each clone has a single copy of the provirus in a unique integration site. As the viewpoint in q4C, we used the 679 bp NlaIII fragment containing the proviral CTCF-BS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

At the smallest scale, chromatin is organized in a series of reproducible loops that are formed by bringing together specific genomic loci which are separated on the linear genome by up to ~2 Mb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dekker and Heard, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nora et al., 2012</xref>). The zinc finger protein CTCF plays a central part in establishing and maintaining these chromatin loops: the non-palindromic CTCF-BS is found at the borders of ~80% of loops. Certain other chromatin-associated proteins, such as PRC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schoenfelder et al., 2015</xref>), and transcription factors including AP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Phanstiel et al., 2017</xref>) and YY1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beagan et al., 2017</xref>), can also cause looping of chromatin. The resulting chromatin loops in turn play a critical part in controlling gene expression, by regulating the contacts made between enhancers and promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gibcus and Dekker, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schwarzer and Spitz, 2014</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we used a panel of non-malignant CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell clones naturally infected with HTLV-1. Each clone carries a single copy HTLV-1 provirus in a known genomic location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cook et al., 2012</xref>); all 10 clones studied were competent to express the plus-strand proviral genes except clones 6.25 and 8.13.</p><p>The results of chromosome conformation analysis (q4C) presented here reveal reproducible contacts between the HTLV-1 provirus and the flanking host genome at least 1.4 Mb from the integration site. Each clone has a unique pattern of chromatin contacts, depending on the site of integration of the provirus in the host genome. The allelic bias observed in the q4C data, with the preferential detection of SNPs on the chromosome carrying the provirus, indicates that the provirus makes preferential contacts in cis with host chromatin at distances at least 4 Mb from the provirus. Preferential contacts in cis may extend beyond this distance, but detection is likely to be limited by the sensitivity of the q4C technique.</p><p>Four observations indicate that certain chromatin contacts made between the provirus and the host genome depend on the presence of CTCF. First, in each of two clones (ED and TBX4B; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>), knocking out the CTCF BS in the provirus without altering the coding sequence of the <italic>tax</italic> gene abrogated a major contact with a site in the host genome, respectively ~50 and 17 kb downstream, where CTCF was shown to bind. Second, of the 44 host loci identified by the peak-calling algorithm as making contact with the provirus, 22 contained one or more CTCF-BS (p=4.73 * 10<sup>−4</sup>, Fisher’s exact test). Third, consistent with recent observations made by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Wit et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sanborn et al., 2015</xref>), 12 of the 13 (92.3%) CTCF-BS in the host contact sites whose orientation could be ascertained were oriented towards the CTCF-BS in HTLV-1. Fourth, both the number and height of q4C peaks were correlated with the number of CTCF-BS in the host genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). However, not all host chromatin contact sites contain CTCF-BS, and certain peaks remained detectable by q4C after knock-out of the proviral CTCF-BS. These observations are consistent with the findings that certain chromatin-associated proteins other than CTCF can also give rise to chromatin looping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schoenfelder et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Phanstiel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beagan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The formation of chromatin loops between the HTLV-1 provirus and the host genome in turn raised the possibility that host transcription is deregulated. At least two mechanisms of such deregulation can be suggested. First, the abnormal chromatin loops might alter the normal contacts made between enhancers and promoters in the host genome, either creating new contacts or abrogating pre-existing contacts. Second, the new chromatin loop might bring the proviral LTR near a host promoter and cause abnormal transcription from the promoter.</p><p>We show here that HTLV-1 can deregulate host transcription both at sites contiguous with the provirus and at non-contiguous, distant sites. Again, each clone has a unique pattern of transcription. In the host genome immediately flanking the provirus, we detected frequent abnormal (clone-specific) transcription, predominantly in the opposite transcriptional sense to the provirus upstream of the 5′ LTR and, to a lesser extent, in the same transcriptional sense downstream of the 3′ LTR. The observed abnormal transcription involved both intergenic regions and identified host genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>); in addition, we observed examples of abnormal transcription and abnormal splicing of host genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Kataoka et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kataoka et al., 2015</xref>) and Rosewick et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rosewick et al., 2017</xref>) have reported evidence of transcription initiated on the minus strand of the provirus and continuing upstream into the host genome in transformed lymphocyte clones carrying HTLV-1 or the related bovine leukemia virus (BLV). The present results are consistent with these recent reports, demonstrating that abnormal host transcription flanking the provirus in cis is a general feature of HTLV-1 infection. Our results further suggest that an important mechanism of the observed abnormal transcription is chromatin looping between the provirus and the host genome. The abnormal transcription is bidirectional: both downstream of the provirus in the same sense as the proviral plus-strand, and upstream in the opposite sense. The observation of clone-specific transcription upstream of the 5′ LTR in the plus-strand sense (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), especially in high <italic>tax</italic>-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), suggest that the HTLV-1 promoter/enhancer can drive abnormal expression from nearby transcription start sites.</p><p>In addition to the abnormal transcription frequently detected in regions of the host genome contiguous with the provirus, each clone also had a unique pattern of abnormal transcription at non-contiguous, distant sites. The great majority of these clone-specific transcripts came from the chromosome carrying the provirus, not its homologous ‘uninfected’ chromosome, as shown by the allelic bias observed in the sequence reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Similarly, the observed allelic bias in the q4C reads extended to at least 1 Mb upstream and downstream of the provirus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These results are consistent with the notion that the abnormal transcription observed at sites distant from the provirus results from contacts made between the provirus and the host genome.</p><p>While certain CTCF-dependent chromatin loops mediate enhancer-promoter interactions, there is growing evidence that the main function of CTCF-dependent loops is structural and is largely shared between cell types, whereas loops formed by other chromatin-binding proteins such as YY1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weintraub et al., 2017</xref>) or chromatin-modifying proteins such as PRC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eagen et al., 2017</xref>) mediate dynamic enhancer-promoter interactions and thus play a central part in determining cell-type-specific transcription. It remains to be tested whether each respective instance of HTLV-1-associated abnormal host transcription observed here depends on chromatin looping induced by CTCF or another chromatin-binding protein.</p><p>Retroviruses have long been known to disrupt host gene expression by insertional mutagenesis, either by integration of the provirus within a gene or by activating expression of a flanking host gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Uren et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coffin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nusse and Varmus, 1982</xref>); indeed, the first report of insertional oncogenesis was activation of <italic>c-myc</italic> by avian leukosis virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hayward et al., 1981</xref>). Upstream host oncogenes have been shown to be activated by integrated retroviruses, for example mouse mammary tumour virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nusse and Varmus, 1982</xref>) and murine leukemia virus (MLV); activation may occur either by an effect of the proviral enhancer or by readthrough transcription from the LTR into the host genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rasmussen et al., 2010</xref>). Integration downstream of a host oncogene conferred a strong selective advantage on certain clones transduced with a gene therapy vector derived from MLV, resulting in a number of cases of leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hacein-Bey-Abina et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2003</xref>). In mice, it has also been shown that MLV can cause abnormal host transcription by activating a distant host gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lazo et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sokol et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babaei et al., 2015</xref>). In a study of MLV-induced leukemia, Sokol et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sokol et al., 2014</xref>) suggested that the MLV proviral enhancer was brought near the oncogene by chromatin looping; if so, it is likely that chance integration of MLV at this particular locus enabled the virus to exploit a normal chromatin loop normally present in the mouse genome. In contrast to this adventitious effect of MLV, our results show that the HTLV-1 provirus itself can cause both abnormal chromatin contacts in cis with distant host loci and abnormal host transcription at distant loci. These findings demonstrate that HTLV-1 has a range of insertional mutagenesis that can extend to the megabase scale.</p><p>The altered chromosomal looping and consequent effects on host genome transcription depend on the proviral integration site and the presence of nearby CTCF-BS, and so differ in each infected T-cell clone. The changes in chromatin structure caused by HTLV-1 might not only create novel loops but also destroy pre-existing CTCF-dependent loops that are present in uninfected cells. Further work is needed to investigate the impact of altered looping and transcription on the persistence, infectivity and oncogenic potential of the infected T-cell clones.</p><p>We postulate that CTCF confers a survival or replication advantage to HTLV-1, because of the high degree of sequence conservation of the proviral CTCF binding site and the coincidence of the binding site with a border of epigenetic modifications associated with transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Satou et al., 2016</xref>). However, the nature and mechanism of this putative advantage are not yet known.</p><p>Schmidt et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>) showed that retrotransposons propagated CTCF-BS throughout the genome of several mammalian lineages during evolution; however, present-day exogenous retroviruses have not previously been shown to alter the higher-order structure of host chromatin, to our knowledge. It was recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goodman et al., 2018</xref>) that the spumaretrovirus foamy virus encodes a CTCF-BS in its long terminal repeats. The impact of these binding sites on host chromatin structure and transcription have not been investigated; Goodman et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goodman et al., 2018</xref>) suggested that the presence of CTCF bound to the LTRs might block enhancer effects of the foamy virus LTR, and so might account for the low observed degree of genotoxicity of the foamy virus.</p><p>The HTLV-1 transcriptional transactivator protein Tax drives expression not only of the proviral plus stand but also of several host genes, notably <italic>CD25</italic> (<italic>IL2RA</italic>), <italic>IFNG</italic>, <italic>IL6</italic>, <italic>IL15</italic>, <italic>GM-CSF</italic>, <italic>TNFB</italic>, and <italic>CCL22</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsuoka and Jeang, 2011b</xref>). While these effects may contribute to the persistence and replication of the virus, and to the risk of the inflammatory and malignant diseases associated with HTLV-1, the effects are not clone-specific. The present results show that, in addition to these generic effects, HTLV-1 has the potential to disrupt host gene expression in cis at both contiguous and non-contiguous sites. Since the virus infects between 10<sup>4</sup> and 10<sup>5</sup> different clones of T cells in a typical host, each carrying the provirus at a different genomic location, we conclude that the virus deregulates tens of thousands of host genes in a typical infected host.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture, preparation</title><p>The HTLV-1-infected T-lymphocyte clones were derived by limiting dilution from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of donors attending the National Centre for Human Retrovirology (NCHR) at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, St Mary's Hospital, London.

The sequencing primer was situated in the viewpoint (NlaIII fragment), terminating four bases upstream of the 3′ NlaIII restriction site. These four bases as well as the NlaIII restriction site were used as a filter to ensure sequence specificity, and were subsequently trimmed from the 5′ end of the sequence in the first read of each pair using cutadapt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martin, 2011</xref>).

In order to avoid misalignments due to composite reads (containing NlaIII fragments from multiple contacts), in silico digestion at NlaIII binding sites (CATG) was performed on the reads. ‘Digested’ Fastq files were subsequently aligned (as single reads) against a merged reference of the human genome (hg19 assembly) and the HTLV-1 genome (accession number AB513134). For each read, only the first digested NlaIII fragment was used for subsequent analysis unless the first fragment was the one directly following the viewpoint (incomplete digestion) in which case the second fragment was used. Successfully aligned pairs were filtered to remove barcode errors, and only pairs where both read 1 and read two mapped to the same chromosome in convergent orientation were kept. Unique read1-read2 pairs were considered a ligation event: the shear site serves as a unique molecular identifier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gillet et al., 2011</xref>); that is, it identifies a ligation event in a single cell. The number of unique ligation events was then quantified at each ligation site (virus-host genome contact site). At least two biological replicates were analysed from each clone.

Sequence data were trimmed to remove adapters and low-quality bases using TrimGalore, and aligned against the same combined reference (human + viral genomes) as above, using GSNAP. Duplicates were removed using Picard v.2.9.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard">http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard</ext-link>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_006525">SCR_006525</ext-link>)) and peaks were called against the DNA input control using MACS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), and data from the best replicate (highest number of peaks identified) of each clone were used in downstream analysis. CTCF-BS identified in at least two of the clones examined were used in further analysis. The orientation of CTCF motifs within identified CTCF ChIP peaks was determined using PWMtools PWMscan (Ambrosini G., PWMTools, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ccg.vital-it.ch/pwmtools">http://ccg.vital-it.ch/pwmtools</ext-link>) to call the orientation of the highest scoring motif. The orientation of ~79% of CTCF observed binding sites was determined in this way.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Whole-genome sequencing</title><p>Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from each subject’s PBMCs and the respective T cell clones using DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (QIAGEN). Whole-genome sequencing was carried out on PBMC DNA from each subject from whom clones were used in this study, with the exception of subject TBX; DNA from this subject’s clone TBX4B was sequenced because PBMC DNA was not available. DNA sequencing was performed on the Ilumina X10 platform, one sample per lane. Alignment against the same combined reference (human + viral genomes) was done using BWA-MEM v0.5.9 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_010910">SCR_010910</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>), and duplicates were removed using Picard. Base calibration (against known dbsnp_135.hg19) and SNP calling for all samples was done using Genome Analyser ToolKit (GATK; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001876">SCR_001876</ext-link>) v3.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DePristo et al., 2011</xref>). Pre-processing, variant discovery and calling followed GATK best practices workflow 3.6. The variant list was filtered to select biallelic variants using GATK SelectVariants and reads per allele were counted by GATK ASEReadCounter, using minimum mapping quality 10, minimum base quality two and minimum depth 10. The B-allele frequency (BAF) of each SNP was calculated as the allele count of alternative base/sum of allele counts of reference and alternative bases. SNPs were defined as heterozygous if the B allele frequency (BAF) was between 0.15 and 0.85.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Haplotype analysis</title><p>Read-aware phasing into haplotypes was performed using SHAPIT v2.r837 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delaneau et al., 2013</xref>) which extracts phase-informative reads and assembles them into haplotypes using data modelled on the data from the 1000 Genome Project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/1000GP_Phase3.html">https://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/1000GP_Phase3.html</ext-link>). RNASeq data were aligned to the combined reference using GSNAP (a variant-aware aligner, known to reduce reference bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DePristo et al., 2011</xref>]); duplicates were removed using Picard and the alleles counted for each biallelic variant using GATK ASEReadCounter, using a minimum mapping quality of 10 and minimum base quality of 2. Allelic imbalance (AI) in q4C and RNA-seq data was calculated by the formula AI = abs(0.5 – BAF); AI ranges between 0 (biallelic) and 0.5 (monoallelic expression).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistics</title><p>Nonparametric tests were used to examine the association between the number of CTCF-BS and the q4C peak height (Wilcoxon) and the number of q4C peaks (Spearman). The difference in the frequency of q4C peaks at a given distance from the provirus was tested using a chi-squared goodness of fit test. The correlation between the number of q4C peaks and the density of CTCF-BS was examined using Pearson’s test. The curves showing the relationship between allelic imbalance and genomic distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) were computed using LOESS regression.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Data availability</title><p>Sequence data have been deposited at the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/</ext-link>), hosted by the European Bioinformatics Institute (accession number EGAS00001002259).

In q4C, we modified the 4C protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krijger and de Laat, 2016</xref>) by applying the approach used in our previously described linker-mediated (LM)-PCR protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gillet et al., 2011</xref>) for identifying and quantifying proviral integration sites. In q4C, instead of the secondary restriction enzyme, sonication is used to process DNA circles. Linkers with a 6 bp specific tag was added to sonicated DNA. The end of the VP and a fragment of genomic DNA were amplified by LM-PCR. In this example, three ligation events occurred between the VP (red) and a genomic region (green) at the ligation site I and one event at the ligation site II (yellow). Because the DNA shear site is (approximately) random, the amplicon from each cell has a different shear site. The abundance of ligation events at each respective ligation site is quantified by counting the number of different shear sites.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="octet-stream" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-36245-supp2-v1.pptx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36245.029</object-id><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>q4C data analysis steps.</title><p>Summary of main steps in the analysis steps of q4C data.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wenhui Li as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>I apologize for the delay, but I am pleased to tell you that I have now obtained thoughtful reviews, and all of the reviewers were positive about your manuscript. Both reviewers had suggestions that I believe will strengthen the message of your manuscript. I believe that appropriate responses can be provided without any further experimentation. Please respond to each of the reviewers comments in an itemized response letter, along with a revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors have studied how the presence of a binding site for the chromatin architectural protein CTCF within the HTLV-1 provirus affects chromatin loops within the host cell nucleus. Using an elegant adaptation of the circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) technique, they identify chromosomal regions that form loops with the CTCF binding region of the provirus. The loops are shown to form in cis and not in trans and to alter transcription of host genes near the integration site and distant sites within a loop.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting and well performed study. The manuscript could be improved by considering the following points:</p><p>1) The results clearly show that the CTCF binding site in the viral genome can participate in looping with cis host genomic elements, but whether this alters host genomic looping as the authors suggest is less clear. Can the authors define the loop patterns that would be present in the region of the integration site when no provirus is present?</p><p>2) It would be helpful to provide a schematic of the authors' modifications to the 4C method.</p><p>3) How have the quantitative aspects of this method been validated?</p><p>4) The altered chromosomal looping and consequent effects on host gene transcription will be different in each clone with a different integration site. Overall, it is not clear how this affects HTLV-1 persistence or oncogenic potential. Some discussion of these points would strengthen the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>It has been known for many years that insertional activation (or, rarely, inactivation) of gene expression is the principal mechanism by which they cause cancer, a fact which enabled scientists to identify and study in simple animal models, genes which turned out to be of central importance to human cancer. HTLV has always been a somewhat embarrassing exception; in only a few cases has oncogenic disruption of genes near the site of integration. The elegant study by Melamed et al., submitted to <italic>eLife</italic>, promises to provide an answer to this quandary, and to significantly advance our understanding of important aspects of the HTLV-host interaction.</p><p>Using a panel of 10 clonal HTLV-infected cell lines, from infected patients, each with a single provirus, the authors developed and used a novel DNEA looping assay to show that proviral sequences, which contain a CTCF binding site can be brought into juxtaposition with regions of neighboring chromosomal DNA up to as many as 4 Mbp away, and that this looping, by bringing viral enhancer elements near cellular promoters, can affect the transcription of genes on the same chromosome, but at a considerable distance, providing a likely explanation of why, in most cases, classical oncogene activation patterns of adjacent genes are not seen in HTLV-induced lymphoma, even if the underlying mechanism might be almost the same.</p><p>All in all, I found this to be a well-written and convincing study, certainly worthy of publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. My comments are mostly just points that might benefit from further discussion.</p><p>1) Although the primary observations seem quite compelling, the authors seem to tiptoe around the role of chromosomal looping in oncogene activation. There must be additional evidence in support of such a model that they can cite, such as the existence of oncogenic cell lines with aberrant expression of known oncogenes within a few Mbp of an HTLV-1 provirus. The focus of this study on non oncogenic lines makes it seem like they are splitting off an important part of the story.</p><p>2) It seems highly unlikely that the CTCF binding site is in the provirus by accident. Some discussion – even speculation – to this point would be very welcome.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36245.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] Overall, this is an interesting and well performed study.

However, the appropriate method to use to systematically map the loop patterns in the normal genome is HiC, which in principle identifies loops (albeit with limited sensitivity) between any two genomic regions (‘all to all’ mapping), whereas 4C identifies loops made between a defined ‘viewpoint’ and all other regions (‘one to all’ mapping). It is outside the scope of this study to carry out HiC analysis in addition to the 4C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It would be helpful to provide a schematic of the authors' modifications to the 4C method.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have made a schematic diagram to compare conventional 4C and our modified version, q4C, and this is included as Supplementary file 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) How have the quantitative aspects of this method been validated?</p></disp-quote><p>Quantification of chromatin looping. 4C (and indeed other ‘C techniques’) gives relative quantification of chromatin looping: in the absence of single-cell 4C – which no-one has yet developed – absolute quantification of loop frequency is not yet possible. Therefore, validation of the (relative) loop frequency depends primarily on the reproducibility of peak identification in independent biological replicate experiments, as we report in the present Results. The improvement in quantification introduced by the use of sonication instead of restriction enzyme digestion was demonstrated in our high-throughput analysis of retroviral integration sites (Blood 2011: 117, 3113; Bioinformatics 2012: 28, 755; et seq.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The altered chromosomal looping and consequent effects on host gene transcription will be different in each clone with a different integration site. Overall, it is not clear how this affects HTLV-1 persistence or oncogenic potential. Some discussion of these points would strengthen the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>The impact of the provirus on chromatin looping and host transcription is indeed clone-specific. Because of the great clonal diversity of HTLV-1-infected cells in each host, identifying the impact of altered chromatin looping on HTLV-1 persistence or oncogenic potential will depend largely on bioinformatic analysis: in particular, to compare the association between CTCF binding sites and proviral integration sites between clones infected in vitro – in the absence of in vivo selection – and those that persist in vivo, and between malignant infected (ATL) clones and non-malignant clones. We are now embarking on this analysis. To emphasize the point raised by the reviewer, we have added the following sentence to the Discussion section:</p><p>“The altered chromosomal looping and consequent effects on host genome transcription depend on the proviral integration site, and so differ in each infected T-cell clone. Further work is needed to investigate the impact of altered looping and transcription on the persistence, infectivity and oncogenic potential of the infected T-cell clones.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] All in all, I found this to be a well-written and convincing study, certainly worthy of publication in eLife. My comments are mostly just points that might benefit from further discussion.</p><p>1) Although the primary observations seem quite compelling, the authors seem to tiptoe around the role of chromosomal looping in oncogene activation.

This is of course a very important point. However, the chief aim of the present paper was to show that insertional mutagenesis – both local and at distant sites – is a general feature of HTLV-1 infection, and yet does not usually cause oncogenic transformation. We now plan to apply the techniques reported here to analyse chromatin looping and host transcription in cases of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. In this planned study, we will focus on primary cells from ATL cases, rather than long-term in vitro cell lines, because ATL clones are notoriously difficult to propagate in vitro, so the relationship between such in vitro cell lines and primary ATL clones is at best uncertain. See also the response to reviewer 1, point 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It seems highly unlikely that the CTCF binding site is in the provirus by accident. Some discussion – even speculation – to this point would be very welcome.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer’s implication that CTCF binding must confer some benefit on HTLV-1. However, this has proved a very difficult problem. To clarify the point, as the reviewer suggests, we have added the following short paragraph to the Discussion:</p><p>“We postulate that CTCF confers a survival or replication advantage to HTLV-1, because of the high degree of sequence conservation of the proviral CTCF binding site and the coincidence of the binding site with a border of epigenetic modifications associated with transcriptional activity [Satou et al., 2016]. However, the nature and mechanism of this putative advantage are not yet known.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
