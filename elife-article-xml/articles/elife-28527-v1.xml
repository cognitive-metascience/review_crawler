fully understood. We found that neurosecretory protein GL (NPGL), a newly-identified neuropeptide, increased food intake and white adipose tissue (WAT) in rats. NPGL-precursor gene overexpression in the hypothalamus caused increases in food intake, WAT, body mass, and circulating insulin when fed a high calorie diet. Intracerebroventricular administration of NPGL induced de novo lipogenesis in WAT, increased insulin, and it selectively induced carbohydrate intake. Neutralizing antibody administration decreased the size of lipid droplets in WAT. <italic>Npgl</italic> mRNA expression was upregulated by fasting and low insulin levels. Additionally, NPGL-producing cells were responsive to insulin. These results point to NPGL as a novel neuronal regulator that drives food intake and fat deposition through de novo lipogenesis and acts to maintain steady-state fat level in concert with insulin. Dysregulation of NPGL may be a root cause of obesity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.28527.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28527.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28527.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Throughout history, our ancestors needed to accumulate fat to survive during times when food sources were scarce. However, for most people in the modern age, food is abundant and eating too much is a major cause of weight gain, obesity and diseases affecting the metabolism. Obesity in particular, can lead to diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.</p><p>Hunger and appetite are regulated by proteins and other chemicals that act as messengers, for example insulin, and a region of the brain called the hypothalamus. However, the full mechanisms that regulate these sensations remain unclear. Only recently, a protein called NPGL was discovered in a part of the hypothalamus of birds and mammals. However, it was not known if NPGL plays a role in regulating eating habits and weight gain.</p><p>Iwakoshi-Ukena et al. have now discovered that NPGL is found in the hypothalamus of rats and is regulated by diet and insulin. When the gene for NPGL was manipulated to produce too much of the protein, rats fed a high calorie diet started to eat more, and gained more weight and body fat. Adding additional NPGL to their brains had the same effect. When the animals were fed a normal diet, NPGL only moderately affected how much they ate, but it substantially increased how much fat they produced. Iwakoshi-Ukena et al. also observed that when animals were starved and insulin levels were low, the rats started to produce more NPGL. These results suggest that NPGL plays a role in fat storage when energy sources are limited, and can contribute to obesity when too much NPGL is produced in animals on a high calorie diet.</p><p>These findings indicate that NPGL could be an additional brain chemical that regulates hunger and fat storage in mammals. A next step will be to reveal the specific mechanisms by which NPGL regulates overeating and fat accumulation. These findings will further advance the study and treatment of obesity and obesity-related diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

result in obesity and lead to serious health problems such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Steinberger and Daniels, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hill et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahima and Lazar, 2013</xref>). Thus, it is important for human health to gain insight into the physiological mechanisms underlying the regulation of obesity. As obesity results mainly from overfeeding, most research to date has focused on hypothalamic regulation of feeding and satiety. Several hypothalamic neuropeptides and peripheral factors influence food intake and body mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schwartz and Porte, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Morton et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2014</xref>). For instance, the arcuate nucleus (Arc) of the hypothalamus produces neuropeptide Y (NPY)/agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), which are potent orexigenic and anorexigenic factors, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schwartz and Porte, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Morton et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2014</xref>). In addition, leptin and insulin derived from peripheral tissues act on the hypothalamus to influence energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baskin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Varela and Horvath, 2012</xref>). Precise hypothalamic control of energy balance affects puberty, thermoregulation, energy storage, survival, and other critical processes during different life-history stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schneider et al., 2013</xref>). Prior to the last decade, several bioactive peptides in the brain were discovered: neuromedin S, TLQP-21, nesfatin-1, and neuroendocrine regulatory peptide (NERP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mori et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartolomucci et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Oh-I et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yamaguchi et al., 2007</xref>). These neuropeptides are also involved in energy homeostasis and feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ida et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartolomucci et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Oh-I et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Toshinai et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, nonadecaneuropeptide derived from Acyl-CoA binding domain-containing seven was found to be a novel anorexigenic factor in the mouse hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lanfray et al., 2016</xref>). Despite considerable progress in understanding the regulation of energy homeostasis over the last several decades, the neural control of hyperphagia or obesity is not completely understood. To further understand the mechanism regulating energy intake and/or storage, we sought to identify previously unknown bioactive substances in the hypothalamus that regulate energy metabolism.</p><p>As part of our search for novel neuropeptides and/or peptide hormone precursors in the hypothalamus, we identified a novel cDNA in the chicken hypothalamus and deduced a precursor protein including a secretory protein of 80 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ukena et al., 2014</xref>). This small protein has Gly-Leu-NH<sub>2</sub> at its C-terminal and was named neurosecretory protein GL (NPGL). In chickens, subcutaneous infusion of NPGL increased body mass gain, suggesting that NPGL may be involved in growth processes, including energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ukena et al., 2014</xref>). Subsequently, we found homologous <italic>Npgl</italic> genes in mammals, including human, rat, and mouse; the primary structure of NPGL is highly conserved among mammals and avian species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Rat NPGL assumes a circular structure, although the mature structure has not been determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Given the effects of NPGL administration observed in chickens, along with the highly conserved nature of this gene across species, we hypothesized that NPGL and its precursor serve a prominent, unexplored role in energy homeostasis in mammals. More recently, we found that NPGL could induce food intake in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Matsuura et al., 2017</xref>). However, the physiological significance of NPGL in metabolic control in mammals remains to be elucidated.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28527.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure of NPGL and expression of NPGL in rats.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The amino acid structure of NPGL is shown schematically.

To accomplish this goal, we first examined the pattern of expression in the brain and peripheral tissues, along with the specific localization and distribution of NPGL-producing cells in the brain. Subsequently, we investigated the biological action of NPGL and its precursor by overexpression of the precursor gene for <italic>Npgl</italic> in the hypothalamus, and intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of NPGL or a specific antibody directed against this protein. We further examined the effects of NPGL on food intake, blood chemistry, and body composition when animals were fed normal chow, high calorie diet, or macronutrient diet. Finally, we determined that NPGL plays a role in monitoring energetic status and appropriate adjustment of feeding and energy metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression of <italic>Npgl</italic> mRNA and NPGL in the hypothalamus</title><p>First, we examined the expression of <italic>Npgl</italic> mRNA in the brain and various peripheral tissues in human, rat, and mouse.

To elucidate these possibilities, we analyzed the expression levels of lipogenic and lipolytic enzyme mRNAs in retroperitoneal WAT (rWAT) and liver. Specifically, we chose acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FAS), stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 1 (GPAT1), and adiponutrin (ADPN) as lipogenic enzymes, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT1a), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) as lipolytic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shi and Burn, 2004</xref>).</p><p>We found that mRNA expression levels of <italic>Acc</italic>, <italic>Fas</italic>, <italic>Adpn</italic>, and <italic>Atgl</italic> in rWAT significantly increased after <italic>Npgl</italic> overexpression, but no differences were detected in liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

Furthermore, we found that mature NPGL is produced in restricted hypothalamic nuclei and specifically plays a major role in food intake and fat accumulation in rats. Obesity is a burgeoning health issue worldwide, and yet how the brain regulates hyperphagia or adiposity is unclear. Under a high calorie diet including high sucrose, NPGL stimulates feeding behavior and increases blood insulin. At this time, blood glucose levels are not different in control and NPGL-treated groups, suggesting that insulin resistance is not induced by NPGL. Therefore, it seems that NPGL stimulates carbohydrate intake and induces de novo lipogenesis because these phenomena occur readily under high carbohydrate conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Subsequently, NPGL stimulates more carbohydrate usage to provide the glucose substrate for lipogenesis, and finally accelerated carbohydrate intake increases blood insulin levels as an indirect action of NPGL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This step can recur to achieve fat accumulation in WAT efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). It is well known that insulin is an anabolic hormone, including its role in fat deposition in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dimitriadis et al., 2011</xref>). However, as revealed in the present experiments, administration of insulin inhibits the expression of <italic>Npgl</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This result suggests that excess de novo lipogenesis by NPGL may be inhibited through negative feedback action of insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Together, the present findings point to NPGL as a novel neuronal lipogenic factor that maintains steady levels of fat storage in harmony with insulin. However, the excess and prolonged action of NPGL under high calorie diet finally leads to obesity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In developing or developed countries, abdominal adiposity easily leads to obesity, which is associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Oliveros et al., 2014</xref>). The relationship between the action of human NPGL and its pathophysiological status has yet to be assessed, but the conserved nature of NPGL indicates that it is likely to play an important metabolic role in humans.</p><p>The present findings indicate that NPGL induces adiposity in WAT without remarkable changes in overall body mass in the experiments except for <italic>Npgl</italic> overexpression under high calorie diet. This increased fat accumulation, combined with no increase in muscle mass and body length, appears to explain the overall lack of body mass difference between the control and NPGL-treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>). Furthermore, this study shows that NPGL-mediated fat accumulation principally results from de novo lipogenesis in WAT but not in liver even when animals are fed normal chow and increases in food intake and blood insulin levels do not occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Indeed, the data from acute i.c.v. injection of NPGL show that NPGL can induce de novo lipogenesis in WAT rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). To our knowledge, our study is the first report on the presence of an endogenous hypothalamic mediator whose function is to control peripheral de novo lipogenesis independently of feeding behavior in animals. De novo lipogenesis is the biochemical process of converting non-lipid precursors into fatty acids for storage as energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Moore et al., 2014</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that de novo lipogenesis in WAT plays an important role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis, although de novo lipogenesis in non-adipose tissues including liver leads to ectopic lipid accumulation, lipotoxicity, and metabolic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lodhi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Solinas et al., 2015</xref>). In adipose tissues, glucose taken up via SLC2A4 (referred to as GLUT4) is converted into citrate via the glycolysis system and TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rui, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">TeSlaa and Teitell, 2014</xref>). Citrate is converted to palmitoleic acid by lipogenic enzymes including ACC, FAS and SCD1, and eventually stored as triglycerides via GPAT1 and ADPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shi and Burn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rui, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jeong et al., 2011</xref>). In addition to lipogenic enzymes, the mRNA expression of <italic>Atgl</italic>, a lipolytic enzyme, also increased in NPGL-treated rats in the cases of three different experiments of this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5I</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, the mRNA expression of <italic>Cd36</italic>, a fatty acid transporter, increased in WAT of NPGL-infused rats under macronutrient diets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Analyses using adipose tissue specific <italic>Atgl</italic> knockout mice and whole body <italic>Cd36</italic> knockout mice suggest that the fat oxidation system and fatty acid transport are required for de novo lipogenesis in adipose tissues and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mottillo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clugston et al., 2014</xref>). This result suggests that the activation of de novo lipogenesis by NPGL may be coupled with lipolysis to accelerate fat accumulation in WAT.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28527.019</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Potential role of NPGL in food intake and fat accumulation.</title><p>Downward blue and upward red arrows indicate ‘inhibition’ and ‘stimulation’, respectively and other-colored arrows demonstrate downstream events.

When food is readily available, NPGL stimulates carbohydrate intake and induces de novo lipogenesis using available carbohydrate.

This step can be repeated to achieve fat accumulation in WAT efficiently. Excess de novo lipogenesis by NPGL is inhibited through negative feedback actions of insulin to maintain steady-state fat storage in WAT.

It is well known that the expression of anabolic neuropeptides such as NPY and AgRP are upregulated under negative energy balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Morton et al., 2006</xref>). NPGL selectively stimulates carbohydrate intake during the light period when rats are not typically active or feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Circulating insulin levels are lower at this time than during the dark period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Marcheva et al., 2010</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest that a decrease in circulating insulin during a restricted feeding state such as fasting may induce the expression of <italic>Npgl</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This mechanism of NPGL induction may serve as a hunger signal to prepare for fat accumulation during a food available state.</p><p>NPGL-producing cells are located in the ArcLP and the VTM in the posterior hypothalamus. In addition, we detected NPGL-immunoreactive fibers in the anterior Arc where NPY/AgRP- or α-MSH-producing cells are located. More recently, we found that NPGL innervated α-MSH-producing cells and the acute i.c.v. injection of NPGL stimulated feeding behavior in mice fed with normal chow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Matsuura et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, NPGL may regulate the transcription or activity of these well-known orexigenic or anorexigenic factors to modulate energy homeostasis involved in food intake and fat accumulation in rats. In the present study, chronic i.c.v. infusion of NPGL did not increase food intake in rats fed normal chow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), whereas a single injection of a lower dose of NPGL has been shown to increase food intake in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Matsuura et al., 2017</xref>). The reason for this discrepancy is unclear and future studies in which rats and mice are investigated under identical conditions are needed to clarify whether differences exist between species in the role played by this neuropeptide. Furthermore, the VTM is known as the origin of histaminergic neurons, and neuronal histamine is also an anorexigenic and anti-obesity factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Haas and Panula, 2003</xref>). Thus, it is possible that NPGL-expressing cells interact with histamine neurons to regulate fat accumulation. NPGL-immunoreactive fibers were also detected around the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH) and ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and J</xref>). These regions also participate in energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schwartz and Porte, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Morton et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, it has been demonstrated that lipogenesis and lipolysis in WAT are regulated in the mediobasal hypothalamus through the sympathetic nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buettner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scherer et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that NPGL may participate in the sympathetic regulation of adiposity. Future studies are necessary to identify the target sites and neuronal networks concerning NPGL-producing neurons.</p><p>In conclusion, the present data reveal novel molecular and functional relationships among the hypothalamus, insulin action, and peripheral adiposity and elucidate a previously unknown role for NPGL in energy homeostasis. Together, these findings reveal a novel neurochemical gateway where signals from the brain and periphery converge to monitor energetic status and adjust feeding and metabolism appropriately. The cognate receptor for NPGL has not yet been identified. The identification of the receptor will help to elucidate the mechanisms of NPGL activity in the mammalian brain. However, the present data bring to light an important role for NPGL in regulation of food intake, body mass, and onset of obesity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Male Wistar rats (7 weeks old) were purchased from a commercial company (Kyudo, Saga, Japan) and housed for one week at 23 ± 2°C under a 12:12 hr light–dark cycle with <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to tap water and normal chow (CE-2; CLEA Japan, Tokyo, Japan).

For rWAT analysis, two regions were randomly selected from each slide and diameters of approximately 100–250 adipocytes were obtained by averaging the largest and smallest diameters. Two independent investigators who were blind to the groups performed all analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Indirect calorimetry and locomotor activity</title><p>Four weeks after injecting AAV-based vectors, indirect calorimetry was performed using an O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> metabolism-measuring system for small animals (MK-5000RQ; Muromachi Kikai, Tokyo, Japan). The system monitored VO<sub>2</sub> (ml/min) and VCO<sub>2</sub> (ml/min) at 3 min intervals and calculated the respiratory quotient (RQ) ratio (VCO<sub>2</sub>/VO<sub>2</sub>). Locomotor activity was simultaneously measured using the SuperMex infrared ray passive sensor system (Muromachi Kikai). Measurements were collected hourly over a 23 hr period (light period: 10:00–21:00, dark period: 21:00–9:00) after habituation for 30 min. Energy expenditure was calculated using the following equation: energy expenditure (cal/kg/hr) = VO<sub>2</sub> (ml/kg/hr) × [3.815 + (1.232 × RQ)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lusk, 1928</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Fatty acid analysis</title><p>For the analysis of endogenous SCD1 activity in rWAT, the lipids were extracted according to the previous method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Folch et al., 1957</xref>). WAT (100 mg) was extracted with 1 ml of chloroform: methanol (2:1) using beads crusher (μT-12; TAITEC, Saitama, Japan) and 0.25 ml of distilled water was added and mixed by inversion. After incubation for 30 min, the sample was centrifuged at 3000 × g and the lower organic phase was collected and evaporated. Extracted fatty acids were methylated using Fatty Acid Methylation Kit (nacalai tesque, Kyoto, Japan) and purified using Fatty Acid Methyl Ester Purification Kit (nacalai tesque). The eluted solution was evaporated to dryness and kept at –20°C. The residues were resolved into hexane and fatty acids were identified by GC-MS (JMS-T100 GCV; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The SCD1 activity was estimated as oleate to stearate ratio (18:1/18:0) and palmitoleate to palmitate ratio (16:1/16:0) from individual fatty acids. The 16:1/16:0 ratio seems to be a better indicator of endogenous SCD1 activity than the 18:1/18:0 ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sampath and Ntambi, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Blood tests</title><p>Serum levels of glucose, lipids, and hormones were measured using appropriate equipment, reagents, and kits. The GLUCOCARD G+ meter was used to measure glucose content (Arkray, Kyoto, Japan). The NEFA C-Test Wako (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) was used to measure free fatty acid levels. The Triglyceride E-Test Wako (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) was used to measure triglyceride levels and the Cholesterol E-Test Wako (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) for cholesterol content. The Rebis Insulin-rat T ELISA kit (Shibayagi, Gunma, Japan) was used to measure insulin levels, the Leptin ELISA kit (Morinaga Institute of Biological Science, Yokohama, Japan) for leptin, and the Corticosterone ELISA kit (Assaypro, St. Charles, MO) for corticosterone.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Richard D Palmiter (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Serge Luquet (Reviewer #2); Don Marsh (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors of this paper provide initial characterization of a newly discovered neuropeptide that they call NPGL. It is expressed in a small number of neurons in the arcuate region of the hypothalamus and is modestly regulated by diet and insulin. Chronic expression (from a virus) or infusion (icv) of NPGL has a modest effect on food intake and body weight when rats are fed a high-fat diet but has minimal effect when fed normal chow. However, even without large effects on food intake there are significant effects on adipocyte physiology. The authors suggest that this neuropeptide plays a role in fat storage during times of energy restriction and contributes to obesity when over-expressed in animals on a high-fat diet.</p><p>The findings described in this manuscript are novel and will be of significant interest to scientists and physicians studying/working in the field of metabolic disorders. We have no major concerns with this paper and support its publication as an original article in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Minor Comments):</italic></p><p>Introduction, first paragraph – most of these general references are more than 10 years out of date.</p><p>Introduction, second paragraph – when referring to genes, gene names should be in italics.
