The activation of WASP constitutes a key pathway for actin filament nucleation. Yet, when WASP function is eliminated there is negligible effect on actin polymerization at the immunological synapse, leading to gaps in our understanding of the events connecting WASP and calcium ion signaling. Here, we identify a fraction of total synaptic F-actin selectively generated by WASP in the form of distinct F-actin ‘foci’. These foci are polymerized de novo as a result of the T cell receptor (TCR) proximal tyrosine kinase cascade, and facilitate distal signaling events including PLCγ1 activation and subsequent cytoplasmic calcium ion elevation. We conclude that WASP generates a dynamic F-actin architecture in the context of the immunological synapse, which then amplifies the downstream signals required for an optimal immune response.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04953.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04953.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04953.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The immune system is made up of several types of cells that protect the body against infection and disease. Immune cells such as T cells survey the body and when receptors on their surface encounter infected cells, the receptors activate the T cell by triggering a signaling pathway.</p><p>The early stages of T cell receptor signaling lead to the formation of a cell–cell contact zone called the immunological synapse. Filaments of a protein called F-actin—which are continuously assembled and taken apart—make versatile networks and help the immunological synapse to form. F-actin filaments have crucial roles in the later stages of T cell receptor signaling as well, but how they contribute to this is not clear. Whether it is the same F-actin network that participates both in synapse formation and the late stages of T cell receptor signaling, and if so, then by what mechanism, remains unknown.</p><p>The answers came from examining the function of a protein named Wiscott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP), which forms an F-actin network at the synapse. Loss of WASP is known to result in the X-linked Wiscott-Aldrich Syndrome immunodeficiency and bleeding disorder in humans. Although T cells missing WASP can construct immunological synapses, and these synapses do have normal levels of F-actin and early T cell receptor signaling, they still fail to respond to infected cells properly.</p><p>Kumari et al. analyzed the detailed structure and dynamics of actin filament networks at immunological synapses of normal and WASP-deficient T cells. Normally, cells had visible foci of newly polymerized F-actin directly above T cell receptor clusters in the immunological synapses, but these foci were not seen in the cells lacking WASP. Kumari et al. found that the F-actin foci facilitate the later stages of the signaling that activates the T cells; this signaling was lacking in WASP-deficient cells.</p><p>Altogether, Kumari et al. show that WASP-generated F-actin foci at immunological synapses bridge the early and later stages of T cell receptor signaling, effectively generating an optimal immune response against infected cells. Further work will now be needed to understand whether there are other F-actin substructures that play specialized roles in T cell signaling, and if foci play a related role in other cell types known to be affected in Wiscott-Aldrich Syndrome immunodeficiency.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04953.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04953.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>T cell receptor signaling</kwd><kwd>actin polymerization</kwd><kwd>immunological synapse</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37AI043542</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dustin</surname><given-names>Michael L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI65644</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burkhardt</surname><given-names>Janis K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI088377 718</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kam</surname><given-names>Lance C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH common fund- Nanomedicine Development Center (PN2EY016586)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dustin</surname><given-names>Michael L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000884</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kumari</surname><given-names>Sudha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100003185</institution-id><institution>National Psoriasis Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Annual grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dustin</surname><given-names>Michael L</given-names></name><name><surname>Kumari</surname><given-names>Sudha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006962</institution-id><institution>New York University Langone Medical Center </institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NYUMC microscopy core</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dustin</surname><given-names>Michael L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>T cell receptor signaling is regulated by newly polymerized F-actin foci at the immunological synapse.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Upon encountering antigen-presenting cells (APCs) displaying T cell receptor (TCR) ligands and adhesion molecules, T cells undergo a series of actin dependent shape changes and signaling steps. These ligands include MHC complexed with antigentic peptide (MHCp) for mouse monoclonal T cells, agonist anti-CD3 antibody for polyclonal mouse (2C11) or human (OKT3) T cells. All of these ligands when presented with ICAM1 in supported lipid bilayers (SLB) trigger a series of changes in T cell synaptic cytoskeleton and morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kaizuka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burkhardt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ilani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beemiller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kumari et al., 2012</xref>). First, TCR signaling is initiated at F-actin-based protrusions of polarized T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Valitutti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Negulescu et al., 1996</xref>). Next, these early activation events lead to F-actin dependent formation of a broad immunological synapse (IS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wülfing and Davis, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grakoui et al., 1999</xref>) containing T cell antigen receptor (TCR) microclusters (MCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bunnell et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campi et al., 2005</xref>). Synapse spreading is followed by myosin II dependent contraction to form supramolecular activation clusters (SMACs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Monks et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Griffiths et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ilani et al., 2009</xref>). TCR MCs form in the outer lamellipodia-like ‘distal’ (d)SMAC, after which signaling MCs move centripetally through the lamella like ‘peripheral’ (p)SMAC, driven by centripetal flow of F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ponti et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Varma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">DeMond et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vardhana et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kumari et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yi et al., 2012</xref>) to eventually reach the ‘central’ (c)SMAC. The cSMAC is an F-actin depleted zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stinchcombe et al., 2006</xref>), in which TCR is destined for down-regulation via extracellular vesicle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vardhana et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Choudhuri et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Actin polymerization and remodeling continues throughout the lifetime of the immunological synapse, and studies using a variety of T cell activation systems have identified a critical requirement for F-actin and its molecular effectors in optimal TCR signaling and T cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Valitutti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Holsinger et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Snapper et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burkhardt et al., 2008</xref>). Pharmacological disruption of global F-actin or genetic manipulations that reduce synaptic F-actin polymerization result in defects in early signaling events such as cell adhesion, TCR MC formation, early TCR signaling, TCR MC transport, as well as the TCR-distal events including intracellular calcium rise, and store operated calcium ion entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DeBell et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Valitutti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nolz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Varma et al., 2006</xref>). Since global actin perturbation impairs all the above steps, it has been a challenge to dissect the mechanistic role of F-actin in TCR signaling and to identify whether there exist functionally distinct F-actin networks within SMACs that may play distinct roles at various stages of the pathway.</p><p>One way to investigate functional diversity within the subsynaptic F-actin network, during TCR signaling, is to utilize actin perturbations that dissociate early TCR signaling from late TCR signaling. One such context is provided by the loss of an actin effector protein—Wiscott Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP). F-actin polymerization relies on regulatory factors such as nucleation promoting factors (NPFs) and downstream nucleation factors such as Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanchoin et al., 2000</xref>). WASP is a hematopoietic-cell-specific NPF activated downstream of TCR, originally identified as a target of loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked immunodeficiency Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Derry et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Machesky and Insall, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Takenawa and Miki, 2001</xref>). WAS T cells exhibit a variety of T cell activation defects such as aberrant synapse morphology, impaired proliferation in response to TCR-activation stimuli, and impaired calcium ion signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Molina et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cianferoni et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calvez et al., 2011</xref>). Similar to WAS patients, T cells from <italic>Was−/−</italic> mice also display profound defects in antigen receptor-induced proliferation, IS stability, nuclear NFAT translocation and IL-2 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Snapper et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cannon and Burkhardt, 2004</xref>).

Despite many years of study, the F-actin network to which WASP contributes, and the specific TCR-signaling steps in which it participates to regulate calcium signaling, remain unknown.</p><p>How might WASP regulate T cell calcium ion responses without affecting total synaptic F-actin? As an NPF, WASP binds to Arp2/3 and G-actin, increasing the ability of Arp2/3 to nucleate actin branches from existing filaments. Moreover, WASP binds hematopoietic lineage cell-specific protein 1 (HS1) through its SH3 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dehring et al., 2011</xref>). HS1 is also activated in response to TCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Taniuchi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gomez et al., 2006</xref>) and can weakly activate Arp2/3 complex, as well as stabilize branched F-actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Weaver et al., 2001</xref>). HS1 deficient T cells show defects similar to WASP−/− T cells in TCR activation dependent calcium elevation, proliferation, IL-2 secretion and NFAT activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Taniuchi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hutchcroft et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gomez et al., 2006</xref>). It is therefore possible that a previously uncharacterized subclass of the synaptic F-actin network at the TCR MC that represent a small fraction of total synaptic F-actin, is generated by WASP and stabilized by HS1, supports calcium signaling. Alternatively, it has also been proposed that WASP is a modular scaffolding protein capable of interacting with other proteins of the TCR signalosome, independent of its role as an NPF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang et al., 2005</xref>). Although these two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, an F-actin dependent role could be addressed by identifying the F-actin network in the immunological synapse to which WASP contributes, and independently targeting this network to investigate the role of the WASP-generated F-actin subpopulation in calcium signaling at the synapse. Thus, WASP can be utilized as a tool to probe for functionally distinct organizational categories of F-actin within the synapse.</p><p>The signaling cascade leading up to calcium ion elevation in response to TCR engagement has been studied in much detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braiman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mingueneau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sherman et al., 2011</xref>). TCR ligation triggers a molecular program that results in activation of phospholipase C-γ1 (PLCγ1), through phosphorylation on Y-783 by Itk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Park et al., 1991</xref>). Once it has been activated, phospho-PLCγ1 catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4,5 bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) to inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and diacylglycerol. IP<sub>3</sub> then acts as a second messenger and facilitates release of calcium ions from intracellular stores. Following TCR activation, PLCγ1 recruitment at the synapse is primarily mediated via binding to linker of activated T cells (LAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braiman et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, recent studies using Jurkat T cells and thymocytes have reported a role for the cortical cytoskeleton in both promoting and inhibiting PLCγ1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tan et al., 2014</xref>). Although PLCγ1 binds F-actin in biochemical assays, and loss of F-actin dynamics led to reduced PLCγ1 phosphorylation in Jurkat T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DeBell et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carrizosa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Patsoukis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babich et al., 2012</xref>), the dependence of PLCγ1 activation on WASP activity has not been tested in primary T cells. We hypothesize that WASP and HS1 generate an F-actin network that maintains phosphorylation of PLCγ1 at the synapse, accounting for their role in calcium ion elevation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carrizosa et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we tested these hypotheses by characterizing the F-actin microarchitecture at the immunological synapse that is selectively regulated by WASP, and evaluating its role in early signaling, HS1 and PLCγ1 dynamics, and calcium signaling at the immunological synapse. The results presented here identify and functionally characterize a WASP-dependent actin network at the immunological synapse that regulates phospho-PLCγ1 levels at TCR MC and calcium ion elevation in T cells. This network is visualized as F-actin foci that result from new F-actin actin polymerization at TCR MC. Disruption of these actin foci does not impair initial synapse formation or early TCR signaling. Importantly, disruption of the F-actin foci using a selective Arp2/3 complex inhibitor also spares early TCR signaling, but results in the same impairment in HS-1 and PLC-γ1 activation that has been observed in WASP deficient T cells. Defining a new F-actin network in the immunological synapse, and its molecular regulation, furthers our mechanistic understanding of the cytoskeletal regulation of T cell activation and its dysfunction in WAS pathology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>WASP generates F-actin foci in the immunological synapse</title><p>Utilizing a planar surface functionalized with anti-mouse CD3 antibody and ICAM1 as an antigen-presenting surface, we first compared the F-actin cytoskeleton in polyclonal primary CD4 T cells from either wild type (WT) or WASP deficient C57BL/6J mice at the early spreading stage of immunological synapse formation. To resolve dynamic F-actin networks, we employed a labeling strategy designed to highlight growing filament ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Furman et al., 2007</xref>). A 1 min pulse of Rhodamine-ATP-G-actin in live-permeabilized cells identified freshly incorporated subunits (Fresh F-actin), while subsequent fixation and Alexa488-phalloidin staining identified total F-actin. T cells synapses were visualized using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF) to selectively illuminate structures within 200 nm of the interface. WT T cells exhibited discrete F-actin rich features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, arrowheads). We refer to these structures as F-actin ‘foci’. To selectively extract and quantify F-actin foci from the lamellar actin background, we utilized a spatial frequency-filter based local background correction method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> graph, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2">Figure1—figure supplement 1A,2</xref>, ‘Materials and methods’). This foci extraction method is capable of reliably identifying foci on a variable background of lamellar F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Assessment of the amount of newly polymerized actin in foci vs surrounding lamellar areas using the above-mentioned labeling and quantification method revealed that the F-actin foci incorporate fresh actin subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This indicates that the foci are dynamically polymerizing structures, rather than sites where F-actin accumulates due to rearrangement of preexisting filaments. Furthermore, the polymerization rate of individual filaments (Fresh/Total ratio) is similar between foci and surrounding areas in WT T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that the foci result from preferential local nucleation, rather than enhanced polymerization rate of existing filaments. When compared at the whole synapse scale, overall synaptic F-actin levels, as well as the rate of actin polymerization were similar in WT and WASP−/− T cells, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cannon and Burkhardt, 2004</xref>). However, there was a significant reduction in F-actin foci in WASP−/− cell synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that dynamic F-actin foci are formed in a WASP dependent manner. The loss of foci in WASP−/− T cells is not due to non-specific developmental defects, since acute siRNA mediated knockdown of WASP in activated mouse CD4 T cells resulted in a similar phenotype to the WASP−/− T cells. No reduction in total F-actin and significant reductions in foci were observed in WASP siRNA transfected cells imaged on SLB with anti-CD3 and ICAM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This lack of effect on total F-actin in WASP deficient or depleted cells may be attributed to the fact that these foci contribute to &lt;10% of the total synaptic F-actin intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> top graph), or perhaps to a compensatory increase in the lamellar and lamellipodial actin when more ATP-G-actin is available for polymerization regulated by other NPFs such as WAVE2.

This ‘background image’ was then subtracted from the raw image to generate a high-pass filtered image where we could clearly visualize F-actin foci. The processed image was manually checked for co-localization of F-actin foci with the F-actin foci in the raw image. As shown in the ‘merge’ panel, the 50% rank filter was found to be most optimal for F-actin foci extraction, while the 25% filter overestimated and 75% filter underestimated the number of F-actin foci. The 50% rank filter corrected image was therefore used to quantify F-actin foci per cell, as indicated in the corresponding figure legends. In some experiments, this processing was also carried out for TCR and ICAM1 image, to estimate co-localization between F-actin foci and TCR MC. (<bold>B</bold>) Characterization of range of F-actin foci intensities to assess the efficacy of foci extraction method.

TIRF images of the T cell synapse were processed to extract F-actin foci as described above in (<bold>A</bold>). These foci were used to create a binary mask to outline the foci or total synaptic cell regions in either original raw images (upper graph) or background images (lower graph). Each graph shows the intensity distribution of individual pixels corresponding to foci or total synapse area, and the X-axis represents the binned pixel intensity, normalized to the mean synaptic F-actin intensity from each cell's raw image. The Y-axis represents the number of pixels in the foci or synapse area, normalized to either the total number of pixels in the synapse (‘/total number of pixels’ traces), or to only the total number of pixels in the foci area (‘/foci pixels’ trace). The data is represented as the mean number of pixels from 13 cells ±SEM. It is notable that the number of pixels encompassing foci regions is &lt;10% of total number of pixels (top left graph). Also note that in both raw and background images, the pixels in foci do not exclude the high-intensity range, suggesting that our foci identification method does not preclude foci in high intensity neighborhoods, and identifies higher intensity patches even in high background neighborhood.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04953.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04953.004</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-04953-fig1-figsupp1-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s2" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04953.005</object-id><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>Test of rank-filter based processing method for foci detection.</title><p>T cells purified from WT or <italic>Was−/−</italic> mice were incubated with anti-CD3/ICAM1 reconstituted lipid bilayers for 2 min and then stained with Alexa488-phalloidin.

NWASP (WASL) is a close homolog of WASP and is capable of compensating for WASP's function in T cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cotta-de-Almeida et al., 2007</xref>). However, primary CD4 T cells from <italic>Wasl−/−</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) formed immunological synapses with F-actin foci similar to T cells from WT mice. WAVE2 is required for immunological synapse formation itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nolz et al., 2006</xref>), thus we could not examine synaptic foci in WAVE2 deficient T cells. Instead, we determined the localization of NWASP and WAVE2 in the immunological synapse in order to gain further insight into their possible role in foci formation. Activation of T cells with anti-CD3 and ICAM1 recruited NWASP and WAVE2 to the IS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nolz et al., 2006</xref>), but the recruited proteins failed to co-localize with F-actin foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>, NWASP coloc. = 9.48% ± 0.76 n = 78; WAVE2 coloc. = 14.36% ± 1.25, n = 54). We were unable to identify suitable reagents for staining of endogenous WASP in the immunological synapse. These results demonstrate that NWASP does not contribute to F-actin foci and suggest that WAVE2 is unlikely to contribute directly to formation of F-actin foci.</p><p>In addition to WASP, deficiency of HS1, a cortactin-related NPF, also leads to reduced calcium ion signaling in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gomez et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, we examined the role of HS1 in generation of F-actin foci using T cells from WT and HS1−/− mice. F-actin foci formation was only marginally impaired in HS1−/− T cells, this reduction was modest compared to T cells from mice lacking both HS1 and WASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). A similar marginal reduction in F-actin foci intensity was obtained by siRNA-mediated knockdown of HS1 in activated mouse CD4 T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>). HS1 is phosphorylated on Y397 (phospho-HS1) during T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hutchcroft et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gomez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carrizosa et al., 2009</xref>). We next determined if this phosphorylation is WASP dependent. WT mouse CD4 T cells activated with anti-CD3 and ICAM1 displayed foci of phospho-HS1 in the synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref>). These phospho-HS1 foci were significantly reduced in WASP−/− or WASP−/− NWASP−/− CD4 T cells, but not in CD4 T cells from NWASP deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref>).

To eliminate the possibility that the lack of foci on TCR MC in the nascent cSMAC is a consequence of cell fixation methodology, we examined foci in live T cells by transfecting them with LifeAct-GFP, a peptide construct that selectively labels F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Riedl et al., 2008</xref>).

TCR signaling proceeds by accumulation of active Lck, as indicated by phosphorylation of the activation loop, in MCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campi et al., 2005</xref>). Consistent with this, phospho-SFK localized to F-actin foci associated MC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, inhibition of SFK phosphorylation using PP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Varma et al., 2006</xref>) significantly reduced the number of F-actin foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), indicating that TCR-driven SFK signaling is required for their formation.

TCR-induced Zap70 Y319 phosphorylation in MC and overall F-actin levels at the synapse were comparable between primary WT and WASP−/− cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

PLCγ1 is one of the key effector molecules regulating calcium ion flux downstream of TCR-activation, which mediates inositol-1,3,4-trisphosphate synthesis in the plasmamembrane, thereby facilitating calcium ion release from endoplasmic reticulum stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DeBell et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babich et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, there is evidence that PLCγ1 can bind to F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carrizosa et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore reasoned that F-actin foci may locally enrich PLCγ1 at the TCR MC, supporting PLCγ1 interaction with TCR signalosome effectors such as Itk and LAT, thereby promoting its phosphorylation and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braiman et al., 2006</xref>). We therefore assessed the role of WASP in PLCγ1 activation in WT and WASP−/− T cells. WASP−/− T cells exhibited significantly reduced phospho-PLCγ1 levels at the synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The reduction in phospho-PLCγ1 levels was not due to a general decrease in total PLCγ1 levels in the WASP−/− T cells, as the levels of total cellular PLCγ1 were comparable in WT and WASP−/− whole T cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

WASP is a scaffolding protein and interacts with a variety of proteins at MCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Thrasher and Burns, 2010</xref>). To distinguish between two possible roles of WASP, activating Arp2/3 complex to generate F-actin foci, or acting as a direct molecular scaffold, in the regulation of PLCγ1 activation at the synapse, we overexpressed mutant forms of human WASP, including an Arp2/3-activation deficient form (WASP Δ473–480 or WASPΔC) and SFK scaffolding deficient form (WASPY291F) in human CD4 T cells. WASP binds with Arp2/3 via its C-terminal verprolin-homology, central, acidic (VCA) domain, while a stretch of hydrophobic residues in the central domain is reported to facilitate Arp2/3 activation without affecting the binding of Arp2/3 to the acidic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Machesky and Insall, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Panchal et al., 2003</xref>). WASPΔC lacks this Arp2/3 activation sequence within the C-region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kato et al., 1999</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, schematic). Indeed, T cells expressing GFP-WASPΔC showed normal levels of Arp2/3 complex recruitment (data not shown), as well as total F-actin at the synapse, and synaptic recruitment of WASPΔC was comparable to WT WASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). However, WASPΔC expressing cells were severely defective in F-actin foci generation, as well as in PLCγ1 phosphorylation at the synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). This result indicates that WASP-dependent Arp2/3 activation is essential for foci genesis and activation of calcium ion signaling effector PLCγ1 at the synapse. Overexpression of WASP Y291F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dovas et al., 2009</xref>), a mutant form defective in phosphorylation dependent interaction with SH2 domain of SFKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Padrick and Rosen, 2010</xref>), had no effect on foci formation or PLCγ1 activation. This result suggests that WASP's scaffolding of SFKs via Y291 does not play a role in foci formation or PLCγ1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Together these results demonstrate a critical requirement of WASP's Arp2/3 activation and foci nucleation ability for PLCγ1 activation. Thus, decoupling of WASP's interactions in MC from the ability to activate the Arp2/3 complex, but not SFKs, results in a strong disruption of F-actin foci.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Arp2/3 complex polymerizes F-actin foci at TCR MCs</title><p>Next, we more directly addressed the role of Arp2/3 complex, which is known to nucleate actin filaments de novo downstream of WASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dominguez, 2010</xref>), in foci induction.

However, the high-resolution subsynaptic distribution of Arp2/3 complex at the primary T cell synapse remains unknown. We first assessed the association of Arp2/3 complex with TCR MCs.

Given the small size and large lamellar actin background at the primary T cell synapse as well as highly mobile nature of MCs, this analysis would be extremely challenging to perform in the bilayer system. Therefore, we activated T cells on micron-scale anti-CD3 dots adsorbed on a glass surface where the remaining space was coated with ICAM1 in an attempt to restrict TCR signaling to a known, micron scale location in an artificial immunological synapse. Due to their aforementioned performance in time-lapse studies after transfection, human CD4 T cells were utilized for LifeAct-GFP transfection and live imaging on anti-CD3 microdots. Incubation with the patterned surface triggered rapid actin polymerization at the anti-CD3 microdot, reflected in LifeAct-GFP accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>). This enrichment of LifeAct at the microdot was not due to the topography of the cell contact interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Owen et al., 2013</xref>), since a global membrane labeling dye, DiI, and integrin LFA1 were not enriched at these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Within 5 s of CK666 treatment, pre-existing LifeAct enrichment was lost from the microdot site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref> <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>) and fresh microdot contact events failed to elicit LifeAct-GFP enrichment in the presence of CK666 (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>). These data confirm that the TCR engagement sites dictate Arp2/3 complex-dependent F-actin foci formation at the synapse, de novo. Furthermore, ligand microdots can spatially pattern F-actin foci by predefining the sites of TCR engagement, and thus provide a suitable platform for spatially isolating TCR dependent mechanisms.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media5" mime-subtype="mov" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-04953-media5.mov"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04953.026</object-id><label>Video 5.</label><caption><title>Human CD4 T cells were transfected with LifeAct-GFP plasmid (green) and incubated with ICAM1-coated glass substrate with 1 µm anti-CD3 printed dots (red) on stage at 37°C and imaged live.</title><p>The play rate is 25 times faster than the acquisition rate.

In order to test whether the independent elimination of foci by perturbation of Arp2/3 complex would phenocopy this effect, we chose to deplete foci using CK666 and monitor the consequences of this treatment on early TCR signaling, PLCγ1 activation and subsequent calcium ion signaling. CK666 treatment, which resulted in severe inhibition of F-actin foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), did not diminish TCR-proximal activation events. While fewer T cells formed synapses after CK666 treatment (37% reduction), upon adhesion, F-actin dependent processes including formation of TCR MC and exclusion of CD45 phosphatase from MCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Varma et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), and the phosphorylation of Zap70 on Y319 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) proceeded normally in CK666-treated cells. In addition, other TCR-activation dependent signaling events leading to calcium flux, such as the phosphorylation of LAT on Y171 and SLP76 on Y145 were not altered in CK666-treated cells in comparison to control treated cells (data not shown). However, a severe defect was observed in the levels of TCR-induced PLCγ1 phosphorylation on Y783 after CK666 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>), where a drop was observed in both the number and intensity of phospho-PLCγ1 clusters at the synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Furthermore, while phospho-PLCγ1 localized with F-actin foci in control cells, treatment with CK666 led to loss of foci-associated phospho-PLCγ1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Upon attenuation of F-actin foci, total PLCγ1 levels were also reduced at the synapse, matching the decline in phospho-PLCγ1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) and indicating that the impaired levels of phospho-PLCγ1 at the whole cell level may be accounted for by the reduction in PLCγ1 enrichment at the TCR signalosome. When assaying signaling events downstream of PLCγ1 activation, such as TCR-induced calcium ion elevation in the cytoplasm and nuclear mobilization of NFAT1, CK666-treated cells showed significant reduction in these processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref>). Although a reduction in lamellipodial and lamellar actin was observed in CK666 treated cells (mean total F-actin 42% reduced), this reduction was relatively lower than foci depletion (mean 67% reduced) or under global F-actin depletion (CytoD, mean F-actin 90% reduced), and did not affect early TCR signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We thus conclude that WASP and Arp2/3 dependent foci play a non-redundant role in PLCγ1 activation and calcium ion signaling at the synapse. In line with this result, CK666-treated cells exhibited a loss of phospho-HS1, as well as HS1, at the synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>), similar to that observed in WASP−/− T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

PLCγ1 localized with TCR microclusters in live cell synapse, and this distribution was lost upon treatment of cells with CK666 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). As a control, the association of human Zap70-GFP with MC was maintained after CK666 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, due the mobile nature of MC, it was challenging to follow individual cluster before and after CK666 treatment in this setting. We thus chose to utilize anti-CD3 microdots to activate human T cells. Human CD4 T cells expressing PLCγ1-YFP were incubated with micron-size immobile anti-CD3 dots, and visualized using live cell imaging immediately after cell attachment. Similar to F-actin foci assembly at the microdot, PLCγ1 enrichment was also visible at the microdot sites. CK666 treatment of cells led to a reduction of PLCγ1 enrichment at microdots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I,J</xref>).

Thus we utilized an activated cultured endothelial cells (EC) based planar APC system, where a flat synaptic interface is formed that is ideal for <italic>en-face</italic> visualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sage et al., 2012</xref>). Using this system, F-actin and HS1 rich ‘invadopod-like-protrusions’ (ILPs) are observed at TCR MC-like features in the periphery of the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sage et al., 2012</xref>). We found that ILPs were associated with the Y397 phosphorylated form of HS1, similar to F-actin foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Furthermore, when pre-formed T cell-EC conjugates were treated with CK666, there was concomitant loss of ILPs and phospho-HS1, indicating that these structures also require Arp2/3-dependent continuous polymerization of F-actin, and support local phospho-HS1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Since CK666-treatment also led to a reduction in total synaptic F-actin, which could be a consequence of inhibition of the EC cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>), we utilized specific shRNA-mediated reduction in WASP levels in T cells, and examined foci (ILPs), total F-actin and phospho-HS1 levels at the T cell-EC conjugate interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). WASP silenced T cells display selective loss of both ILPs as well as phospho-HS1, while maintaining total F-actin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>). Therefore, the F-actin foci that we have primarily been characterized using SLB in this study, are the counterparts of ILPs in the cell conjugate system, and are necessary for efficient T cell activation. Thus, F-actin foci may represent a cytoskeletal module that functions to optimally support TCR distal signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) in diverse antigen presenting contexts.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04953.031</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>ILP signaling in T-EC immunological synapse is WASP dependent.</title><p>Human CD4 T cells were incubated with culture media containing lentiviral particles carrying WASP shRNA or non-specific (control) shRNA for 48 hr (<bold>A</bold>) T cells transduced with WASP shRNA or control shRNA carrying lentiviral particles were incubated with endothelial monolayer for 10 min, fixed and processed for Alexa594-phalloidin (pseudo-colored green) and phospho-HS1 (pseudo-colored red) immuno-staining.

(<bold>C</bold>) Model of temporal sequence of events leading to F-actin foci formation and PLCγ signaling at the immunological synapse. Multiple pathways can result in actin polymerization and remodeling at the synaptic interface, contributing to F-actin organization in different SMAC zones. One such pathway involves WAVE2 recruitment by activated LFA1, followed by WAVE2 dependent Arp2/3 complex activation resulting in thick lamellipodial (dSMAC) and lamellar (pSMAC) F-actin meshworks. WAVE2-dependent F-actin pool is required for calcium-dependent calcium entry via the CRAC channel. Additional pathways including MyosinII-mediated actin remodeling is required for maintaining lamellar actin flow and directional persistence of microclusters (MCs) towards the cSMAC, and formin-mediated nucleation of F-actin promotes MTOC docking and stability of synapse. Another pool of F-actin or ‘F-actin foci’ is generated by the activity of WASP protein in the p- and dSMAC zones. Following TCR triggering, WASP is recruited at TCR signalosome via several possible mechanisms – such as via Vav, via NCK, via Zap70 and CrkL mediated WIP release and other effector mechanisms, and, through Fyn or PIP2 or PTP-PEST-binding at the plasma membrane (PM). Once activated, WASP recruits Arp2/3 complex to the MC, which then leads to actin branch nucleation and polymerization at the MC, over and above the local background actin. This process continues even during MC movement in the lamellar region, with a high F-actin turnover at the foci until its delivery to the cSMAC. In the foci, HS1 is recruited via binding both the Arp2/3 complex as well as F-actin, and is subsequently phosphorylated. As a consequence of early TCR signaling, PLCγ1 is also recruited to the MC signalosome, where it is stabilized via interactions with both F-actin, and foci residing HS1. F-actin foci dynamics in the proximity of the plasma membrane further support PLCγ1 phosphorylation, potentially by facilitating its interaction with PM-bound, upstream activators such as Itk. Phosphorylation of PLCγ1 by Itk then triggers phosphoinositide signaling, which in turn initiates calcium ion flux and NFAT1 activation. WASP deficiency or failure to activate Arp2/3 complex by WASPΔC mutant leads to selective loss of nucleation of foci at the MC. As a result, early signaling is not affected, however, both HS1 and PLCγ1 levels are severely reduced at the microcluster sites. The remaining PLCγ1 at synapse allows cell spreading and synapse formation, however, it is not sufficient to achieve calcium flux comparable to the control cells. Direct pharmacological inhibition of Arp2/3 complex using CK666 yields similar results; early TCR signaling is preserved while PLCγ1 phosphorylation and late signaling are severely perturbed. As actin polymerizing processes other than WASP also utilize Arp2/3 Complex, CK666-treated cells show a general reduction in lamellipodial and lamellar actin as well. However, the remaining F-actin levels are sufficient to support early TCR signaling. In contrast, total F-actin depolymerization at the synapse using CytochalasinD results in defects in early as well as late signaling, as has been reported in earlier studies. The image on the bottom shows a maximum intensity projection of synaptic contact interface of a human primary CD4 T cell, acquired using spinning disc confocal microscope.

At the immunological synapse, the compartmentalization of TCR signalosome proteins is regulated for optimal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fooksman et al., 2010</xref>). It is therefore surprising that cytoskeletal behavior is routinely measured as an all-or-none response of total polymerized F-actin, effectively ignoring different F-actin network subpopulations that could have distinct contributions to specific steps of the TCR signaling process. The WASP-dependent F-actin microarchitecture at the TCR MC that we report here is an important example. These F-actin ‘foci’ facilitate specific downstream TCR signaling steps, including PLCγ1 activation and calcium ion elevation, but are not required for TCR MC formation and other proximal signaling events such as Zap70 phosphorylation. Our study has shown that, when F-actin foci are depleted by WASP deficiency or CK666 treatment, the remaining lamellipodial and lamellar F-actin networks are not able to support optimal PLCγ1 activation, indicating that actin foci are indeed necessary for this later signaling step. Furthermore, we found that the molecular machinery associated with ‘flat’ TCR MC formed on planar substrates is the same as that in the distinctly three-dimensional ILP structures formed in T cell interfaces with antigen presenting endothelial cells. Others have noted the three dimensional nature of T-APC synapses that appear to have a classical immunological synapse/SMAC architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brossard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biggs et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roybal et al., 2013</xref>).

Ours is the first study, to our knowledge, to have performed a detailed characterization of foci as structures that are polymerized de novo via a WASP dependent mechanism. Previously, it was proposed that similar TCR associated F-actin foci were formed through a buildup of retrogradely flowing F-actin moving over artificially immobilized TCR on chrome micro-barriers in both Jurkat and primary T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Smoligovets et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yu et al., 2010</xref>). Further characterization of this buildup revealed that it is due to accumulation of pre-existing filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Smoligovets et al., 2013</xref>). We avoided this pitfall here by utilizing a system in which TCR MC remain mobile or are pre-established in micron scale spots that are segregated and are less likely to be traversed by F-actin flows, preventing an accumulation of filaments.</p><p>T cell ILP display molecular similarities to ‘podosomal’ actin structures that are a common feature of leukocyte contact with substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dovas and Cox, 2011</xref>). Composed of dynamic F-actin, such podosomes are rich in HS1 related cortactin and are formed in a WASP-dependent manner at the adhesion interface of leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dovas and Cox, 2011</xref>). We speculate that the TCR utilizes similar WASP-HS1 based molecular machinery to generate F-actin foci/ILP that then serve to support calcium ion signaling through stabilization of PLCγ recruitment and phosphorylation. In the immunoreceptor driven synapses of non-T cells, this foci-like organization of actin microfilaments has not been observed thus far. F-actin architecture at the NK cell synapse appears to be uniform and the deep lamellipodial network dominates the synaptic interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rak et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, in B cells, a thick cortical actin meshwork that is inhibitory for early B cell receptor signaling has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Treanor et al., 2011</xref>), but evidence of any ‘foci-like’ organization is missing. In such cell types, WASP could serve other roles, and may not promote immunoreceptor signaling via foci generation at the synapse.</p><p>In the case of both CD4 and CD8 primary T cells, foci are robustly triggered following TCR ligation. In activated mouse T cell blasts, antigen-dependent induction of foci was observed as well; however, a few low intensity actin features were visible in a fraction of T cell blasts activated on ICAM1 in SLB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We do not understand the origin of these low-intensity foci. It is possible that foci are generated at a basal level throughout the active signaling state of T cell blasts after initial priming, and antigen re-stimulation is a potent trigger for their formation. Alternatively, it is possible that integrins such as LFA-1 are capable of forming a few transient actin-rich features in activated lymphocytes in a specific chemokine environment, when its ligand ICAM1 is highly expressed. In contrast to the primary T cell systems, we have not detected foci in the Jurkat T cell line activated using the SLB system. A signaling network linking TCR to WASP has been outlined in the Jurkat cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barda-Saad et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Thrasher and Burns, 2010</xref>), so it is likely this signaling pathway is intact. However, any WASP-dependent foci that may exist in these cells are either smaller than the resolution limit, or are transient in nature and rapidly dissipate into the lamellar network before they can be observed. Interestingly, in Jurkat T cells, the actin polymerizing function of WASP is not required for its role in calcium ion signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Silvin et al., 2001</xref>), and Arp2/3 silencing does not prevent PLCγ1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gomez et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, it is also possible that these cells utilize an alternative WASP-independent cytoskeletal pathway to support TCR-induced calcium ion elevation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babich et al., 2012</xref>), and therefore do not need to utilize foci for this purpose. For example, the lack of negative regulators like PTEN may allow Jurkat cells to sustain calcium ion signals through alterations in lipid metabolism, without F-actin foci. A detailed comparison of the differential organization and function of F-actin modalities between Jurkat cells and the primary T cells will provide fundamental insights into the operation of compensatory cytoskeletal pathways that assist TCR distal signaling and may be important at different developmental stages in the T cell lineage or part of the failure of growth control in malignancy.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Functional class of F-actin at the synapse</title><p>Our study revealed at least two functional classes of F-actin at the synapse. The first component is critical for very early signaling events encompassing TCR triggering and the proximal signaling cascade. This fraction is represented by a slow turnover CK666-resistant cortical F-actin pool, which most likely relies on filament remodeling proteins other than actin branching for its dynamics. The second component, the WASP and Arp2/3-dependent F-actin foci network is responsible for assisting PLCγ1 activation and calcium ion signaling. Furthermore, in addition to these two networks, there is evidence for a third, CK666-sensitive network that we have not investigated in this study. This network is made up of a fraction of lamellar and lamellipodial F-actin that is rapidly eliminated under even short duration treatments of CK666 based on the reduction in ‘total F-actin’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This observation indicates that this third sub-population is composed of dynamic F-actin. This network is not required for the early TCR signaling steps that we have tested, indicating that it may play other roles at the synapse that are known to be dependent on F-actin. For example, it may be equivalent to the WAVE2 dependent network that is not required for early TCR signaling or PLCγ1-dependent calcium ion efflux from endoplasmic reticulum, but is necessary for CRAC channel mediated calcium ion entry from extracellular medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nolz et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Considering that all the above-mentioned networks are made up of the same building blocks of G-actin, how are functional boundaries between them set up and regulated, and how is this related to the organizational differences between these networks? Given the small size of T cells, the highly dynamic nature of their F-actin structures and the pleotropic action of pharmacological inhibitors on all F-actin organizations, it is challenging to dissect the specific roles of these sub-populations during TCR signaling. Thus, further interrogation of these networks will require a combination of genetic tools enabling conditional perturbation, as well as rescue, of Arp2/3 complex and NPFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moulding et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blundell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sato et al., 2013</xref>), in combination with super-resolution microscopy in primary T cells. The results from these experiments will reveal how these networks combine to generate an emergent multifunctional synaptic F-actin network during T cell activation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Is PLCγ1 the convergence point for multiple cytoskeletal pathways?</title><p>The primary recruitment of PLCγ1 from cytosol to the MC has been well characterized, and it involves its interaction with TCR signalosome proteins LAT and SLP76, and subsequent phosphorylation at PLCγ1 residue Y783 by membrane-bound Itk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Park et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braiman et al., 2006</xref>). Loss of F-actin foci resulted in reduced phospho-Y783 PLCγ1 levels at the synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref>). The microdot enrichment assays and the SLB experiments both indicated that this was largely due to defects in PLCγ1 accumulation at the MCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Accumulation of PLCγ1 at actin foci could occur via its direct association with actin filaments, as reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carrizosa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Patsoukis et al., 2009</xref>), as well as with foci-recruited HS1. Both these mechanisms could simultaneously contribute to accumulation of PLCγ1 at TCR MCs.</p><p>The precise manner by which accumulation at actin foci promotes PLCγ1 activation is not clear. There are several possible mechanisms that could underlie this process. First, it is probable that the continual nucleation of F-actin filaments at foci provides a sustained cytoskeletal microenvironment for the enrichment of PLCγ1 around the TCR signalosome. As the TCR MC traverses regions with highly variable levels of lamellar F-actin en route to the cSMAC, the foci would provide for the continuous presence of high levels of F-actin at the TCR microcluster, which may in turn ensure continuous local enrichment of PLCγ1 at the MC. Second, foci F-actin growing in juxtaposition to the plasma membrane may facilitate the interaction of F-actin bound PLCγ1 with its plasma-membrane anchored effectors such as Itk, thereby enhancing its phosphorylation. In this model, the growth of foci would exert force on and push the plasma membrane in its vicinity. Consistent with this mechanism, we find that foci zones mark areas of high membrane tension, observed as the foci-dependent localization and increased phosphorylation of mechanosensory protein CasL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kumari et al., 2012</xref>;; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yu et al., 2012</xref>) at the MC-foci sites (Santos et al., manuscript under review). This is also consistent with the manifestation as ILPs on the softer endothelial cell substrates. This observation also implies a possible role of F-actin foci in supporting synapse stability. Previously we have shown that WASP−/− T cell synapses form normally with normal pSMAC and dSMAC actin organizations, however they lost stability faster than those of WT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sims et al., 2007</xref>). It will therefore be interesting to investigate whether the synapse stabilizing role of WASP is mediated by actin foci, and if foci influence pSMAC oscillations, as reported earlier in WASP−/− cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sims et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, in CK666-treated cells, there is a modest initial rise in intracellular calcium ion concentration, but final calcium ion concentrations are significantly lower than in DMSO-treated control cells and rapidly decline thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). The factors contributing to residual calcium ion elevation may be either residual phopspho-PLCγ1 in CK666-treated cells, or an additional mechanism of PLCγ1 activation that is insensitive to this inhibition. In accordance with this, we do not observe a complete loss of PLCγ1 at microdot sites in CK666 treated cells. In contrast to the above mentioned processes that augment calcium ion signaling in mature T cells, there are alternative actin cytoskeletal pathways in immature thymocytes that impinge upon PLCγ1, and total F-actin is inhibitory for PLCγ1 activation and calcium ion flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tan et al., 2014</xref>). Detailed examination of F-actin networks in T cells during different developmental stages will clarify how the actin cytoskeleton can generate different activation outcomes at the level of PLCγ1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kumari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roybal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Malissen et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Unique requirement of WASP for foci generation</title><p>We find a specific requirement for WASP in the generation of F-actin foci.

This lack of effect on total F-actin in WASP deficient or depleted cells may be attributed to the fact that the foci contribute to &lt;10% of the total synaptic F-actin intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and perhaps to a compensatory increase in the background actin networks when more ATP-G-actin is available for polymerization regulated by other NPFs such as WAVE2. We have shown that WASP's role in generating F-actin foci cannot be substituted for by NWASP. This selective requirement for WASP could be due to its specific interactions with upstream activators at the TCR signalosome. For example, a conventional mode of WASP and NWASP activation is through interaction with Cdc42 GTPase, However, WASP recruitment can occur independently of Cdc42 at the T cell synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cannon et al., 2001</xref>). In agreement with this, in preliminary experiments, Cdc42−/− T cells showed normal F-actin foci (data not shown) indicating that these foci form without the aid of Cdc42. Additionally, Cdc42-dependent phosphorylation of WASP at Y291 by SFK is known to increase its affinity for Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Torres and Rosen, 2003</xref>). Overexpression of a phospho-deficient mutant (WASP Y291F) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blundell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dovas et al., 2009</xref>) did not perturb F-actin foci formation or PLCγ1 phosphorylation, indicating that the WASP activation pathway utilized for foci formation may be distinct from the upstream regulatory pathways involving Cdc42 activation, or SFK binding at phospho-Y291. While it was not possible to dominantly uncouple TCR MC from PLCγ1 activation by over-expressing WASP that is able to activate Arp2/3, but does not interact with SFKs, it is possible that other regulatory phosphorylation sites can scaffold WASP's interaction partners, thereby playing an ancillary role in PLCγ1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Torres and Rosen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blundell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Macpherson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reicher et al., 2012</xref>). These results, and the failure of compensation by NWASP, suggest that WASP is activated and employed in a specialized manner in T cells to generate F-actin foci. The dimerization property of WASP and positive feedback with Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Padrick and Rosen, 2010</xref>), as well as its role in polarizing micron-scale ‘lipid rafts’ at the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dupre et al., 2002</xref>) may contribute towards a specific enrichment and involvement of WASP at foci. At this stage, the mechanistic basis for WASP vs NWASP utilization is not understood.</p><p>To summarize, we have characterized a subsynaptic F-actin organization in T cells that is functionally distinct from larger scale lamellipodial and lamellar networks. These actin foci provide a signaling scaffold that is required for TCR-distal signaling and play a critical regulatory role in calcium ion signaling. There are significant questions that remain to be answered. For example, we do not yet know the MC-intrinsic properties that temporally regulate F-actin foci formation. We find that ∼40% of TCR MCs are associated with F-actin foci at steady-state. While a large fraction of remaining clusters are in the central cSMAC region of the cell, previously characterized to be an actin depleted zone containing signaling incompetent TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kaizuka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vardhana et al., 2010</xref>), a smaller fraction of foci-unassociated MC resides in the lamellar zone as well. At lamellar zone TCR MCs, it is unclear which MC-intrinsic attributes dictate foci induction, maintenance and subsequent termination of actin nucleation on entry into the cSMAC, and if integrin signaling assists in any of these steps. Further investigation will not only provide a deeper understanding of subsynaptic F-actin dynamics, but will also illuminate other specialized roles that F-actin subpopulations play during the lifetime of a signalosome. The results will also provide deeper insights into signaling compartmentalization of the T cell synapse that is regulated by the actin cytoskeleton and its alteration in WAS pathology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>AND Mouse T cells used in this study were isolated from 2–3 months old AND B10.Br mouse spleen and lymph nodes.

The major issues raised by the reviewers that need to be dealt with in your revision are detailed below, along with a few minor comments. A revised paper addressing in a substantive manner the major issues raised will be examined by the reviewing editor and the referees and final decision made at that time.</p><p>S. Kumari et al. employ a combination of cutting-edge microscopy techniques to investigate the role of Wiscott Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASP) in T cell activation. The authors have developed a novel assay that reveals actin foci that form after activation of the T cell receptor. These have not been noticed before, since this newly polymerized actin represents just a subset of the total actin filament pool. The discovery of distinct types of actin filaments in the T cell is interesting in its own right. These actin foci are associated with TCR microclusters and require WASP and HS-1 for their formation. Interestingly, disruption of the formation of these foci by WASP depletion or Arp2/3 inhibition with CK666 results in the inhibition of PLCg activation and calcium mobilization; however, proximal signaling is not affected. These results provide new insight into the role of actin networks in signaling and also provide a potential explanation of the immunodeficiency defected associated with mutations or knockdown of WASP. This is a very comprehensive and well-conducted study (perhaps a bit dense read in places).</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>1) The authors used a variety of methods of stimulating T cells (pMHC and other times with two different antibodies (Okt3 or 2C11), and also switched between mouse and human T cells. Mouse and human T cells were even employed in the same figure (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The explanation for this is not clear in the paper and would be good if it was explained to the reader. Also, in several parts of the paper, the authors are not internally consistent in how they conduct their experiments, without explanation for the change in method. For example, CD3 antibody was used to activate the T cells when studying the role of WASP in forming actin foci, but pMHC was used for investigating the role of NWASP and WAVE2. Why the two different types of stimuli in different experiments? Unless the authors have a strong experimental or theoretical basis for the switch, these experiments need to be made congruent.</p><p>2) The expression of WASP mutants was used to dissect the role of WASP (e.g. Y291F and deltaC). However, the results are somewhat complicated to interpret. Ideally, it would have been best to express these in WASP-/- T cells, which they employed in panel a-c of the same figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). This would rule out potential complications with having endogenous WASP also present (particularly important for the lack of an effect of Y291F expression). Also I do not understand how Y291F serves as a control. This phosphorylation should enhance WASP activation and increase affinity for Arp2/3. Thus, a mutant would be impaired in these activities but still would retain a scaffolding function. Thus, isn't it still possible that WASP activates PLCg by acting as a scaffold? Again, please make the experiments internally consistent (e.g., use WASP-/- cells throughout as recipient cells) and explain the choice of Y291F as a control.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the authors determined whether TCR signaling is required for formation of the actin foci. They have compared “ICAM alone” and “ICAM + MHCp” conditions. It would be useful to include the “MHCp alone” condition as well to determine if integrin signaling is also involved.</p><p>4) The Arp2/3 inhibitor CK666 abolished 67% actin foci and 42% of lamellipodia and lamellar actin. While the foci are marginally more reduced, it is difficult to attribute the defects in calcium flux and NFAT translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G, H</xref>) to foci reduction rather than lamellipodia and lamellar actin reduction. It might be better to test these downstream signaling defects in WASP deficient cells because depleting WASP appears to be more selective for reducing foci and does not affect lamellar actin structures as much. Further, at least some of the results obtained using CK666 should be confirmed with a more selective approach based on Arp2/3 silencing.</p><p>5) The results showing the role of WASP on foci formation are obtained using fixed and permeabilized cells at a defined time point (2 minutes after beginning of culture). This makes it difficult to estimate the time of formation of these structures. It would be important to investigate the time kinetics of foci formation and of their migration towards cSMAC using time-lapse video microscopy to define whether the kinetics are altered (delayed) upon WASP/Arp2/3 silencing. It would also be interesting to monitor the kinetics of foci formation and of their lifetime in different areas of the synapse (independently of WASP silencing) in parallel with [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] i increases. This approach would allow to establish whether foci formation precedes or not the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] i increase.</p><p>6) The authors propose that WASP pathway regulates actin foci formation, which in turn is instrumental for synaptic activation of PLCγ1. However, they do not show a mechanistic link between foci formation and PLCγ1. An alternative explanation of the data might be that the WASP pathway might control PLCγ1 activation. In turn PLCγ1 signaling might promote actin dynamics as suggested by a recent report (A. Brodovitch et al., J Immunol, 2013; 191:2064-2071). To address this point, the authors should investigate the impact of PLCγ1 silencing (or of its pharmacological inhibition) on F-actin foci formation and the time kinetics of foci formation and of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i (see above).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04953.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>The reviewers have made excellent suggestions that we have addressed by carrying out new experiments, as well as providing better explanations for the rationale and extensive literature behind our existing experiments.</p><p><italic>1) The authors used a variety of methods of stimulating T cells (pMHC and other times with two different antibodies (Okt3 or 2C11), and also switched between mouse and human T cells.

We found that the key features of the foci pathway i.e. the mechanism of foci formation via the WASP/HS-1 dependent pathway and its impact on PLCγ activation are conserved in human and mouse T cells, activated using a variety of activation stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3 fig1s4 fig1s5">Figure 1–figure supplements 3–5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3 fig4 fig5 fig6 fig7">Figures 2–7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8 fig9">Author response images 1 and 2</xref>). This data is consistent with the previous reports, where TCR-dependent calcium signaling was found to be dysregulated in both WASP-/- mouse as well as WAS human T cells (Introduction). We thus utilized these conserved features of the pathway to overcome the technical limitations of individual experimental systems. As such, a large number of the presented experiments were replicated in both human and mouse antigen and agonist antibody-based systems. However, due to the methodological limitations in some contexts, as outlined below, some of our experiments were more suitable to perform in a specific system.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04953.035</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>CK666 treatment results in reduced phosphorylation of PLCã1 at the T cell synapse activated on MHCp.

This system has been routinely utilized for high resolution characterization of cytoskeletal organization at T cell immune synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beemiller et al., 2012</xref>; Hashimoto-Tane et al., 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kumari et al., 2012</xref>). Using siRNA-mediated silencing, we found that the mechanism of foci formation was indeed WASP dependent in this system (30% reduction in foci upon partial WASP silencing, data not shown), and was comparable to foci induction in cells activated using anti-CD3 (Results section, paragraph 1, 27% reduction in foci in T cells activated using anti-CD3, <italic>p=0.0025</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>); 30% reduction in foci in T cells activated using MHCp, <italic>p=0.0005</italic> (data removed now), upon partial WASP silencing]. We have now replaced the MHCp data with anti-CD3 data, for a more coherent presentation of results. We continued to employ MHCp-based activation for most colocalization experiments in the paper, as this system provided cleaner staining with some antibodies, including the mouse monoclonal anti-Arp3 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), which would otherwise cross-react with agonist 2C11 (hamster in origin) antibody, and NWASP and WAVE2 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2</xref>). In addition, since this system utilized activated CD4 T cells, which are larger and more suitable for transfection procedures than primary T cells, we were able to achieve higher transfection and survival rates for siRNA experiments, and better spatial resolution for colocalization experiments.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04953.036</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p>Barbed-end labeling of polymerizing actin filaments in Human CD4 T cells.

The WASP, NWASP and HS1 deficient mice were not maintained with the TCR transgenes and were polyclonal 129 or C57B6 backgrounds (Cannon et al., 2004). Thus, we utilized the agonist anti -CD3 antibody (2C11) to activate the freshly isolated primary CD4 T cells from control and gene targeted mice and only made comparisons in the same strain backgrounds, for a number of experiments demanding complete removal of gene products. Although anti-CD3 based activation is a more synthetic way of triggering TCR, it has frequently been utilized interchangeably with the antigen-specific system for assessing the role of actin regulatory proteins in T cell activation (Bouma et al., 2011; Cannon et al., 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gomez et al., 2006</xref>; Moulding et al., 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nolz et al., 2006</xref>; Padrick et al., 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sato et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sato et al., 2001</xref>). Indeed, we found that the mechanism of foci formation, and the effect of their depletion on PLCγ1 activation are comparable between the 2C11 and peptide -MHC systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>), thus justifying the use of both systems for complementary experiments. In fact we have attempted to simplify the initial data presentation to focus on the results with mouse knockout stains with anti-CD3 stimulation only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), later introducing other systems with appropriate stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>Human T cell activated on OKT3</italic>:</p><p>For live imaging and overexpression studies, we could not continue to utilize mouse cells, and switched to human cells for two reasons. First, primary mouse T cells could not recover from electroporation utilized for transfecting them, as noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chicaybam et al., 2013</xref>). Although activated mouse T cells would survive better than primary T cells after transfection procedures, we were reluctant to generate WASP-/- T cell blasts for overexpression experiment, given previously reported activation and proliferation defects in WASP-/- T cells. Second, human WASP constructs have already been utilized successfully for dominant negative inhibition experiments in human model T cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Silvin et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, as pointed out by the reviewer, instead of primary mouse T cells, primary human CD4 T cells were utilized to assess the effects of human WASP dominant negative constructs. Independently, we ascertained the dynamics of foci at synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2</xref>), the effects of WASP depletion on foci formation (now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>), and their role in early and late TCR signaling in human T cells (now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2 fig6s3">Figure 6–figure supplement 2–3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), and observed outcomes identical to those in mouse cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><p>We agree with the reviewers, that in the case of WAVE2 and NWASP recruitment, the colocalization data should have been performed in an identical system as the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, utilizing anti-CD3 for T cell activation. We did attempt to use anti-CD3 based primary mouse T cell based system previously, however the anti-WAVE2 antibody (H-110, Santacruz Biotechnology) (Goh et al., 2012), gave high background on the 2C11 coated surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 3</xref>). Thus, we had utilized peptide-MHC-based activation, which substantially reduced the non-specific background staining. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we now utilized a different antibody (D2C8, Cell Signalling technology) (Wernimont et al ., 2011), which provides cleaner labelling of endogenous WAVE2 in the cells activated using anti-CD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 3</xref>). We have now provided this new experimental data, to replace the old set (Figure 1–figure supplement figure 4B) . The current data shows a comparable lack of colocalization between actin foci and NWASP/WAVE2 (NWASP 9.48%, WAVE2 14.36%), as we reported using pMHC system previously (NWASP 7.54%, WAVE2 11.7%).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04953.037</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><p>A comparison of endogenous WAVE2 staining, obtained using two different rabbit anti-mouse WAVE2 antibodies, and identical immunostaining procedure as described in Methods.

The overexpression of WASP constructs in human model T cell lines has previously been utilized as a successful strategy to assess WASP function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Silvin et al., 2001</xref>). In human primary T cells, we find that the overexpressed constructs localize to the foci sites in a manner similar to WT WASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 4A</xref>). Overexpression of WASP C resulted in a strong perturbation of patches as well as PLC γ1 phosphorylation, indicating that it is able to compete with endogenous protein for effector function. We didn’t observe a dominant negative effect with WASP Y291F, which lacks a potential Src family kinase SH2 binding site (Padrick, 2010) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>). The failure of this mutant to have an effect suggests that binding of Lck or Fyn, the major Src family kinases in T cells to WASP, is not required for the formation and function of foci. Furthermore, WASP Y291 phosphorylation has been shown to be dependent upon the binding of WASP to Cdc42 (Torres et al., 2003) while foci induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 4B</xref>) as well as WASP recruitment at the T cell synapse can both occur independent of Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cannon et al., 2001</xref>).<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04953.038</object-id><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><p>(A) Distribution of overexpressed GFP-WASPY291F in synaptic plane.

In the literature, real time visualization of T cell engagement of beads coated with anti-CD3 only results in localized actin rich protrusions at the site of the contact (Husson et al., 2011). To dissect the selective participation of TCR and integrin (LFA-1) in foci induction and dynamics requires a different set of highly specialized tools that are beyond the scope of this study (please see the first paragraphs of the subheading “Unique requirement of WASP for foci generation” in the Discussion section). In a parallel studies, we have collaborated with the groups of Michael Sheetz and Lance Kam using micro-patterned TCR and integrin ligand dots to investigate the distinct biochemical contributions of LFA- 1 and TCR to the immunological synapse (Tabdanov et. al., submitted for a special issue of “Integrative Biology”). Using this system, we observed that the actin foci are indeed generated by TCR signaling, and LFA1–dependent signaling aids dissipation of f-actin from the foci to allow integrin dependent spreading. These data suggest that integrin shape foci dynamics, but are not required for their formation. We hope that in a final form of both papers that these complementary studies can be cross-referenced.</p><p><italic>4) The Arp2/3 inhibitor CK666 abolished 67% actin foci and 42% of lamellipodia and lamellar actin. While the foci are marginally more reduced, it is difficult to attribute the defects in calcium flux and NFAT translocation (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6G, H</italic></xref><italic>) to foci reduction rather than lamellipodia and lamellar actin reduction. It might be better to test these downstream signaling defects in WASP deficient cells because depleting WASP appears to be more selective for reducing foci and does not affect lamellar actin structures as much. Further, at least some of the results obtained using CK666 should be confirmed with a more selective approach based on Arp2/3 silencing</italic>.</p><p>In WASP-/- T cells as well as the T cells from WAS patients, signaling events downstream of PLCγ1 activation have already been characterized extensively. These include defects in TCR-induced calcium ion flux, NFAT translocation and IL-2 transcription (please see the third paragraph of the Introduction and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calvez et al., 2011</xref>; Cannon et al., 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cianferoni et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>). These TCR-distal signaling defects were comparable to those reported for WASP-/- cells, when we treated cells with CK666 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Akin to WASP deficiency, early TCR signaling is intact in CK666 treatment, distinguishing it from any general F-actin inhibitor, such as Latrunculin A or cytochalasin B, which profoundly inhibit early TCR signaling. Thus, even though CK666 is a broad-range inhibitor, its functional consequences highlight a stage -specific role of Arp2/3 and WASP in TCR signaling. It is indeed interesting that a loss of an additional 50% of total F-actin in CK666 treatment, as compared to WASP-/- cells, causes similar defects in late TCR signaling. The functional significance of the large lost fraction of total F-actin is unclear at the moment, however, it is unlikely to impact WASP-dependent calcium ion signaling cascade (Discussion section, paragraph 5).</p><p>The reviewers have brought up an excellent point regarding the specificity of CK666. Recently, a careful comparison of Arp3 shRNA and CK666 was carried out, where CK666 was found to phenocopy Arp3 knockdown (Bovellan et al., 2014). Arp3 shRNA or CK666 both reduced cortical actin by about 50%, very similar to our findings in T cells and thus validating our use of the inhibitor over genetic manipulation of Arp2/3 complex. Additionally, given the benefit that CK666 provides better temporal control of Arp2/3 complex inhibition compared to Arp2/3 knockdown, during live imaging of cells, we chose to utilize it for our experiments.</p><p><italic>5) The results showing the role of WASP on foci formation are obtained using fixed and permeabilized cells at a defined time point (2 minutes after beginning of culture). This makes it difficult to estimate the time of formation of these structures. It would be important to investigate the time kinetics of foci formation and of their migration towards cSMAC using time-lapse video microscopy to define whether the kinetics are altered (delayed) upon WASP/Arp2/3 silencing. It would also be interesting to monitor the kinetics of foci formation and of their lifetime in different areas of the synapse (independently of WASP silencing) in parallel with [Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup><italic>]i increases. This approach would allow to establish whether foci formation precedes or not the [Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup><italic>]i increase</italic>.</p><p>This would be a valuable dataset to obtain, but we did not undertake this experiment and would like to explain our reasons.</p><p>We and others have previously shown that in WASP deficiency, the cell proliferation and cytokine secretion defects are of reduced amplitude, rather than delayed kinetics (Cannon et al. , 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sims et al ., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>), since they manifest after prolonged culture of cells (30 min-24 hours). Our current data shows that the differences in F-actin foci between WT and WASP- /- or Arp2/3 inhibited cells are also of magnitude rather than kinetics. WASP-/- T cells fail to recover foci even after 1 hour of synapse formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 5</xref>). Similarly in CK666 treatment, foci are permanently lost from the synapse even after prolonged incubation with the bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1B</xref>), and do not recover even after 1 hour of incubation (data not shown). Thus, delayed kinetics of foci formation cannot explain the loss of foci in WASP-/- or CK666-treated cells.<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04953.039</object-id><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><p>Prolonged Lack of foci in WASP-/- T cells.

Using live cell video microscopy, we found that the TCR microclusters and F-actin foci form rapidly (within 4 second frame rate they appear together for first time in many instances: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2–figure supplement 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Author response video 1</xref>). From the results of Huse et al, we know that Calcium flux takes place ∼6 seconds after TCR ligands become available. The kinetic window between TCR microcluster formation, foci induction and calcium release is too small to be captured distinctively. Tracking individual foci and calcium flux is further complicated by the fact that synapse maturation is a rapid and highly dynamic process, where lamellar fluctuations occur continuously (Sims et al., 2007) and fresh microclusters/foci continue to form and migrate centripetally in the synaptic interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2–figure supplement 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6–figure supplement 3</xref>). Therefore, we would have to assay calcium ion dynamics at the sites of individual mobile foci. Additionally, calcium ions rapidly diffuse in the cytoplasm, preventing the recording of calcium ion fluxes at the site of single foci. Thus, given the challenging nature of the process for live cell imaging purpose, and the inadequacy of current imaging methodologies to achieve it, we were unable to pursue this question further.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media6" mime-subtype="avi" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-04953-resp-media1.avi"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04953.040</object-id><label>Author response video 1.</label><caption><p>Actin foci associate with TCR MC as soon as synapse forms.

However, they do not show a mechanistic link between foci formation and PLCγ1. An alternative explanation of the data might be that the WASP pathway might control PLCγ1 activation. In turn PLCγ1 signaling might promote actin dynamics as suggested by a recent report (A. Brodovitch et al. J Immunol 2013; 191:2064-2071). To address this point, the authors should investigate the impact of PLCγ1 silencing (or of its pharmacological inhibition) on F-actin foci formation and the time kinetics of foci formation and of [Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup><italic>]i (see above)</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers make an excellent point. The field has known for a long time that PLC isoforms are important for integrin function and, therefore, will affect synaptic maturation and function (Brodovitch et al., 2013), which in turn will facilitate PLCγ activation. While this feed-forward involvement of PLCγ is essential for synapse formation, it is WASP independent. Our current data show that eliminating WASP or inhibiting Arp2/3 complex both decrease, but do not eliminate PLCγ from TCR microclusters. Therefore, normal synapse formation in WASP deficient T cells is fully consistent with WASP independent PLCγ activation that is critical for synapse formation. We have now included it in the description of our model.</p><p>We did follow up on the reviewers’ suggestion to investigate the role of PLCγ in WASP pathway. We attempted to inhibit PLC pharmacologically using two different doses of U-73122, and monitored the effect of this manipulation on foci formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Author response image 6A</xref>). Under these treatment conditions, synapse attachment and total actin polymerization and foci formation, were inhibited simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Author response image 6B</xref>). This is consistent with the results demonstrated by one of the authors previously (Heissmeyer et al., 2004) that PLC inhibitors such as U-73122 destabilize immunological synapses, particularly the integrin rich components. This reaffirms that a pool of PLC γ or its isoforms is also required for normal synapse establishment, and is likely to be intact in WASP-/- T cells where synapse formation is not impaired.<fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04953.041</object-id><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption><p>(A) Effect of PLC inhibition on synapse formation and foci induction.
