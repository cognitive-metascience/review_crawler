In Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, mutations in <italic>TCF12</italic> or <italic>TWIST1</italic> ablate a specific suture, the coronal. This suture forms at a neural-crest/mesoderm interface in mammals and a mesoderm/mesoderm interface in zebrafish. Despite this difference, we show that combinatorial loss of <italic>TCF12</italic> and <italic>TWIST1</italic> homologs in zebrafish also results in specific loss of the coronal suture. Sequential bone staining reveals an initial, directional acceleration of bone production in the mutant skull, with subsequent localized stalling of bone growth prefiguring coronal suture loss. Mouse genetics further reveal requirements for <italic>Twist1</italic> and <italic>Tcf12</italic> in both the frontal and parietal bones for suture patency, and to maintain putative progenitors in the coronal region. These findings reveal conservation of coronal suture formation despite evolutionary shifts in embryonic origins, and suggest that the coronal suture might be especially susceptible to imbalances in progenitor maintenance and osteoblast differentiation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37024.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Some of the most common birth defects involve improper development of the head and face. One such birth defect is called craniosynostosis. Normally, an infant’s skull bones are not fully fused together. Instead, they are held together by soft tissue that allows the baby’s skull to more easily pass through the birth canal. This tissue also houses specialized cells called stem cells that allow the brain and skull to grow with the child. But in craniosynostosis these stem cells behave abnormally, which fuses the skull bones together and prevents the skull and brain from growing properly during childhood.</p><p>One form of craniosynostosis called Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is caused by mutations in one of two genes that ensure the proper separation of two bones in the roof of the skull. Mice with mutations in the mouse versions of these genes develop the same problem and are used to study this condition. Mouse studies have looked mostly at what happens after birth. Studies looking at what happens in embryos with these mutations could help scientists learn more. One way to do so would be to genetically engineer zebrafish with the equivalent mutations. This is because zebrafish embryos are transparent and grow outside their mother’s body, making it easier for scientists to watch them develop.</p><p>Now, Teng et al. have grown zebrafish with mutations in the zebrafish versions of the genes that cause Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. In the experiments, imaging tools were used to observe the live fish as they developed. This showed that the stem cells in their skulls become abnormal much earlier than previous studies had suggested. Teng et al. also showed that similar stem cells are responsible for growth of the skull in zebrafish and mice.</p><p>Babies with craniosynostosis often need multiple, risky surgeries to separate their skull bones and allow their brain and head to grow. Unfortunately, these bones often fuse again because they have abnormal stem cells. Teng et al. provide new information on what goes wrong in these stem cells. Hopefully, this new information will help scientists to one day correct the defective stem cells in babies with craniosynostosis, thus reducing the number of surgeries needed to correct the problem.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Saethre-Chotzen Syndrome</kwd><kwd>Twist1</kwd><kwd>Tcf12</kwd><kwd>coronal suture</kwd><kwd>craniosynostosis</kwd><kwd>skull bones</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31DE024031</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teng</surname><given-names>Camilla S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T90DE021982</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teng</surname><given-names>Camilla S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005237</institution-id><institution>Helen Hay Whitney Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Farmer</surname><given-names>D'Juan T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DE026339</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maxson</surname><given-names>Robert E</given-names><suffix>Jr.</suffix></name><name><surname>Crump</surname><given-names>J Gage</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35DE027550</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crump</surname><given-names>J Gage</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sequential live imaging of abnormal skull bone fusion in zebrafish reveals a deeply conserved role of two transcription factors, Twist1 and Tcf12, in regulating stem cell activity during growth of the skull.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Craniofacial anomalies are among the most common congenital defects, encompassing cleft lip and palate, facial malformations, and abnormalities in the flat bones forming the top of the skull. Craniosynostosis involves the premature fusion of the skull bones at sutures, fibrous structures that join the bones. During normal development, cranial sutures hold bones of the skull in place while providing malleability required during childbirth. Cranial sutures also contain stem cells that allow for continued skull bone growth as the brain and head structure expands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). While human skull bones eventually fuse later in life, precocious bone fusion in craniosynostosis correlates with region-specific defects in bone growth that often negatively impact growth of the underlying brain. Genetic causes of craniosynostosis include mutations in genes that participate in developmental signaling pathways, including <italic>FGFR</italic>s <italic>1</italic>, <italic>2</italic>, and <italic>3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hajihosseini, 2008</xref>), <italic>TGFBR</italic>s <italic>1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Loeys et al., 2005</xref>), and the Notch ligand <italic>JAGGED1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kamath et al., 2002</xref>). A central unanswered question is the extent to which defects in these pathways result in a failure to maintain postnatal stem cells once the sutures have formed, or whether these pathways have roles in the specification and maintenance of bone progenitors during earlier phases of bone growth preceding suture formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Flaherty et al., 2016</xref>). Most studies have focused on the maintenance of postnatal sutural stem cells, as these stem cells have only been recently marked with a variety of reporters in mice, for example based on <italic>Gli1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>Axin2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maruyama et al., 2016</xref>), and <italic>Prrx1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wilk et al., 2017</xref>). Less is known, however, about how potential defects in the embryonic progenitors that grow the skull bones may prefigure suture loss, although a few reports describe altered bone formation during embryonic stages in craniosynostosis mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Merrill et al., 2006</xref>). The ex utero development and transparency of zebrafish provide a unique opportunity to track the progenitors that form the skull bones, and to better understand how defects in the dynamics of bone growth relate to a later ability to form and maintain sutures once the bones come together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Quarto and Longaker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Laue et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kague et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Topczewska et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A striking feature of many forms of craniosynostosis is that only particular sutures are affected. For example, in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, the second most common form of craniosynostosis, the coronal suture is selectively lost. The majority of Saethre-Chotzen patients harbor heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in <italic>TWIST1</italic> or <italic>TCF12</italic>, which encode basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">el Ghouzzi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Howard et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sharma et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, mice lacking one copy of <italic>Twist1</italic>, or compound heterozygous for <italic>Twist1</italic> and <italic>Tcf12</italic>, display loss of just the coronal suture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sharma et al., 2013</xref>). Analysis of mouse models has led to an appreciation of proper cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yoshida et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ting et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Roybal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deckelbaum et al., 2012</xref>), segregation of osteogenic and non-osteogenic cells at the sutural boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Merrill et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ting et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yen et al., 2010</xref>), and maintenance of postnatal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>) in suture patency. However, it remains unknown the extent to which defects in early progenitors versus postnatal stem cells account for suture loss. As fish are amenable to repeated live imaging of calvarial bone growth and suture development outside the mother, this model provides an opportunity to correlate early defects in osteoprogenitors and bone growth with later suture loss in individual mutants, particularly in cases where the synostosis phenotype is variably penetrant. However, a potential complication is that the coronal suture of zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kague et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mongera et al., 2013</xref>), as well as those of some amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Piekarski et al., 2014</xref>) and birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Matsuoka et al., 2005</xref>), forms at a mesoderm/mesoderm boundary, contrasting with the mammalian coronal suture that forms at a unique interface between the neural-crest-derived frontal bone and the mesoderm-derived parietal bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ishii et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Mammalian sutures may therefore not be considered evolutionarily homologous to the sutures of these other vertebrates, at least from a strict embryological perspective. Should the neural-crest/mesoderm boundary be a factor in coronal sensitivity, non-mammalian coronal sutures might not be susceptible to the same genetic perturbations that cause coronal-specific synostosis in mammals.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37024.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Coronal suture loss in <italic>tcf12; twist1b</italic> mutant zebrafish.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagrams of zebrafish, mouse, and human skulls, with neural crest contributions in turquoise and mesoderm contributions in gold.

The similarity in the genetic interaction between Twist1 and Tcf12 in mice, humans, and fish, despite differences in the cell lineages that give rise to the bones, suggests that the underlying processes of coronal suture development and craniosynostosis are deeply conserved. We demonstrate that in <italic>tcf12; twist1b</italic> mutant fish, the frontal and parietal bones grow abnormally. In mutants, skull bones initiate normally, yet early bone growth is accelerated across the skull. However, subsequent bone growth selectively stalls at the future coronal suture that is destined to fuse. Moreover, sequential live imaging of individual mutant fish shows that the degree of later bone stalling predicts which animals will lose the coronal suture. We observe a similar misregulation of bone growth in <italic>Tcf12<sup>+/-</sup>; Twist1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mutant mice, with tissue-specific removal of <italic>Twist1</italic> resulting in selective overgrowth of the frontal or parietal bones. Further, <italic>Twist1</italic> function must be perturbed within both neural crest- and mesoderm-derived bones, and not just the mesoderm-derived postnatal sutural mesenchyme, to prevent suture formation. At least in mice, we find that these altered bone growth dynamics may be due to changes in osteoblast proliferation and eventual depletion of Gli1<sup>+</sup> and Gremlin1<sup>+</sup> putative bone progenitors prior to the fusion of the bones. These findings demonstrate that Tcf12 and Twist1 have a conserved early function during skull bone growth to regulate the sustained production of osteoblasts, possibly through maintenance of osteoprogenitors, and that the coronal suture is particularly sensitive to defects in this process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Specific loss of the coronal suture in <italic>tcf12</italic>; <italic>twist1b</italic> mutant zebrafish</title><p>In order to investigate requirements for Tcf12 and Twist1 homologs in zebrafish suture formation, we designed TALE nucleases to generate mutant alleles for <italic>tcf12</italic> and both zebrafish Twist1 homologs, <italic>twist1a</italic> and <italic>twist1b</italic>.

We confirmed loss of the coronal suture by micro-computed tomography scans and histology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). As in mice and humans, coronal suture loss correlated with reduced anterior-posterior growth of the frontal and parietal bones, and in cases where the suture was lost unilaterally we consistently observed reduced anterior-posterior growth on that side of the skull (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, we did not detect a requirement for <italic>twist1a</italic> in suture development; sutures formed normally in <italic>tcf12<sup>-/-</sup>; twist1a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants, and loss of <italic>twist1a</italic> alleles did not increase the severity or penetrance of suture defects in <italic>tcf12<sup>-/-</sup>; twist1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

The similarity of coronal suture defects from humans to mice to zebrafish is striking, although each species displays unique dosage sensitivities to loss of <italic>TWIST1</italic> and <italic>TCF1</italic>2. In humans, haploinsufficiency of <italic>TWIST1</italic> or <italic>TCF12</italic> can lead to suture loss. In mice, haploinsufficiency of <italic>Twist1</italic> also results in coronal suture loss, yet haploinsufficiency of <italic>Tcf12</italic> does not, despite enhancing the penetrance of suture defects in <italic>Twist1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sharma et al., 2013</xref>). In zebrafish, only loss of one of two Twist1 homologs (<italic>twist1b</italic>) along with loss of <italic>tcf12</italic> results in suture loss. It remains unclear why humans are more sensitive to Twist1 and Tcf12 dosage than mice and zebrafish, although a similar phenomenon has been observed with other synostosis genes (e.g. <italic>JAG1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Teng et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Repeated live imaging of individual mutant fish revealed a strong correlation between the extent of altered bone growth and later suture loss. Whereas the initiation of the frontal and parietal bones was largely unaffected in mutants, we observed increased proliferation and osteoblast production at the mutant bone fronts in both fish and mice. There were some subtle differences between fish and mice, with larger increases in proliferative osteoblasts in mutant fish than mice, which might reflect species-specific or staging differences. Nonetheless, mutants in both species displayed accelerated growth of both the frontal and parietal bones, which often resulted in abnormal shapes likely due to growth variations along individual bone fronts. In particular, we found that increased diagonal growth in mutants brought the parietal and frontal bones together at the prospective medial regions of the coronal suture much earlier than in wild type animals, which correlates with the medial region of the coronal suture being most commonly fused in mutants. This altered directional growth might be one reason why the coronal suture is preferentially affected in both zebrafish and mouse Twist1/Tcf12 mutants, despite the different origins of the coronal suture in these species.</p><p>Another prominent finding was a lack of continued bone growth at the future coronal but not other sutures in mutants, with the degree of bone stalling predicting synostosis in individuals. We identified <italic>Gli1/gli1</italic> and <italic>Grem1/grem1a</italic> as conserved markers of putative osteoprogenitors in both the growing bone fronts and mature sutures of mice and zebrafish, although both genes display broader expression at early stages of calvarial bone development, including in some periosteal cells. Future lineage tracing experiments should help reveal the extent to which <italic>gli1</italic> in fish and <italic>Grem1/grem1a</italic> in both species mark similar populations of embryonic osteoprogenitors and postnatal sutural stem cells. A previous study had observed reduced expression of <italic>Gli1</italic> in the sutures of adult <italic>Twist1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we extend this finding to embryonic stages when the coronal suture is forming, and uncover the existence of Grem1+ cells in and around the bone fronts of the nascent coronal suture that become depleted in mutant mice. Whether similar osteoprogenitors become exhausted at the developing coronal suture of zebrafish remains to be determined, as it was difficult to precisely quantify the numbers of these progenitors by RNA expression alone. One possibility is that reduced Twist1 and Tcf12 function alters the balance between long-term sutural stem cells (i.e. those marked by <italic>Gli1</italic>) and proliferative osteoblasts and their immediate progenitors. In such a model, the early increase in osteoblast production would come at the expense of long-term progenitors, thus leading to a later failure of continued bone growth and a loss of the sutural stem cells that would normally separate the skull bones. In addition to further verifying this model, an important next step will be to determine why the fronts of the parietal and frontal bones abutting the future coronal suture are most sensitive to progenitor exhaustion in mutants. We did not observe preferential expression of <italic>tcf12</italic> and <italic>twist1b</italic> at the coronal suture in fish, consistent with similarly broad sutural expression of <italic>Twist1</italic> in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rice et al., 2000</xref>). Instead, osteoprogenitors in the coronal zone could be fewer in number at initial stages and/or more sensitive to loss of Tcf12 and Twist1, for example due to compensation by related genes at other sutures.</p><p>Further support for suture defects arising from much earlier changes in bone growth come from our conditional <italic>Twist1</italic> deletion experiments in mouse. Whereas the frontal bone arises from neural crest and the parietal bone from mesoderm, the mesenchyme within the postnatal coronal suture is largely mesoderm-derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yen et al., 2010</xref>). However, suture loss was only observed upon conditional deletion of one allele of <italic>Twist1</italic> from both the embryonic mesoderm and neural crest. This finding is inconsistent with Twist1 functioning solely in the mesoderm-derived postnatal suture mesenchyme for suture patency, instead suggesting that misregulated growth of both the frontal and parietal bones is required to later disrupt the coronal suture in <italic>Twist1</italic> mutants.</p><p>Our study highlights a selective role for Tcf12 in the later growth of the skull bones and patency of the coronal suture. In contrast to animals lacking Twist1 homologs, zebrafish lacking <italic>tcf12</italic> do not display embryonic lethality or defects in ectomesenchyme and facial cartilage formation. Instead, loss of <italic>tcf12</italic> partially suppresses the facial cartilage defects and lethality of <italic>twist1a; twist1b</italic> mutants. Suppression of embryonic defects could be due to loss of competition of Tcf12 with other Twist binding partners, such as Hand2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Firulli et al., 2005</xref>). In this scenario, maternal Twist1a/b and/or other Twist family members (e.g. <italic>twist2</italic> and <italic>twist3</italic>) could compensate for lack of zygotic Twist1a/b. Loss of <italic>tcf12</italic> would then allow remaining Twist proteins to more effectively form homodimers or alternate heterodimers important for embryogenesis. Whereas a previous report indicates that Tcf12 and Twist1 can form heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Connerney et al., 2006</xref>), it is also possible that Tcf12 has Twist1-independent functions that antagonize Twist1 during embryogenesis. Future efforts to directly visualize Tcf12-Twist1 complexes will help to resolve how Tcf12 promotes Twist1 function during skull bone growth while counteracting it during embryonic neural crest development.</p><p>Development of homologous structures often employs ancestrally conserved gene regulatory networks. For example, a requirement for Pax6 genes in eye development in a wide range of animals has been used to argue for deep homology of eye structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gehring and Ikeo, 1999</xref>). Here, we show remarkably specific loss of a single anatomical structure, the coronal suture, in zebrafish and mice lacking Tcf12 and Twist1, despite this suture occurring at a mesoderm/mesoderm interface in zebrafish and a neural-crest/mesoderm interface in mice. Hence, sensitivity of the coronal suture in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is unlikely to be due to its location at a unique neural-crest/mesoderm interface. In addition, there are several other sutures occurring at a neural-crest/mesoderm interface in mice and fish that are not affected by loss of Tcf12 and Twist1. There has been on-going debate, given these distinct tissue boundaries, as to whether coronal sutures are truly homologous across vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Maddin et al., 2016</xref>). Our data indicate that the conserved genetic dependence of the coronal suture in fish and mammals likely reflects a similar sensitivity to early bone growth changes, perhaps owing to similar developmental and anatomical constraints irrespective of the embryonic origins of the bones flanking this suture.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td><italic>sp7:EGFP</italic></td><td>PMID: 20506187</td><td><break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://zfin.org/ZDB-GENO-100402-2">RRID: ZFIN_ZDB-GENO-100402-2</ext-link></td><td>Zebrafish International <break/>Resource Center</td></tr><tr><td> genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td><italic>tcf12<sup>-/-</sup></italic></td><td>this paper</td><td/><td>allele <italic>el548</italic>; see <break/><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td><italic>twist1a<sup>-/-</sup></italic></td><td>this paper</td><td/><td>allele <italic>el571</italic>; see <break/><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td><italic>twist1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic></td><td>this paper</td><td/><td>allele <italic>el570</italic>; see <break/><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Tcf12<sup>-/-</sup></italic></td><td>PMID: 23354436</td><td/><td>Dr. Robert Maxson <break/>(University of Southern <break/>California)</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Twist1<sup>-/-</sup></italic></td><td>PMID: 7729687</td><td><break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:002221">IMSR_JAX:002221</ext-link></td><td>Dr. Richard Behringer <break/>(University of Texas, M.

Left and right sutures were given scores of 0 (no fusion), 1 (&lt;50% fused), 2 (≥50% fused), or 3 (completely fused). A composite score for each animal was calculated by adding the sum of both suture scores. The index value was determined by the sum of composite scores in each genotype group divided by the number of animals in the group.</p><p>The degree of jaw cartilage defect was determined by the number of cartilage elements affected, with more affected equating to a higher grade of severity. Flat-mounted cartilages were measured for area using Fiji.</p><p>Directional bone growth was quantified using Fiji. For bone produced by 10.25 mm and subsequent growth by 14 mm, bone regions were drawn freehand and measured for area. For assessment of BrdU<sup>+</sup> and Sp7<sup>+</sup> cells, tiled z-stacks were captured of stained zebrafish skulls caps using a Zeiss LSM 800. The bone fronts were then digitally extracted using a 30-pt. brush in Amira software, and cells were manually counted in a 3D view on Imaris software. In mouse coronal suture sections, the region of interest was determined by a defined length across the bone fronts and suture. In mouse sagittal suture sections, defined lengths included several cell diameters medial from the last Sp7<sup>+</sup> cell at the bone fronts and accounted for bone curvature. Five sections per animal were quantified and averaged. For bone thickness quantifications, a perpendicular measurement across the broadest point of Sp7+ cells was measured for each section. All measurements and counting were completed in Fiji. For the quantification of RNAscope experiments, regions of interests were defined by the edge of the calvarial bones (imaged by DIC microscopy) in Fiji. The coronal progenitor region was defined as the space between the neighboring frontal and parietal bones, and the sagittal progenitor region was defined as an approximately three-cell layer length region ahead of the parietal bone. RNAscope signal was quantified across a Z-stack projection using the 3D Object Counter tool, and measurements above a pre-defined unit of one transcript were adjusted to account for closely packed transcripts. The final transcript count was normalized to the area of the region of interest. Three sections per animal were averaged for each probe. Unpaired t-tests were performed for all statistical analyses, and all samples were scored blindly.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Megan Matsutani and Jennifer DeKoeyer Crump for fish care; Seth Ruffins, Director of the Microscopy Core Facility of USC Stem Cell, for assistance in rendering micro-CT reconstructions; and members of the Maxson, Crump, and Yang Chai labs for insightful discussions.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Altered progenitor dynamics prefigure craniosynostosis in a zebrafish model of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being evaluated by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>We have included the detailed reviews below. All three of the reviewers commend the basic finding that Twist1/Tcf12 is involved in synostosis, and that the zebrafish is therefore a useful model for studying this syndrome. However, at the same time there is a major concern about a lack of a mechanistic explanation for why Tcf12 leads to the defects you have observed. After discussing this with each of the reviewers, our general feeling is that for us to consider proceeding at <italic>eLife</italic>, there would need to be a more compelling mechanistic explanation for the observed effects.</p><p>Based on these serious concerns, I would like to inquire as to whether you have additional mechanistic data that you think would address this.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript from Teng et al. describes the effect of loss of Twist1 and Tcf12 on cranial bone growth and progenitor proliferation in the zebrafish and mouse models. It has been known for some time that heterozygous mutations in <italic>Twist1</italic> result in coronal synostosis in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome in humans and mice, and more recently, has been demonstrated that Tcf12 is a Twist1 binding partner that is also involved in coronal synostosis in humans and mice. Here, the authors demonstrate that as in mice, Twist1 and Tcf12 interact in zebrafish such that <italic>tcf12<sup>-/-</sup>; twist1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> exhibit coronal synostosis. Using successive bone staining in zebrafish the authors characterize bone growth in these mutants and find that though bone growth is slightly elevated in the earliest phase of formation of the development of the calvarial bones, bone growth is diminished later; these changes correlate with the incidence of synostosis. The number of proliferative osteoprogenitors and osteoblasts is increased in zebrafish, but in mouse only osteoprogenitors have an increased proliferation, though the total number of osteoblasts increases. Finally the authors demonstrate that the craniosynostosis phenotype requires loss of Twist1 from both the parietal and frontal bone. Together, these careful analyses make a compelling case that Twist1 and Tcf12 control bone progenitor cell dynamics to regulate normal growth of the calvaria and prevent craniosynostosis. The zebrafish work suggests that there is nothing unique about the neural crest/mesoderm boundary, but rather suggests that there may be directionality in the way that Twist1/Tcf12 regulate bone growth, though this possibility is not explored and the question of why the coronal suture is specifically synostosed remains uncertain. Nevertheless, these findings advance our understanding of the developmental function of Twist1 and Tcf12 in craniosynostosis in zebrafish and mice and will be of broad interest to the craniofacial development and disease communities. Additionally, these studies validate the zebrafish as a powerful model system for the study of the developmental mechanisms underlying craniosynostosis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript 'Altered progenitor dynamics prefigure craniosynostosis in a zebrafish model of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome' by Teng et al. presents interesting new findings concerning animal models of coronal suture fusion from <italic>TWIST1</italic> and <italic>TCF12</italic> mutations in the zebrafish and the mouse. This paper is significant as it demonstrates conservation of mechanisms underlying coronal suture fusion and presentation of Twist1/Tcf12 phenotypes in the zebrafish. The authors show independence of these suture pathologies to embryological tissue origin, suggesting that the common/ancestral developmental specification of suture formation may have different causes. The authors highlight changes in growth of the calvaria parallel/presage adult pathologies suggesting that changes in growth rate and potential may underlie observed pathologies. To support these observations the authors detail changes in the number of proliferative cells in the osteogenic fronts suggesting the defect in rate maybe attributable to lack of maintenance of progenitors/stem cells. The implications of their findings are first and foremost the conservation of mechanisms of craniosynostosis between zebrafish and mouse. This matter has been of much debate in the field with little data to support either opinion. The discussion of the similarities between the models and the independence to embryological tissue of origin (mesoderm/neural crest) is well done and important for the presentation of this work to the field. Second, the developmental analysis clearly pointed to early growth events as being primary to the changes in suture phenotypes in the models. This is in stark contrast to the center of much of the work in the field centering on suture mesenchyme and late maintenance of patency. The causes of the early shifts in proliferative capacity may be diverse, but the change in growth may be a shared phenotype underlying suture pathologies associated with synostosis.</p><p>Although these are strong points, the mechanistic data to support the changes in growth as underlying suture pathology is thin. My comments fall to two general areas:</p><p>1) Of general concern is the lack of sufficient experimental evidence to support conclusions of changes in postnatal stem cells as key finding of their mechanism. The authors look to BrdU and Sp7 expression to argue for changes in progenitor populations and proliferative potential. This measure is nicely tied to changes in osteogenic progression (surface). This is a measure of proliferation and not stem cells per se; the decrease in numbers could be in fact due to altered production of mitogens such as Fgf signaling factors that have been associated with altered suture fusion.

A significant and unexpected finding from our study is that the coronal suture is likewise most sensitive to loss of Twist1 and Tcf12, despite this forming at a mesoderm-mesoderm boundary in fish and a neural crest-mesoderm boundary in mammals. While we have not detected loss of other sutures in our fish mutants, we do observe occasional ectopic sutures and other skull anomalies in different mutant combinations, which we describe in detail in Figure 1—figure supplement 3.</p><p>Subsection “Specific loss of the coronal suture in <italic>tcf12; twist1b</italic> mutant zebrafish”: “Nonetheless, our results demonstrate that, as in humans and mice with reduced <italic>TCF12</italic> and/or <italic>TWIST1</italic> dosage, mutations in the homologous genes in zebrafish result primarily in loss of the coronal suture, although other calvarial defects are also rarely observed.”</p><p>In response to Reviewer #2(see new Figure 7), we have also examined several progenitor markers (<italic>prrx1a, grem1a, gli1</italic>) in mutant fish and mice, which reveal selective exhaustion of parietal and frontal bone progenitor pools. We also now show altered directional growth of the parietal and frontal bones in mutants, which brings these bones together earlier than normal at the prospective coronal suture zone. Accordingly, we have extensively revised the Discussion to incorporate these new findings and their implications while condensing other sections to make it more focused.</p><p>Discussion, second paragraph: “In particular, we found that increased diagonal growth in mutants brought the parietal and frontal bones together at the prospective medial regions of the coronal suture much earlier than in wild type animals, which correlates with the medial region of the coronal suture being most commonly fused in mutants. This altered directional growth might be one reason why the coronal suture is preferentially affected in both zebrafish and mouse Twist1/Tcf12 mutants, despite the different origins of the coronal suture in these species.”</p><p>Discussion, third paragraph: “We did not observe preferential expression of <italic>tcf12</italic> and <italic>twist1b</italic> at the coronal suture in fish, consistent with similarly broad sutural expression of <italic>Twist1</italic> in mice (Rice et al., 2000). Instead, osteoprogenitors in the coronal zone might be fewer in number at initial stages and/or more sensitive to loss of Tcf12 and Twist1, for example due to compensation by related genes at other sutures.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are remaining issues that need to be dealt with.
