Here, we applied a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model to follow in vivo behavior of adult muscle precursors (AMPs), the transient fruit fly muscle stem cells. We report that emerging AMPs send out thin filopodia that make contact with neighboring muscles. AMPs keep their filopodia-based association with muscles throughout their dormant state but also when they start to proliferate, suggesting that muscles could play a role in AMP reactivation. Indeed, our genetic analyses indicate that muscles send inductive dIlp6 signals that switch the Insulin pathway ON in closely associated AMPs. This leads to the activation of Notch, which regulates AMP proliferation via dMyc. Altogether, we report that <italic>Drosophila</italic> AMPs display homing behavior to muscle niche and that the niche-driven Insulin-Notch-dMyc cascade plays a key role in setting the activated state of AMPs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08497.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08497.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08497.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Muscles experience wear and tear over our lifetimes and therefore need to be regularly repaired and replenished by new cells. These cells are produced by stem cells, which often reside in a special microenvironment called the stem cell niche. This niche may also contain support cells that produce signals to attract stem cells and then maintain them in a dormant state. When the muscle is damaged, its resident stem cells are activated so that they divide to produce new cells. Understanding how this happens is an important goal for regenerative medicine, but many of the details remain unclear.</p><p>In fruit flies, stem cells called adult muscle precursor cells (or AMPs for short) lie dormant in the embryo and larva, but are then activated to form the muscles of the adult fly. These cells share many features with the muscle stem cells of mammals, which prompted Aradhya, Zmojdzian et al. to use them as a model to investigate how stem cells find their niche and are later activated.</p><p>For the experiments, the AMPs in fruit fly larvae were labelled with a fluorescent protein. Aradhya, Zmojdzian et al. observed that these cells produce long extensions that connect them to each other, to nearby muscle and to nerve cells. During development, these extensions are gradually lost until they contact only the muscles that are closest to the AMPs, which indicates that these muscles provide a niche for the AMPs and are perhaps involved in their activation.</p><p>Further experiments show that neighbouring muscles do indeed help to activate AMPs, as they produce a signal that activates a cell communication system called the insulin pathway inside the AMPs. Insulin signalling – which is sensitive to the availability of nutrients in the body – turns on another signalling pathway, called Notch, that then stimulate the AMPs to divide. Aradhya, Zmojdzian et al. propose that this signalling cascade might help to ensure that AMPs are only activated at the right time in development. The next step is to find out whether stem cells in human muscles are activated in a similar way.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08497.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08497.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>muscle stem cell</kwd><kwd>muscle niche</kwd><kwd>Drosophila</kwd><kwd>Notch</kwd><kwd>Insulin</kwd><kwd>quiescence</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Equipe grant DEQ20140329515</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jagla</surname><given-names>Krzysztof</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Myo-ID grant ANR-09-BLAN-0279-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jagla</surname><given-names>Krzysztof</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ID-CELL-SPE grant ANR-12-BSV2-0017-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jagla</surname><given-names>Krzysztof</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007393</institution-id><institution>Association Francaise contre les Myopathies</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AFM-15865</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jagla</surname><given-names>Krzysztof</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Adult muscle precursors (AMP) cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> send out filopodia to interact with neighbouring muscles, which drive the reactivation of AMPs via an Insulin-Notch-Myc cascade.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stem cells exhibit a remarkable capacity to keep a quiescent undifferentiated state, and then, once activated, contribute to developmental growth or damage tissue regeneration. Over the years, lineage tracing and serial transplantation assays have confirmed the presence of stem cell populations in many tissues in both invertebrate and vertebrate organisms (for reviews, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Voog and Jones, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Simons and Clevers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jiang and Edgar, 2012</xref>]). These populations include multipotent cells, such as hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) which can give rise to a broad range of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marquez-Curtis et al., 2011</xref>), and committed precursors, such as the satellite cells required for postnatal growth and the repair of a specific tissue, i.e. skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buckingham and Montarras, 2008</xref>). Importantly, stem cell activity and capacity to maintain tissue homeostasis depend on a specialized microenvironment called the niche. The stem cell niche was first documented in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xie and Spradling, 2000</xref>) but it is now widely accepted that all adult stem cells reside within a niche that retains them and regulates their behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Voog and Jones, 2010</xref>). Niches range in size and complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morrison and Spradling, 2008</xref>). They may house a single stem cell, like the follicle stem cell (FSC) niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nystul and Spradling, 2007</xref>), or more than 10 germ stem cells (GSCs), like the testis niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wallenfang et al., 2006</xref>). Niches may also occupy a single spatially invariant location throughout adult life (e.g. the GSC niche in <italic>Drosophila</italic>), or instead form a complex system of multiple niches distributed throughout tissues (e.g. HSC niches) (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morrison and Spradling, 2008</xref>). Like HSCs, which are able to reside in alternative niches, muscle stem cells (satellite cells) are scattered under the basal laminae of myofibers, which host them and contribute to their niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collins et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuang et al., 2007</xref>). However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that control niche occupancy by stem cells remain poorly understood. Recent work on myogenic progenitor cells, which ensure developmental muscle growth but also provide a source of cells that adopt satellite cell position, has shed new light on this issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bröhl et al., 2012</xref>). It has been shown that Notch signaling is required for the homing of emerging satellite cells by stimulating them to produce basal lamina, thus promoting their adhesion to myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bröhl et al., 2012</xref>). Crucially, if the homing process is impaired, satellite cells are unable to receive inductive signals and thus efficiently contribute to muscle growth and regeneration. This makes gaining further insight into the homing of stem cells and their responsiveness to the signals emanating from the niche a key challenge.</p><p>We have previously characterized the <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscle stem cells called adult muscle precursors (AMPs) that emerge during mid-embryogenesis and express muscle progenitor-specific markers such as the b-HLH transcription factor Twist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Figeac et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2010</xref>). The AMPs lie dormant during embryonic and most of larval life but once activated they will proliferate to provide a source of myoblasts that ensure adult muscle growth and the regeneration of a subset of thoracic flight muscles. We also followed AMP cells in vivo using membrane-targeted GFP, and found that AMPs send out long cellular processes, and are interconnected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Figeac et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, the capacity to send out cytoplasmic extensions and make interconnections has also been documented for quiescent satellite cells sited on myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tavi et al., 2010</xref>). All these features make AMPs similar to vertebrate satellite cells, prompting us to analyze their homing behavior and the mechanisms that drive their activation and exit from the dormant state.</p><p>Our data show that emerging AMPs, in addition to long cellular projections, also send out thin filopodia that link them to the neighboring muscles, which behave as AMPs cell niche. We provide genetic evidence that muscles act via dIlp6 to switch the insulin pathway ON in AMPs and initiate AMP reactivation. This leads to a Deltex-involving activation of Notch, which positively regulates AMP proliferation via dMyc.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AMPs display homing behavior and become tightly associated with neighboring muscles</title><p>AMPs are specified at embryonic stage 12 and then remain quiescent and undifferentiated until the mid-second larval instar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bate et al., 1991</xref>). We showed in earlier work that soon after their specification, embryonic AMPs form an interconnected network via long cytoplasmic extensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Figeac et al., 2010</xref>). A similar feature has also been reported for the quiescent vertebrate satellite cells, which are connected to each other and to the adjacent muscle through thin cytoplasmic extensions termed ‘tunneling nanotubes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tavi et al., 2010</xref>). To examine the dynamics of AMP cell morphology and behavior in more detail, we generated an AMP sensor line, m6-gapGFP (see Materials and methods) that enabled us to visualize the shapes of AMPs in vivo. We focused our analyses on the abdominal AMPs, which when quiescent form a repeat pattern of six cells per hemisegment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Figeac et al., 2010</xref>). Initially, at embryonic stage 12, AMPs appear spherical in shape and are separated from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), but a closer view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) shows that they send out numerous thin filopodia around their surface. This 'sensing behavior' also persists in later embryonic stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>), in which AMPs become more elongated and send out long cytoplasmic extensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) to form an interconnected network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Figeac et al., 2010</xref>). The long cellular processes follow the main neural branches of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C'</xref>, arrows), while the short filopodia display dynamic and irregular patterns and seem not to be attracted by the PNS nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C'</xref>, arrowheads).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08497.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Quiescent AMP cells are tightly associated with surrounding muscles.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) A zoomed view of quiescent dorsal (<bold>A</bold>) and lateral (<bold>B</bold>) AMPs bearing numerous thin filopodia.

Here, we showed that m6-Gal4-targeted expression of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) in embryonic AMPs does not alter their quiescence in embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, in the same NICD context, there were significantly higher numbers of AMPs in third-instar larvae, suggesting that Notch reactivates AMPs in larval stages and promotes their proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).

As the decrease in AMP numbers in a Notch-RNAi context has not been associated with a reduced level of GFP driven by the same m6 regulatory element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), we hypothesize that a low Notch level is sufficient to maintain m6 activity but we cannot rule out a possibility that perdurance of Gal4 and GFP in larval stages plays role as well.</p><p>In vertebrate satellite cells, Notch regulates the asymmetric divisions controlling the number of reserve muscle stem cells that, at the end of the cell cycle, sit on muscles and remain undifferentiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuang et al., 2007</xref>).

First, we quantified the level of Notch and dMyc in the individual lateral AMPs, and found that the mean fluorescent intensity representing Notch and dMyc protein levels was increased in the InRCA context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,C&quot;,J,K</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>) compared with wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,B'',J,K</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>) and was significantly lower in the AMPs expressing the negative regulator of Insulin signaling PTEN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J,K</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). The Insulin pathway thus positively regulates Notch and dMyc during AMP reactivation. Next, using the same approach, we tested dMyc protein levels in AMP-targeted gain and loss of Notch function, and found that Notch increased nuclear dMyc levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,D''</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>), suggesting that Notch acts upstream of dMyc. The sum of these observations prompted us to determine whether dMyc acted as an effector of Insulin and Notch pathways, and whether Notch functioned downstream of Insulin during AMP proliferation. We found that lowering Notch or dMyc levels in AMPs expressing InRCA led to an attenuation of the AMP overproliferation phenotype, indicating that both Notch and dMyc act downstream of the Insulin pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–G,L, M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). We also observed that the increased number of AMPs generated in the NICD-overexpressing context was dMyc-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H,I,L, M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>), indicating that dMyc acts as an effector of Notch in reactivated AMPs. Taken together, these data establish an Insulin-Notch-dMyc cascade governing the exit of AMPs from the dormant state and promoting their proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>). However, as NICD overexpression induces higher numbers of AMPs than InRCA overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>), we cannot rule out the possibility that Notch also acts in an InR-independent way.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Deltex-involving activation of Notch downstream of the Insulin pathway promotes AMP proliferation</title><p>The increased levels of intracellular Notch in AMPs expressing the activated form of Insulin receptor (InRCA) suggested that Insulin promotes Notch pathway activity during AMP reactivation. A similar observation was recently reported in <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestinal stem cells in which proliferation and differentiation is finely tuned by the interplay between the Insulin and Notch pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foronda et al., 2014</xref>). However, the issue of whether the Insulin-dependent regulation of Notch involves conventional Delta/Serrate signal transduction has never been addressed. We thus tested whether the attenuation of Delta or Serrate in the muscle or PNS cells with which AMPs are associated impacts on AMP proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). We found that knocking down Notch ligands in direct AMP cell neighbors has no effect on AMP reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). Similarly, expressing in AMPs a dominant-negative form of Notch receptor (ECN) devoid of intracellular domain and known to efficiently repress canonical Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rebay et al., 1993</xref>) had no effect on AMP cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>), suggesting that Notch activation in AMPs could occur in a ligand-independent way. To further explore the Insulin-Notch pathway linkage, we tested the expression of the ubiquitin ligase Deltex, which is known to play a role in ligand-independent intracellular activation of Notch by promoting its mono-ubiquitinated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hori et al., 2011</xref>). We found that punctate cytoplasmic Deltex expression increased significantly in AMPs expressing InRCA compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). Consistently with this observation, targeted expression of Deltex in AMPs or attenuation of its repressor Supressor of Deltex (Su (Dx)) both led to an overproliferation phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E,I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hori et al. (2011)</xref> proposed that non-visual β-arrestin homolog Kurtz (Krz) binds together with Deltex to the Notch receptor, leading to its poly-ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. We tested Krz function in AMPs and found that both increasing and decreasing Kurtz levels leads to overproliferation of AMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). This suggested that the stoichiometry of Krz and Dx levels regulates Notch activation in AMPs (see schemes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Indeed, reducing Deltex by RNAi-based attenuation or by overexpressing Su (Dx) led to an increased number of AMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 6-source data 1</xref>) similar to that observed in the Deltex overexpression context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>), whereas simultaneous overexpression of Deltex and Kurtz had no effect on AMP numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). It has also been reported that Shrub, a component of the ESCRT-III complex that promotes Notch degradation in multivesicular bodies (MVBs), acts as a negative regulator of ligand-independent Notch activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hori et al., 2011</xref>). We thus tested whether Shrub attenuation could promote AMP proliferation. We found that a downregulation of Shrub in AMP cells results in a burst of AMP proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). Consistent with all these data, overexpressing Deltex or Kurtz in InRCA context increased AMP cell numbers compared to InRCA alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). On the other hand, overexpressing Deltex in AMPs in which the Insulin pathway was attenuated by PTEN restored AMP proliferation back up to wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H,I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). Taken together, this body of evidence suggests that during AMP reactivation, the Insulin pathway activates Notch in a Deltex and Shrub-involving ligand-independent way.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08497.021</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Insulin-driven Notch activation in AMPs involves Deltex.</title><p>(<bold>A-B’</bold>) Single clusters of third-instar larva lateral AMPs stained for Deltex and GFP.

Here, we applied a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model to analyze cellular and molecular events underpinning Adult Muscle Precursor (AMP) reactivation from the dormant state, and identified a muscle niche-driven Insulin-Notch-dMyc regulatory cascade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) that governs AMP entry into proliferation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Homing behavior of AMPs to their muscle niche</title><p>It is widely accepted that stem cells reside in a specific microenvironment, the niche, defined as an interactive structural unit organized to facilitate cell-fate decisions in a proper spatiotemporal manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moore and Lemischka, 2006</xref>). The niche of satellite cells located underneath the basal lamina of myofibers is composed of cellular and extracellular components (muscle fiber and basal lamina) that are sufficient for satellite cell activation, proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zammit et al., 2004</xref>). Niche properties, particularly of its muscle component, also appear crucial for the regenerative potential of satellite cells during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakkalakal et al., 2012</xref>) and satellite cell engraftment in cell therapy approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boldrin et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The stem-like <italic>Drosophila</italic> AMPs specified in mid-embryogenesis lie at the origin of all the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bate et al., 1991</xref>), but the lack of appropriate genetic tools means we still know little of their behavior and niche requirements. Here, we monitored the morphology of embryonic AMPs using a m6-gapGFP sensor line and found that in addition to the long cytoplasmic extensions that connect AMPs together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Figeac et al., 2010</xref>), they also send out numerous thin filopodia and display homing behavior to a set of surrounding muscles. The newly specified AMPs initially display spherical shapes with short thin filopodia distributed around their surface, but shortly afterwards they start to send filopodia in a more directional way, become more elongated extending along the neighboring muscles and connecting them via stabilized cellular protrusions. Thus, the dormant AMPs, like vertebrate satellite cells, adapt their shapes to muscle niche and became tightly associated with muscle fibers, an assumption supported by dotty integrin expression associated with both AMP cell bodies and their muscle-connecting filopodia. Interestingly, the quiescent satellite cells also have the capacity to produce cellular extensions, called nanotubes, connecting muscle stem cells to the muscle fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tavi et al., 2010</xref>), which further argues that AMPs and satellite cells display similar behavior. How the homing of satellite cells and AMPs is regulated remains to be explored, but the Notch pathway, which is activated in AMPs and required to produce basal lamina by adhering to muscle satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bröhl et al., 2012</xref>), appears to play a central role. It is also unknown how satellite cells behave during their reactivation, how they adapt their shapes, and when they lose nanotube connections to muscle niche. Using membrane-targeted GFP enabled us to follow the behavior of AMPs and, for the first time, to visualize them at the time they are reactivated from the dormant state. Our data reveal that the AMPs maintain their elongated shapes with filopodia extending along the muscle niche during the first events of proliferation, which supports the view that muscles play an instructive role during AMP reactivation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Insulin-Notch-dMyc cascade controls AMP reactivation and proliferation</title><p>AMPs are reactivated from their quiescent state at the mid-second larval instar, but the signals and intrinsic molecular mechanisms regulating their entry into proliferation remain unknown. It has previously been shown that the Insulin/TOR signaling pathway controls the exit of <italic>Drosophila</italic> neural stem cells from their dormant state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chell and Brand, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2011</xref>). Global gene expression profiling also revealed that Insulin Growth Factor (IGF) signaling components are upregulated in activated satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pallafacchina et al., 2010</xref>). We therefore tested whether the Insulin pathway could reactivate <italic>Drosophila</italic> AMPs. We found that Insulin and TOR signaling components effectively promote the exit of AMPs from their dormant state, while also positively regulating AMP proliferation. However, increased Insulin/TOR signaling alone is not sufficient to end AMP quiescence during embryonic stages, suggesting a more complex regulatory cascade for the control of AMP reactivation. It has been demonstrated that the reactivation of dormant neuroblasts is driven by a nutritional checkpoint during the second larval instar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chell and Brand, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2011</xref>). Given that AMPs also remain quiescent in nutrient deprivation settings, we hypothesize that a nutrient-dependent switch in metabolism may contribute to AMP reactivation, and might thus be responsible for the inability of embryonic AMPs to enter proliferation. Quiescent stem cells have few mitochondria and use anaerobic metabolism, whereas activated cells switch their metabolism to a high ATP energy output aerobic glycolysis in order to support the high-level macromolecular synthesis required for proliferation, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Montarras et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, genes encoding glycolytic and pyruvate metabolic enzymes known to be downstream of Insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tixier et al., 2013</xref>) act as upstream regulators of the Notch pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saj et al., 2010</xref>), providing a potential link between metabolism and Notch in regulating the quiescent versus activated state of stem cells. A well-known feature of quiescent non-differentiated cells is that they keep Notch activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bjornson et al., 2012</xref>), but Notch receptor activation can also trigger proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baonza and Garcia-Bellido, 2000</xref>), including the proliferation of satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qin et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we followed the GFP expression driven by a Notch-responsive element of the <italic>m6</italic> gene and found that dormant AMPs are GFP-positive, which suggests that, like in satellite cells, Notch is involved in setting the AMP quiescent state. On the other hand, we also observed that during larval stages Notch promotes AMP proliferation, indicating that Notch might play a dual role, again like in satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qin et al., 2013</xref>). Notch acting in concert with Numb is also known to control asymmetric divisions of adult satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuang et al., 2007</xref>). However, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Numb has no impact on AMP proliferation, indicating a novel role for Notch in promoting symmetric cell divisions of AMPs. As Notch regulates the proliferation of cancer cells via Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palomero et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ishikawa et al., 2013</xref>), and Myc promotes the proliferation of myoblasts during development and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2012</xref>), we tested whether dMyc was involved in AMP reactivation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Our data show that dMyc is indeed required for AMP reactivation and proliferation. Genetic rescue experiments show that Notch acts downstream of the Insulin pathway and dMyc functions downstream of Notch. Interestingly, it has been shown that coordinated activation of Insulin and Notch pathways also regulates the self-renewal and differentiation of intestinal <italic>Drosophila</italic> stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foronda et al., 2014</xref>). Here, our data suggest that Notch pathway activation downstream of Insulin involves Deltex and is likely ligand-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The role of ligand-independent Notch activation, which involves interaction with Hif-α, has been reported as essential for normal <italic>Drosophila</italic> blood cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mukherjee et al., 2011</xref>). Our findings further highlight the biological importance of non-canonical Notch activation and provide early evidence for its role during stem cell-niche interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Muscle niche reactivates AMPs via dIlp6</title><p>The key role of the Insulin pathway in AMP proliferation raised an obvious question as to the source and identity of the Insulin Receptor (InR) ligand initiating AMP reactivation.

On the other hand, the lack of substantial effect on AMP proliferation observed in <italic>dIlp2, dIlp3</italic> and <italic>dIlp5</italic> mutants suggests that dIlps secreted to the hemolymph are unable to reactivate AMPs and that direct contact between AMPs and surrounding muscles via long cellular protrusions promotes the reception of local, muscle-derived dIlp6 by the closely-associated AMPs.</p><p>Thus, like for satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakkalakal et al., 2012</xref>), muscle appears to play a niche role while also proving essential to the activation of quiescent AMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Whether the Insulin/IGF signals play a conserved role in this process remains an open question, but the finding that numerous IGF signaling components are upregulated in activated satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pallafacchina et al., 2010</xref>) argues for this possibility.</p><p>Taken together, our data reveal several new features of the transient <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscle stem cells called AMPs, particularly their direct contact with muscles, which behave as an AMPs niche. Muscle appears to be the source of local inductive Insulin signals that reactivate AMPs and, via non-canonical Notch and its target dMyc, induce their proliferation in larval stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). If all the components of this cascade prove to be evolutionarily conserved, it is tempting to speculate that this same cascade may also control the reactivation of human satellite cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>All <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> stocks were grown on standard medium at 25°C.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers appreciate this original study of the communication between <italic>Drosophila</italic> Adult Muscle Precursors (AMPs) and their <italic>niche</italic>, providing interesting parallels with the niche of satellite cells in adult vertebrates. The authors report observations on filopodia produced by AMPs to contact the muscle and investigate signaling pathways that control AMP behaviour, with novel findings on ligand independent activation of Notch by upstream action of the insulin receptor, which in turn is controlled by dIlp6 produced by the muscle.</p><p>The following points need to be addressed:</p><p>1) Niche 'homing' behavior of the AMPs is the least well-supported part of the manuscript and relies largely on description of AMP position and morphology. Are the preferences for filipodial contact between AMPs and specific muscle fibers relevant, or merely due to proximity? This is easily tested using ablation of specific fibers or genetic backgrounds in which they fail to form (the Keshishian lab did this to great effect for studies of motorneuron innervation in the mid-1990s, for example). Such studies would bolster the idea that the cells home to the niche and may reveal some interesting insights.</p><p>The second and third paragraphs of the subsection “AMPs display homing behavior and became tightly associated with neighboring muscles” (“Embryonic AMPs are the immediate neighbors of somatic muscles […] tightly associated”; “Interestingly, filopodial AMP-muscle connections appear to follow a stereotyped pattern […] are decorated by punctate integrin’s expression”) need to be rephrased, as the description is not clear. Because filopodial extensions are generally viewed as highly dynamic, the characterization of AMP filopodia should include: range, dynamics (stability); target specificity; position of integrin accumulation. This is important to support the conclusion that &quot;direct contacts between AMPs and surrounding muscles favor reception of local muscle-derived dIlp6&quot; (paragraph two, subheading “Muscle niche reactivates AMPs via dIlp6”). If technically possible, an improved 3-D view (reconstruction?) of AMP/Muscle contacts via filopodia would help non-expert readers to appreciate the positioning of AMPS relative to internal, median and external muscle <italic>layers</italic>. What happens to signaling if filipodia are disrupted?</p><p>In conclusion, the authors do little to investigate the relevance of the filipodia in either homing or signaling. A detailed analysis is probably beyond the scope of this article but some attempt to clarify ideas about their function should be made, along the lines indicated above.</p><p>2) A second point concerns the Gal4 drivers used.</p><p>The authors’ statement that muscles are the source of Dilp6 acting on AMPs, is based on using a pan-mesodermal Mef2 driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 G-I</xref>). This driver could also affect the AMPS. An additional specific muscle driver e.g. MHC-Gal4 should be used. Furthermore, since drivers exist that are only active in subsets of somatic muscles, some contacted by AMPs, others not, use of these would be informative as to whether direct contacts between specific muscles and AMPs are instructive.</p><p>vM6-Gal4 is generated from a Notch dependent enhancer. This complicates the experiments when Notch is manipulated. For example, inhibition of Notch would reduce expression of M6-Gal4. This can in turn impact on expression of the other RNAi's and modify the phenotypes. At least some experiments should be repeated with an independent Gal4 to verify the effects.</p><p>3) The authors argue that the effects of Notch involve ligand-independent signaling, but they have not really tested that. Dx and Su(Dx) can also affect ligand dependent signaling. A strategy that blocks ligand dependent signaling would clarify this issue e.g. by blocking the ADAM protease.</p><p>The conclusion that N acts downstream of InR in stimulating AMP proliferation is novel and of potential strong impact in the field. Yet, the authors should leave open the possibility that N acts also independent of InR since overexpressing NICD induces higher number of AMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>) than InRCA, although not higher Myc levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Muscle niche-driven Insulin-Notch-Myc cascade reactivates dormant Adult Muscle Precursors in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The manuscript has been greatly improved and the new <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref> was appreciated, but there are some remaining modifications that need to be made to the manuscript before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) On the one hand, the authors use the expression from the m6 enhancer (m6-GFP) expression to argue that Notch is active in the AMPs, but then they now argue that the expression from the same enhancer (in m6-Gal4) can't be reduced when Notch activity is attenuated. These claims are rather contradictory. Most likely there is a simple explanation (perdurance of Gal4 and GFP in the latter?) but this does make the results confusing for the reader (e.g. subheading “Notch acts downstream of the Insulin pathway and regulates the proliferation of AMPs via dMyc” and in the Discussion: &quot;Here we followed the GFP expression driven by a Notch-responsive element of the <italic>m6</italic> gene and found that the Notch pathway was active in dormant AMPs&quot;). Can they be confident that this is reading out Notch activity at that time? Maybe the enhancer requires Notch for activation but not for maintenance? Given the data they have provided, I suggest that they tone down their statements.</p><p>2) Teasing apart the ligand dependent versus ligand independent Notch activity is tricky. The authors discuss in the rebuttal their experiment with the KuzDN, which gives minor effects that they argue should be ignored. But at the same time they place quite a strong emphasis on the role of Deltex despite the fact that the results in this section are confusing and contradictory (e.g. over-expressing and attenuating Deltex have the same effects, likewise Su(dx), likewise kurtz). Given these contrary data, it doesn't seem appropriate to make major conclusions about the roles of these factors so I suggest that they remove the scheme from the right hand part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and further moderate their statements about the role of Dx.

Are the preferences for filipodial contact between AMPs and specific muscle fibers relevant, or merely due to proximity? This is easily tested using ablation of specific fibers or genetic backgrounds in which they fail to form (the Keshishian lab did this to great effect for studies of motorneuron innervation in the mid-1990s, for example). Such studies would bolster the idea that the cells home to the niche and may reveal some interesting insights.</italic></p><p>The AMPs interact with immediately neighboring muscles but seem to have some preferences in interactions so that for example the most anterior lateral AMP interacts preferentially with LT and LO1 lateral muscles whereas posterior lateral AMP is mainly connected to the SBM. As suggested in comment 1 we performed a series of targeted muscle ablations to test AMPs behavior in the context neighboring muscles are absent. To do so we expressed inducer of apoptosis Reaper specifically in muscle founder cells using Duf-Gal4 driver (we favor genetic ablation method over laser ablation). This has led to a range of muscle ablation phenotypes (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 B-D</xref>) and the following observations:</p><p>1) In segments with partial loss of LT/LO1 muscles the anterior lateral AMP, which normally extends anteriorly to interact with LO1, LT3/2/1 (white arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) remained tightly associated with posterior lateral AMP and interacted mainly with SBM muscle (white arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 B and C</xref>).</p><p>2) In segments with loss of dorsal and dorso-lateral muscles and with some LT muscles persisting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) the dorso-lateral AMPs interacted with remaining LT1/2 muscles (arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) to which they do not connect in the wild type context (arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) indicating some plasticity in AMPs connections.</p><p>3) In segments with a pronounced loss of dorsolateral and lateral muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B and C</xref>) the dorsal and dorso-lateral AMPs adopted rounded shapes (yellow arrows) and were unable to migrate to other segments or to the ventral region in which muscles were still present.</p><p>4) In embryos with a total muscle ablation the majority of remaining AMPs adopted rounded shapes (yellow arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The number of AMPs detected was drastically reduced (asterisks indicate lacking AMPs) suggesting that in the absence of muscles AMPs do not survive.</p><p>All these observations indicate that there is a plasticity of AMP interactions with neighboring muscles. However, there is also dorsal-ventral positional information restricting these interactions in a way dorsal AMPs are unable to migrate and interact with lateral muscles when dorsal muscles are ablated.</p><p>Also AMPs association with muscle niche appears crucial for their survival as AMPs number is drastically reduced when muscles are absent (see progressively increasing number of lacking AMPs, indicated by asterisks, correlating with the severity of muscle loss phenotypes – compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B, C and D</xref>).</p><p>After analyzing a range of muscle ablation phenotypes generated in Duf&gt;Rpr context we assume that we already generated ablations similar to those that could be generated by drivers targeting subsets of muscles.</p><p>We also used anti-Elav staining to test whether in Duf&gt;Rpr context the PNS is not affected (data not shown). We didn’t find any defects in the PNS.</p><p><italic>The second and third paragraphs of the subsection “AMPs display homing behavior and became tightly associated with neighboring muscles” (“Embryonic AMPs are the immediate neighbors of somatic muscles […] tightly associated”; “Interestingly, filopodial AMP-muscle connections appear to follow a stereotyped pattern […] are decorated by punctate integrin’s expression”) need to be rephrased, as the description is not clear. Because filopodial extensions are generally viewed as highly dynamic, the characterization of AMP filopodia should include: range, dynamics (stability); target specificity; position of integrin accumulation. This is important to support the conclusion that &quot;direct contacts between AMPs and surrounding muscles favor reception of local muscle-derived dIlp6&quot; (paragraph two, subheading “Muscle niche reactivates AMPs via dIlp6”). If technically possible, an improved 3-D view (reconstruction?) of AMP/Muscle contacts via filopodia would help non-expert readers to appreciate the positioning of AMPS relative to internal, median and external muscle</italic> layers<italic>. What happens to signaling if filipodia are disrupted? In conclusion, the authors do little to investigate the relevance of the filipodia in either homing or signaling. A detailed analysis is probably beyond the scope of this article but some attempt to clarify ideas about their function should be made, along the lines indicated above.</italic> </p><p>Indeed a detailed analysis of homing appears beyond the scope of this article. However, to provide some insights into raised issues we performed series of experiments and provide now a more detailed view of AMPs localization, interaction with surrounding muscles and filopodia dynamics.</p><p>To better characterize AMPs localization with respect to internal, intermediate and external muscles (now schematized in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D’-G’</xref>), we created Z-stack movies of stage 14 and stage 15 M6-gapGFP embryos (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>) stained for muscles and AMPs. We incorporated slice annotations to indicate position of AMPs with respect to muscle layers.</p><p>These movies clearly show that AMPs are not associated with one particular muscle layer. Also the ventral, lateral, dorso-lateral and dorsal AMPs have distinct internal/external locations. The lateral AMPs extend from the external to internal layer. The posterior lateral AMP (arrowhead in Z-stack movies) lies the most externally and is seen at the same optical level that the external lateral muscles (ExtLM: LT muscles). The anterior lateral AMP (arrow in Z-stack movies) lies more internally, mainly at the level of internal lateral muscles (IntLM: LO1 and SBM). The ventral AMPs are located in between external ventral muscles (ExtVM: VA1 and VA2) and intermediary ventral muscles (ImVM: VO3-VO6) but they send cellular extensions externally and are seen at the level of VA1 and VA2.</p><p>The dorso-lateral AMPs are clearly located under the external DT1 and lies mainly in between the intermediary dorsal muscles (InDM: DO3 and DO4) and internal dorsal muscles (IntDM: DA3). Finally, the dAMPs are located in between the external (ExtDM: DO1 and DO2) and internal dorsal muscles (IntDM: DA1, DA2).</p><p>Note: Please view movies (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>) frame by frame to appreciate AMPs positioning and to see corresponding annotations. Corresponding comments are included in the Results section.</p><p>We also made additional αPS1 integrin staining at three different developmental time points to better document integrin distribution associated with the filopodia and with the AMP cell bodies. This is presented as Z-stack projections of lateral AMPs at three different time points (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 E-G</xref>’) and Z-stack 2 and 3 channels movies showing punctate decoration of lateral AMPs by αPS1 integrin at stage 16 (Figure 2–figure supplement 1A and 1B). We observed that the first αPS1 dotty signals associated with AMPs appear at late stage 14 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, E</xref>’) and are progressively enriched at stage 15 and 16 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F-G</xref>’). We observe punctate αPS1 pattern associated mainly with AMP cell bodies but also aligned with filopodia (clearly seen at stage 16, arrows in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G, G</xref>’).</p><p>Similar but more discrete βPS pattern is also observed (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H, H</xref>’). The AMP cell bodies and filopodia-associated αPS1 dots are also shown in Z stack movies (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Videos 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">6</xref>) – view 2 and 3 channels movies in parallel frame by frame to follow αPS1 dots associated with the AMPs and corresponding annotations. As filopodia are highly dynamic structures we hypothesize that the filopodia-associated αPS1 dots mark cellular extensions that are getting in contact with target muscles and are in the process of stabilization. This possibility is supported by the observation that a subset of filopodia get indeed stabilized (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>).</p><p>Corresponding comments were included to the revised text, in the Results section.</p><p>To characterize filopodia dynamics we performed lifetime imaging of M6-gapGFP labeled AMPs at embryonic stage 15 (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). The chosen developmental time window corresponds to the homing period in which AMPs actively send filopodia and try to contact target muscles. Z stacks were taken each 1 min during the period of 35 minutes. Leica SP8 confocal microscope with fast resonant scanner was used for live imaging. ImageJ was used to register and to annotate the movie.</p><p>We focused on and annotated the lateral AMPs. To follow the number of filopodia and the direction of their projection we labeled the extremities of all filopodia at each time point (indicated by yellow open circles, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). This revealed that the lateral AMPs send filopodia non-randomly and mainly in anterior-dorsal directions, which correlate with location of SBM and LO/LT muscles to which lateral AMPs are connected by stage 16. We observe that between 6 and 9 filopodia are produced at each time point over the lifetime experiment. Interestingly, some of filopodia/cellular extensions are more stable than others (indicated by arrowheads). The anterior lateral AMP extension that appears stabilized and persists until the end of movie (arrowhead) ensures connection to LO1 and LT muscles. Filopodia projecting in dorsal direction (denoted by the arrowhead) potentially connecting the SBM persists few minutes but does not acquire stable state.</p><p>Note: A frame by frame viewing of the movie will allow to count number of filopodia per time point and appreciate filopodia extension and retraction events.</p><p>We included the corresponding comments in the Results section.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we also attempted to affect filopodia and to test whether they play a role in signal transduction from muscles to the AMPs. To interfere with filopodia formation we tested several genetic contexts including overexpression of dominant negative form of CDC42 (CDC42DN) or Rac1 (Rac1DN), attenuation of Diaphanous (Diaphanous RNAi) and attenuation of DAAM (DAAM RNAi) (data not shown). Among them we found that AMP-targeted attenuation of DAAM encoding one of the formins produces the most penetrant phenotypes. In DAAM RNAi context we observed that AMP filopodia length is significantly reduced in 2<sup>nd</sup> instar larvae (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L</xref>) and AMP cell number decreased when counted in mid-3<sup>rd</sup> instar (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7M</xref>) thus suggesting affected AMPs reactivation.</p><p>These data support a view that filopodia play an important role in AMPs reactivation.</p><p><italic>2) A second point concerns the Gal4 drivers used. The authors’ statement that muscles are the source of Dilp6 acting on AMPs, is based on using a pan-mesodermal Mef2 driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 G-I</xref>). This driver could also affect the AMPS. An additional specific muscle driver e.g. MHC-Gal4 should be used. Furthermore, since drivers exist that are only active in subsets of somatic muscles, some contacted by AMPs, others not, use of these would be informative as to whether direct contacts between specific muscles and AMPs are instructive.</italic></p><p>We previously documented (Jagla et al., Development 1998, 125, 3699-708) that <italic>Mef2</italic> gene expression is excluded from the Twist-expressing AMPs and used here Mef-Gal4 driver based on this observation. In response to the reviewers’ comment, we however tested Mef-Gal4 expression by crossing it to UAS-GFP. We observed that, like <italic>Mef2</italic> gene, the Mef-GAL4 driver is strongly expressed in somatic muscles of second instar larvae but is not active in AMPs (documentation of Mef-GAL4 expression not shown). Thus we are confident that data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> are resulting from somatic muscle activity of Mef-Gal4.</p><p>Regarding drivers expressed in subsets of muscles such as Lb-Gal4 or Slou-Gal4 (we currently use in the lab for targeting individual muscles), they drive expression at relatively high levels in embryos but their activity drops down in larval stages and are thus not well adapted for studying muscle derived signals in larval stages. Moreover, the Slou-Gal4 drives also expression in ventral AMPs and Lb-Gal4 in lateral AMPs.</p><p><italic>vM6-Gal4 is generated from a Notch dependent enhancer. This complicates the experiments when Notch is manipulated. For example, inhibition of Notch would reduce expression of M6-Gal4. This can in turn impact on expression of the other RNAi's and modify the phenotypes. At least some experiments should be repeated with an independent Gal4 to verify the effects.</italic> </p><p>M6-Gal4 driver has been generated using previously described (Lai et al., Development 2000, 127, 3441-55) 2.1 kb m6 regulatory element covering -2098 to +37 of m6 and carrying 4 putative Su(H) binding sites. This element has been previously shown to drive expression of GFP specifically in embryonic and larval AMPs (Lai et al., Development 2000, 127, 3441-55). We agree with the reviewers that M6-Gal4 is not a perfect tool for manipulating Notch, however we observed that it keeps active in the context Notch is attenuated indicating that Notch is not the only regulator of its activity and/or that a low level of Notch is sufficient to maintain M6-Gal4 active.</p><p>The following observations are in support of this view:</p><p>1) After crossing M6-Gal4 with UAS-NotchRNAi line we observed a strong decrease of AMP proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G, J</xref>) indicating that Notch was attenuated and suggesting that M6 regulatory sequences are robust enough to keep active in the context of reduced Notch.</p><p>2) We tested activity of m6 regulatory element by imaging M6-gapGFP (GFP driven by the same 2.1 kb element) in wt AMPs (lacZ context) and in AMPs with reduced Notch (Notch RNAi context). Representative images showing anterior cluster of lateral AMPs acquired with the same confocal settings with a graph of fluorescence intensity are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>. This comparison reveals that attenuation of Notch does not lead to the loss of 2.1 kb m6 element activity. Measuring of fluorescence intensity reveals mean value reduction of about 10%.</p><p>Thus we are confident that the attenuation of Notch has no major effect on M6 driver activity.</p><p>Regarding alternative AMP drivers, to our knowledge, the only one reported so far is the 1151-Gal4 (Roy and VijayRaghavan, Development 1997, 124, 3333-41; Anant et al., Development 1998, 125, 1361-9). It is expressed in AMPs associated to 3<sup>rd</sup> instar wing and leg imaginal discs and it has also been reported (Sudarsan et al., Dev Cell 2001, 1, 829-39) that 1151-Gal4 is expressed from 1<sup>st</sup> instar in AMPs and in the fat body. Thus, 1151-Gal4 appears activated later than M6-Gal4 and its expression is not restricted to AMPs.</p><p>On the other hand, 1151-Gal4 is an enhancer trap insertion, mapped to cut locus encoding a homeodomain transcription factor regulated by Notch (Sun and Deng, Development 2005, 132, 4299-308). It is thus difficult to exclude Notch influence on 1151-Gal4, which seems not to be a good alternative for driving expression specifically in AMPs and in a Notch independent way.<italic>3) The authors argue that the effects of Notch involve ligand-independent signaling, but they have not really tested that. Dx and Su(Dx) can also affect ligand dependent signaling. A strategy that blocks ligand dependent signaling would clarify this issue e.g. by blocking the ADAM protease.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that we did not test all players in ligand-independent Notch activation and that Deltex can also affect ligand dependent signaling. In consequence we modified our statements in the text from “ligand independent Notch signaling” to “Deltex-involving Notch signaling”.</p><p>Regarding Deltex, we revise our statement in the text (“To further explore the link between Insulin and Notch pathway we tested expression of the ubiquitin ligase Deltex, known to be involved in ligand-independent intracellular activation of Notch by promoting its mono-ubiquitinated state (Hori et al., J Cell Biol 2011, 195, 1005-15)”).</p><p>Regarding, blocking ligand dependent Notch signaling, we already did it using a dominant negative allele of Notch called ECN and consisting of extracellular and transmembrane domains but lacking all the intracellular Notch sequence (Rebay et al., Cell 1993, 74, 319-29; Klein et al., Dev Biol 1997, 189, 123-34; please see revised version <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>). Overexpression of ECN was previously found to mimic loss of function phenotypes of Notch (Rebay et al., Cell 1993, 74, 319-29) and it was then used in more than 50 publications for mimicking/testing loss of canonical Notch signaling. We found that overexpression of ECN in AMPs has no effect on their reactivation supporting ligand-independent Notch activation. A notion that is also consistent with the increased number of AMPs after attenuation of Shrub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>Regarding blocking Kuzbanian/Adam10 protease we followed the reviewers’ suggestion and overexpressed a dominant negative form of Kuzbanian (stock BL6578) in AMPs. We found that blocking Kuzbanian function has a minor influence on AMPs number (about 15% less of lateral AMPs counted in 30 segments compared to control). This supports the view that Kuzbanian-involving ligand dependent Notch signaling has no major role in AMPs reactivation.</p><p>However, whether Kuzbanian acts exclusively in ligand-dependent way remains unclear. To our knowledge the ligand independent Notch activation also involves series of cleavages and in particular the gamma-secretase-involving cleavage of Notch-derived NEXT-like substrate, normally generated upon S2 cleavage by Kuzbanian (Schneider et al., J Cell Sci 2013, 126, 645-56). Thus, with no clear view on Kuzbanian function in ligand-independent versus-ligand dependent Notch signaling we thought including AMP count data from M6&gt;KuzDN context (data not shown) would not reinforce the already presented data.</p><p><italic>The conclusion that N acts downstream of InR in stimulating AMP proliferation is novel and of potential strong impact in the field. Yet, the authors should leave open the possibility that N acts also independent of InR since overexpressing NICD induces higher number of AMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>) than InRCA, although not higher Myc levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>).</italic></p><p>We agree with this comment and added the following statement: “However, because overexpressing of NICD induces higher number of AMPs than InRCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>) we cannot exclude a possibility that Notch also acts in an InR-independent way.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.] <italic>1) On the one hand, the authors use the expression from the m6 enhancer (m6-GFP) expression to argue that Notch is active in the AMPs, but then they now argue that the expression from the same enhancer (in m6-Gal4) can't be reduced when Notch activity is attenuated. These claims are rather contradictory. Most likely there is a simple explanation (perdurance of Gal4 and GFP in the latter?) but this does make the results confusing for the reader (e.g. subheading “Notch acts downstream of the Insulin pathway and regulates the proliferation of AMPs via dMyc” and in the Discussion: &quot;Here we followed the GFP expression driven by a Notch-responsive element of the m6 gene and found that the Notch pathway was active in dormant AMPs&quot;). Can they be confident that this is reading out Notch activity at that time? Maybe the enhancer requires Notch for activation but not for maintenance? Given the data they have provided, I suggest that they tone down their statements.</italic></p><p>We agree that because of GaL4/GFP perdurance it is difficult to argue for activation versus maintenance of Notch in quiescent AMPs. As suggested, we toned down our statements in the Results and in the Discussion.</p><p>In the Results, the original sentence “As the decrease in AMP numbers in a Notch-RNAi context has not been associated with a reduced level of GFP driven by the same M6 regulatory element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>) we assume that the M6-Gal4 driver stays active in Notch attenuated conditions” now reads: “As the decrease in AMP numbers in a Notch-RNAi context has not been associated with a reduced level of GFP driven by the same m6 regulatory element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>), we hypothesize that a low Notch level is sufficient to maintain m6 activity but we cannot rule out a possibility that perdurance of Gal4 and GFP in larval stages plays role as well.”</p><p>In the Discussion, the passage “Here we followed the GFP expression driven by a Notch-responsive element of the <italic>m6</italic> gene and found that the Notch pathway was active in dormant AMPs…” now reads: “Here we followed the GFP expression driven by a Notch-responsive element of the <italic>m6</italic> gene and found that dormant AMPs are GFP-positive, which suggests that like in satellite cells, Notch is involved in setting the AMP quiescent state.”</p><p> <italic>2) Teasing apart the ligand dependent versus ligand independent Notch activity is tricky. The authors discuss in the rebuttal their experiment with the KuzDN, which gives minor effects that they argue should be ignored. But at the same time they place quite a strong emphasis on the role of Deltex despite the fact that the results in this section are confusing and contradictory (e.g. over-expressing and attenuating Deltex have the same effects, likewise Su(dx), likewise kurtz). Given these contrary data, it doesn't seem appropriate to make major conclusions about the roles of these factors so I suggest that they remove the scheme from the right hand part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and further moderate their statements about the role of Dx. Altering Deltex activity does influence the AMPS but it is not clear that it is the main effector of the signaling through InR nor the critical regulator of Notch in this context.</italic> </p><p>As pointed by the reviewers, the fact that over-expressing and attenuating Deltex, Su(Dx) and Kurtz leads to the similar AMP overproliferation phenotype is surprising even if our interpretation based on stoichiometry of Kurtz and Deltex could explain this paradigm. In consequence, we removed the corresponding scheme from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and moderated our statement concerning Deltex and its role as InR effector.</p><p>We modified the following sentence in the Results section: “Taken together, this body of evidence points to the conclusion that during AMP reactivation, the Insulin pathway activates Notch in a Deltex and Shrub-involving ligand-independent way”. This now reads: “Taken together, this body of evidence suggests that during AMP reactivation, the Insulin pathway activates Notch in a Deltex and Shrub-involving ligand-independent way.” <italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1A</xref> presents a hypothetical scheme not directly connected to experiments described in the manuscript.
