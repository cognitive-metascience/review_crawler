MLI recruitment is tightly controlled by the profile of short-term plasticity (STP) at granule cell (GC)-MLI synapses. While GCs are the most numerous neurons in the brain, STP diversity at GC-MLI synapses is poorly documented. Here, we studied how single MLIs are recruited by their distinct GC inputs during burst firing. Using slice recordings at individual GC-MLI synapses of mice, we revealed four classes of connections segregated by their STP profile. Each class differentially drives MLI recruitment. We show that GC synaptic diversity is underlain by heterogeneous expression of synapsin II, a key actor of STP and that GC terminals devoid of synapsin II are associated with slow MLI recruitment. Our study reveals that molecular, structural and functional diversity across GC terminals provides a mechanism to expand the coding range of MLIs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>feed-forward inhibition</kwd><kwd>short-term plasticity</kwd><kwd>synapsin</kwd><kwd>presynaptic mechanisms</kwd><kwd>sensorimotor information</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-2015CeMod</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Isope</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEQ20140329514</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Isope</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004562</institution-id><institution>Ministère de l'Education Nationale, de l'Enseignement Superieur et de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dorgans</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Molecular, structural and functional diversity of cerebellar granule cell inputs on single molecular layer interneurons extends information processing in feed-forward inhibition microcircuits.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inhibitory interneurons mediating feed-back or feed-forward inhibition (FFI) provide brain microcircuits with an exquisite temporal control over the firing frequency of projecting neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hennequin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">O'Donnell et al., 1993</xref>). In the cerebellar cortex, the FFI microcircuit is activated by granule cells (GCs) that target two types of molecular layer interneurons (MLIs): stellate cells (SCs) and basket cells (BCs). SCs and BCs finally control Purkinje cells (PC), the sole projecting neurons of the cerebellar cortex, through a powerful somatic or dendritic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jörntell et al., 2010</xref>). In combination with the direct excitatory pathway provided by GC-PC connections, the FFI encodes sensorimotor information through acceleration or deceleration of PC simple spike activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong and Edgley, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jelitai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ozden et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Sensorimotor information is conveyed to the cerebellar cortex by mossy fibers (MFs) as short high-frequency bursts of action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chadderton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jörntell and Ekerot, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Powell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rancz et al., 2007</xref>). During high-frequency stimulations, cerebellar synapses exhibit several forms of short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) including facilitation and depression of synaptic responses in the millisecond range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atluri and Regehr, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brachtendorf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dittman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Doussau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Miki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Valera et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zheng and Raman, 2010</xref>). STP play multiple roles in information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anwar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fioravante and Regehr, 2011</xref>). At the input stage of the cerebellar cortex, a strategy based on the heterogeneity of STP across MF-GC synapses provides a mechanism for coding multisensory events at the level of single GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chabrol et al., 2015</xref>). Also, differences in the profile of STP across synapses involved in the direct excitatory pathway or in the FFI microcircuit control the inhibitory/excitatory balance and shape Purkinje cell discharge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grangeray-Vilmint et al., 2018</xref>). GCs which are the most numerous neurons in the brain, segregate in clonally related subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Espinosa and Luo, 2008</xref>). Despite such number and differences, STP heterogeneity across GC boutons is poorly documented. A seminal study has shown that the behavior of glutamate release during high-frequency activities at GC boutons is determined by the target cell (that is PC, SC or BC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bao et al., 2010</xref>). Following compound stimulations of clusters of GCs or beams of parallel fibers (PFs), it was shown that GC-BC synapses depress during high-frequency stimulation while GC-SC synapses facilitate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bao et al., 2010</xref>). By controlling the spatiotemporal excitability of PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bao et al., 2010</xref>), and potentially by shaping the inhibitory/excitatory balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grangeray-Vilmint et al., 2018</xref>), target cell–dependency of STP at the input stage of the FFI pathway must have important functional consequences for cerebellar output. However, target cell–dependency of STP at GC-MLI synapses is challenged by different experimental findings. First, many MLIs cannot be classified solely by their axon profile (e.g. basket versus dendritic synapses) or their position in the molecular layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Palay and Chan-Palay, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sultan and Bower, 1998</xref>) and it was proposed that MLIs represent a single population of interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jörntell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rakic, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sotelo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sultan and Bower, 1998</xref>). Second, release properties and STP profiles of GC synaptic inputs to MLIs can be modified by presynaptic long-term plasticity and by local retrograde signaling independently of the target cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bender et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Soler-Llavina and Sabatini, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Given the abundance of GCs and the importance of STP at GC-MLI synapses for cerebellar computation, we set out to study the diversity of STP at unitary GC-MLI synapses. Also, we aimed to uncover the molecular determinants of functional heterogeneity. Among presynaptic proteins involved in STP, synapsins (Syn) are good candidates underlying functional heterogeneity across cerebellar synapses. Syn are presynaptic phosphoproteins coded by three distinct genes (Syn I, II and III). Both Syn I and Syn II regulate neurotransmitter release and STP in mature synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cesca et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Humeau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Song and Augustine, 2015</xref>).

Here, we show that MLIs, regardless of their identity, receive four functionally distinct types of synapses from GCs. Each class of connection differentially drives the timing of MLI recruitment characterized by the first-spike latency. Differences in STP across GC-MLI connections are underlain by heterogeneous expression of Syn II at GC-MLI synapses. Functional studies using wild-type (WT) and Syn II knockout (KO) mice demonstrate that Syn II determines the profile of STP and the first-spike latency in MLI. Our observation that single MLIs receive GC inputs with distinct molecular and functional properties suggests that the temporal coding of GC activity by MLIs and thereby the inhibitory control over the cerebellar output via PCs depends on GC subtypes recruited by a given sensorimotor input.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Functional heterogeneity at unitary GC-MLI synapses during high-frequency stimulations</title><p>In order to study how information from single GC inputs is encoded by MLIs, we measured STP at unitary GC-MLI synapses in acute parasagittal slices by minimal electrical stimulation of PFs (10 pulses at 100 Hz), in the direct vicinity of the dendritic tree of a recorded MLI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Malagon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Miki et al., 2016</xref>). MLIs localized in the vermis (lobules IV-VI) were recorded in whole-cell voltage-clamp configuration and loaded with Atto-594 (<italic>n</italic> = 49) to visualize their dendritic tree and their morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Using two-photon microscopy, the stimulation pipette was visually positioned above an isolated dendrite. The stimulating currents were carefully adjusted to stimulate only a single synaptic contac (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). In 28 MLIs, we recorded synaptic responses from at least 2 GCs. STP profiles were highly heterogeneous across unitary GC-MLI contacts (<italic>n</italic> = 96) including unitary connections contacting the same MLI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To classify the STP profiles, we used principal component analysis (PCA) on the averaged and normalized synaptic charges in trains of EPSCs followed by a <italic>k</italic>-means clustering analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). We identified four clusters that characterize STP at GC-MLI synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). The profiles differ by: (i) the quantity of neurotransmitter released at the first stimuli (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, left</italic></bold>), (ii) paired-pulse plasticity (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, right</italic></bold>), (iii) the STP profiles during the first four EPSCs, and (iv) the ability to sustain glutamate release after the fourth stimuli. Because high-frequency stimulation can change the excitability of PFs, it should be ensured that no additional PFs are recruited during the train. Given precautions made to select the lowest stimulation intensity (see Materials and methods), such recruitment occurs randomly during the train. Recruitment of additional PFs may strongly affect the profile of STP from one train to another during successive stimulations and skew the classification of inputs. We checked whether the profile of STP was conserved during 10 successive 100 Hz trains. The systematic narrow clustering of 10 recordings belonging to the same series of stimulations in the cloud of point of PCA transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>) clearly indicated that the profiles of STP were conserved from one train to another during successive stimulations of the same synaptic contact. Recruitment of additional PFs might also depend on the intensity of stimulation. However, the lack of correlation between the charge of the first EPSCs, PPR, PC1 or PC2 and the stimulation current intensity indicated that STP profiles were not affected by this parameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Choosing intensities just above the threshold could also induce failure of fiber recruitment rather than presynaptic mechanisms. However, the classification of inputs using PCA transformation followed by <italic>k</italic>-mean clustering analysis was weakly affected when EPSCs at the first stimulus were excluded from the dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Hence, putative experimental errors due to unexpected changes in PF excitability did not influence the overall classification of inputs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41586.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Heterogeneous profile of STP at unitary GC-MLI synapses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Typical experiment showing the profile of STP during 100 trains at three unitary inputs recruited by local stimulation of PF at two different locations (Z1 to Z3).

Target-cell-dependent STP has also been described at cerebellar GC-MLI synapses by using stimulation of beam of PFs or clusters of GC somata; upon high-frequency stimulation, compound synaptic responses exhibit a facilitating profile at GC-SC synapses whereas these responses depress at GC-BC synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bao et al., 2010</xref>). At the opposite, our results show rather heterogeneous unitary inputs to BCs (contacted by three different classes of inputs) or SCs (contacted by four different classes of inputs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Although the lack of the main facilitating class of input (C3) on BCs may explain why compound GC-BC synaptic responses depress during high-frequency activities, our results argue against target-cell dependency of STP at GC synapses. It is likely that in compound responses, input classes associated with a strong synaptic strength mask the presence and influence of weak inputs exhibiting other profiles. Anyhow, our work suggests that the excitatory drive to MLIs and the tuning of the FFI pathway are more complex than expected.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Organization of synaptic diversity at unitary GC-MLI synapses</title><p>Heterogeneous expression and functions of Syn II in different cell types forming a same neural network have been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bragina et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Feliciano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gitler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kielland et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Patton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wei et al., 2011</xref>) but our findings bring the first evidence that expression of Syn II at a given connection can be heterogeneous. Syn II expression may be genetically determined at early developmental stages, leading to Syn II(+) and Syn II(-) subclones of GCs. It is interesting to note that clonally related GCs (that is, GCs issued from the same GC progenitors) stack their axons in a specific sub-layer in the molecular layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Espinosa and Luo, 2008</xref>) suggesting that the presence or absence of Syn II may be organized in a beam-dependent way. Since beams of neighboring PFs are activated during sensory stimulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wilms and Häusser, 2015</xref>), recruitment of Syn II(+) or Syn II(-) connections may be related to the activation of a given sensorimotor task. Alternatively, Syn II targeting at individual PF boutons may be controlled by a complex interplay of mechanisms regulating the traffic of Syn in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gitler et al., 2004</xref>) or organizing the assembly of the presynaptic active zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Owald and Sigrist, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Presynaptic diversity also arises from other parameters that probably expand the range of synaptic behaviors across GC boutons. Calcium imaging performed on single PFs revealed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics and regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx by neuromodulators in synaptic varicosities from a same PF are highly heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bouvier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brenowitz and Regehr, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang and Linden, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang and Linden, 2012</xref>). Also, local retrograde release of endocannabinoid by MLI dendrites can affect the functioning of subsets of GC boutons upon sustained activity of PF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beierlein and Regehr, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Soler-Llavina and Sabatini, 2006</xref>). Hence, functional heterogeneities among GC terminals also originate from the history of firing of each GC. To summarize, the synaptic behavior of individual GC bouton may be tuned by an intermingled combination of factors including expression of Syn II, presynaptic receptor composition, presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamic, number of active release sites, retrograde signaling and history of firing.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Control of glutamate release by Syn II in GC boutons</title><p>At GC synapses, releasable synaptic vesicles are segregated in two pools, one with fully releasable vesicles and a second one with reluctant vesicles, which are differentially poised for exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Doussau et al., 2017</xref>). The fully-releasable pool supports glutamate release during single action potentials while the reluctant pool is recruited only by stimuli elicited at high frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Doussau et al., 2017</xref>). In Syn II KO mice, synaptic transmission is characterized by a defect in glutamate release by single action potentials and by a rapid recovery of synaptic transmission by 100 Hz stimuli. This suggests that a lack of Syn II impair <italic>p<sub>r</sub></italic> of fully-releasable vesicles without affecting the recruitment of reluctant vesicles. Potentially, Syn II may act with several partners to control the recruitment of fully-releasable vesicles. In GC terminals, Munc13-3 has been involved in superpriming steps that tightly couple synaptic vesicles with P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> calcium channels (positional superpriming) or maturate the fusion machinery (molecular superpriming) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ishiyama et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kusch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>). Munc13-3 may indirectly act with Rab3-interacting molecules (RIMs) which are well known organizers of calcium channel and synaptic vesicles in the active zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Südhof, 2013</xref>). Since Syn II interacts with both Rab3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Giovedì et al., 2004</xref>) and P/Q type calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Medrihan et al., 2013</xref>), it cannot be excluded that Munc13-3, Syn II, Rab3 and RIM act in concert to reduce the physical distance between fully-releasable vesicles and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels.

Here, we show that temporal coding in GCs is later extended in the FFI pathway by an input-specific control of first-spike latency in MLIs.

Indeed, long-term potentiation (LTP) of GC-PC connections require the coincidence of strong PF and MLI activities onto the same PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Binda et al., 2016</xref>). As exemplified by the rules governing the induction of associative GC-PC long-term depression triggered by coincident PF and climbing fiber activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Suvrathan et al., 2016</xref>), induction of associative GC-MLI LTP may depend on the time window separating excitatory and inhibitory inputs onto PCs. Heterogeneous profiles of STP at MF-GC synapses and GC-MLI synapses necessarily induce wide range of delays between the direct excitatory pathway and FFI at the level of PC synapses. Hence, the fine tuning of STP at the level of single cells may have fundamental importance for the induction of long-term plasticity and ultimately for motor learning.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Syn II KO mice <break/>(CD1 backround)</td><td valign="top">PMID <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7777057">7777057</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">See Material <break/>and methods</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit anti-Syn I</td><td valign="top">Synaptic Systems</td><td valign="top">Cat# 106 104</td><td valign="top">IHC (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Monoclonal anti-Syn II <break/>Clone 27E3</td><td valign="top">Synaptic Systems</td><td valign="top">Cat# 106 211</td><td valign="top">IHC (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Monoclonal anti-Syn II <break/>Clone 19.4</td><td valign="top">Millipore</td><td valign="top">Cat# MABN 1573</td><td valign="top">IHC (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Guinea pig anti-VGluT1</td><td valign="top">Synaptic Systems</td><td valign="top">Cat# 135 304</td><td valign="top">IHC (1:600)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Goat anti-Rabbit- <break/>Alexa 647</td><td valign="top">Molecular Probes</td><td valign="top">Cat# A-21070 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2535731">AB_2535731</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IHC (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Goat anti-Mice <break/>Alexa-488</td><td valign="top">Molecular Probes</td><td valign="top">Cat# A-21141, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_141626">AB_141626</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IHC (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Goat anti-Guinea Pig <break/>Alexa-555</td><td valign="top">Molecular Probes</td><td valign="top">Cat# A-21435, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2535856">AB_2535856</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IHC (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Picrotoxin -

In all experiments, cells were voltage-clamped at −70 mV in whole-cell configuration (Multiclamp 700B, Molecular Devices). Data were acquired using the WinWCP freeware (John Dempster, Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Strathclyde, UK). Electrical stimulations were realized with a ~ 10 MΩ resistance monopolar electrode also filled with ATTO-594 for a precise adjustment of the distance between the stimulation pipette and isolated dendritic processes of MLIs. Electric pulses were adjusted at any GC-MLI contact and evoked with a stimulator (IsoStim01-D, NPI Germany). Variations of input resistance were not corrected but monitored. The recordings were not taken into account if serie resistance has changed by more than 20%.</p><p>Minimal stimulation was used to monitor STP at unitary GC-MLI synapses in sagittal slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To do so, we followed previously established procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Malagon et al., 2016</xref>). For each synapse, the intensity of electrical stimulation was maintained in an intensity window that avoided both stimulation failures and multiple-synapse stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Several parameters were systematically checked to choose the optimal value of the stimulating current ensuring the recruitment of a single synapse. First, the stimulation must induce a high success rate (&gt;0.4) and stable EPSC integral at the first stimuli in the train. The lowest current value reaching these criteria was chosen for minimal stimulation. Stimulating currents were rejected if they generated (i) systematic failures at the first stimulus, (ii) an increase in failure rate at the second stimulus, (iii) no decrease in the failure rate at the second stimulus for synapses with a high failure rate (~0.3 to 0.6) at the first stimulus, (iv) a strong (&gt;5 fold) increase in EPSC amplitude at the first stimulus in one or more responses for the same stimulating current, and/or (v) aberrant values of the paired-pulse ratios (&gt;4) during 10 successive stimuli. In almost 80% of experiments, the current values of minimal stimulations were inferior to 50 µA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Our results showed that current spread in cerebellar slices follows a biexponential decay function with two current-distance constant (τ<sub>1</sub> = 12.051 µm for ± 4.06 µm that accounts for 93.3% of current drop and τ<sub>2</sub> = 8.8*10<sup>−3</sup> µm ± 4.2*10<sup>−3</sup> µm that accounts for the last 6.7% of the drop). Given that intersynaptic distance on MLI dendrites is estimated to 10 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Soler-Llavina and Sabatini, 2006</xref>), nearest synaptic contacts of the recorded synapses received a current 52.9% lower that this latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). To summarize, it is likely that current spread properties ensure the recruitment of single synapses when using stimulation intensities just above the threshold.</p><p>We performed glutamate-uncaging assays onto horizontal slices by using MOSAiC patterned illumination system (Andor Technologies). MLI were recorded in ACSF containing 100 µM RuBiGlutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Valera et al., 2016</xref>). In order to find connected pairs of GC-MLI, we first used full-field arrays composed of very small photostimulation areas (15 ~ 25 µm diameter) and patches of GC were sequentially illuminated with blue light (460 nm). We took advantage on horizontal slice configuration to stimulate GCs localized at distant locations from the recorded MLI. Considering the weak probability of connection between GC and MLI, synaptic activities evoked by photostimulation of small cluster of GCs localized far away of the recorded MLI are likely to originate from unitary GC-MLI synapses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Post-hoc 3D reconstructions</title><p>After the experiments, two-photon Z-stacks (1 µm resolution) were done to reconstruct the recorded MLIs in sagittal configuration using the <italic>simple neurite tracer</italic> plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Longair et al., 2011</xref>) from ImageJ freeware (National Institute of Health, USA).

For immunogold labeling, the fixative solution was replaced by 0.1% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer. Transversal cerebellar vibratome sections (75 µm thick) were cut and processed either for ultrastructural analysis or for pre-embedding immunogold labeling.

Gold particles were then silver enhanced using the R-Gent SE-EM kit (Aurion) before being washed in distilled water and PB. Finally, the sections were post-ﬁxed in 0.5% OsO4 in PB for 10 min before classical processing for Araldite embedding (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and ultramicrotomy. The ultrathin sections were counterstained with uranyl acetate and observed with a Hitachi 7500 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi High Technologies Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an AMT Hamamatsu digital camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan).

GCs contact MLIs on their dendritic shaft and PCs on their dendritic spines. Since PC dendritic spines are devoid of mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Palay and Chan-Palay, 1976</xref>), GC-MLI synapses stand out from the large majority of asymmetrical synapses in the cerebellar cortex by the presence on mitochondrion within the postsynaptic compartment. Also, we only took in account synapses located to the upper part of the molecular layer to avoid GC-Golgi cell synapses. Morphometric analyses were performed using ImageJ freeware (National Institute of Health). We binned the number of vesicles (with 50 nm distance bins) starting from the active zone cytomatrix as a reference point (0 nm).

Your article is being evaluated by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation is being overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor.</p><p>A key question arose in the discussion with the editors and reviewers regarding methodology, which we would like to ask you about before we form a decision. Specifically, it was not clear how you determined that action potential failures did not occur during minimal stimulation. The reviewers noted that the 70 µA intensity seemed to give lower proportions of failures than the 80 µA intensity (in Figure 1—figure supplement 1) and pointed out that if stimulation failures indeed occur, the plasticity profiles could be erroneous. We would like to know whether you think that this concern is easily addressed, and if so, how. That point, as articulated by reviewer 1, as well as the other points raised in the reviews, are included below. It is not necessary for you to complete a revision yet, but please consider the reviews and respond within the next two weeks letting us know how you might address the points, including new experiments and timetable for the completion of the additional work as necessary. We will share your responses with the reviewers and then issue a binding recommendation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This work by Dorgans et al. examines short-term plasticity (STP) at single parallel fiber-molecular layer interneuron synapses. They find that STP is highly variable across individual synapses and that responses fall into four types groups using principle component analysis. They then show that expression of synapsin II is also variable across synapses and suggest this may account for at least part of the variability in STP. In syn II KO mice, release probability from PF-MLI synapses is reduced generally, and STP responses fall into only two rather than 4 groups, indicating reduced variability of STP responses. They go on to show that differences in STP at PF-MLI synapses results in correlated differences in the firing response of MLIs to synaptic stimulation. The authors argue that diversity of STP at these synapses increases the coding range of MLIs. The data are generally of high quality and the results are of broad interest. However, the manuscript lacks detail on experimental design and analysis in many instances. In several cases it is difficult to assess the conclusions without further detail.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The authors use minimal electrical stimulation to measure STP from single synapses. However, the profile of STP can be highly affected by the efficiency of stimulation. Specifically, failure to reliably elicit an action potential on the first stimulus can result in apparent synaptic failures and alter the apparent STP. Very little detail is given on the stimulus protocol in the Materials and methods, though it does state they avoided stimulation failures, how was this avoided? The Materials and methods cite Figure 1—figure supplement 1 where some detail is provided. From this figure, it looks like 70 and 80 µA stimulation activated a single synapses, but there are far more failures at 70 µA (is this true?). If the same synapse is reliably activated in each case the synaptic failure rate should be the same, suggesting the increased failure rate at 70 µA is due to failure to reliably evoke an AP in the axon. The legend indicates 70 µA was chosen as the minimal stimulation in this case, making me concerned that many recordings may not be reliably stimulating action potentials in the axon on the first stimulus.

Additionally, expression of synapsin II also differs across synapses and may account for at least part of the variability in STP, as demonstrated by tests of synapsin-II knock-out mice. Additionally, differences in STP parallel fiber to interneuron synapses correlates with differences in the firing responses of interneurons to synaptic stimulation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers agreed that the revisions have substantially improved the manuscript. One concern remains regarding the matter of stimulation intensity, namely whether each stimulus reliably evoked action potentials in parallel fibers, and it was suggested that it would be appropriate to show in a supplement a plot of failure (or success) rate versus stimulus intensity. In the consultation, it was acknowledged that even if failures were evident, it would not compromise the results and interpretations in a way that could not be addressed by a straightforward discussion and/or acknowledgment of possible sources error. Our consensus was that such a graph is needed simply for complete disclosure of experimental conditions. In the reviewer's words: &quot;What I would really like to ask them to do, is (1) plot failure rate vs stimulus intensity for every cell and exclude cells in which the failure rate has not reached a plateau at the stimulus intensity used, (2) provide a better example in supplement figure 1B including the failure rate plot and (3) add a statement that the stimulus intensity used was the minimum intensity that produced a failure rate of at least 90% (or whatever the real value is) of the plateau failure rate.&quot;</p><p>The reviewer's original expression of this point are included below.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>The authors have substantially responded to the reviewers' concerns and improved the manuscript, including additional experiments, changes to figures, additional supplementary figures, and major changes in the text. I am satisfied with the use of an additional syn II antibody and other responses to reviewer comments. I am reasonably confident that responses result from stimulation of a single synapse and not multiple synapses. The authors use an impressive array of analysis, experiments, and strict response criteria to establish that EPSCs arise from a single synapse.</p><p>However, I am less certain that an AP was reliably evoked in the parallel fiber with each stimulus. As I said in the previous review, in Figure 1—figure supplement 1B there are far more failures at 70 µA stimulus that 80 µA stimulus. This strongly suggests AP were not reliably evoked at this stimulus intensity, and a higher stimulus intensity (80 µA) should be used. The authors need to show a plot of failure (or success) rate versus stimulus intensity (as is shown in figure 2D of Malagon et al., 2016) and indicate the stimulus intensity chosen. Ideally, this plot should show that the failure rate reaches a plateau at the stimulus intensity used for subsequent experiments (though I suspect this is not the case for the data in the figure). The authors do mitigate this concern to a degree by showing that when the first EPSC is excluded the principal component analysis still produces more or less the same groups of responses (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). However, I still think the plot of failure rate vs stimulus needs to be shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41586.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors' note: the authors’ plan for revisions was approved and the authors made a formal revised submission.]</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This work by Dorgans et al. examines short-term plasticity (STP) at single parallel fiber-molecular layer interneuron synapses. They find that STP is highly variable across individual synapses and that responses fall into four types groups using principle component analysis. They then show that expression of synapsin II is also variable across synapses and suggest this may account for at least part of the variability in STP. In syn II KO mice, release probability from PF-MLI synapses is reduced generally, and STP responses fall into only two rather than 4 groups, indicating reduced variability of STP responses. They go on to show that differences in STP at PF-MLI synapses results in correlated differences in the firing response of MLIs to synaptic stimulation. The authors argue that diversity of STP at these synapses increases the coding range of MLIs. The data are generally of high quality and the results are of broad interest. However, the manuscript lacks detail on experimental design and analysis in many instances. In several cases it is difficult to assess the conclusions without further detail.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The authors use minimal electrical stimulation to measure STP from single synapses. However, the profile of STP can be highly affected by the efficiency of stimulation. Specifically, failure to reliably elicit an action potential on the first stimulus can result in apparent synaptic failures and alter the apparent STP. Very little detail is given on the stimulus protocol in the Materials and methods, though it does state they avoided stimulation failures, how was this avoided? The Materials and methods cite Figure 1—figure supplement 1 where some detail is provided. From this figure, it looks like 70 and 80 µA stimulation activated a single synapses, but there are far more failures at 70 µA (is this true?). If the same synapse is reliably activated in each case the synaptic failure rate should be the same, suggesting the increased failure rate at 70 µA is due to failure to reliably evoke an AP in the axon. The legend indicates 70 µA was chosen as the minimal stimulation in this case, making me concerned that many recordings may not be reliably stimulating action potentials in the axon on the first stimulus. Was the lowest stimulus intensity to evoke responses always used? And did this intensity have more failures than slightly higher intensities as is shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1? Malagon et al., 2016 (cited in the Materials and methods) appear to have used the plateau of failure rate to determine the minimal stimulus intensity, but (at least from Figure 1—figure supplement 1) that does not appear to be the case here.</p></disp-quote><p>Failure rate</p><p>A stable failure rate is indeed an essential criterion for ensuring that minimal stimulation actually recruits a single synapse. Several works performed at unitary GC-BC or GC-SC synapses report a failure rate ranged from 0 to 0.6 at the first stimulus (Ishiyama et al., 2014; Malagon et al., 2016; Miki et al., 2016). As noted by Malagon and coworkers, “stable, high success rate for the first stimulus (Figure 2D, dots), together with a stable EPSC integral (Figure 2D, circles), indicated reliable AP firing for each stimulus in the presynaptic PF” (Malagon et al., 2016). We used these criteria to adjust and choose the intensity of stimulation. We systematically probed the failure rate and the amplitude of EPSCs at the first stimuli and at the second stimuli (to probe the paired-pulse ratio) at several values of current intensity during 10 successive paired-pulse stimulations (real time measurement of EPSC charge was not possible). The lowest value reaching these criteria was chosen for minimal stimulation. In general this value ranged between 30 to 40 µA. Stimulations meeting the following criteria were not considered valid for minimal stimulation:</p><p>– stimulations generating systematic failures at the first stimuli (considered as infra-threshold stimuli).</p><p>– stimulations generating strong variations of the failure rate at the first and/or the second stimuli during 10 successive stimuli</p><p>– stimulations generating strong variations of EPSC amplitudes at the first and second stimuli during 10 successive stimuli (real-time EPSC amplitudes could be measured and visualized by superimposing the 10 traces)</p><p>– stimulations generating variable values of the paired-pulse ratio during 10 successive stimuli (again, real time estimation of the paired pulse ration could be performed during the experiment) -stimulation generating aberrant values of the paired pulse ratio</p><p>Despite such precautions, we cannot exclude that some of the failures are due to lack of excitability rather than synaptic processes. By using our protocol to select an appropriate intensity of minimal stimulation, most of the failures due to a lack of excitability are likely to occur at the first response. To estimate possible errors in the classification of inputs due to experimental errors at the first stimulus, we checked whether the classification of unitary GC-MLI synapses was influenced by the first response. Accordingly, we compared the classification of inputs by PCA and k-mean clustering analysis during 100 Hz trains by taking into account the first response in the train or not. Results are now presented in a new supplementary figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). As shown on this supplementary figure, the classification of inputs was weakly affected when the first responses were not included in the analysis. This suggests that the weight of the first response in the classification of input is weak and those experimental errors due to lack of excitability, if any, weakly affect this classification.</p><p>The cutoff distance of stimulation</p><p>To stimulate only a single synapse, the field covered by the supra-threshold stimulation current should be restricted to distance inferior to the intersynaptic distances measured in MLI dendrites. It is possible to estimate the distance covered by the supra-threshold electrical stimulation simply by moving the tip of the stimulation pipette away from the recording electrode. The “cutoff distance” of stimuli was measured using currents of increasing intensities elicited at increasing distances from the recorded electrodes. Results have now been added in the Figure 1—figure supplement 1. In our experimental conditions, the current dropped sharply when propagating into the slice. This drop could be fitted by a biexponential decay (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). In MLI, intersynaptic distance in dendrites was estimated to ~10 µm (Soler-Llavina and Sabatini, 2006). As an example, at 10 µm from the stimulating electrode, a current of 25 µA (value used in the majority of minimal stimulation experiments) drops to 16.8 µA. Since we always choose the minimal value of current intensity, it is likely that a 16 µA drop of the current intensity cannot elicit response in neighboring synapses.</p><p>Despite all the precautions taken, it could be argued that some stimulation could have systematically recruited 2 or more PFs in a stable manner without the experimenter being able to detect it. If so, this phenomenon is supposed to be associated with strong synaptic weights at the first stimuli in the train and is likely to occur for high current values. Conversely, weak current values can generate unexpected failures of PF excitability. This phenomenon is supposed to be associated with large value of PPR since failure of excitability decrease at the second stimuli. Hence, high and low current values may be associated with specific STP profile. We checked whether the charges of EPSCs at the first stimuli, PPR, PC1 and PC2 where correlated with the current intensity. Our result failed to show such correlations. These results are now displayed in Figure 2—figure supplement 2. The lack of correlation between these parameters and the intensity of current indicated that in most of the experiments, STP profile was shaped by synaptic mechanisms rather than change in PF excitability.</p><p>Stability of STP profile during 10 successive100 Hz trains</p><p>Because high-frequency stimulation can change the excitability of PFs, it should be ensured that no additional PF is recruited during the train. Given the precaution made to select the lowest stimulation intensity, such recruitment is supposed to occur randomly during the train (that is, not systematically and/or at different stimulus number from one train to another). Consequently, recruitment of additional PFs may strongly affect the profile of STP from one train to another. We checked whether the profile of STP was conserved during 10 successive 100 Hz trains at a given position of the stimulation electrode. The results are displayed in Figure 2—figure supplement 2. It should be noted that PCA transformation was performed blindly on every single trace and not on the mean values of ten successive trains. The systematic narrow clustering of 10 recordings belonging to the same series of stimulations in the cloud of point of PCA transformation (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A) clearly indicated that the profile of STP was very stable from one train to another at a given position of the stimulation electrode.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Looking at the traces, it appears the synapses vary greatly in the degree of asynchronous release, was this measured or considered as a variable? I would guess that differences in asynchronous release could have a profound impact on STP and the pattern of firing in the post-synaptic MLI. Did the amount of asynchronous release correlate with any of the response groups?</p></disp-quote><p>Asynchronous release is indeed variable from synapse to synapse and generally increases during train of high-frequency stimulations at GC-MLI synapses. Measurements of peak amplitude of EPSC only take in account quanta that are released synchronously and therefore underestimate release if a substantial number of quanta are released asynchronously. As mentioned in several studies (for a review, see Neher, 2015), asynchronous and synchronous events are both taken into account by measuring EPSC charge (current integral) instead of EPSC peak amplitude at each stimulus number. In this study, release events and STP were estimated by measuring EPSC charges. Hence, we are quite confident that STP profile could be correctly compared between all types of synapses exhibiting asynchronous release or not.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) More detail should be provided on the principal component analysis. It's not clear to me what a positive or negative PC1 or PC2 value means.</p></disp-quote><p>In our analysis, input variables were normalized and centered. This linearly scaled the values between -1 and 1 (Salton et al., 1975). PCA computes a linear dimensionality reduction on the original dataset using singular value decomposition ARPACK algorithm and computes eigenvectors from n-dimensional dataset (here, n=10; the charge values for eEPSC1 to eEPSC10) composed of multiple observations (x=116 synapses). The eigenvectors are used to transform original dataset into n’-eigenvalues through covariance reduction and variables are sorted from 1 to n’ (here, PC1 to PC5) where PC1 eigenvalues represent maximal variance into the dataset (and PC2 value, the second maximal variance, PC3 the third, etc.). Each Principal Component is explained by a relative proportion of variance from the n-dimensions of original dataset. Thus, calculating the Principal Components of a n-dimensional dataset is the perfect way to illustrate dissimilarities between x-observations by describing non-linearities between individual observations and neglecting co-varying parameters through a global dataset computation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Regarding Figure 4.

GCs contact MLIs on their dendritic shaft and PCs on their dendritic spines. Since PC dendritic spines are devoid of mitochondrion (Palay and Chan-Palay, 1976), GC-MLI synapses stand out from the large majority of asymmetrical synapses in the cerebellar cortex by the presence on mitochondrion within the postsynaptic compartment. Also, we only took into account synapses located to the upper part of the molecular layer to avoid GC-Golgi cell synapses.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Have you (or others) tested the reliability of the syn II antibody?

Indeed, we cannot excluded that anti-Syn II antibody (monoclonal antibody from Synaptic System) is less good that anti-Syn I antibodies.</p><p>To confirm the heterogeneous expression of Syn II in GC boutons, we performed a new set of immunohistochemical experiments with a Syn II antibody produced by another company (Millipore instead of Synaptic System). It should be noted that the use of Millipore anti-Syn II antibodies required to perform a heat-induced epitope retrieval protocol (slices were incubated 3 time in a boiling citrate buffer at pH 6 during 5 minutes) because Syn II signals were too weak with a regular protocol of staining. This retrieval protocol increased substantially the background noise for both VGluT1 and Syn II staining. Nevertheless, profile plots performed in the molecular layer of cerebellar sagittal sections using Millipore anti-Syn II confirmed the presence of i) VGluT1(+)/Syn II(+) puncta (presence of Syn II in GC boutons), ii) VGluT1(+)/Syn II(i) puncta (absence of Syn II in GC bouton) and iii) VGluT1(-)/Syn II(+) puncta (presence of Syn II in inhibitory synapses) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).

At many synapses, change in the paired-pulse ratio is indeed a good parameter to probe change in pr. However, the release machinery of GC terminal stands out by its capacity to recruited new sites (Miki et al., 2016) or reluctant synaptic vesicles (Doussau et al., 2017) in a millisecond time scale during paired pulse stimulation at high frequencies meaning that at these synapses, an increase in n (number of sites) underlies part of the large facilitation that occurs during paired pulse facilitation (Miki et al., 2016; Valera et al., 2012). The paired-pulse ratio was not significantly increased in Syn II KO mice (mean/median PPR for WT =</p><p>1.8/1.6 ± 0.08, n= 101 and mean/median PPR for Syn II KO mice = 2.6/1.7 Syn II ± 0.08 KO, p = 0.19, note that median are similar). These data have been added in the manuscript. This suggests that in Syn II KO mice, the recruitment of the reluctant pool at the second stimuli is normal and mask effect of low pr of the fully releasable pool on PPR (fully releasable vesicles = vesicles released by a single AP, see Doussau et al., 2017).</p><p>In Syn II KO mice, the number of docked synaptic vesicles (SVs) is reduced in comparison to WT synapses (Figure 6). The pool of docked SVs comprised unprimed and primed SVs (RRP). The RRP itself is segregated in heterogeneous population of primed SVs (Doussau et al., 2017; Neher and Brose, 2018). Electron micrographs from brain slices cannot permit to distinguish between the different pools of docked SVs and therefore give only partial information about the ultrastructure-function relationship. Nevertheless the reduction of the number of docked SVs in Syn II KO synapse may underlie, at least in part, the increase in the failure rate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The lack of target cell specificity in the heterogeneity of GC connections on MLI directly contradicts previous findings, which is acknowledged by the authors. One explanation they offer is that in previous studies, strong connections in compound responses (elicited by stimulation of GC clusters or by parallel fiber stimulation) could mask weak responses. The authors can and should directly address this important issue using their GC-specific photostimulation assay. Are there target-dependent differences in photostimulation-evoked synaptic profiles? (they might already have the data to answer this question).</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important issue. We addressed this question in the new version of the manuscript. We were able to identified 2 basket cells and 1 stellate cell (post hoc reconstruction) for which we recorded synaptic responses following photostimulation at 3 different locations (that is, 3 different GCs). These results were now presented in a new supplementary figure (Figure 7—figure supplement 2). The result showed clearly that either BCs or SCs are contacted by excitatory connections belonging to different classes. Photostimulation experiments thus confirmed the behavioral heterogeneity of excitatory synaptic inputs contacting same MLIs. We also performed a new set of experiments using compound stimulations of clusters of GCs or beams of PFs associated with post hoc identification of MLI subtypes (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Our experiments failed to show a target dependence of STP at GC-MLI synapses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Syn II is heterogeneously expressed across GC-MLI presynaptic terminals”: the authors correlate vglut1 signal with synapsin I signal (presumably in the molecular layer, although that is not mentioned) and report R= 0.584. They conclude that &quot;synapsin I is present in ALL GC terminals&quot;. I think this conclusion is not justified given the low R-value and should be rephrased.</p></disp-quote><p>In presynaptic terminal, VGluT1 is supposed to be exclusively associated to synaptic vesicles while synapsin are associated to synaptic vesicles or cytosolic depending of their phosphorylation status. Hence, even if both proteins are present in the same terminal they are not supposed to be perfectly localized. This explains the value of the Pearson coefficient for Syn I/ VGluT1 colocalization. We agreed that correlation values with the Pearson coefficient are confusing and we rephrased this part.</p><p>References</p><p>Neher, E. (2015).

I am satisfied with the use of an additional syn II antibody and other responses to reviewer comments. I am reasonably confident that responses result from stimulation of a single synapse and not multiple synapses. The authors use an impressive array of analysis, experiments, and strict response criteria to establish that EPSCs arise from a single synapse.</p><p>However, I am less certain that an AP was reliably evoked in the parallel fiber with each stimulus. As I said in the previous review, in Figure 1—figure supplement 1B there are far more failures at 70 µA stimulus that 80 µA stimulus. This strongly suggests AP were not reliably evoked at this stimulus intensity, and a higher stimulus intensity (80 µA) should be used. The authors need to show a plot of failure (or success) rate versus stimulus intensity (as is shown in Figure 2D of Malagon et al., 2016) and indicate the stimulus intensity chosen. Ideally, this plot should show that the failure rate reaches a plateau at the stimulus intensity used for subsequent experiments (though I suspect this is not the case for the data in the figure). The authors do mitigate this concern to a degree by showing that when the first EPSC is excluded the principal component analysis still produces more or less the same groups of responses (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). However, I still think the plot of failure rate vs stimulus needs to be shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p></disp-quote><p>Minimal stimulation</p><p>We carefully reexamined all parameters concerning minimal stimulations (failure rate, stimulus intensity, paired-pulse ratio) for all synapses that were included in our analysis in the last version of the manuscript. In this novel analysis, we increased the stringency of the criteria applied. In this new analysis, we then excluded 19 synapses (new n=96). We excluded synapses for which the failure rate dropped abruptly at current intensities below the intensity chosen for minimal stimulation as they may potentially be a signature of a recruitment of several synaptic contacts. These experiments were initially included because the increase in current intensity was not associated with an increase in the mean EPSC amplitude at the first stimulus. We also excluded synapses for which the failure rate was inferior to 0.4.</p><p>Note that the classification obtains by k-mean clustering analysis depends on sample size. Accordingly, k-mean clustering analysis changed the identity of a few synapses. However, no change in the main conclusion was observed: the same 4 classes of synapses were equally distributed in WT mice and unequally distributed in Syn II KO mice (near complete disappearance of cluster C1 in KO mice).</p><p>Figures 2, 5 and Figure 2—figure supplement 3 have been modified following modification of the dataset (pie charts, PCA analysis, means values of EPSC …)</p><p>Example of Figure 1—figure supplement 1</p><p>We agree that the example chosen in the previous version of the manuscript to illustrate minimal stimulation was not the most appropriate one. As suggested by the reviewers, we now show the plot of the success rate versus stimulus intensity, not only for this example (panel C) but also for all synapses that were included in the dataset for PCA and k-mean clustering analysis (panel B).</p></body></sub-article></article>
