To sustain synaptic transmission, compensatory retrieval of membranes and vesicular proteins is essential. We combined capacitance measurements and pH-imaging via pH-sensitive vesicular protein marker (anti-synaptotagmin2-cypHer5E), and compared the retrieval kinetics of membranes and vesicular proteins at the calyx of Held synapse. Membrane and Syt2 were retrieved with a similar time course when slow endocytosis was elicited. When fast endocytosis was elicited, Syt2 was still retrieved together with the membrane, but endocytosed organelle re-acidification was slowed down, which provides strong evidence for two distinct endocytotic pathways. Strikingly, CaM inhibitors or the inhibition of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin-Munc13-1 signaling pathway only impaired the uptake of Syt2 while leaving membrane retrieval intact, indicating different recycling mechanisms for membranes and vesicle proteins. Our data identify a novel mechanism of stimulus- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent regulation of coordinated endocytosis of synaptic membranes and vesicle proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14643.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14643.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14643.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nerve cells release chemicals called neurotransmitters to communicate with each other. The neurotransmitters are packaged inside membrane-encased sacs called vesicles that fuse with the cell’s membrane and release their contents into the space between the nerve cells. The vesicle membrane (which also has proteins embedded in it) can then be retrieved into the cell, and recycled to make new vesicles ready to release more neurotransmitters.</p><p>Recycling vesicle components requires highly coordinated mechanisms that regulate how much membrane and vesicle protein is retrieved from the cell membrane. Researchers interested in these processes have often studied them at a part of the brainstem of mammals known as the calyx of Held. However, many of the details about how vesicle proteins are recycled remained unclear.</p><p>Okamoto et al. have now measured vesicle membrane and protein retrieval at the same time and in the same cell at the calyx of Held from rats and mice. The cell surface area was also measured, and the experiments focused on a fluorescently tagged version of a vesicle protein called Synaptotagmin2 that could be tracked under a microscope. Okamoto et al. found that, in weakly active nerve cells, the vesicle membrane and Synaptotagmin2 were retrieved together at a slow rate. The process was faster in more active nerve cells, and Synaptotagmin2 was still retrieved with the membrane but it appeared to be stored first in larger sacs. This suggests that membrane and vesicle proteins may be retrieved via two distinct modes depending on the activity strength. The results of further experiments went on to suggest that vesicle membranes might be recycled in a different way from vesicle proteins.</p><p>Finally, Okamoto et al. also found a signaling pathway that couples the uptake of vesicle membrane with uptake of Synaptotagmin2. Future studies could now explore how these processes work in other types of nerve cell.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14643.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14643.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>exocytosis</kwd><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>synaptic terminals</kwd><kwd>image analysis</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>transgenic animals</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>JSPS/MEXT KAKENHI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15H04261</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sakaba</surname><given-names>Takeshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Core-to-Core Program A</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sakaba</surname><given-names>Takeshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Torey Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sakaba</surname><given-names>Takeshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008732</institution-id><institution>Uehara Memorial Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sakaba</surname><given-names>Takeshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ERC Advanced Grant of the European Union</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brose</surname><given-names>Nils</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>JSPS/MEXT KAKENHI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15K14321</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sakaba</surname><given-names>Takeshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>JSPS/MEXT KAKENHI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26110720</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sakaba</surname><given-names>Takeshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>JSPS/MEXT KAKENHI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15K18346</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Midorikawa</surname><given-names>Mitsuharu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Capacitance measurements and pH imaging reveal distinct modes of uptake for endocytotic presynaptic membrane and proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synaptic transmission relies on neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals, which is mediated by exocytotic fusion of synaptic vesicles (SVs) with the plasma membrane. Following exocytosis, vesicular components are retrieved by endocytosis, and recycled for subsequent rounds of exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Südhof, 2004</xref>). SV recycling has been studied for decades using electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heuser and Reese, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ceccarelli et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takei et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schikorski and Stevens, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Watanabe et al., 2013</xref>), membrane capacitance measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">von Gersdorff and Matthews, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moser and Beutner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sun and Wu, 2001</xref>), and live imaging of fluorescent markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Betz and Bewick, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miesenböck et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sankaranarayanan and Ryan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hua et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Two major modes of vesicle fusion have been proposed, kiss-and-run, in which the membrane fusion occurs transiently and vesicle membrane is retrieved simply by fusion pore closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fesce et al., 1994</xref>), and full fusion, where the vesicle membrane collapses into the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cremona and De Camilli, 1997</xref>). In the kiss-and-run scenario, the fusing vesicles are thought to largely maintain their identity as regards membrane and protein composition, but it is not clear how membrane and protein retrieval is coordinated when full fusion occurs.</p><p>As for membrane retrieval, capacitance measurements revealed a fast and a slow endocytosis component. Fast endocytosis with a time constant of less than few seconds, is seen when a strong stimulus is applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xue et al., 2012</xref>), and often involves excess membrane retrieval. In contrast, slow endocytosis, which is a major form of endocytosis, has a time constant of seconds to tens of seconds, and at a variety of synapses, the amount of membrane endocytosed in this manner is similar to the amount of membrane that had previously been exocytosed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">von Gersdorff and Matthews, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moser and Beutner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sun and Wu, 2001</xref>). Subsequent studies showed that fast and slow endocytosis reflects clathrin-independent and clathrin-dependent modes of endocytosis, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamashita et al., 2010</xref>), and that the contribution of fast endocytosis increased progressively by applying stronger stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Renden and von Gersdorff, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamashita et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Midorikawa et al., 2014</xref>). Precise control of the amount of membrane retrieval has high physiological relevance, since perturbation of membrane retrieval induces use-dependent depletion of the releasable vesicles and rundown of exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The maintenance of transmitter release is not only dependent on membrane retrieval following membrane fusion, but also on the recovery of vesicular proteins into the recycling vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kononenko and Haucke, 2015</xref>). Vesicle protein recycling has been studied mainly by using a pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein (GFP) variant, pHluorin, as a vesicle protein marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miesenböck et al., 1998</xref>). Except for kiss-and-run events, retrieval of vesicular proteins seems to be slow, with a time constant of seconds to tens of seconds, similar to the time constant of membrane retrieval during slow endocytosis as assessed by capacitance measurements. However, in contrast to membrane retrieval, the retrieval of synaptic proteins slows down as stimulation persists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armbruster et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fernández-Alfonso and Ryan, 2004</xref>). Further, exocytosed vesicular proteins, such as VAMP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sankaranarayanan and Ryan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gandhi and Stevens, 2003</xref>), synaptophysin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Granseth et al., 2006</xref>), synaptotagmin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernández-Alfonso et al., 2006</xref>), and VGLUT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balaji and Ryan, 2007</xref>), appear to be retrieved into endocytotic organelles to similar extents. Proper endocytotic retrieval is of high physiological relevance, given that clearance of vesicle proteins from transmitter release sites is required for the maintenance of synaptic transmission and that insufficient retrieval leads to the slowed recruitment of SVs to release sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hosoi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hua et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies on endocytotic membrane retrieval based on capacitance measurements and on endocytotic protein recycling indicate the presence of highly coordinated mechanisms that regulate the extent of membrane and protein retrieval after exocytosis. Several endocytotic proteins, such as AP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Traub, 2009</xref>), AP180 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koo et al., 2011</xref>), endophilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Milosevic et al., 2011</xref>), or stonin 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kononenko et al., 2013</xref>), were proposed as potential adaptors for endocytocic vesicle protein sorting, but the detailed mechanisms are still debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Opazo and Rizzoli, 2010</xref>). In addition, little is known about corresponding upstream modulatory or regulatory processes and their activity dependence.</p><p>To gain detailed insight into the mechanisms of exo-endocytosis coupling, simultaneous measurements of membrane retrieval and vesicle protein retrieval are required that allow for the separate assessment of membrane retrieval kinetics and vesicle protein retrieval kinetics in the same cell. Such simultaneous measurements would further allow us to address the known kinetic differences between capacitance measurements and pHluorin-based measurements.</p><p>The calyx of Held synapse is a mammalian model system of synaptic transmission at central synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Forsythe, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borst and Sakmann, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu and Borst, 1999</xref>). The large terminal size (10–20 μm) enables simultaneous voltage-clamp recordings from pre- and post-synaptic compartments, so that the kinetics of exocytosis can be dissected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu and Borst, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sakaba and Neher, 2001</xref>). In addition, the extent and time course of membrane fusion and retrieval can be monitored by membrane capacitance measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sun and Wu, 2001</xref>). Correspondingly, the calyx of Held is one of the best characterized synapses as regards the relationship between the kinetics of exo- and endocytosis. However, the dynamics of endocytotic vesicle protein recycling has remained unclear even in this synapse.</p><p>To monitor the dynamics of endocytotic vesicle protein recycling at the calyx terminal, we used the cypHer5E fluorophore (referred hereafter as cypHer; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adie et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hua et al., 2011</xref>), as an exo-endocytosis reporter. The cypHer moiety, which has a pH dependence opposite to pHluorin (i.e. fluorescent in acidic pH, and quenched in neutral pH), was coupled to antibodies against the luminal domain of Synaptotagmin 2 (anti-Syt2-cypHer), an endogenous SV protein at the calyx of Held terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pang et al., 2006</xref>), so that our strategy directly labels an endogenous vesicle protein with cypHer. We combined capacitance measurements and pH-sensitive vesicle protein imaging at the calyx of Held presynaptic terminal to simultaneously monitor the kinetics of membrane and vesicular protein exo-endocytosis. Upon stimulation, we found a 12–14 s delay followed by a 20–40 s decay time constant for re-acidification of retrieved Syt2-containing organelle. By comparing the time courses of endocytotic membrane and Syt2 uptake, we discovered distinct modes of membrane and protein uptake depending on stimulus intensities, and key signaling mechanisms that maintain the coordinated uptake.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Simultaneous recordings of membrane capacitance and anti-Syt2-cypHer uptake</title><p>To visualize the turnover of the vesicular protein Syt2, we labeled calyx terminals with anti-Syt2-cypHer in a slice preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The 200 μm transverse brainstem slices were incubated for 30 min in a high potassium solution (32.5 mM) containing anti-Syt2-cypHer (0.01 mg/ml) to depolarize the terminals and induce exocytosis followed by endocytosis, in which the anti-Syt2-cypHer is internalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The fluorescence of the cypHer dye is almost quenched at the neutral extracellular pH of 7.4 after SV exocytosis and is almost maximal at the intravesicular pH of 5.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hua et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, the cup-shaped structures observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> can be assumed to be calyx terminals filled with anti-Syt2-cypHer-containing internalized vesicles. The staining was calyx specific in this region, and anti-Syt2-cypHer showed a stimulus dependent fluorescence change when field stimulations were applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hua et al., 2011</xref>). Anti-Syt2-cypHer exposed to the membrane surface is barely fluorescent, so that background fluorescence is kept low even in a slice preparation. To measure the kinetics of Syt2 and plasma membrane recycling simultaneously, labeled calyx terminals were whole-cell voltage clamped, and the membrane capacitance and the cypHer signal were measured. When the terminal was stimulated with a train (10 times, 200 ms intervals) of depolarization pulses (0 mV for 50 ms following a prepulse to +70 mV for 2 ms), large capacitance jumps caused by exocytosis were observed (1.52 ± 0. 21 pF after 10 pulses, n = 7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). A 50 ms pulse is sufficient to deplete the readily-releasable pool of SVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hosoi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamashita et al., 2010</xref>), and the following pulses mainly reflect release of newly-replenished SVs at release sites. The capacitance decayed bi-exponentially with two time constants of a few seconds (τ = 5.2 s, 37% ) and tens of seconds (τ = 66.5 s, 63% ), reflecting clathrin-independent and dependent endocytosis, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamashita et al., 2010</xref>). During the recording, we also measured the fluorescence of the cypHer signal. The cypHer fluorescence showed a rapid decrease upon stimulation, followed by a slow recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The time course of fluorescence change reflects the kinetics of exocytosis and subsequent endocytosis. To compare the time course of membrane capacitance traces and cypHer fluorescence traces, we inverted the cypHer traces. Comparison of the recovery time course of the capacitance traces and the cypHer traces showed that both returned to ~0.4 of the peak value after 60 s (C<sub>m</sub>, 0.33 ± 0.06, n = 7; F, 0.47 ± 0.07, n = 10, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Two notable features are revealed by comparing capacitance and cypHer measurements: (1) C<sub>m</sub> had a rapid decay component whereas cypHer signals did not (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. below); (2) CypHer signals showed a delay in the decay phase as compared with the decay of the capacitance values. The delayed recovery of cypHer signal is consistent with reports showing that acidification of glutamatergic SVs occurs with a time constant of tens of seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Egashira et al., 2015</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atluri and Ryan, 2006</xref>). Fitting of the recovery time course of the cypHer signal was optimal when we assumed a re-acidification time constant of 38.7 s and a 14 s delay of onset after membrane retrieval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The asymptotic value (extrapolated from the exponential fit) of the fluorescence recovery (0.13 from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) was similar to that of the capacitance trace (0.12 from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), which indicated that the rate of endocytosis becomes as low as that of re-acidification.

We applied four consecutive 50 ms depolarizing pulses with 20 s intervals, and simultaneously measured the size of the capacitance jumps and the cypHer fluorescence change. With this protocol, capacitance jumps showed a gradual decrease because of incomplete recovery of the readily releasable vesicle pool between the stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

It has been shown that the amount of fast mode of endocytosis was gradually increased by elongating pulse durations in P8-11 calyx of Held terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Renden and von Gersdorff, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamashita et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Midorikawa et al., 2014</xref>). While the kinetics of this membrane retrieval has been characterized, the kinetics of the accompanying protein retrieval is largely unknown.</p><p>In this set of experiments, the calyx terminal was stimulated by a 2 s depolarization pulse to induce only a fast mode of endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yao and Sakaba, 2012</xref>). The membrane capacitance showed a large jump upon the stimulation (&gt;1 pF, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, left), and decayed rapidly after the stimulation, which is consistent with previous studies. This fast mode of endocytosis is shown to be insensitive to dynamin inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamashita et al., 2010</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xu et al., 2008</xref>), as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> fast component, suggesting the same mechanism. On the contrary, the cypHer signal barely showed a recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, right). The discrepancy was more clearly seen when we compared the averaged traces of membrane capacitance and cypHer signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This is different from the results obtained with trains of ten 50 ms depolarizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), where membrane capacitance and cypHer signal decayed with more similar time courses. In fact, the recovery time course of cypHer signal after the 2 s depolarization was even slower than after trains of ten 50 ms depolarizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, 40 s after the stimulus; 50 ms x 10, 0.70 ± 0.04, n = 10; 2 s, 0.93 ± 0.07, n = 9, p=0.019). To explain the delayed cypHer signal recovery after the 2 s depolarization condition, we considered two possibilities: (i) the anti-Syt2-cypHer was not retrieved together with the endocytosed membrane and left behind at the plasma membrane surface, or (ii) the anti-Syt2-cypHer was retrieved via endocytosed organelles, but the intra-organelle pH was not (or barely) re-acidified after endocytosis. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we briefly (5 s) applied an acidic solution (pH 5.5) extracellularly before (20 s) and after (40 s) the stimulation to de-quench the surface-exposed anti-Syt2-cypHer. In the 2 s pulse condition, membrane retrieval assessed by capacitance measurements is essentially completed 40 s after the stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). If the anti-Syt2-cypHer were taken up into the endocytosed organelle, there should be no difference in the amount of de-quenching before and after the stimulation. On the other hand, the amount of de-quenching should be higher after stimulation if anti-Syt2-cypHer were not taken up and left behind at the plasma membrane. We found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>) that the amount of de-quenching was not different before or after the stimulation (pre, 0.40 ± 0.16; post, 0.41 ± 0.10, n = 5, p=0.66), indicating that anti-Syt2-cypHer was retrieved via endocytosed organelles, but was not (or barely) re-acidified. The lack of re-acidification in the newly endocytosed organelles after a 2 s depolarization can be explained if the membrane endocytosis occurred as bulk endocytosis, which is seen after strong stimulation of the calyx terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Lange et al., 2003</xref>). Longer post-stimulus recordings showed a sign of cypHer signal recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), which is consistent with the idea that anti-Syt2-cypHer is initially taken up via larger endosomal-like structure formed by bulk endocytosis, followed by slow re-acidification due to the larger volume-to-surface ratio.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Effect of calmodulin blockade on Syt2 uptake</title><p>Calmodulin (CaM) plays a role during endocytosis, and its contribution is dependent on the age of the animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamashita et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yao and Sakaba, 2012</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2009</xref>). In addition to its role in endocytosis itself, it was suggested that CaM is crucial for clearing fused vesicle membrane and proteins from release sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hosoi et al., 2009</xref>). To test the role of CaM in coordinated membrane and Syt2 retrieval during the slow mode of endocytosis, we inhibited CaM function by intracellular application of a CaM inhibitory peptide (20 μM). We whole-cell voltage clamped the calyx terminal and waited for 4–5 min to allow the peptide to diffuse into the terminal. Then, a train of ten 50 ms depolarizations was applied to evoke exocytosis followed by endocytosis, and the effects on membrane capacitance and cypHer signal recovery were monitored.</p><p>After the stimulus, membrane capacitance recovered, but the cypHer signal barely showed any recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>).

It remains possible that a higher concentration of CaM inhibitor is required to inhibit membrane retrieval itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sun et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). To test if the slower recovery of the cypHer signal was caused by slower protein retrieval or else by slower re-acidification, we performed an acidic solution (pH 5.5) perfusion experiment as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>. We applied acidic solution before (20 s) and after (40 s) the train of ten 50 ms depolarizations under control conditions in the absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) or presence of CaM inhibitory peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The amounts of de-quenching induced by acid perfusions, before and after stimulation, were measured in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Then, we calculated the de-quenching ratio after and before the stimulation (post ΔF / pre ΔF), and compared the values between the two conditions. We found that the post ΔF / pre ΔF value was larger in the presence of CaM inhibitory peptide (control, 1.15 ± 0.20, n = 5; CaM inhibitory peptide, 1.95 ± 0.14, n = 5, p=0.012, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The small increase in the post ΔF / pre ΔF ratio under control condition is caused by incomplete membrane retrieval 40 s after the stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Because the time course of membrane retrieval was similar for both control and CaM inhibitory peptide conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), this result indicates that anti-Syt2-cypHer was left behind at the plasma membrane surface in the presence of CaM inhibitory peptide.

In many studies, it was assumed that the kinetics of the fluorescence changes represent endocytosis, including both, membrane and labeled protein retrieval. By directly comparing the kinetics of membrane and anti-Syt2-cypHer retrieval, we show here that this assumption is essentially correct at the calyx of Held presynaptic terminal when the stimulation intensity is mild. Under this condition, endocytosis is operates mainly by a slow, clathrin-dependent mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamashita et al., 2010</xref>). The time course of cypHer signal recovery under this condition was slightly slower than that of the capacitance recovery, but the difference can be well described by taking the re-acidification time course (20 s ~ 40 s) into account. This is longer than recent reports showing that the re-acidification time course of glutamatergic vesicles takes 15 s in cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Egashira et al., 2015</xref>). In some studies, even faster re-acidification time courses were suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gandhi and Stevens, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atluri and Ryan, 2006</xref>). One of the possibilities that may cause the slow re-acidification time course was relatively large size of the synaptic vesicles in the calyx terminal (50 nm, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sätzler et al., 2002</xref>). These vesicles may contain up to 5,000–7,000 glutamate molecules. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cho and von Gersdorff. (2014)</xref> reported that vesicular glutamate may function as a buffer for vesicle protons. So a larger vesicle may contain many hundreds to thousands of protons and its acidification may take a relatively long time. However, the time constant for single vesicle glutamate filling at the calyx of Held is estimated to be 15 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hori and Takahashi, 2012</xref>). In our train stimulation protocol, 37% of membrane retrieval was mediated by fast endocytosis, thus larger endosome-like structure might also contribute to the slower re-acidification time course. It may be possible that Syt2 remains stranded in the plasma membrane for ~15 s and then a partial contribution of larger endosome-like structure is needed (bulk endocytosis) to explain the 38.7 s decay time constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Previous reports employing pHluorin-based probes showed that endocytosis gets slower with stronger stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armbruster et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fernández-Alfonso and Ryan, 2004</xref>). Usually, clathrin-dependent, slow endocytosis is observed after mild stimulation, but in these pHluorin-based studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armbruster et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fernández-Alfonso and Ryan, 2004</xref>), endocytosis-based signal recovery was still slow (tens of seconds) even with strong stimulation, which elicits clathrin-independent endocytosis. In contrast, capacitance measurements and electron microscopic studies showed that clathrin-independent endocytosis, i.e. either bulk endocytosis or ultrafast endocytosis, occurs in the range of tens of ms to seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jockusch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Watanabe et al., 2013</xref>). Fast endocytosis in the present study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) reflects clathrin-independent endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Lange et al., 2003</xref>), and by providing a direct comparison of membrane uptake, vesicle protein uptake, and re-acidification of endocytosed organelles, our results reconcile the previously reported, apparent discrepancy in the kinetics of endocytosis as assessed by pHluorin probes vs. capacitance measurements and electron microscopic analyses. Our data demonstrate that the retrieval of vesicle membrane and vesicle proteins occurs simultaneously, but that re-acidification of the endocytosed organelle is slow after clathrin-independent, fast endocytosis. This is likely due to the large surface-to-volume ratio of the endosome-like structures that form during fast endocytosis and/or to slow budding of vesicles from such endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Watanabe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kononenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kononenko and Haucke, 2015</xref>)</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The molecular basis of coordinated retrieval of vesicle membrane and vesicle proteins</title><p>In the present study, we examined the exo-endocytotic cycling of Syt2 using cypHer as a reporter. The lack of SV2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yao et al., 2010</xref>) or stonin2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kononenko et al., 2013</xref>) compromises the fidelity of synaptotagmin sorting, but the kinetics of clathrin-dependent slow endocytosis is unchanged even when synaptotagmin sorting is perturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kononenko et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests that membrane retrieval and sorting of SV proteins can be segregated. Our results are consistent with this notion, and the two processes can be separated in the presence of a CaM inhibitor or in Munc13-1<sup>W464R</sup> calyces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). However, the possibility remains that several independent cycling pathways exist for a given vesicle protein. For instance, VGLUT deficiency slows the recycling of synaptophysin but not of Syt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pan et al., 2015</xref>), while stonin 2 deficiency slows the recycling of Syt1 but not of synaptophysin or synaptobrevin 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kononenko et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>CaM inhibitors and the perturbation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM-Munc13-1 signaling perturb Syt2 uptake without altering membrane retrieval kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). However, calcineurin, a downstream target of CaM, was shown to be necessary for membrane retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sun et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). For three reasons, our results do not necessarily contradict these calcineurin data. First, it is possible that the complex between CaM and calcineurin is so tight that higher concentrations of CaM inhibitors are required to block the function of calcineurin in membrane retrieval. Second, the effect of calmodulin blockers on membrane retrieval can be seen when low concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers are present in the presynaptic patch pipette, which lead to a strong elevation of the global presynaptic calcium concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2014</xref>), but not when high concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers are used as in the present study (see Materials and methods). Third, a CaM-independent component of membrane retrieval might exist. All this notwithstanding, our results suggest that CaM has several downstream targets that regulate the retrieval of membrane and proteins.</p><p>Clathrin-independent endocytosis, which forms large endosome-like structures by retrieving large pieces of membrane, has been observed at many types of synapses after strong stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thomas et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2009</xref>). Recent findings indicate that the plasma membrane adaptor AP-2 is required for vesicle regeneration from bulk endosome-like organelles in central nerve terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kononenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Watanabe et al., 2014</xref>), but it is not known how long it takes for vesicles to bud from the endosome-like organelles after bulk endocytosis. We found in this context that re-acidification barely occurs 1 min after a 2 s depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), which suggests that vesicle budding from endosome-like organelles is slow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheung et al., 2010</xref>). Our results also suggest that Syt2 is retrieved together with the membrane not only in the slow, but also in the fast mode of endocytosis, but the molecular mechanism of Syt2 sorting during bulk endocytosis remains to be elucidated.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The role of CaM-Munc-13 signaling in the coordinated retrieval of membrane and Syt2</title><p>We showed that CaM inhibition slowed down Syt2 retrieval without affecting the kinetics of membrane retrieval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), and our data indicate that Munc13-1 is a possible downstream target of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM signaling in this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This is somewhat surprising since Munc13-1 is a well-known vesicle priming factor at the active zone. In this context, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM-Munc13-1 signaling pathway regulates the recovery rate of the pool of releasable SVs in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Junge et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lipstein et al., 2012</xref>) and in the calyx of Held terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lipstein et al., 2013</xref>), likely by enhancing the replenishment rate of synaptic vesicles. However, the effect of dynamin inhibition, which perturbs endocytosis, on the SV replenishment rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hosoi et al., 2009</xref>) is very similar to the effect measured in the Munc13-1<sup>W464R</sup> KI calyces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), and to that of acute pharmacological blockade of CaM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sakaba and Neher, 2001</xref>). Because the effects of perturbed endocytosis on vesicle pool recovery can be explained by delayed clearance of active zone release sites from the remains of molecular complexes formed by the preceding fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hosoi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kawasaki et al., 2000</xref>), or by impaired structural recovery after the preceding exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2009</xref>) in addition to priming of synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Midorikawa and Sakaba, 2015</xref>), and based on the results of our present study, we propose that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM-Munc-13 complex does not only act in the regulation of SV replenishment but is also involved in release site clearance. The corresponding roles of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM-Munc-13 complex might be dependent on or independent of each other. The total amount of exocytosis evoked by a train of ten 50 ms stimuli was smaller in Munc13-1<sup>W464R</sup> KI calyces as compared to WT controls, but the amount of exocytosis elicited by the first pulse in the train was not different (data not shown), which is consistent with a previous study showing slower SV replenishment at release sites in Munc13-1<sup>W464R</sup> KI calyces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lipstein et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our finding that the uptake of Syt2 is perturbed by CaM inhibition and in Munc13-1<sup>W464R</sup> calyces supports the idea that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM-Munc13-1 signaling plays a role in endocytosis, and particularly in the retrieval of Syt2. Disruption of exocytotic proteins such as SNAREs affects endocytosis, which suggests a close coupling between exo- and endocytotic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hosoi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Syt1 is needed for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in chromaffin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McAdam et al., 2015</xref>), and inhibition of Syt2 interaction to AP2 blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis in calyx terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hosoi et al., 2009</xref>). Also, genetic deletion of SV proteins perturbs endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nicholson-Tomishima and Ryan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deák et al., 2004</xref>). One possible molecular scenario is that the core complex of the release machinery, composed of SNAREs, Munc13s, Munc18s, and synaptotagmin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ma et al., 2013</xref>), has to be disassembled before endocytosis, and that without a functional Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM-Munc13-1 pathway, exocytosed Syt2 might be harder to dissociate from the release complex, so that Syt2 translocation to the endocytotic sites is retarded, causing a molecular jam at the active zone. It will be interesting to examine whether the uptake of other proteins involved in the vesicle fusion complex are also regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM-Munc13-1 signaling.</p><p>In any case, our results show that the coordinated endocytotic retrieval of membrane and proteins is subject to modulation by second messenger pathways, and thus is a potential target of modulation during presynaptic plasticity. This might be particularly relevant in the calyx of Held, which has to cope with high-frequency transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Taschenberger et al., 2002</xref>) and where Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation boosts proper SV sorting and replenishment, but other synapses may employ the same regulatory mechanism. So far, the calyx of Held terminal is the most convenient neuronal presynaptic terminal for capacitance measurements, but recently several other neuronal presynaptic terminals, where genetic manipulations are better feasible, were shown to be amenable to capacitance recordings (e.g. hippocampal mossy fiber terminals, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hallermann et al., 2003</xref>; cerebellar mossy fiber boutons, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delvendahl et al., 2015</xref>; cultured cerebellar Purkinje cell, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kawaguchi and Sakaba, 2015</xref>). Because endocytotic mechanisms may differ among synapse types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kononenko and Haucke, 2015</xref>), it will be interesting to examine the differential kinetics of vesicular protein retrieval in these preparations as well.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>Animal care and animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Physiological Society of Japan, and were approved by the Doshisha University Committee for Regulation on the Conduct of Animal Experiments and Related Activities.

During slicing, the brainstem was kept in ice-cold solution containing (in mM) 130 Sucrose, 60 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 25 glucose, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 ascorbic acid, 3 myoinositol, 2 Na-pyruvate, 0.1 CaCl<sub>2,</sub> and 3 MgCl<sub>2</sub>. In order to allow the slices to recover from the cutting procedure, slices were incubated at 37°C for 1 hr in a standard extracellular solution containing (in mM) 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 25 glucose, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.4 ascorbic acid, 3 myoinositol, 2 Na-pyruvate, 2 CaCl<sub>2,</sub> and 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub> (pH 7.4, gassed with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). Slices were visualized on an upright microscope (Axioskop; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The calyx of Held presynaptic terminals were whole-cell voltage clamped at -80 mV using an EPC9/2 amplifier (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany) controlled by PatchMaster software (HEKA). The presynaptic patch pipettes (7–10 MΩ) were filled with intracellular solution containing (in mM) 140 Cs-gluconate, 20 TEA-Cl, 10 HEPES, 5 Na<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine, 4 MgATP, 0.3 NaGTP, and 0.5 EGTA (pH 7.3). When using calmodulin/dynamin inhibitory peptide, reagents were added to the intracellular solution. For recordings of wild type mice, some data (5 out of 8) were taken with CsCl based intracellular solution, in which Cs-gluconate was replaced by CsCl. Since we found no difference by using CsCl solution, we pooled the corresponding data.</p><p>The presynaptic series resistance (10–25 MΩ) was compensated by 10–50% as appropriate. During recordings, 1 μM TTX and 10 mM TEA-Cl were included in the extracellular solution to block Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels respectively, and presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents were isolated. Only cells with stable membrane resistance (Rm), leak current below 50 pA at holding potential (-80 mV) and stable series resistance below 25 MΩ were considered in the study.</p><p>Membrane capacitance measurements from the calyx of Held presynaptic terminals were performed using an EPC9/2 amplifier in the sine+DC configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lindau and Neher, 1988</xref>). A sine wave (30 mV in amplitude, 1000 Hz in frequency) was superimposed on a holding potential of -80 mV. Experiments were performed at room temperature. TTX and bafilomycin were obtained from Wako (Osaka, Japan). ATP, GTP, and TEA-Cl were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Missouri).

CypHer was excited at 645 nm with a monochromator (Polychrome V; Till Photonics, Hillsboro, Oregon) triggered by PatchMaster software (HEKA) and imaged using a 692/40 nm single-band bandpass filter (Semrock, Rochester, New York). Time-lapse images were acquired at 0.5 Hz with 300–500 ms exposure time. Time-lapse images were corrected for photobleaching by subtracting the bleaching time course of the neighboring calyx terminal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement2</xref>). The fluorescence intensity of the region of interest was background-subtracted, and normalized either to initial intensity or to ΔF induced by stimulation.</p><p>To monitor fluorescence changes during exo-endocytosis, the calyx of Held terminals were stimulated with a train of depolarizing pulses (+70 mV for 2 ms followed by repolarization to 0 mV for 50 ms, repeated ten times with an inter-stimulus interval of 200 ms) and a step depolarizing pulse (+70 mV for 2 ms followed by repolarization to 0 mV for 2 s). For experiments involving the application of acidic solutions, MES-buffered (25 mM) extracellular solution at pH 5.5 was puff-applied to target terminals using a Pneumatic PicoPump (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, Florida) before and after stimulation. The MES-buffered solution was made by replacing 25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub> of the standard external solution to 25 mM MES.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>All reviewers thought that this manuscript is important and exciting, comparing for the first time the kinetics of compensatory endocytosis of membrane and proteins in calyx of Held nerve terminals and two independent techniques: time-resolved membrane capacitance and pHluorin-mediated fluorescent imaging of anti-Syt2-cypHer. In addition, the manuscript provides important molecular mechanisms that decouple protein and membrane recycling. However, several questions related to the data analysis were raised, and that need to be addressed. Also, the discussion related to acidification estimates of synaptic vesicles requires attention.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Analysis:</p><p>The analysis of the time course of the cypHer5E fluorescence changes is not clearly described and the statements on the time course appear unjustified. First, the concept of a time constant for the fluorescence recovery time course seems not justified because the analyzed average time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, red line) does not show evidence of a decreasing slope, instead the slope is apparently rather constant from 15 s to 60 s. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> (top and bottom panels) suggest that the decrease is still continuing at 60 s. Has the fluorescence generally been recorded for longer times (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) to show that there is actually an asymptotic value? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, right, suggests that the recovery is sometimes only partial. Are longer recordings available? Do the authors assume that the decline in fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, top) returns to the pre-stimulation baseline? If so, how can this assumption be justified?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> shows exponential decays – why are they noisy? It appears that the capacitance data has somehow been used to generate these curves but there is not a corresponding description. Is it a convolution of the C<sub>m</sub> time course with a re-acidification time constant? If so, it would be helpful to actually fit this time constant (least squares). If the bold orange line is the best fit it would suggest that the hypothesis might be wrong because the best match (bold orange) does not seem to be a good fit, a straight line would do much better. The analysis needs clarification and/or further analysis.</p><p>2) Can it be concluded that the recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) is slower? Apparently the slow phase of the C<sub>m</sub> trace and the fluorescence recovery are absent with the dynamin inhibitor and the fluorescence recovery is also absent in the bafilomycin experiment.</p><p>3) The issue if the recovery is slower or its extent smaller also applies to the text referring to other experiments.</p><p>4) The authors seem to assume that fast endocytosis in the bulk endocytosis mode after the 2 s pulses is the same mechanism as that of the fast phase after short pulses. What is the evidence for that?</p><p>5) Recent experiments have shown the in chromaffin cells Syt1 is needed for Ca-dependence of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and that it involves dynamin. How do the authors relate their findings to these results (Yao et al. 2012 J Neurosci, McAdam et al. 2015 J Cell Sci)? Should one expect a similar role for Syt2 in the calyx?</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>Atluri and Ryan are quoted several times saying that &quot;…acidification of glutametergic SVs occurs with a time constant of tens of seconds.&quot; But this is not very accurate. Atluri and Ryan (JNeurosci., 2006) estimated a time constant of 4 -5 seconds (at room temperature) and Gandhi and Stevens (Nature, 2003) estimated a time constant of 0.4 seconds. So the time constant of 30 seconds after a 10 s delay that the authors estimate is very surprising and seems very slow. On the other hand, synaptic vesicles in the calyx of Held are quite large (50 nm diameter) and may contain up to 5000-7000 glutamate molecules. Recently, Cho and v. Gersdorff (JNeurosci., 2014) reported that vesicular glutamate may function as a buffer for vesicle protons. So a larger vesicle may contain many hundreds to thousands of protons and its acidification may take a relatively long time. However, the time constant for single vesicle glutamate filling at the calyx of Held is estimated to be 15 seconds (Hori and Takahashi, Neuron, 2012). Please comment on this previous result. In conclusion, it seems that Syt2 remains stranded in the plasma membrane for 10 s and then a larger endosome-like structure is needed (bulk endocytosis) to explain the very slow 30 s decay time constant. All these references should be briefly discussed and cited in the Discussion and the authors should mention in the Abstract or Introduction this surprising finding of the 10 s delay followed by a 30 s decay time constant for reacidification.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14643.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>Analysis:</italic></p><p><italic>The analysis of the time course of the cypHer5E fluorescence changes is not clearly described and the statements on the time course appear unjustified.

We added 3 more cells for the cypHer fluorescence data, and now fitting become better. The new trace was best fitted using least squares method with 38.7s re-acidification time constant with a 14s delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, to show variability of the data, we added error bars to the cypHer trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> (top and bottom panels) suggest that the decrease is still continuing at 60 s. Has the fluorescence generally been recorded for longer times (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) to show that there is actually an asymptotic value?</italic></p><p>We also added longer recording to show that the cypHer fluorescence showed decreasing slope after longer recording period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). As the reviewers mentioned, the decrease is still continuing to some extent at 60 s but the slope becomes shallower afterwards, and can be well fitted by an exponential. The slopes until 60 s were similar between shorter recordings and longer recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The exponential fitting to the longer cypHer recording gives asymptotic value of 0.13, which is similar to the asymptotic value of 0.12 calculated from fitting the averaged C<sub>m</sub> recording (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) with a double exponential, as described in the first paragraph of the subsection “Simultaneous recordings of membrane capacitance and anti-Syt2-cypHer uptake”.</p><p>We added this point as “The asymptotic value (extrapolated from the exponential fit) of the fluorescence recovery (0.13 from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) was similar to that of the capacitance trace (0.12 from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), which indicated that the rate of endocytosis becomes as low as that of re-acidification. The exponential decay time constant was more clearly seen by taking longer recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that exocytosed Syt2 is almost completely retrieved.”.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, right suggests that the recovery is sometimes only partial. Are longer recordings available?</italic></p><p>The partial recovery observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> is probably due to photobleaching. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, because we used field stimulation to elicit exocytosis, which stimulates all the calyx, we could not use neighboring non-stimulated calyx terminal as a reference as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>, hence photobleaching was not corrected. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref> figure legend, we added “The apparent partial recovery is due to photobleaching (Hua et al., 2011).” Subtracting the baseline decline before stimulation also suggests that incomplete recovery is likely to be due to photobleaching (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref> ).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14643.016</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14643.016">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14643.016</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-14643-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>Do the authors assume that the decline in fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, top) returns to the pre-stimulation baseline?

However, we should note that our analysis does not assume that fluorescence returns to baseline, and for the fitting, the baseline value is a free parameter.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> shows exponential decays – why are they noisy?

We described the fitting procedure more clearly both in figure legends and Methods section, and performed the fitting by least squares method. We changed the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">figure 1</xref> figure legends as “By assuming a certain delay and a re-acidification time constant of the endocytosed organelle after membrane retrieval, the recovery time course of cypHer signal (red circles) was fitted. […] During the delay, the value was held to be 1. The cypHer signal was best fitted with a 14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">12</xref>) s delay with a 38.7 (18.9) s re-acidification time constant after membrane retrieval (dotted line).”</p><p>In the Methods section, we also added “When cypHer fluorescence was fitted by assuming a certain delay and a re-acidification time constant of the endocytosed organelle after membrane retrieval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), the pH-dependence of the cypHer fluorescence was described by a Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with a Hill coefficient of 1, and a pKa of 7.05 (Hua et al., 2011).” By taking longer recordings, now we show that control fluorescence shows decreasing slope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), and we think the fitting become more meaningful.</p><p><italic>2) Can it be concluded that the recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) is slower? Apparently the slow phase of the C<sub>m</sub> trace and the fluorescence recovery are absent with the dynamin inhibitor and the fluorescence recovery is also absent in the bafilomycin experiment.</italic></p><p>Thank you very much for suggesting better description of the result. From the dynamin inhibitor experiment, we concluded that the slow phase of membrane retrieval and fluorescence recovery was blocked. Fast phase of membrane retrieval still remained, but fluorescence recovery was negligible probably because the fast endocytosis was mediated by bulk endocytosis and their re-acidification was very slow. Instead of using the word “slower”, now we describe the effect as “blocked”, and change the manuscript as “Both the capacitance and the cypHer signal recovery were blocked, and their recovery became significantly smaller in the presence of dynamin inhibitory peptide than under control conditions”.</p><p>In the bafilomycin experiment section, we also described the effect as “blocked” instead of “slower”, and changed the sentence as follow “but the recovery of cypHer signal was blocked with bafilomycin”.</p><p><italic>3) The issue if the recovery is slower or its extent smaller also applies to the text referring to other experiments.</italic></p><p>As for CaM inhibitory peptide experiment, we changed the description as “but the cypHer signal recovery was reduced and/or slowed down by application of CaM inhibitory peptide”. In Munc13-1<sup>W464R</sup> KI experiment, we also changed the description as “but the cypHer signal recovery was significantly smaller in Munc13-1<sup>W464R</sup> KI calyces as compared to WT calyces”.</p><p><italic>4) The authors seem to assume that fast endocytosis in the bulk endocytosis mode after the 2 s pulses is the same mechanism as that of the fast phase after short pulses. What is the evidence for that?</italic></p><p>The mode of endocytosis is stimulus-dependent, and it has been shown that the fast mode of endocytosis is seen in response to strong stimulation in P8-11 calyx of Held terminals (Wu et al., 2005; Yamashita et al., 2005, 2010). With similar train stimulation protocol that we used in this work (20ms x 10 depolarization at 10 Hz), Wu et al. (2005) reported that about 35% of the endocytosis was mediated by fast mode of endocytosis, which is consistent with our result (37% fast endocytosis), and Renden and von Gersdorff (2007), Wu et al. (2009) and Yamashita et al. (2010) showed that the amount of fast endocytosis increased gradually with stronger stimulation. In Midorikawa et al. (2014), we also showed that the amount of fast mode of endocytosis was gradually increased by elongating pulse durations in P8-11 calyx of Held terminals, and fast endocytosis after shorter (200 ms) pulse and longer (500 ms) pulse were both P/Q type Ca channel dependent. Also, fast mode of endocytosis at the calyx seems to be insensitive to dynamin inhibitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, Yamashita et al., 2010; but see Xue et al., 2008), suggesting the same mechanism. We emphasized the progressive stimulus dependence of the fast endocytosis by adding the sentence “and that the contribution of fast endocytosis increased progressively by applying stronger stimulation (Renden and von Gersdorff, 2007; Wu et al., 2009; Yamashita et al., 2010; Midorikawa et al., 2014).” in Introduction section, and “It has been shown that the amount of fast mode of endocytosis was gradually increased by elongating pulse durations in P8-11 calyx of Held terminals (Renden and von Gersdorff, 2007;Wu et al., 2009; Yamashita et al., 2010; Midorikawa et al., 2014).” in Results section. We also added “This fast mode of endocytosis is shown to be insensitive to dynamin inhibition (Yamashita et al., 2010, but see Xue et al., 2008;), as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> fast component, suggesting the same mechanism.” to clearly show that fast endocytosis in the bulk endocytosis mode after the 2 s pulses and that of the fast phase after short pulses share the same mechanism.</p><p><italic>5) Recent experiments have shown the in chromaffin cells Syt1 is needed for Ca-dependence of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and that it involves dynamin. How do the authors relate their findings to these results (Yao et al. 2012 J Neurosci, McAdam et al. 2015 J Cell Sci)? Should one expect a similar role for Syt2 in the calyx?</italic></p><p>Thank you for pointing out the important references. We cited both works in the manuscript. Because it has been demonstrated that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is critical for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), the slow form of endocytosis, in the calyx of Held, and that inhibition of Syt2 interaction to AP2 by the inhibiting peptide blocks CME in the calyx of Held (Hosoi et al., 2009), it is possible that Syt2 is needed for CME. We mention these studies in a Discussion section as “Syt1 is needed for Ca-dependence of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in chromaffin cells (Yao et al., 2012; McAdam et al., 2015), and inhibition of Syt2 interaction to AP2 blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis in calyx terminals (Hosoi et al., 2009).” However, we cannot tell if Syt2 is needed for Ca-dependence of clathrin-mediated endocytosis from our data.</p><p><italic>Discussion:</italic></p><p><italic>Atluri and Ryan are quoted several times saying that &quot;…acidification of glutametergic SVs occurs with a time constant of tens of seconds.&quot; But this is not very accurate. Atluri and Ryan (JNeurosci., 2006) estimated a time constant of 4-5 seconds (at room temperature) and Gandhi and Stevens (Nature, 2003) estimated a time constant of 0.4 seconds.

We quote Atluri &amp; Ryan (2006) and Gandhi &amp; Stevens (2003) as examples of short reacidification times, and cite Hori &amp; Takahashi (2012) and Egashira et al. (2015) for longer reacidification times. We mentioned that the reacidification time constant of 40 s observed in rat calyx terminal was slow, and mentioned the large size and the resultant buffering capacity of the synaptic vesicles in the calyx of Held terminal. We also mentioned the possible reason for 14 s delay as the reviewers pointed out. All of these points were added to the Discussion part by adding: “In some studies, even faster re-acidification time courses were suggested (Gandhi and Stevens, 2003; Atluri and Ryan, 2006). […] It may be possible that Syt2 remains stranded in the plasma membrane for ~15 s and then a partial contribution of larger endosome-like structure is needed (bulk endocytosis) to explain the 38.7 s decay time constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1—figure supplement2</xref>).”</p><p>We also added the following sentence to the Introduction: “Upon stimulation, we found a 12-14 s delay followed by a 20-40 s decay time constant for re-acidification of retrieved Syt2-containing organelle”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
