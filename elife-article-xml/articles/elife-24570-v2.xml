trimethylation of H3K27 (H3K27me3). However, it is uncertain whether PRC2 writing of H3K27me3 is mechanistically required for gene silencing. Here, we studied PRC2 function in postnatal mouse cardiomyocytes, where the paucity of cell division obviates bulk H3K27me3 rewriting after each cell cycle. EED (embryonic ectoderm development) inactivation in the postnatal heart (Eed<sup>CKO</sup>) caused lethal dilated cardiomyopathy. Surprisingly, gene upregulation in Eed<sup>CKO</sup> was not coupled with loss of H3K27me3. Rather, the activating histone mark H3K27ac increased. EED interacted with histone deacetylases (HDACs) and enhanced their catalytic activity. HDAC overexpression normalized Eed<sup>CKO</sup> heart function and expression of derepressed genes. Our results uncovered a non-canonical, H3K27me3-independent EED repressive mechanism that is essential for normal heart function. Our results further illustrate that organ dysfunction due to epigenetic dysregulation can be corrected by epigenetic rewiring.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24570.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24570.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cardiology</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>heart development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31571487</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Aibin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01HL098166</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pu</surname><given-names>William T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL095712</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pu</surname><given-names>William T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During heart maturation, embryonic ectoderm development as a chromatin remodeler triggers transcriptional silencing, while H3K27me3 is a passenger that is not sufficient for gene silencing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Normal developmental maturation of organ function requires precise transcriptional regulation of gene expression. This transcriptional regulation depends upon the interplay of an array of epigenetic regulators, which shape the epigenetic landscape by repositioning nucleosomes and depositing covalent modifications on histones. Since the chromatin landscape is established through a series of steps, each contingent upon normal completion of prior steps, transient disruption, through environmental mishaps or genetic mutations, might be anticipated to break the normal sequence and irreversibly impact organ development and function. Whether or not this is the case is presently unknown, and the answer has clear therapeutic implications for diseases that involve epigenetic changes.</p><p>Development and function of the heart is vulnerable to epigenetic insults, as mutation of epigenetic regulators causes both structural heart disease and cardiomyopathy in humans and in experimental model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zaidi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delgado-Olguín et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lickert et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Montgomery et al., 2007</xref>). Recent work has highlighted the critical role of epigenetic silencing of ectopic transcriptional programs in normal heart development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delgado-Olguín et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Montgomery et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Trivedi et al., 2010</xref>). One class of epigenetic repressors are the histone deacetylases (HDACs), which remove activating histone acetylation marks to repress gene expression. HDACs consist of four classes (classes I, IIa, IIb, and IV) on the basis of their domain structure and expression pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laugesen and Helin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang and Bruneau, 2012</xref>). Zhao and colleagues reported that HDACs target both actively transcribed and repressed genes to reset chromatin state for subsequent complex-dependent transcriptional outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with this, class I HDACs such as HDAC1 and HDAC2 are frequently subunits of multi-protein complexes, such as Sin3, NuRD and CoREST. Inactivation of HDAC1/2 caused abnormal heart growth and function that was linked to ectopic expression of slow twitch skeletal muscle genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Montgomery et al., 2007</xref>). Class II HDACs were found to repress cardiac MEF2 transcription factor activity and their genetic inactivation caused pathological cardiac hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Another class of epigenetic repressors is polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), comprising the core subunits EED, SUZ12, and either EZH1 or EZH2. Canonically, PRC2 represses gene transcription by catalyzing trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2002</xref>). However, whether or not H3K27me3 deposition is sufficient to account for PRC2-mediated transcriptional repression in all contexts remains uncertain. Margueron and colleagues reported that elevated EZH2 and H3K27me3 levels are a consequence of high proliferation of cells in tumorigenesis, arguing that perturbation of this equilibrium leads to irreversible transcriptional change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wassef et al., 2015</xref>). In PRC2-null ESCs as well as other cell types, most genes that are marked by H3K27me3 remain repressed even after inactivation of PRC2 components, suggesting redundant repressive mechanisms. Furthermore, most studies of PRC2 function have been performed in actively cycling cells, whereas the majority of cells in adult mammals cycle slowly, and some cells, such as adult cardiomyocytes (CMs), are largely post-mitotic. Since cell cycle activity mandates re-deposition of histone marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Margueron et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hansen et al., 2008</xref>), in mitotic cells writing activity of epigenetic complexes may overshadow other functions that are important in non-proliferating cells.</p><p>The role of PRC2 in the heart has been studied by cardiac-specific inactivation of EZH2 or EED during early cardiac development. This resulted in disruption of H3K27me3 deposition, derepression of non-cardiomyocyte gene programs, and lethal heart malformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delgado-Olguín et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we investigated the function of EED in postnatal heart maturation. Postnatal CMs have largely exited the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergmann et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Senyo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alkass et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Soonpaa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirai et al., 2016</xref>) and express little EZH2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2012a</xref>), but nonetheless contain abundant H3K27me3. Thus, the postnatal heart affords a unique opportunity to investigate the mechanism by which EED represses gene expression in post-mitotic cells and to harness this knowledge to determine whether the dysregulated chromatin landscape can be rewired to restore gene expression and heart function. We found that EED silences the slow-twitch myofiber gene program to orchestrate heart maturation by complexing with and stimulating HDAC deacetylase activity. Surprising, de-repression of the majority of genes in EED-deficient cardiomyocytes occurred without loss of H3K27me3, pointing to important EED repressive activity that is independent of its role in PRC2-mediated H3K27 trimethylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Heart dysfunction in neonatal cardiac-inactivation of Eed</title><p>To understand the role of <italic>Eed</italic> in regulating cardiac gene expression during heart maturation, we generated <italic>Eed</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>; <italic>Myh6</italic><sup>Cre</sup> (Eed<sup>CKO</sup>) mice, in which <italic>Myh6</italic><sup>Cre</sup> specifically inactivates the conditional <italic>Eed</italic><sup>fl</sup> allele in CMs. Western blotting and qRTPCR demonstrated effective cardiac EED protein depletion that occurred between postnatal day (P) 0 and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Indeed, the upregulated genes were significantly enriched for gene ontology terms related to skeletal muscle genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Normal cardiac function requires proper expression of cardiac sarcomere genes and repression of skeletal muscle and slow-twitch myofiber genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frey et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Montgomery et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ding et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that abnormal expression of these genes contributes to weak cardiac contraction in Eed<sup>CKO</sup> mice.</p><p>To dissect the relationship between the differentially expressed genes and H3K27me3, H3K27ac, and EED occupancy, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) in purified, 2-month-old CMs. CMs were over 95% pure by immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G</xref>). Markedly reduced H3K27me3 in Eed<sup>CKO</sup> CMs demonstrated highly efficient EED inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G</xref>). PCR of genomic DNA from purified CMs, as well as review of the RNA-seq track view of the <italic>Eed</italic> locus, further indicated both efficient gene inactivation by Myh6-Cre, which is CM-specific, as well as high CM purity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2H,I</xref>). ChIP-seq signals were consistent high CM purity. For example, at <italic>Myh</italic>6, expressed in CMs, showed robust signal for the active mark H3K27ac and little signal from the repressive mark H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2J</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>Vim</italic>, expressed in non-CMs, lacked H3K27ac and was enriched for H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2K</xref>).</p><p>About half of the upregulated genes (49.71%), including 7 of 14 upregulated skeletal muscle genes, were occupied by EED at their TSSs in WT. EED occupancy at a subset of the upregulated genes was confirmed by ChIP-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2L</xref>). Unlike upregulated genes, only 8.42% of downregulated genes were bound by EED and H3K27me3. These findings suggest that gene upregulation (derepression) rather than downregulation is the predominant, direct effect of EED deficiency, and that repression of skeletal muscle genes is a key direct role of EED in adult heart.</p><p>We evaluated the relationship between H3K27me3 occupancy and gene upregulation in Eed<sup>CKO</sup>. First, we quantitatively measured H3K27me3 signal within ±500 bp of TSS on EED target genes in control and Eed<sup>CKO</sup>, stratified by H3K27me3 signal in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2M</xref>). This analysis showed that EED inactivation reduced the median H3K27me3 signal only of the quartile of genes with highest H3K27me3 occupancy in wild type. Surprisingly, the median H3K27me3 signal in the remaining three quartiles of upregulated genes was not significantly altered by EED inactivation. Consistent with this analysis, the aggregate H3K27me3 signal at the promoters of the 863 upregulated genes was not reduced in Eed<sup>CKO</sup>, while it was lower in Eed<sup>CKO</sup> at the unchanged and downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2N</xref>). To further corroborate these findings, we divided upregulated genes into three clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>): those in which upregulation was coupled to H3K27me3 reduction (Cluster C1), those with low H3K27me3 signal (C2), and those with no change in H3K27me3 signal (C3). Cluster C1, which matches the canonical view in which gene derepressed is association with loss of H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Margueron et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hansen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyer et al., 2006</xref>), contained only 252 of 863 upregulated genes (29%) in Eed<sup>CKO</sup>. In comparison, 4731 of 10,024 expressed genes (47%) had reduced promoter H3K27me3, indicating lack of enrichment of H3K27me3 loss among upregulated genes. Again, the expected relationship between gene upregulation and H3K27me3 loss did not hold for the majority of upregulated genes, as those in Clusters 2 (303 genes) and 3 (308 genes) were not linked to loss of H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Togerther, these analyses indicate that the majority of gene upregulation that occurs with Eed inactivation occurs without loss of H3K27me3. These conclusions were robust to the normalization method used for H3K27me3 ChIP-seq analysis (see Materials and methods), indicating that it was not a result of global differences in H3K27me3 between WT and Eed<sup>CKO</sup>. Furthermore, we independently confirmed retention of H3K27me3 at promoters of selected upregulated genes by ChIP-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2O</xref>).</p><p>Overall, these results indicate that upregulation of most genes in Eed<sup>CKO</sup>, including the derepressed skeletal muscle genes, was not accompanied by loss of H3K27me3, as expected by the canonical model of EED repression via ‘writing’ of repressive H3K27me3 marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Margueron et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hansen et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Elevated H3K27ac at genes upregulated in Eed<sup>CKO</sup></title><p>Our data suggested that EED repressed gene expression in the postnatal heart through mechanisms other than H3K27me3 deposition.

These peak changes were accompanied by a broad, genome-wide increase of H3K27ac signal strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Indeed, the aggregate H3K27ac signal at the promoters of the 863 genes upregulated in Eed<sup>CKO</sup> increased, whereas it was either unchanged or reduced for the genes that were unchanged or downregulated, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

Increased H3K27ac signal was also observed at enhancer regions (H3K27ac peaks region in either WT or Eed<sup>CKO</sup>) associated with these upregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

EED has been proposed to facilitate perpetuation of H3K27me3 marks by itself binding to H3K27me3, thereby reinforcing deposition of H3K27me3 at existing sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Margueron et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hansen et al., 2008</xref>). If this is the case, then ablation of EED should disrupt the H3K27me3 landscape, preventing its restoration even if EED is later re-expressed. To test this model, we temporally re-expressed EED in CMs by taking advantage of highly efficient, durable, and CM-selective gene transfer using adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) and the cardiac troponin T promoter (<italic>Tnnt2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>).

Delayed EED re-expression corrected the abnormally high global H3K27ac levels observed in Eed<sup>CKO</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). However, delayed EED re-expression did not correct the low H3K27me3 levels seen in Eed<sup>CKO</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This result was reinforced by genome-wide measurement of H3K27me3 and H3K27ac chromatin occupancy by ChIP-seq. Whereas EED re-expression at P14 and P25 both conferred phenotypic rescue and normalized the genome-wide distribution of H3K27ac signal, P14 and P25 EED re-expression did not normalize H3K27me3 distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>).</p><p>We then evaluated the effect of EED re-expression on the 863 genes derepressed in CKO-luc by performing RNA-seq on purified CMs. Out of 863 genes that were upregulated in Eed<sup>CKO</sup>, 256 (66, 87, and 103 in Cluster 1, 2, and 3, respectively) were significantly downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). This normalization of gene expression was associated with reduction of H3K27ac, but not H3K27me3, near the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). Inspection of the <italic>Acta1</italic> and <italic>Myl7</italic> loci reinforced the finding that, at the upregulated slow twitch skeletal muscle genes, delayed EED re-expression corrected abnormal deposition of H3K27ac but did not significantly affect H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). These data are consistent with the model that EED ‘reads’ its own mark to reinforce its ‘writing’, so that proper writing cannot be restored after a period has elapsed during which the mark decays. An alternative explanation is that CM PRC2 histone trimethylase activity declines with age due to downregulation of EZH2 and lack of detectable trimethylase activity from EZH1-containing complexes from adult CMs. Regardless of the precise mechanism, our data show that phenotypic rescue and gene expression correction by AAV-EED were not associated with normalization of H3K27me3. Rather, correction aligned with normalization of H3K27ac epigenetic marks.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>EED interacts with HDACs and enhances its deacetylase activity but is dispensable for HDAC recruitment</title><p>Histone H3 and H4 acetylation, including H3K27ac, is regulated by a balance between histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stefanovic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tie et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2009</xref>).

These lines of evidence led us to hypothesize that EED represses its postnatal cardiac target genes by interacting with HDACs to decrease their H3K27ac. To test this hypothesis, we screened class I and class II HDACs (HDAC1-HDAC9) for interaction with EED.

HDAC2, H3K27me3, and H3K27ac signal at the entire set of 8625 EED occupied regions further confirmed this result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We identified three classes of EED-bound genomic domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). A first class (E1, 5073 regions) was marked by EED, HDAC2 and H3K27ac, but had little H3K27me3. This class was consistent with a previous study that showing that HDACs mark not only inactive genes but also active genes that are poised for transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). A second class (E2, 1830 regions) had strong EED and H3K27ac signals, and H3K27me3 was present but weak. A third class (E3, 1722 regions) was marked by strong and broad EED and H3K27me3, but little H3K27ac. Together, these data suggest that EED may function in a complex involving HDACs, independent of H3K27me3.</p><p>Overall, HDAC2 signals did not change in EED deficient CMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This finding was also confirmed by ChIP-qPCR measurement of HDAC2 or HDAC5 enrichment at promoters of genes upregulated in Eed<sup>CKO</sup> compared to control, revealing no significant difference between HDAC2 or HDAC5 occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Given that upregulated genes accounted for a small portion of EED occupied regions, we further analyzed HDAC2 occupancy of genes upregulated, unchanged or downregulated in Eed<sup>CKO</sup>. This analysis reinforced that Eed inactivation did not change HDAC2 occupancy, indicating that HDAC2 accumulation on genomic domains is independent of EED (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Thus, elevated acetylation on H3K27ac in Eed<sup>CKO</sup> was unlikely due to decreased HDAC binding.</p><p>To identify mechanisms that account for increased H3K27ac at upregulated, EED-occupied genes in Eed<sup>CKO</sup> CMs, we considered the possibility that EED biochemically regulates HDAC activity. We measured the in vitro deacetylase activity of HDAC2 in the presence of increasing amounts of recombinant EED protein, expressed and affinity purified from S<italic>f</italic>21 cells using a baculovirus expression system. EED protein did not contain detectable contaminating proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). EED alone had no detectable deacetylase activity, but when added to HDAC2 it augmented HDAC2's deacetylase activity by up to threefold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Together, the aforementioned data all support a model in which EED represses a subset of its target genes by stimulating HDAC. These results also raise the possibility that EED drives transcriptional repression at least partially by modulating the activity of another class of epigenetic repressors, HDACs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>HDACs functions downstream of EED to direct normal heart maturation</title><p>Both class I and class II HDACs regulate cardiac gene expression, hypertrophy, and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hohl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trivedi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kook et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>).

Accordingly, we developed AAV9-Tnnt2-HDAC1/2 (abbreviated AAV-HDAC1/2) to direct CM-selective overexpression of HDAC1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).

Neonatal Eed<sup>CKO</sup> mice were treated with AAV9-EED at P5. They were then treated daily with the broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitor suberanilohydroxamic acid (SAHA) or vehicle control. Het mice transduced with AAV9-luc and then SAHA or vehicle served as additional controls. Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xie et al., 2014b</xref>), SAHA treatment for 2 months did not adversely effect heart function in the Het controls, nor did it perturb expression of 5 genes (<italic>Acta1, Myl9, Tnni1, Tbx15</italic> and <italic>Mybpc2</italic>) that were aberrantly upregulated in Eed<sup>CKO</sup>. Interestingly, SAHA treatment appeared to block heart function rescue by AAV9-EED re-expression. Two out of five mice died prematurely in the Eed<italic><sup>CKO</sup></italic>+EED+SAHA group and were lost to the study. Despite this potential survivor bias, heart function rescue by AAV9-EED tended to impair AAV9-EED rescue in the remaining three mice, although this did not reach statistical significance (p=0.07; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). These data suggest that HDAC activity is essential to suppress aberrant gene expression in Eed<sup>CKO</sup>. In line with this, normalized transcription of four out of five genes by EED re-expression in Eed<sup>CKO</sup> was blocked by SAHA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The different effect of SAHA on normal hearts compared to AAV9-EED rescue of EED deficiency suggests that multiple redundant repressive pathways operate in normal heart development, making the HDAC pathway dispensible. However, in AAV-EED rescue of EED deficiency, these redundancies are disrupted, perhaps as a result of perturbations of the chromatin landscape, leaving heart development vulnerable to HDAC inhibition.

One subset of repressed genes was occupied by EED and H3K27me3 in WT, and EED inactivation reduced H3K27me3 in association with gain of H3K27ac. Upregulation of these genes in Eed<sup>CKO</sup> could be due to a combination of loss of H3K27me3 (canonical mechanism). Loss of EED itself with subsequent gain in H3K27ac might also contribute to regulation of these genes. A second subset of repressed genes was also occupied by EED and H3K27me3 in WT, but H3K27me3 was not reduced by EED inactivation. While H3K27me3 may contribute to the repression of these genes in WT, their upregulation in Eed<sup>CKO</sup> was not attributable to H3K27me3, which was unchanged. Rather, our data suggest that upregulation was directly due to loss of EED itself, with consequent reduction of HDAC activity and gain in H3K27ac. A third subset of genes was occupied by EED but little H3K27me3 in WT. These genes had significant H3K27ac at baseline, which was further increased by Eed inactivation. Thus, these genes may represent a set ‘poised’ for activation; in WT EED occupancy represses these genes by collaborating with HDAC to limit gene activity.

The role of PRC2 methylation of H3K27me3 in gene repression was further reinforced by studies of Drosophila imaginal discs in which wild-type histone H3 was replaced by a point mutation, H3K27R, that can neither be methylated nor acetylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pengelly et al., 2013</xref>). The effect of this H3K27R mutation resembled PRC2 inactivation, suggesting that in this system the major repressive activity of PRC2 is trimethylation of H3K27. However, several lines of evidence from our study indicate that an essential mechanism of PRC2 repression in adult CMs is independent of H3K27me3. First, genes de-repressed by <italic>Eed</italic> inactivation had largely unchanged H3K27me3. This result was robust to the method used to normalize the H3K27me3 ChIP-seq data and was independently validated at selected sites by ChIP-qPCR. Second, AAV-EED rescued heart function without correcting global H3K27me3 levels or occupancy of upregulated gene TSSs. Third, AAV-HDAC1/2 rescued heart function and re-established gene repression without elevating H3K27me3.</p><p>Our data indicate that in adult CMs, PRC2 regulation of H3K27ac plays an essential role in repression of a subset of genes. First, gene upregulation in Eed<sup>CKO</sup> was associated with gain of H3K27ac. Second, AAV-EED rescue correlated with restoration of H3K27ac rather than H3K27me3. Third, AAV-HDAC1/2 rescued function of Eed<sup>CKO</sup> hearts and normalized H3K27ac but not H3K27me3. HDACs have multiple substrates, including other histone acetylation sites as well as non-histone proteins. Our data do not exclude important effects of HDACs on targets other than H3K27ac, but the close correlation between H3K27ac and cardiac rescue strongly suggests that HDAC acts, at least in part, through H3K27ac. Depletion of essential PRC2 subunits in ES cells and <italic>Drosophila</italic> was previously reported to increase H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pasini et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tie et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferrari et al., 2014</xref>), consistent with the genetic interplay between PRC2 and histone acetylation that we observed in this study. Similarly, dominant negative inhibition of PRC2 by expression of a point mutant of histone H3.3 (H3.3K27M) globally increased H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herz et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, EED-HDAC2 interaction and HDAC activity were previously reported to be essential for PRC2 repression of selected target loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van der Vlag and Otte, 1999</xref>). However, the global role of H3K27me3 versus H3K27ac in EED-mediated repression in vivo has remained uncertain. Our study clarifies this relationship in postnatal CMs, by demonstrating that gene de-repression downstream of EED loss of function is closely tied to H3K27ac gain rather than to H3K27me3 loss.</p><p>As reviewed above, the canonical dogma is that PRC2 represses genes by depositing H3K27me3. Why might our study have reached a different conclusion? One key difference is the mitotic state of the model systems: whereas the vast majority of studies of PRC2 have been performed in actively cycling cells such as embryonic stem cells and developing embryos, mature CMs have largely exited the cell cycle. Cycling cells require active rewriting of histone marks, so that PRC2 inactivation is rapidly accompanied by widespread H3K27me3 loss. In contrast, adult CMs have relatively stable H3K27me3 and little detectable PRC2 methyltransferase activity. Under these conditions, there is likely a greater opportunity to expose writing-independent activities of EED. Importantly, many cells of adult mammals are either slowly cycling or terminally differentiated, and thus aspects of their epigenetic regulation may more closely resemble adult CMs than cultured cells such as embryonic stem cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Remodeling the chromatin landscape to correct heart failure</title><p>Mutations of epigenetic regulators cause congenital heart disease, and abnormalities of the chromatin landscape have been implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zaidi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delgado-Olguín et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lickert et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Montgomery et al., 2007</xref>). The chromatin landscape is not hardwired but rather dynamically constructed through the sequential action of epigenetic regulators, suggesting that perturbation of the normal sequence may irreversibly disrupt the chromatin landscape. Consistent with this expectation, we found that transient loss of EED irrevocably altered the landscape of H3K27me3. EED inactivation also globally increased H3K27ac levels, and gene de-repression was associated with H3K27ac gain on TSS regions of de-repressed genes. This was closely in line with the findings by Margueron and colleagues that transcription and histone modification changes as a consequence of EZH2 loss are predominantly irreversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wassef et al., 2015</xref>). Despite these irreversible changes to the epigenetic landscape, remarkably AAV-EED and AAV-HDAC1/2 were able to successfully remodel the chromatin landscape to functionally correct abnormalities of gene expression and organ function, even without correcting the genome-wide distribution of modified histone marks. These results reveal that it is possible to rehabilitate deregulated gene programs due to distorted chromatin landscapes, which contribute to diseases such as heart failure and congenital heart disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All animal experiments were performed according to protocols (protocol #, Lsc-HeAB-1) approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Peking University and Boston Children's Hospital. <italic>Eed</italic><sup>fl</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xie et al., 2014a</xref>) and <italic>Myh6</italic><sup>Cre</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agah et al., 1997</xref>) alleles were described previously. ‘WT’ denotes either <italic>Eed</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>; <italic>Myh6</italic><sup>Cre–</sup> or <italic>Eed</italic><sup>fl/+</sup> genotypes.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Kevin Struhl (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Mauro Calabrese (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>First: There is general agreement that your manuscript is a potentially important study and that the findings you report are surprising. There is enthusiasm for publishing this paper in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, the surprising and significant conclusions rest heavily on there being no cardiac cell division after birth to dilute away the H3K27 mark. Recent papers suggest that heart cells can and do divide after birth. The authors must test this to see if cell division is taking place. Current models are that non-dividing cells should be able to maintain H3K27me3 without PRC2, which is why the paper concludes that PRC2 must have another function independent of H3K27me3 in light of the cardiomyopathy seen after EED deletion.</p><p>Second: The reviewers also commented that the Text understated the loss of the histone mark. One third of derepressed genes did show loss of H3K27me3. How did this take place? This could have been due to cell division and passive loss of the histone mark. Quantitative measurements with statistical testing should be performed for known polycomb targets in heart muscle.</p><p>Third: there is general concern that the EED KO may not be a true null. Peptides can still be seen in Western. It would be important to determine whether the mutant protein truly has no activity.</p><p>Finally: your paper proposes a direct mechanistic link between EED and HDAC. One reviewer suggested the excellent idea of treating cardiomyocytes with HDAC-inhibitors to see if the same target genes are upregulated as in the EED CKO. If so, the results would speak for a common mechanism.</p><p>For publication, we would like to see these points and related points addressed in a revised manuscript. If you choose to revise your manuscript, we would also require a reviewer-link to the GEO data for this study. We hope to see a revised manuscript within 2-3 months, although the nature of the requested experiments may require you to take more time.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is a potentially important study that proposes that depleting EED (and therefore PRC2) in postnatal cardiomyocytes results in a lethal dilated cardiomyopathy with loss of silencing of myocardial gene program. This finding is surprising because non-dividing cells are thought to be able to maintain H3K27me3 without PRC2. The authors conclude that EED has a non-canonical function that is independent of its H3K27 methylation activity. The paper reports exciting findings. However, there are two concerns that must be addressed for publication.</p><p>1) Postnatal cardiomyocytes have been shown in recent studies to proliferate. Please consult (as one example): Naqvi N, Li M, Calvert JW, Tejada T, Lambert JP, Wu J, Kesteven SH, Holman SR, Matsuda T, Lovelock JD, et al. 2014. A proliferative burst during preadolescence establishes the final cardiomyocyte number. Cell 157: 795-807. The authors' findings relating to an EED deletion could be explained if there is proliferation in the postnatal cardiomyocytes. In this case, there would not be a &quot;non-canonical&quot; function of PRC2, and the authors would have to tone down their conclusions considerably. The paper may still be publishable without this dramatic conclusion.</p><p>2) The authors' data suggest that there is in fact some loss of H3K27me3. This would be consistent with continued (though limited) proliferation of cardiomyocytes after birth. I think the authors underestimated the depletion of the H3K27me3 mark.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, the authors describe the interesting observation that EED is critical for heart maturation and propose a novel mechanism, in which EED does not repress its target genes via its chanonical role in PRC2 through applying the H3K27me3 mark, but rather through affecting histone acetylation by modulating HDAC activity. The authors present clear evidence for a striking phenotype, and provide a comprehensive analysis with convincing rescue experiments showing a clear role for EED and HDACs. However, some discrepancies in the data, like for example opposing results for recruitment of HDACs by EED depending on the assay (EED loss of function – no effect vs. sufficiency via EED tethering), need to be addressed before firm mechanistic claims linking EED with HDAC activity can be made.</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>: There is still a remaining Eed transcript detectable in Eed<sup>CKO</sup> mice. The Western Blot is cut, so it is not visible, if there is a remaining Eed protein of reduced size. The authors should show the entire Western Blot and quantify the remaining RNA-levels based on qPCR (both for wt and CKO transcript levels). It is possible that a truncated Eed protein could still have a remaining function in the CKO allele, or incomplete deletion by the Cre-driver (some remaining protein visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) could explain the leftover H3K27me3 signal. A truncated EED-protein could also have different hypomorphic functionalities, for example related to gene repression, than a complete null would have. Therefore, it is important to clarify, if the presented CKO allele is a complete functional null or not.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–K</xref>: In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–G</xref> the authors have demonstrated that EED does not play a significant role in vivo in recruiting HDAC2 to chromatin.

The authors find that deletion of Eed during heart development results in cardiomyopathy concomitant with upregulation of several slow-twitch myofiber genes. A battery of genomic profiling experiments performed in wild-type, mutant, and Eed or HDAC rescued cardiomyocytes, demonstrate that Eed recruits and/or stimulates histone deacetylase activity at key target genes to acutely repress their expression during heart maturation. The major surprise is that this repressive effect is caused by recruitment and/or stimulation of HDAC activity, and is independent of major changes in H3K27me3 at two-thirds of target genes. The experiments presented are thorough and extensive. The results corroborate prior works that have linked PRC2 complex to HDACs, and should be of broad interest to many researchers.

There is enthusiasm for publishing this paper in eLife. However, the surprising and significant conclusions rest heavily on there being no cardiac cell division after birth to dilute away the H3K27 mark. Recent papers suggest that heart cells can and do divide after birth. The authors must test this to see if cell division is taking place. Current models are that non-dividing cells should be able to maintain H3K27me3 without PRC2, which is why the paper concludes that PRC2 must have another function independent of H3K27me3 in light of the cardiomyopathy seen after EED deletion.</italic> </p><p>Our main finding is that upregulation of the majority of genes in postnatal cardiomyocyte EED knockout was not linked to loss of H3K27me3. This observation is independent of whether cardiomyocyte proliferate or not. However, the paucity of postnatal cardiomyocyte proliferation is likely an important reason that our data differs from studies of EED in cell lines or proliferating cell types.</p><p>Although Naqvi et al. (PMID:24813607) suggested a burst of cardiomyocyte proliferation in mouse preadolescence (2 weeks after birth), this finding has not been reproduced by the work of four independent groups using multiple independent methods (PMID: 24876275, 26544945, 26544927, and 26472817). The general consensus currently is that there is detectable but limited cardiomyocyte proliferation in the postnatal heart (for example, PMID 17660827, 19342590, 23222518, in addition to the 4 studies cited in the previous sentence). The large majority of murine cardiomyocytes undergo a final round of nuclear division within the first postnatal week of life, and then terminally exit the cell cycle. In the mature adult heart, there is general agreement that the rate of cardiomyocyte turnover is low (CM turnover of 0.7-1% per year in adult mouse and human). We performed immunofluorescent staining for phosphohistone H3 (pH3, M-phase marker) of heart sections at three different postnatal ages and confirmed that there is little cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity after the first postnatal week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>). Given the large body of data on this topic in the literature and the elaborate methods (C14 carbon dating; imaging mass spectrometry; genetic pulse-labeling) that have been employed to reach the current consensus, we felt that including these data in this paper would not add to the paper or to the overall literature on this subject.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24570.019</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Examination of cariomyocyte proliferation rate in neonatal heart.</title><p>Immunostaining and quantification of phosphorylated histone H3 (pH2; red) as a marker for M-phase in hearts at P0, P5 and P18 cardiomyocytes (TNN13, green).

One third of derepressed genes did show loss of H3K27me3. How did this take place? This could have been due to cell division and passive loss of the histone mark. Quantitative measurements with statistical testing should be performed for known polycomb targets in heart muscle.</italic> </p><p>As noted by the reviewers, 1/3 of upregulated genes had H3K27me3 loss, whereas 2/3 of upregulated genes had retained H3K27me3. This variation in H3K27me3 levels strongly argues that loss of H3K27me3 is not due to passive dilution during proliferation. We have done separate experiments that measure locus-specific histone turnover in cardiomyocytes, which is possible because of their low turnover rate. We observed that cardiomyocytes display finely-regulated locus-specific histone turnover. This separate manuscript is currently in preparation.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have made more clear that 1/3 of genes are upregulated and lose H3K27me3, consistent with the canonical model of PRC2-mediated repression through H3K27me3 deposition. We grouped the upregulated genes into clusters based on their H3K27me3 signal in WT and Eed<sup>CKO</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). C1 corresponds to the cluster with gene upregulation and H3K27me3 loss. The majority of genes fall into C2 and C3, which do not show this canonical association. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>, we quantitatively compared H3K27me3 signal between WT and Eed<sup>CKO</sup> within each cluster with appropriate statistical testing to better demonstrate the behavior of H3K27me3 in C1 vs C2 and C3.</p><p>In the revision, we also performed quantitative analysis of H3K27me3 levels on known polycomb targets (defined by ± 10 kb of gene TSS) in cardiomyocytes as suggested by the editor and reviewers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found that median H3K27me3 levels were reduced only in EED target genes among the quartile of upregulated genes with the strongest H3K27me3 in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2M</xref>), again indicating that H3K27me3 loss was only seen in a minority of upregulated genes.</p><p><italic>Third: there is general concern that the EED KO may not be a true null. Peptides can still be seen in Western. It would be important to determine whether the mutant protein truly has no activity.</italic> </p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, the above 75 kDa, indicated by asterisk, is larger than the calculated full-length molecular weight of 60 kDa and is a non-specific band. The remaining EED detected in EED-CKO is likely due to the signals from non-cardiomyocytes of P0 and P5 heart apex used for Western blot and RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). While <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> used whole heart apex, the rest of the manuscript used isolated adult cardiomyoctes with &gt;95% purity for Western blots, RNA analysis, and ChIP-seq.</p><p>In the EED conditional allele, the floxed exons are 3-6, which contain the critical WD-repeat domain of EED that binds to nucleosomes and EZH2. This same floxed allele was tested by Stuart Orkin’s lab and demonstrated to be functionally null (Xie, et al., Cell Stem Cell, 2014, PMID: 24239285). In RNA-seq of purified cardiomyocytes, exons 3-6 were not detectably expressed, confirming high efficiency gene ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2I</xref>). We further verified the nearly complete excision of the floxed allele by PCR analysis with DNA from purified cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2H</xref>). Based on these data, we are confident that there is no residual, functional EED protein in the large majority of adult cardiomyocytes used for the RNA-seq and ChIP-seq experiments.</p><p><italic>Finally: your paper proposes a direct mechanistic link between EED and HDAC. One reviewer suggested the excellent idea of treating cardiomyocytes with HDAC-inhibitors to see if the same target genes are upregulated as in the EED CKO. If so, the results would speak for a common mechanism.</italic> </p><p>Our model is that EED stimulates HDAC activity, and therefore HDAC inhibition might mimic some of the features of EED-CKO. As suggested by the editor and reviewers, we treated control (Het + AAV-luc) mice with the broad spectrum HDAC inhibitor SAHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). SAHA did not significantly affect heart function or derepress genes that were upregulated in EED-CKO. These data indicate that EED-HDAC is not required in normal cardiomyocyte maturation, possibly due to multiple, redundant gene repressive mechanisms. However, when EED-CKO mice were rescued with AAV9-EED, rescue was blocked by SAHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This suggests that transient EED loss of function disrupts the chromatin landscape and multiple gene repressive mechanisms. Whereas re-expression of EED can restore gene repression, this process depends on HDAC activity.</p><p><italic>For publication, we would like to see these points and related points addressed in a revised manuscript. If you choose to revise your manuscript, we would also require a reviewer-link to the GEO data for this study. We hope to see a revised manuscript within 2-3 months, although the nature of the requested experiments may require you to take more time.</italic> </p><p>We have deposited the data to GEO and have supplied a reviewer link in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>This is a potentially important study that proposes that depleting EED (and therefore PRC2) in postnatal cardiomyocytes results in a lethal dilated cardiomyopathy with loss of silencing of myocardial gene program. This finding is surprising because non-dividing cells are thought to be able to maintain H3K27me3 without PRC2. The authors conclude that EED has a non-canonical function that is independent of its H3K27 methylation activity. The paper reports exciting findings. However, there are two concerns that must be addressed for publication.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Postnatal cardiomyocytes have been shown in recent studies to proliferate. Please consult (as one example): Naqvi N, Li M, Calvert JW, Tejada T, Lambert JP, Wu J, Kesteven SH, Holman SR, Matsuda T, Lovelock JD, et al. 2014. A proliferative burst during preadolescence establishes the final cardiomyocyte number. Cell 157: 795-807. The authors' findings relating to an EED deletion could be explained if there is proliferation in the postnatal cardiomyocytes. In this case, there would not be a &quot;non-canonical&quot; function of PRC2, and the authors would have to tone down their conclusions considerably. The paper may still be publishable without this dramatic conclusion.</italic> </p><p>We addressed this comment in detail in the summary critique (point #1). The main observation that gene upregulation was not associated with H3K27me3 loss at 2/3 of genes is not dependent on whether or not cardiomyocytes proliferate. The terminal differentiation of postnatal CMs is relevant to the study because it provides a potential explanation for why this non-canonical mechanism is not observed in intensively studied cell types such as ESCs and cancer cell lines, where cell proliferation demands PRC2 deposition of new H3K27me3 and hence emphasizes this aspect of PRC2 function.</p><p>Although Naqvi et al. (PMID:24813607) showed a burst of cardiomyocyte proliferation in mouse preadolescence (2 weeks after birth), this result has not been reproduced by four independent groups using multiple independent approaches (PMID: 24876275, 26544945, 26544927, and 26472817). The general consensus currently is that there is detectable but limited cardiomyocyte proliferation in the postnatal heart. The large majority of murine cardiomyocytes undergo a final round of nuclear division within the first postnatal week of life, and then terminally exit the cell cycle. In the mature adult heart, there is general agreement that the rate of cardiomyocyte turnover is low (CM turnover of 0.7-1% per year in adult mouse and human). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref> shows additional data that cardiomyocytes have largely exited the cell cycle after the first postnatal week. We do not rule out all proliferation-related dilution of H3K27me3 in EED-CKO, but it is likely to make a small contribution to the loss of H3K27me3.</p><p>We observed that H3K27me3 is retained at some sites and lost at others. This cannot be accounted for simply by proliferation-related dilution, and further indicates that other mechanisms are responsible for H3K27me3 loss. We have studied histone dynamics in postnatal cardiomyocytes extensively and are preparing a separate manuscript on this topic. However, it is outside of the scope of the present study.</p><p><italic>2) The authors' data suggest that there is in fact some loss of H3K27me3. This would be consistent with continued (though limited) proliferation of cardiomyocytes after birth. I think the authors underestimated the depletion of the H3K27me3 mark.</italic> </p><p>We agree that about 1/3 of derepressed genes have reduced H3K27me3. On the other hand, 2/3 of these genes retain H3K27me3, which was quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref> and also in this revision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2M</xref>). This differential retention of H3K27me3 cannot be accounted for by passive dilution during proliferation and strongly argues for other mechanisms of H3K27me3 loss. We have done separate experiments that measure locus-specific histone turnover in cardiomyocytes, which is possible because of their low turnover rate. We observed that cardiomyocytes display finely-regulated locus-specific histone turnover. This separate manuscript is currently in preparation.</p><p>The major focus of this manuscript is understanding the mechanism of derepression of the 2/3 of genes that retained H3K27me3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2: In this manuscript, the authors describe the interesting observation that EED is critical for heart maturation and propose a novel mechanism, in which EED does not repress its target genes via its chanonical role in PRC2 through applying the H3K27me3 mark, but rather through affecting histone acetylation by modulating HDAC activity. The authors present clear evidence for a striking phenotype, and provide a comprehensive analysis with convincing rescue experiments showing a clear role for EED and HDACs. However, some discrepancies in the data, like for example opposing results for recruitment of HDACs by EED depending on the assay (EED loss of function – no effect vs. sufficiency via EED tethering), need to be addressed before firm mechanistic claims linking EED with HDAC activity can be made. 1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>: There is still a remaining Eed transcript detectable in EedCKO mice. The Western Blot is cut, so it is not visible, if there is a remaining Eed protein of reduced size. The authors should show the entire Western Blot and quantify the remaining RNA-levels based on qPCR (both for wt and CKO transcript levels). It is possible that a truncated Eed protein could still have a remaining function in the CKO allele, or incomplete deletion by the Cre-driver (some remaining protein visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) could explain the leftover H3K27me3 signal. A truncated EED-protein could also have different hypomorphic functionalities, for example related to gene repression, than a complete null would have. Therefore, it is important to clarify, if the presented CKO allele is a complete functional null or not.</italic> </p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, the band at 75 kDa, indicated by an asterisk, is larger than the expected full-length molecular weight of 60 kDa and represents a non-specific signal. The remaining EED detected in EED CKO is likely due to the signals from non-cardiomyocytes of P0 and P5 heart apex used for Western blot and RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). While <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> used whole heart apex, the rest of the manuscript used isolated adult cardiomyoctes with &gt;95% purity for the other Western blots, RNA analysis, and ChIP-seq.

Could this be tested in a full EED KO or knockdown cell line?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this critical point. Although the tethering experiment demonstrated that EED can stimulate local histone deacetylation, it is confusing because it appears to contradict the in vivo data that show that EED is dispensable for recruiting HDAC2 to chromatin. The cellular and chromatin contexts of these experiments are quite different and we do not believe the results are incompatible. For instance, the tested genes do not naturally have HDAC2 or EED occupancy, whereas the in vivo experiment was a loci that do have endogenous HDAC2 and EED occupancy. Nevertheless, because this experiment is confusing, we removed it from the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: While it is interesting that overexpression of HDAC1/2 leads to a partial rescue (changes in H3K27ac look not very strong after HDAC overexpression) of the EED CKO phenotype, a complementary proof would be a loss of function experiment for HDAC activity in heart muscle cells.
