Many prokaryotes, archea, unicellular eukaryotes, and plants use a recently discovered family of F<sup>−</sup> exporter proteins to lower cytoplasmic F<sup>−</sup> levels to counteract the anion’s toxicity. We show here that these ‘Fluc’ proteins, purified and reconstituted in liposomes and planar phospholipid bilayers, form constitutively open anion channels with extreme selectivity for F<sup>−</sup> over Cl<sup>−</sup>. The active channel is a dimer of identical or homologous subunits arranged in antiparallel transmembrane orientation. This dual-topology assembly has not previously been seen in ion channels but is known in multidrug transporters of the SMR family, and is suggestive of an evolutionary antecedent of the inverted repeats found within the subunits of many membrane transport proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01084.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01084.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01084.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Fluorine is the thirteenth-most abundant element in the Earth’s crust, and fluoride ions are found in both soil and water, where they accumulate through the weathering of rocks or from industrial pollution. However, high levels of fluoride ions can inhibit two processes essential to life: the production of energy by glycolysis and the synthesis of DNA and RNA bases. In polluted areas, organisms such as bacteria, algae and plants must remove fluoride ions from their cells in order to survive.</p><p>Since ions cannot freely cross lipid membranes, organisms use proteins called channels or carriers to move ions into and out of their cells. Channel proteins form a pore, or channel, in the cell membrane, through which ions can quickly move from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration. In contrast, carrier proteins can transport ions in both directions—that is, to and from areas of high concentration—but they are slower than channel proteins.</p><p>A family of proteins that export fluoride from microbe and plant cells, thus allowing them to grow in the presence of this toxic ion, was discovered recently, but it was not clear if these proteins function as channels or as carrier proteins. Now, Stockbridge et al. find that these proteins, called Fluc proteins, are fluoride channels with an unusual architecture.</p><p>Fluc proteins are found in many species of bacteria, and Stockbridge et al. show that a number of these, when purified and inserted into a lipid membrane, are channel proteins. Additionally, they do not transport related ions such as chloride, which means that they are unusually selective for ion channels. Two Fluc polypeptides associate to form a channel in the cell membrane, and Stockbridge et al. show that these two subunits are arranged in an antiparallel formation. Although this architecture is unprecedented among ion channels, it has been observed in carrier proteins in a range of organisms, and may indicate that Fluc proteins offer an evolutionary model for many carrier proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01084.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01084.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>ion channel</kwd><kwd>fluoride</kwd><kwd>membrane topology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99-GM101016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robertson</surname><given-names>Janice L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Efflux of xenobiotic fluoride from microorganisms occurs through a novel family of ion channels with stringent selectivity for fluoride ion and dual-topology molecular architecture.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fluoride pervades our biosphere, appearing in groundwater, sea, and soil typically at 10–100 μM levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Weinstein and Davison, 2004</xref>).

Two separate, phylogenetically unrelated families of F<sup>−</sup> exporters are now known: CLC<sup>F</sup>-type F<sup>−</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters, a subclass of the widespread CLC superfamily of anion-transport proteins, and a group of small membrane proteins known as the ‘crcB’ family or, as we rename them here (to avoid confusion with the CLCs), the ‘Fluc’ family. Fluc proteins are widespread among unicellular organisms.

Lipid vesicles reconstituted with this mutant were treated with LysC protease to exclusively remove the C-terminal His tags exposed to the outside of the liposomes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> shows that Fluc proteins are randomly oriented in the liposomes.

This treatment labels only the lower band containing the polypeptides with externally exposed C-termini, thereby demonstrating that the N- and C-termini are exposed on the same side of the membrane, as anticipated by the Fluc hydropathy profile. To further confirm the predicted four-TM topology, similar experiments were performed with unique cysteines (N31C and E94C) placed in the first or third loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Liposomes were reconstituted under ‘Poisson-dilution’ conditions, that is, with Ec2 or Bpe at protein densities so low that 30–50% of the liposomes are devoid of protein, and most of the protein-containing liposomes carry only a single functional unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Walden et al., 2007</xref>). The liposomes were loaded with 150 mM each of KF and KCl and suspended in iso-osmotic solution containing 1 mM KF and KCl along with 300 mM K-isethionate (2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, a membrane-impermeant monovalent anion). Valinomycin (Vln), a K<sup>+</sup> ionophore, was then added to start the efflux by allowing the anions to move down their gradients. After protein-catalyzed ion efflux had reached completion, detergent was added to disrupt all the liposomes and reveal the protein-free fraction. Two striking results are apparent from the F<sup>−</sup> and Cl<sup>−</sup> efflux kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). First, the proteoliposomes are selectively permeable to F<sup>−</sup>; Cl<sup>−</sup> efflux is undetectable on this timescale, and similar experiments in the absence of F<sup>−</sup> recapitulate this lack of Cl<sup>−</sup> transport. Second, Fluc-mediated F<sup>−</sup> efflux is so fast that an initial rate measurement is precluded by the 1-s dead-time of the stirred-cuvette system. An estimate based on a 35-nm liposome radius leads to a lower limit of ∼30,000 s<sup>−1</sup> for the single-Fluc transport rate. Since this is substantially higher than turnover of any conformational-cycle based membrane transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jayaram et al., 2008</xref>), it intimates that Fluc might be a F<sup>−</sup> channel.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01084.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>F<sup>−</sup> transport and selectivity in Fluc proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Liposome flux assays for Fluc Ec2 and Bpe (∼10 pmol protein/mg lipid).

Initial experiments aimed at maximizing the electrical signal used liposomes with high protein density, 10–50 Fluc copies per liposome. When fused into planar bilayers, these liposomes evoke a robust increase in bilayer conductance in discrete steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), each of which reports a single liposome inserting its packet of ion-conducting proteins. The heterogeneity in step-size reflects the wide distribution of liposome size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Miller and Racker, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Accardi et al., 2004</xref>). After a few minutes, liposomes are perfused away to stabilize the bilayer conductance, thereby allowing examination of its properties. We applied a series of pulses to voltages from −100 mV to +150 mV and recorded the resulting currents to determine current-voltage (I–V) relations under various ionic conditions. As shown in the inset to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, recorded in the presence of a salt gradient (300 mM NaF//30 mM NaF), the current appears as a ‘leak’ without any time- or voltage-dependent gating over a wide voltage range. The Fluc-mediated conductance is ideally selective for F<sup>−</sup> over Na<sup>+</sup>, as seen from the zero-current voltage (reversal potential) of 53 mV, indistinguishable from the Nernst potential for F<sup>−</sup> in the eightfold ionic activity gradient. High selectivity is further illustrated by the I–V relation under bi-ionic conditions (300 mM NaF//300 mM NaCl), whose high reversal potential (119 mV) sets a lower limit of ∼100 on the F<sup>−</sup>/Cl<sup>−</sup> permeability ratio.</p><p>To detect single-channel currents, we prepared Fluc-reconstituted liposomes under Poisson-dilution conditions and fused them as above into planar bilayers. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> shows examples of Fluc-insertion events in three separate bilayers, along with a histogram of Fluc insertion-step amplitudes taken from ∼50 bilayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, upper panel). Most of these insertion-steps are 1.8 pA under these conditions, equivalent to 7 pS, while a minority (&lt;20%) are 30–50% of this main step-size (illustrated in the third trace). The current shows occasional discrete fluctuations of two types: subsecond-timescale closing events and rare millisecond-timescale excursions to a substate of 50–60% of the main-state amplitude. The ‘full-open’ state persists &gt;95% of the time at all voltages (−200 mV to +200 mV). Its high open probability further shows itself in an extended recording with three channels in the bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, red trace) and from the amplitude histogram of a typical single channel (right panel lower histogram). These channels display voltage-independent, anion-selective characteristics in harmony with the macroscopic currents reported above, and their appearance is strictly dependent on reconstituting Fluc protein into the liposomes. Accordingly, we conclude that these unitary current-steps reflect activity of single Fluc proteins, with single-molecule turnover of ∼10<sup>7</sup> F<sup>−</sup> ions/sec at −200 mV, a rate typical for ion channels and three to four orders of magnitude higher than the fastest known transporters. Thus, Fluc-Ec2 is a highly F<sup>−</sup>-selective channel, a protein with a transmembrane pore through which F<sup>−</sup> ion moves thermodynamically downhill by electrodiffusion.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01084.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Single Fluc channels.

Upon illumination of these liposomes immobilized on a glass surface, the covalently attached fluorophores bleach in several minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>), mostly in single and double steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Given the measured labeling efficiency (72%), the preponderance of single- and double-bleach events is fully consistent with a dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Fewer than 5% bleach in three or four steps, consistent with co-localization of the liposomes, but not with trimeric or tetrameric architecture for the channel.

The twin Flucs possess abundantly charged loops; for one of the pair, a positive charge bias resides on the N- and C-termini and loop 2, while its homologous partner exhibits a converse bias, with excess positive charge on loops 1 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, according to the positive-inside rule for charge distribution in bacterial membrane proteins, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">von Heijne, 1989</xref>) one of the twins is predicted to insert into the membrane with the termini in the cytoplasm, and the second should be oppositely oriented. In striking contrast, the singletons display relatively balanced charge distributions on either face. In a genomic analysis of small membrane proteins, including Fluc, Rapp and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rapp et al., 2006</xref>) proposed that a balanced Arg+Lys distribution in loops indicates dual-topology oligomeric construction, in which subunits insert randomly in both transmembrane orientations, and those of opposite orientations associate together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Do singletons like Ec2 and Bpe find partners in the membrane from a pool of randomly oriented Flucs to form inverted-topology homodimers? Do the fraternal Flucs find their homologous companions oppositely oriented in the membrane? A strong indication of antiparallel assembly appears in eukaryotic Fluc genomes. These genes all code for a pair of homologous Fluc sequences within a single open reading frame, and the linker connecting them contains a predicted TM helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This ‘inversion linker’ would force the second Fluc domain to adopt a transmembrane topology upside down with respect to the first. These genomic characteristics of Fluc channels constitute compelling evidence for dual-topology construction, but since no previously known ion channels are built in this way, experimental support is needed to test such sequence-based suggestions.</p><p>We approach the question in two ways. First, amino-group cross-linking of Fluc subunits is examined in detergent micelles. Even though the Ec2 subunit contains four amino groups, the dimer cannot be cross-linked by glutaraldehyde (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Since these amines are all located on the same face of the protein—in loop 2 and both termini—glutaraldehyde would be expected to cross-link a conventional parallel dimer but not an antiparallel dimer. With an additional lysine substituted on the opposite face, in loop 1 (R25K) or loop 3 (N95K), glutaraldehyde treatment now leads to the appearance of a dimer band on the PAGE gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Similarly, lysine-less Bpe is not cross-linked by glutaraldehyde, despite its solvent-accessible N-terminal amino group. Single lysine mutations on the side opposite to the N-terminus, in loop 1 (R29K) or loop 3 (R95K), beget a cross-linked dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), whereas solvent-accessible lysines on loops 2 (R68K), on the C-terminus (R130K), or on both do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These results are in natural harmony with antiparallel orientation and are difficult to understand in terms of a parallel-topology dimer, but do not by themselves provide rigorous proof.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01084.014</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Fluc architecture.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Crosslinking patterns. 15% SDS-PAGE of WT Ec2 (<bold>A</bold>) or Bpe (<bold>B</bold>) and indicated lysine mutants treated with 0.125% glutaraldehyde for the indicated times.

We expressed several constructs in which La1 and La2 are fused together with linkers designed to force the two domains into parallel or antiparallel orientations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). For the antiparallel construct, Laf-TM, the domains are linked with a non-dimerizing glycophorin-A TM helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lemmon et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Fleming et al., 1997</xref>).

This result strongly implies that functional Fluc channels are built with the two 4-TM subunits or domains in antiparallel transmembrane topology, an arrangement that prohibits axial symmetry along the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we have taken four initial steps towards understanding the molecular character of the Fluc family of F<sup>−</sup> exporters. The results demonstrate that the mechanism by which Fluc transports F<sup>−</sup> is thermodynamically passive electrodiffusion through a transmembrane channel, that the channel is unusually F<sup>−</sup>-selective, and that it is constructed as a dimer of subunits or homologous domains. In addition, the two subunits in the functional dimer are very likely oriented antiparallel to each other within the membrane.</p><p>How could a passive channel move F<sup>−</sup> out of the cell against an environmental F<sup>−</sup> challenge? It might seem that an active transport mechanism would be required, as in bacteria that use CLC<sup>F</sup>–type F<sup>−</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters. However, Fluc channels can work to effectively expel F<sup>−</sup> in two ways. First, the negative membrane potential maintained by many classes of metabolizing cells tilts the anion’s equilibrium towards expulsion. Second, the high pK<sub>a</sub> of HF (∼3.4), anomalous among haloacids, dictates that in weakly acidic environments, a significant amount of extracellular HF is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2012</xref>). This membrane-permeant acid readily enters the cell and dissociates at the higher cytoplasmic pH. F<sup>−</sup> would therefore accumulate far above its extracellular concentration if no conductive pathway for the anion were present in the membrane, but a passive F<sup>−</sup> channel would undermine this weak-acid accumulation effect.</p><p>A deeper enigma is Fluc’s remarkable discrimination between F<sup>−</sup>, which is so difficult to desolvate, and Cl<sup>−</sup>, which is orders of magnitude more abundant in the environment. Liposome flux experiments establish a far more dramatic F<sup>−</sup>/Cl<sup>−</sup> selectivity than the 100-fold lower limit set by electrical recording. Anion-efflux assays measure Cl<sup>−</sup> turnover &lt;30 ions/s, while in the same assays with F<sup>−</sup>, unitary turnover rates exceed 30,000 s<sup>−1</sup>, and direct single-channel recording yields a turnover of 10<sup>6</sup>–10<sup>7</sup> F<sup>−</sup>/sec. These values conservatively put F<sup>−</sup>/Cl<sup>−</sup> selectivity &gt;10<sup>4</sup>-fold, the highest value known between close analogs for any ion channel. It is this formidable selectivity that allows a bacterium or yeast to express a constitutively open F<sup>−</sup> channel in its energy-coupling membrane while avoiding a massive Cl<sup>−</sup> conductance that would otherwise catastrophically collapse its membrane potential. High ion selectivity requires that F<sup>−</sup> be largely desolvated as it passes through the Fluc channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hille, 2001</xref>), an energetically demanding step (&gt;100 kcal/mol) that has been an obstacle to the development of F<sup>−</sup>-selective small-molecule ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cametti and Rissanen, 2009</xref>). This chemical problem motivates future work to identify selectivity regions in Fluc sequences and, ultimately, structures.</p><p>The molecular architecture inferred here is unconventional and unexpected. Most ion channel proteins are built on a barrel-stave plan in which three to seven similar subunits surround an axial pore running perpendicular to the membrane plane, the wider pores requiring a larger number of subunits. But an ion-conduction pore formed by a two-stave barrel—a dimer—is unprecedented until now. We are obliged to point out, however, that Fluc’s high open probability precludes a definitive conclusion that the observed single-channel currents are mediated by a single pore rather than two in parallel, especially in light of the infrequent subconductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, this substate is not precisely half the condunctance of the fully open channel, and the protein’s small size makes a two-pore dimer, along the lines of CLC channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Middleton et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ludewig et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Middleton et al., 1996</xref>), unlikely, but a picture like this is not firmly ruled out at our investigation’s early stage.</p><p>A final surprise that provides an intriguing glimpse into the evolution of membrane transport proteins is the dual-topology construction inferred for Fluc. Unprecedented among known ion channels, dual topology has been observed in the SMR family of proton-coupled multidrug antiporters such as EmrE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schuldiner, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Morrison et al., 2012</xref>), and it recalls the inverted structural repeats that provide the mechanistic scaffolds of many transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Forrest et al., 2010</xref>). Oppositely oriented repeats within subunits are rare in ion channels, and so it is unclear whether this architecture provides particular mechanistic advantages for Flucs. The inverted structural repeats of transporters almost certainly evolved from gene duplication and subsequent fusion of sequences coding for dimeric proteins with an odd number of TM helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zuckerkandl and Pauling, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Forrest and Rudnick, 2009</xref>). The Fluc family obligingly provides examples in modern genomes of all stages along such an evolutionary pathway, including duplicated gene-pairs in bacteria and fused homologues in eukaryotes. Fusion of the latter genes must have required evolutionary gymnastics to capture a TM helix as an inversion linker for maintaining antiparallel topology of subunits with an even number of membrane crossings.</p><p>Finally, we note a conspicuous analogy to Fluc construction: the aquaporin channel. This protein’s narrow, water-permeable pore is formed within a single 6-TM subunit on the interface between two structurally similar domains in inverted orientation with respect to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Harries et al., 2004</xref>). It is thus entirely feasible to construct a narrow pore at a dual-topology dimer interface. The Fluc-aquaporin analogy is also of interest since the desolvated F<sup>−</sup> ion, with a radius of 1.3 Å, is almost the same size as H<sub>2</sub>O.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>Chemicals from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) were of highest grade obtainable. <italic>E. coli</italic> mixed phospholipids (EPL), 1-palmitoyl, 2-oleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (POPE), 1-palmitoyl, 2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), and 1-palmitoyl, 2-oleoylphosphatidylglycerol (POPG) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, detergents from Anatrace, and fluorophores from Invitrogen or GE-Biosciences.

In short, liposomes prepared with 10 mg/ml <italic>E. coli</italic> polar lipids containing 150 mM KF, 150 mM KCl, and 25 mM HEPES pH 7 were extruded 21 times through a 400-nm membrane filter and passed over a 1.5-ml G-50 Sephadex column equilibrated in external buffer composed of 300 K-isethionate, 25 mM HEPES pH 7, 1 mM KF or KCl, according to the ion measured. Liposomes were diluted 20-fold into external buffer in a stirred cuvette, and efflux was initiated by addition of 1 μM K<sup>+</sup> ionophore valinomycin. After ∼30 s, 50 mM β-octylglucoside was added to disrupt the liposomes. Cl<sup>−</sup> or F<sup>−</sup> appearance in the external solution was monitored using homemade Ag/AgCl or Cole-Parmer LaF<sub>3</sub>/EuF<sub>3</sub> electrodes, respectively; under the ionic conditions used here, these electrodes are ideally selective for Cl<sup>−</sup> or F<sup>−</sup>, and they show no cross-reactivity towards the other anion.</p><p>In some experiments, F<sup>−</sup> efflux was monitored by 90° light scattering at 600 nm in a fluorimeter. A liposome sample containing 300 mM KF, 25 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7 was diluted 200-fold into 2 ml of a degassed isotonic solution containing 300 mM K- or Na-isethionate, 25 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7 in a stirred cuvette, and efflux was initiated by 1 μM Vln. Water efflux maintaining osmotic balance leads to time-dependent shrinking and flattening of the initially spherical liposomes, accompanied by a ∼10% increase in 90° light scattering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Stockbridge et al., 2012</xref>). After transport was complete, p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazine (FCCP) was added to the cuvette, effectively making the protein-free liposomes specifically permeable to F<sup>−</sup> to provide a quantitative measurement of the fraction of liposomes, f<sub>0</sub>, free of Fluc channels. For Poisson-dump experiments, data were collected for proteins from four independent preparations of CLC-ec1 and Fluc-Ec2, and two independent preparations of Fluc-Bpe, Fluc-Laf, Fluc-LapA, and Fluc-LapB.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Planar lipid bilayer recording</title><p>Planar bilayer recording was as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Accardi et al., 2004</xref>), using a POPE/POPG phospholipid mixture to form the bilayer and 150 mM NaF-1.5% agar salt bridges to connect the recording chambers to the Ag/AgCl electrodes through 1 M KCl wells. Liposomes (0.5 μl added to the cis solution) were fused into the bilayer, with 300 mM or 30 mM NaF, 15 mM Mops-NaOH pH 7, in the cis or trans chamber respectively, trans defined as electrical ground. Ionic conditions for recording were established by perfusion of either chamber. Macroscopic I–V relations were determined with families of voltage pulses (0.5–1 s) from a holding potential of zero to command-voltages from −100 to +150 mV in 10-mV increments. Current output from a Axopatch 200A amplifier was low-pass filtered at 500 Hz and sampled at 2 kHz in pCLAMP software. Voltages were corrected for junction potential, &lt;3 mV. Signals for single-channel analysis were subsequently filtered digitally at 100 Hz.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>SEC-SLS-UV-RI</title><p>The molecular mass of Fluc in detergent was determined using the static light scattering/refractive index method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Folta-Stogniew, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Slotboom et al., 2008</xref>) implemented at the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, Yale University. Briefly, purified protein was passed over a Superdex-75 SEC column equilibrated in 400 mM NaF, 10 mM MES pH 6.5, 5 mM DM and coupled in-line with light scattering, refractive index, and UV detectors. Ovalbumin, transferase, bovine serum albumin, and carbonic anhydrase were used as standards. The molecular mass was determined in two ways: by the three-detector method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hayashi et al., 1989</xref>), and from light scattering intensity at several angles (ASTRA software, Wyatt Technology Corp.).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Single-molecule TIRF photobleaching</title><p>For the labeling reaction, freshly prepared Bpe with a single cysteine substitution (T3C or R29C) was incubated with a 20-fold molar excess of Cy5-maleimide for 1 hr at room temperature in the dark and quenched with a 100-fold molar excess of cysteine. To wash away excess fluorophore, the protein was bound to cobalt affinity beads and washed with 45 column volumes of cobalt wash buffer. The protein was eluted with 400 mM imidazole and the labeling efficiency was calculated from the protein absorbance at 280 nm (ε<sub>Bpe</sub> = 38,960 M<sup>−1</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup>, calculated from protein sequence), and the Cy5 absorbance at 655 nm (ε<sub>Cy5</sub> = 2.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup>), with spillover correction of 0.017. Parallel experiments with wildtype, cysteine-free Bpe showed that the background labeling was &lt;2% under the same conditions. Protein was reconstituted into liposomes at very low density (0.15 µg/mg lipid).</p><p>Flow chambers were prepared using two glass coverslips that were cleaned by sonication in 2% micro-90 detergent (Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL), ethanol and 0.1 M KOH. Liposomes were formed immediately prior to analysis. BPe T3C liposomes were sonicated vigorously for 10 min until clarity, yielding ∼30 nm liposomes. BPe R29C liposomes were extruded 21 times through a 100 nm filter, then 21 times through 30 nm filter (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada) to form small vesicles. Liposomes were diluted ∼10<sup>5</sup>-fold in reconstitution buffer, and loaded into the flow chamber, where they spontaneously adhere to the glass surface. The fluorescence from each liposome was measured using a custom through-objective TIRF microscope built for single molecule detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Friedman et al., 2006</xref>). Cy5 fluorescence was measured by illuminating the sample with a helium-neon 633 nm laser (75 µW power) and collecting the emitted light through a 633 nm long-pass filter (1 s per frame). Each spot was centered inside a 3 × 3 pixel area using linear interpolation and drift-correction, and the intensity was integrated over the duration of the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Cross-linking</title><p>For glutaraldehyde cross-linking experiments, ∼0.1 mg/ml freshly purified protein in 20 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic (MOPS), pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaF, and 5 mM DM was incubated with 0.125% glutaraldehyde (∼500-fold molar excess) for 5–120 min. The reaction was quenched with a 10-fold molar excess of Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and samples were run on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Jeff Gelles and Larry Friedman for use of the TIRF microscope, and to Ewa Folta-Stogniew for her rigorous implementation of the SEC-LS/UV/RI experiments (WM Keck facility, Yale University, supported by NIH Award Number 1S10RR023748-01).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Richard Aldrich (Reviewing editor), Olaf Andersen, and Joe Mindell (peer reviewers).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision. This interesting and novel paper from the Miller lab reports the discovery and characterization of a new class of fluoride-conducting ion channels. These channels, referred to as “Fluc”, were found as a family of membrane proteins under the control of an F<sup>-</sup>-sensing riboswitch. Here, the Miller lab expressed and purified several homologs, and find that they mediate dissipative and highly selective F<sup>-</sup> fluxes in liposomes and lipid bilayer membranes. Single channel events present themselves when liposomes containing low concentrations of Fluc proteins are fused to lipid bilayers, conclusively revealing the functional classification of these proteins. Simple labeling experiments sketch out a likely transmembrane topology. Several lines of evidence point to a dimeric functional unit, including crosslinking, “poisson-dump” assays, and single-molecule photobleaching. Surprisingly, the protein appears to form antiparallel dimers, as has been recently described for the multidrug transporter EmrE but for few, if any, other native membrane proteins. The work is thorough and rigorous, and the arguments are strong and convincing.</p><p>The manuscript is clearly written and provides important new insights into cellular F<sup>-</sup> homeostasis, as it provides solid experimental evidence that the Fluc family of fluoride channels, with their impressive selectivity for F<sup>-</sup> over Cl<sup>-</sup>, enable cells to maintain a low intercellular F<sup>-</sup> with no direct expenditure of metabolic energy.</p><p>[Editors’ note: minor issues and corrections have not been included, so there is not an accompanying Author response.]</p></body></sub-article></article>
