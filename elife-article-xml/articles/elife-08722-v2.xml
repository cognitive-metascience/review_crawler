Thus, we hypothesized that migration of IPCs away from hypoxic zones within the SGZ might result in oxidative damage, thus triggering cell death. Hypoxic niches were observed along the SGZ, composed of adult NSCs and early IPCs, and oxidative byproducts were present in adjacent late IPCs and neuroblasts.

This process involves the birth of new neurons, which are created at a rate of ∼4000 a day in the hippocampus of a young adult mouse. Yet only a fraction of these cells survive to form mature neurons. These cells die in two main waves – the first occurs days after they form, and the second several weeks later when as immature neurons they integrate into the brain. During this later wave, new neurons become active and survive if they connect with other nerve cells and die if they don’t. But little is known about what causes the earlier wave of cell death.</p><p>The tissues that contain the precursors of new neurons often have lower oxygen levels compared to other tissues. This means that when these cells start to become neurons and leave these sites, they have to face higher levels of oxygen and may undergo “oxidative” damage. This led Chatzi et al. to ask whether such oxidative damage might cause the early loss of new neurons in the hippocampus.</p><p>First, the part of the hippocampus that contains the precursor cells (called the subgranular zone or SGZ) was found to have patchy areas of low oxygen. Further experiments then revealed that chemicals that may cause oxidative damage were present in the nearby cells that had already started on the path to become new neurons.</p><p>Chatzi et al. then tested whether chemically stabilizing a protein called Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1α (or HIF1α for short), which naturally helps cells to adapt to low oxygen environments, might increase the survival of the cells in the SGZ. Higher levels of HIF1α did indeed increase the survival of these cells.</p><p>These findings suggest that newborn cells in the SGZ walk a tightrope between a low oxygen environment that supports the early precursors and the surrounding higher oxygen levels that can be toxic to those cells that start to become neurons. Further studies of the proteins and molecules that act downstream of HIF1α could shed light on ways to enhance the survival of these newly-generated neurons.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08722.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08722.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>adult neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>survival</kwd><kwd>hypoxia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS R01 080979</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Westbrook</surname><given-names>Gary L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000863</institution-id><institution>Ellison Medical Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Westbrook</surname><given-names>Gary L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS P30 061800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Westbrook</surname><given-names>Gary L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001961</institution-id><institution>AXA Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chatzi</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000738</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CDA-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schnell</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neural progenitors reside in relative low oxygen in the subgranular zone (SGZ), and the higher tissue oxygen levels that these cells must face as they migrate away from the hypoxic areas and differentiate appear to cause oxidative damage and an early phase of cell death.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the adult hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), one of the two neurogenic niches in the adult mammalian brain, new neurons are continuously generated throughout adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taupin and Gage, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van Praag et al., 2002</xref>). Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is a highly dynamic and regulated process that evolves slowly over several weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). Adult neural stem/ radial glia-like cells (Type I cells) reside at the interface between the SGZ and the hilus, and give rise to rapidly dividing intermediate progenitors (Type 2 cells). These cells migrate a short distance into the SGZ and progressively (via Type 2a and Type 2b intermediate progenitors) differentiate into neuroblasts (Type 3 cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuentealba et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonaguidi et al., 2012</xref>).

The survival of adult-generated granule cells exhibits two critical periods; an early one during the transition from transient amplifying progenitors to neuroblasts and a later one during the integration of the immature neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dayer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kempermann, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sierra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mandyam et al., 2007</xref>). The early phase is associated with phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sierra et al., 2010</xref>). GABA-mediated-depolarization and NMDA-receptor-mediated neuronal activity regulate the later phase of survival, at two and three weeks after mitosis respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jagasia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tashiro et al., 2006</xref>).

DMOG resulted in an increase of BrdU labeled nuclei in the SGZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Quantitative analysis of the BrdU+ cells showed a significant effect of DMOG on survival of newborn cells in the SGZ (2-way ANOVA, p = 0.0002, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). One day of DMOG treatment did not alter the number of BrdU+ cells, consistent with no effect on proliferation (p = 0.49, n = 6 animals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, DMOG significantly increased the survival of BrdU+ cells by 3 days post-mitosis (p &lt;0.0001, n = 12 animals). Interestingly, the relative increase in BrdU-labelled cells in DMOG persisted at later time points (7 dpi., p = 0.0017, n = 8 animals; 14 dpi., p = 0.003, n = 6; 21 dpi., p = 0.007, n = 6; 28 dpi., p = 0.01, n = 6), as assessed by the rate of BrdU+ cell loss between 3 and 28 dpi. (Comparison of fits, p = 0.5, F = 0.7). To delineate the effective time window for the action on adult newborn granule cell survival by 28 dpi., dividing cells were labeled with BrdU at day zero, then exposed to DMOG from 0–3, 0–7 or 7–14 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Exposure to DMOG for the first three day post-mitosis resulted in a 33% increase in survival (p = 0.023, n = 3), whereas exposure for 7 days did not yield a significant further increase (p = 0.23, n = 3). However, DMOG administration from day 7–14, a critical period during which the newborn cells begin to integrate into the hippocampal network, had no effect on their survival (p = 0.76, n = 3). The differentiation of BrdU+ cells into mature neurons (NeuN+) by 28 dpi. was not affected by exposure to DMOG for either the first 3 or 7 days post mitosis (BrdU+NeuN+/BrdU+: 0–3 days, Vehicle: 96 ± 4%, DMOG: 95 ± 2%, n = 3; 0–7 days, Vehicle: 98 ± 3%, DMOG: 96 ± 2%, n = 3, 2-way ANOVA p = 0.8).

Acute slices from wildtype animals were prepared 3 days after retroviral infection and GFP-expressing 3 day old cells were identified using fluorescence microscopy and recorded using whole-cell voltage clamp techniques.

Adult DG neurospheres were generated and cultured for 7 days at ambient oxygen tension (21% O<sub>2</sub>), in the presence of DMOG (100 μM) or in hypoxic conditions (2.5% O<sub>2</sub>). Neurospheres under all three conditions exhibited normal morphology, each containing committed progenitors that co-expressed nestin and doublecortin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Treatment with DMOG or reducing O<sub>2</sub> levels to 2.5% increased the number of neurospheres, a measure of cell survival (p = 0.01 and p = 0.002 respectively), but had no effect on the size of the neurospheres, a measure of cells’ proliferation (p = 0.98, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>).

In rat hippocampus the pO<sub>2</sub> has been estimated to be 20.3 mmHg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erecińska and Silver, 2001</xref>), whereas even more hypoxic regions have been detected in the SGZ of the adult mouse DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mazumdar et al., 2010</xref>). Using the hypoxia marker, pimonidazole hydrochloride, which labels cells with oxygen levels &lt;10 mm Hg (1.3%), we found that SGZ stem-cell like-radial glia and early intermediate progenitors lie within hypoxic zones. Interestingly, not all cells in the SGZ were labeled, but were localized to narrow zones of a few cell diameters wide along the hilar border of the SGZ. Only a fraction of GFAP+ or Tbr2+ cells were pimonidazole-positive whereas the hypoxic cell did not label with the proliferating marker Ki67 (data not shown).

The latter may predominate in the SGZ with its high ratio of nuclei to blood vessels compared to other brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mazumdar et al., 2010</xref>). Although some neural stem cells are perivascular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ottone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tavazoie et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Palmer et al., 2000</xref>), it remains to be determined whether these vessels carry highly oxygenated blood or how easily oxygen is distributed to the cell. Interestingly, a recent paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sun et al., 2015</xref>) revealed that within the SGZ zone only late amplifying progenitors (Tbr2+/DCX+) and horizontal early neuroblasts (Tbr2-/DCX+), among the entire population of SGZ progenitors are in direct contact with blood vessels.</p><p>Numerous adult stem cells reside in hypoxic niches, where they maintain a quiescent state depending predominantly on anaerobic glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">de Filippis and Delia, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mohyeldin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Platero-Luengo et al., 2014</xref>). Stem cells exhibit different metabolic properties than their differentiated progeny that may promote ‘stemness’. However, whether anaerobic metabolism is an adaptation to low oxygen levels in the specific niches in vivo or is an intrinsic stem cell property is still unclear. In either case, our results are consistent with two-photon phosphorescence direct in vivo measurements of local oxygen tension in the bone marrow, which revealed a hypoxic adult stem cell niche with high heterogeneity in local pO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Spencer et al., 2014</xref>).

Interestingly, we detected oxidative byproducts in intermediate progenitors and neuroblasts located adjacent to the hypoxic niches. This correlation suggests that migration of intermediate progenitors away from hypoxic zones leads to oxidative damage, and thus triggers an early phase of apoptosis. In vitro, hypoxic conditions (defined as &lt;5% O<sub>2</sub>) reduces apoptosis, promotes proliferation, and increases cultured embryonic, adult neural stem cells and neuronal progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sierra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shingo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Studer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Felling, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gustafsson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clarke and van der Kooy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bürgers et al., 2008</xref>).

Additionally, conditional ablation of HIF1-α in adult mouse brain resulted in hydrocephalus, decreased neurogenesis (partly due to an increase in apoptosis) and deficits in spatial memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tomita et al., 2003</xref>). In our experiments, DMOG, an agent that stabilizes HIF1-α under normoxic conditions, reversed the early phase of cell death of newborn cells in the adult dentate gyrus.

Rather, we propose that the metabolic milieu of the adult SGZ, a previously underexplored variable of this highly specialized neurogenic niche, plays a critical role in the early survival of adult generated hippocampal granule cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All procedures were performed according to the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were in compliance with approved IACUC protocols at Oregon Health &amp; Science University.

Pimonidazole hydrichloride in water was injected intraperitoneally at a dosage of 60 mg/kg. Animals were sacrificed at 1 hr and the brain removed following cardiac perfusion. Given that the half-life of pimonidazole is 22 min in mice, &gt;99% of free drug had been cleared by the time of sacrifice, thus the pimonidazole imaged in our experiments was already bound at time of perfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Walton et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Williams et al., 1982</xref>).</p><p>To examine survival of newborn cells in the adult hippocampus, mice were injected intraperitoneally with Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 300 mg/kg twice with a 4 hr interval between doses, and sacrificed at different time points. This pulse-chase protocol was chosen to saturate mitotic cell labeling within a single cell cycle as determined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cameron and Mckay, 2001</xref>).

Coronal sections (100μm thick) of the hippocampus were collected from each mouse and permeabilized in 0.4% Triton in PBS (PBST) for 30 min. Sections were then blocked for 30 min with 5% horse serum in PBST and incubated overnight (4°C) with primary antibody in 5% horse serum/PBST. Sections incubated with anti-BrdU were first incubated in 2N hydrochloric acid in potassium PBST for 30 min (37°C), washed twice and blocked with horse serum as described above. After extensive washing, sections were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa 488, 568 or 647 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), for 2 hr at room temperature. They were then washed in PBST (2 × 10 min) and mounted with Dapi Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL).</p><p>For quantification of immunopositive cells, six sections offering dorsal to ventral coverage of the dentate gyrus were stained from each animal. For the BrdU survival analysis, 6–12 animals were analyzed for each time point and condition, while for the rest of the immunofluorescence quantification 3–5 animals were analyzed per group. Slides were coded and imaged by an investigator blinded to experimental condition with a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope under a 10x 0.45NA, 20x or 40x 0.8NA lens. A 49 μm z-stack (consisting of 7 optical sections of 7μm thickness) was obtained from every slice. For evaluation of cells densities, positive cells within the dentate gyrus per z-stack were counted (Image J) and divided by the volume of the dentate gyrus. To determine the volume of the DG quantified the cross sectional area of the dentate gyrus (Image J) was multiplied by the section thickness.

Your full submission has been evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor and two peer reviewers, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers and Reviewing Editor. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that in its present form your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>You will note that one of the reviewers was quite enthusiastic about the manuscript and the other was much less so. Nonetheless, both of them raised some of the same or similar technical issues. These include the potential of hypoxic conditions introduced in the histological processing, the reduction of mRNA by a drug that supposedly inhibits at the protein level, and whether the data support &quot;oxygen tension.&quot; Clearly, resolving these technical considerations is of paramount importance, and it isn't immediately obvious that this can be done in a very short time frame. If you believe that you can satisfactorily address these and the other issues raised in the reviews, the potential significance of the work would make us willing to consider a new submission of this work, which might be handled by the same or different reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic>The authors aim to show that migration from a hypoxic area in the SGZ to outer layers of the GCL is accountable for the death of young hippocampal neuroblasts after cell division. Although the idea of oxygen tension gradient in neurogenesis regulation is interesting and supported by previous data, this paper is far from providing proofs for this mechanism and the quality of images is not satisfactory. Many of the conclusions are not supported by the data.</p><p>My detailed remarks are listed here:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: a major concern is about the proper tissue handling when using Hypoxyprobe. According to the Methods, animals were transcardially perfused with saline (subsection “Immunohistochemistry and Quantitation”). For how long were they perfused? It is of extreme importance because a brain not exposed to blood oxygen and not fixed yet with PFA will suffer from experimentally-induced hypoxia. It is crucial for the authors to show a similar Hypoxyprobe labeling pattern when the brains are immediately immersed in PFA.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>: the schematic should come at the end of the paper.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> top right: how does this image correlate with the other images in the top row? Supposed to be an enlargement? It is not clear whether this cell is GFAP+ or not.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>: where are the 8-oxo-DG cells in the two images on the right?</p><p>The authors claim that DCX+ cells are located in more external layers of the GCL and away from the SGZ but in the images presented it appears that they are localized to the same place as Tbr2+ cells.</p><p>Overall, It would also be interesting to show how many of the NSCs are positive for Hypoxyprobe and whether it correlates with their activation status.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>: the regulation of prolyl hydroxylase on the levels of Hif1-α is at the protein level (by inducing its rapid degradation). Therefore what is the rationale for measuring Hif1-α mRNA levels? It should not be changed if prolyl hydroxylase is inhibited. Instead, the protein level should be measured.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>: it is not clear from the image which cells are pAKT+VE.</p><p>The legends repeat the conclusion of more pAKT cells twice.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: the staining presented is not satisfactory. DCX is way too much overexposed and nestin staining probably represents non-specific blood vessel staining. It is not clear which cells are proliferating and no conclusion can be drawn.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>: are you sure these cells were labeled with BrdU (as indicated in y-axis)? If indeed please relate to the labeling protocol.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: how were cell numbers normalized? Why not presenting cell numbers as # of positive cells per area or volume unit?</p><p>It is not clear to me why the numbers of Ki67 cells were not changed but the numbers of Tbr2 increased. These markers label the same population. Also quantification for Tbr2 should be added.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> are not representative because there are more mCherry cells in the image but more GFP cells in the quantification. The images are not of good quality. There are many double-positive cells – how did you count them? Why are there so many red labeled cells in the hilus and outer GCL in <italic>Bax</italic> mutants treated with DMOG? It is not conclusive enough that the difference between <italic>Bax</italic> mutants treated with vehicle and <italic>Bax</italic> mutants treated with DMOG is due to increase in the fraction of mCherry cells. It rather can inhibit proliferation/survival of GFP cells.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>: why connect the groups with lines?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: I do not understand why these experiments were conducted. It was shown before (by Gage group and others) the exact timing of synapse formation. The authors did not conduct the same electrophysiology experiments on DMOG-treated animals.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>: I also do not understand why the number of neurosphere is an indication for cell survival. Does DMOG or hypoxia increase the survival of the cells in the dish that initiate the sphere? Perhaps a better experiment would be to use a DMOG-treated animal for sphere production rather than to apply it to the dish.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic>This is a great study by Drs. Chatzi et al. The paper will have an important impact in the field of adult neurogenesis. The study is also highly significant for the field of hypoxia in general, including e.g. tumor biology. The study is particularly relevant for understanding the cognitive consequences of obstructive sleep apnea. The specificity with which the different stages of neurogenesis are affected by HIF/hypoxia is impressive.</p><p>My great enthusiasm for this paper is somewhat dampened by several aspects that need to be addressed before considering this paper for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Most of these comments relate to the hypoxic condition, which was primarily deduced from the use of molecular markers. One example is the title, which states &quot;oxygen tensions within the SGZ[…]&quot; yet, oxygen tensions were not really measured, but are suggested by the use of a molecular marker. I don't doubt the study, but the statement &quot;Oxygen tensions&quot; somehow implies that those oxygen tensions were measured. It is for example conceivable that these cells are just functioning anaerobically, i.e. they are metabolically hypoxic, but the tension may be normal? Changing the title would solve this issue. But, it is a recurrent issue, and the authors have to double check their statements: In the second section of Results, the authors state e.g. &quot;Mimicking hypoxia&quot;. But, really what they (DMOG) do is stabilize Hif1-α. This, however, is only one aspect of hypoxia – hypoxia will also affect other regulators such as HIF2. Indeed, the balance between the regulation of oxidants and anti-oxidants is one of the aspects that would differentiate chronic versus intermittent hypoxia. Stabilizing HIF1a is not addressing this important aspect of hypoxia or the regulation of the Redox state, just to name one example. In short hypoxia will cause many additional biochemical changes throughout the cellular and local niche environments, which are not accounted for by Hif1-α stabilization. Again, this is easily fixed by changing the heading, and other statements that imply that the authors &quot;mimicked hypoxia&quot; – e.g. at the end of subsection “DMOG increases survival, but not proliferation or differentiation”.</p><p>In addition to this general comment, I have also a few specific comments.</p><p>1) Previous studies (e.g.,Hodge et al., 2008; Roybon et al., 2009) suggest that type 3 neurons can potentially be Tbr2+/DCX+. Therefore, it is recommended that the analysis be revised to pool type 2b with type 3 cells OR use Sox 11+/Prox1+ staining should the authors wish to resolve type 3 versus type 2.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: it is unclear as to how the KI67+ cell counts were normalized. The text describes KI67+ cells/field. This should be clarified since the area of SGZ will vary between sections.</p><p>3) Given the ubiquity of HIF and the systemic application of DMOG, it would be useful for the reader to know whether stabilizing Hif1-α had any effects on macroscopic structures/volumes of the DG.</p><p>4) The statement &quot;Double inmmunohistochemistry with an antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated Akt together with anti-DCX&quot; is unclear.</p><p>5) Was the electrophysiology conducted in untreated animals? Please clarify. I also suggest that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref> be placed in separate figures.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Localized hypoxia within the SGZ determines the early survival of newborn hippocampal granule cells&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

The rejection was based on “technical issues” that you mentioned in your letter. Specifically, the editors’ letter mentioned 3 technical issues:</p><p>1. “…The potential of hypoxic conditions introduced in the histological processing”. This is not a relevant concern based on the chemistry of the probe as we elaborate below. The methods of tissue fixation were entirely standard and in fact we had also done the less-ideal method proposed by the reviewer (immersion fixation of the entire brain) and the results were the same. We explain this further in the proposed point-by-point response to the reviewer as below.</p><p>2. “…The reduction of mRNA by a drug that supposedly inhibits at the protein level…”. The reviewer was not aware the Hif1a transcription can be autoregulated because of the presence of hypoxic response elements (HREs) in its promoter. Thus our analysis and interpretation are correct. In any case, this was a minor issue that is not critical to the overall thrust of the paper.</p><p>3. “…Whether the data support ‘oxygen tension’…” as what we measured. This point was raised by reviewer 2, and we agree that we have adjust the wording in the title, headers and text. However we used a hypoxic biosensor that we calibrated in vitro thus we think we are able to assess that regions of the subgranular zone have an oxygen tension less than 1.5%. It is true we did not use an oxygen electrode, but rather a readout of a chemical reaction.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>The authors aim to show that migration from a hypoxic area in the SGZ to outer layers of the GCL is accountable for the death of young hippocampal neuroblasts after cell division. Although the idea of oxygen tension gradient in neurogenesis regulation is interesting and supported by previous data [...].</italic></p><p>This comment makes it sound like our paper investigated a well-understood mechanism. We disagree. Mazudmar et al. (2010) showed that oxygen regulates neural stem cells through Wnt-β catenin signaling in vitroand that deletion of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 α subunit (HIF-1α) in vivodecreased adult hippocampal neurogenesis. However the mechanisms and the developmental stages at which oxygen gradients affect adult neurogenesis remain unknown. The point of our paper was to show in vivothat heterogeneous oxygen gradients influence the survival of an early stage of neurogenesis, well before the better-studied activity-dependent survival that occurs later. These papers were cited and the topic discussed in the Introduction of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>[…] this paper is far from providing proofs for this mechanism and the quality of images is not satisfactory. Many of the conclusions are not supported by the data.</italic> </p><p>We are able to easily address all specific comments as below.</p><p><italic>My detailed remarks are listed here: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: a major concern is about the proper tissue handling when using Hypoxyprobe. According to the Methods, animals were transcardially perfused with saline (subsection “Immunohistochemistry and Quantitation”). For how long were they perfused? It is of extreme importance because a brain not exposed to blood oxygen and not fixed yet with PFA will suffer from experimentally-induced hypoxia. It is crucial for the authors to show a similar Hypoxyprobe labeling pattern when the brains are immediately immersed in PFA.</italic> </p><p>In brief, this is not a significant concern. Hydroxyprobe (pimonidazole) was delivered as a single injection and the animal was sacrificed at 60 minutes. Given that the half-life of Hydroxyprobe is 22 minutes in mice, &gt;99% of free drug has been cleared by the time of sacrifice. Furthermore, pimonidazole becomes reductively activated and its active intermediate binds to thiol groups in nucleic acids and proteins in hypoxic cells. Thus bound drug is not in rapid equilibrium with free drug, i.e. the pimonidazole imaged in our experiments was already bound at time of perfusion.</p><p>In terms of perfusion, a saline rinse (4 ml, &lt;30 sec) is standard protocol to remove blood and thus increase access of PFA to the brain, and transcardial perfusion is regarded as the most effective way to achieve rapid and complete fixation within 1 minute. Thus the saline rinse should reduce the chance of generalized hypoxia. Finally, if there was any free pimonidazole and if there was generalized hypoxia, we should have seen generalized staining as well as signs of generalized hypoxia – we did not. In addition, rapid immersion of the brain in PFA produced similar results (data not shown). Details of the kinetics of Hydroxyprobe have been added to Methods and references added.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>: the schematic should come at the end of the paper.</italic> </p><p>The schematic was introduced as the framework for the experiments, not a cartoon of the conclusions. We think this was clear, however we have modified the figure legend and text to make this explicit.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> top right: how does this image correlate with the other images in the top row? Supposed to be an enlargement? It is not clear whether this cell is GFAP+ or not.</italic> </p><p>Yes, the rightmost panels were enlargements. For example, in the top row the rightmost panel shows a hypoxic cell labeled with pimonidazole (green) colocalized with the stem cell marker GFAP (yellow). The figure has been modified for clarity as has the figure legend. The point of this figure was clearly quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>: where are the 8-oxo-DG cells in the two images on the right? The authors claim that DCX+ cells are located in more external layers of the GCL and away from the SGZ but in the images presented it appears that they are localized to the same place as Tbr2+ cells.</italic> </p><p>We did not claim that DCX+ cells are located in “more external layers of the GCL,” as that is not how this tissue is organized. DCX expressing immature newborns neurons in theDG are localized in the SGZ zone and inner GCL layer as clearly depicted in our images. Newborns cells migrate in the more external layer of the GCL much later during their development ( &gt;2 weeks post-mitotic). We included the schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> specifically to avoid such misunderstandings. Thus, as stated in the original text and obvious from the image, the 8-oxo-DG cells are located within the SGZ in the same layer with Tb2+and Tbr2+/DCX+ cells.</p><p><italic>Overall, It would also be interesting to show how many of the NSCs are positive for Hypoxyprobe and whether it correlates with their activation status.</italic> </p><p>In our experiments, the vast majority of pimonidazole+ cells were neural stem cells (GFAP+), a cell type that can exist for long periods. Thus our labeling provides a single snapshot with a window of &lt;60 minutes (the duration of free pimonidazole in the tissue). It is not practical to count GFAP+ cells because the labeling even in confocal sections is dense, but as clearly shown in the images only a small fraction of GFAP+ cells were pimonidazole-positive. For the more short-lived intermediate progenitors (Tbr2+), 14.6 ± 1.1% of Tbr2+ cells (Type 2a cells, 100 Tbr2+ cells from 3 animals) were double labeled with pimonidazole. We did not see colabeling of pimonidzole with Ki67 (as was mentioned in the Discussion). We have further elaborated on this point in the Discussion.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>: the regulation of prolyl hydroxylase on the levels of Hif1-α is at the protein level (by inducing its rapid degradation). Therefore what is the rationale for measuring Hif1-α mRNA levels? It should not be changed if prolyl hydroxylase is inhibited. Instead, the protein level should be measured.</italic> </p><p>This is not correct. Several hypoxia response elements (HREs) have been identified in the <italic>HIF1A</italic> promoter and implicated in an autoregulatory loop whereby HIF itself upregulates HIF-1α transcription. Thus stabilization of Hif1-α by DMOG can in turn induce an increase in Hif1-α mRNA levels. A specific anti-Hif1-α antibody is also not commercially available. This point has been added to the Results and references added.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>: it is not clear from the image which cells are pAKT+VE. The legends repeat the conclusion of more pAKT cells twice.</italic> </p><p>Arrows in the original figure clearly identified the pAKT cells, but the figure has now been enlarged to make this point even clearer. The figure legend was not repetitive, it merely identified the raw data panel and the quantification in the histogram. However, we have now consolidated this wording.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: the staining presented is not satisfactory. DCX is way too much overexposed and nestin staining probably represents non-specific blood vessel staining. It is not clear which cells are proliferating and no conclusion can be drawn.</italic> </p><p>We completely disagree. Nestin clearly labeled the linear radial glia fibers as expected, and thus is definitely not non-specific. It is true that Nestin labeled blood vessels in the hilus, but their distinctive morphology (horizontal vs vertical in this image) made them clearly separable. Because we used a mouse antibody, we expect blood vessel staining but this has no impact on the quantification. To avoid confusion, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> has been modified to show only Ki67 immunolabeling at low power (panels A, B), and triple staining with Ki67/Nestin/DCX at higher magnification (panels C, D).</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>: are you sure these cells were labeled with BrdU (as indicated in y-axis)? If indeed please relate to the labeling protocol.</italic> </p><p>Yes. BrdU methodology was in the original Methods section. BrdU methods have been added to the figure legend and we have clarified the text in the subsection “DMOG increases survival, but not proliferation or differentiation”.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: how were cell numbers normalized? Why not presenting cell numbers as # of positive cells per area or volume unit?</italic> </p><p>Cell counts were normalized to the vehicle-treated controls. We have now converted these numbers and plotted the figure as positive cells per tissue volume (cells/mm<sup>3</sup>), which has no effect on the conclusions.</p><p><italic>It is not clear to me why the numbers of Ki67 cells were not changed but the numbers of Tbr2 increased. These markers label the same population. Also quantification for Tbr2 should be added.</italic> </p><p>We did not detect (or claim) a significant effect on the total density of the Tbr2+ cells; thus there is no discrepancy. We have added the data on Tbr2 (Vehicle: 5776 ± 681 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, DMOG: 7331 ± 1381 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, p=0.07, n= 5 animals) in the subsection “DMOG increases survival, but not proliferation or differentiation”.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> are not representative because there are more mCherry cells in the image but more GFP cells in the quantification. The images are not of good quality. There are many double-positive cells – how did you count them? Why are there so many red labeled cells in the hilus and outer GCL in</italic> Bax <italic>mutants treated with DMOG?</italic> </p><p>The images were representative, but the reviewer has interpreted the relatively high background of the red channel in low magnifications as mCherry+ cells. There are no mCherry+ cells in the hilus and outer GCL. This is not a question of the quality of the image but due to the fact that the animals were analyzed one week post stereotaxic injections as necessary for the experiment, and mCherry in vivomatures much slower than GFP. Thus the signal/noise ratio is not as good in the red channel than in the green channel at low mag. We used high magnification images for quantification where mCherry+ cells are easily resolved as was apparent in the high mag images in the original figure. All cells including double labeled cells were counted. We have worked to improve the image quality at low magnification given the technical constraints as discussed here.</p><p><italic>It is not conclusive enough that the difference between</italic> Bax <italic>mutants treated with vehicle and</italic> Bax <italic>mutants treated with DMOG is due to increase in the fraction of mCherry cells. It rather can inhibit proliferation/survival of GFP cells.</italic> </p><p>The two retrovirus strategy was used simply to allow quantification and thus these are the same population of newborn neurons. If, as the reviewer implies, DMOG inhibited proliferation or survival, GFP+ and mCherry+ cells would be equally affected and the ratio of GFP/mCherry cells unchanged. Thus we do not see this as a logical explanation of the data. We have amplified this point in the subsection “DMOG increases survival, but not proliferation or differentiation”.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>: why connect the groups with lines?</italic> </p><p>The panel has been replotted as a histogram.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6: I</xref> do not understand why these experiments were conducted. It was shown before (by Gage group and others) the exact timing of synapse formation. The authors did not conduct the same electrophysiology experiments on DMOG-treated animals.</italic> </p><p>There is conflicting evidence in the literature concerning the timing of first synaptic activity and its influence on cell survival. Given that even small amounts of neural activity can have an impact, we think high quality data in this regard is critical and it is key to our conclusion that this early period of cell survival is independent of neural activity. It could be a supplemental figure, but given <italic>eLife’s</italic> format we think it is better included as a regular figure. We see no rationale for repeating the electrophysiology in DMOG-treated animals, given that DMOG did not affect the surrogate activity markers pCREB or c-Fos.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7: I</xref> also do not understand why the number of neurosphere is an indication for cell survival. Does DMOG or hypoxia increase the survival of the cells in the dish that initiate the sphere?</italic> </p><p>The number of neurospheres is a standard measure in the stem cell field to assess survival. Because the seeding density of dissociated cells for neurosphere formation was the same for all conditions, the total number of neurospheres reflects the survival of the progenitors.</p><p><italic>Perhaps a better experiment would be to use a DMOG-treated animal for sphere production rather than to apply it to the dish.</italic> </p><p>We don’t see this as an interpretable experiment. The reason for using neurospheres is that we can control the oxygen levels and the concentration of DMOG. The in vivotissue oxygen concentration is much lower than the oxygen concentration used for routine cell cultures (room air, 21%). The ability to compare the effects of real hypoxic conditions with DMOG treatment on progenitors in vitroprovides a valuable calibration tool with clean readouts.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p> <italic>My great enthusiasm for this paper is somewhat dampened by several aspects that need to be addressed before considering this paper for publication in</italic> eLife<italic>. Most of these comments relate to the hypoxic condition, which was primarily deduced from the use of molecular markers. One example is the title, which states &quot;oxygen tensions within the SGZ[…]&quot; yet, oxygen tensions were not really measured, but are suggested by the use of a molecular marker. I don't doubt the study, but the statement &quot;Oxygen tensions&quot; somehow implies that those oxygen tensions were measured. It is for example conceivable that these cells are just functioning anaerobically, i.e. they are metabolically hypoxic, but the tension may be normal? Changing the title would solve this issue. But, it is a recurrent issue, and the authors have to double check their statements: In the second section of Results, the authors state e.g. &quot;Mimicking hypoxia&quot;. But, really what they (DMOG) do is stabilize Hif1-α. This, however, is only one aspect of hypoxia – hypoxia will also affect other regulators such as HIF2. Indeed, the balance between the regulation of oxidants and anti-oxidants is one of the aspects that would differentiate chronic versus intermittent hypoxia. Stabilizing HIF1a is not addressing this important aspect of hypoxia or the regulation of the Redox state, just to name one example. In short hypoxia will cause many additional biochemical changes throughout the cellular and local niche environments, which are not accounted for by Hif1-α stabilization. Again, this is easily fixed by changing the heading, and other statements that imply that the authors &quot;mimicked hypoxia&quot; – e.g. at the end of subsection “DMOG increases survival, but not proliferation or differentiation”</italic>.</p><p>We have changed the title, wordings and section headers to address this issue. We agree with the reviewer that this does not change the conclusions of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>In addition to this general comment, I have also a few specific comments. 1) Previous studies (e.g., Hodge et al., 2008; Roybon et al., 2009) suggest that type 3 neurons can potentially be Tbr2+/DCX+. Therefore, it is recommended that the analysis be revised to pool type 2b with type 3 cells OR use Sox 11+/Prox1+ staining should the authors wish to resolve type 3 versus type 2.</italic> </p><p>We agree that our staining paradigm cannot differentiate between Type 2b and Type 3 cells. We have revised the analysis and data have been plotted as percentages of Tbr2+/DCX-, Tbr2+/DCX+ and Tbr2-/DCX+ cells and the text reworded in the subsection “DMOG increases survival, but not proliferation or differentiation”.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: it is unclear as to how the KI67+ cell counts were normalized. The text describes KI67+ cells/field. This should be clarified since the area of SGZ will vary between sections.</italic> </p><p>Ki67 cells counts are now expressed as fold increases of Ki67cells/mm<sup>3</sup> in DMOG vs. vehicle-treated animals. For normalization the density of Ki67+ cells in individual DMOG treated animals was normalized to the mean cell density of the animals in the control group (see Methods).</p><p><italic>3) Given the ubiquity of HIF and the systemic application of DMOG, it would be useful for the reader to know whether stabilizing Hif1-α had any effects on macroscopic structures/volumes of the DG.</italic> </p><p>Administration of DMOG had no effect on the DG volume (Control: 0.61mm<sup>3</sup> ± 0.02, n=3 animals, DMOG: 0.59 ± 0.04, n=animals, p=0.89). This point has been added to the text in the subsection “DMOG increases survival, but not proliferation or differentiation”.</p><p><italic>4) The statement &quot;Double inmmunohistochemistry with an antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated Akt together with anti-DCX&quot; is unclear.</italic> </p><p>The statement has now been better explained in the subsection “Stabilizing Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1α” as follows: “Double immunohistochemistry with an antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated Akt together with an antibody against the neuroblast/immature neuron marker doublecortin (DCX)[…]”</p><p><italic>5) Was the electrophysiology conducted in untreated animals? Please clarify. I also suggest that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref> be placed in separate figures.</italic> </p><p>Yes, the electrophysiology was done in control animals as the question was whether there is any synaptic activity at this stage. We prefer to keep the activity-related panels together in one figure, but we have clarified that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> refers to the lack of electrical activity in 3-day-old cells in control animals and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref> address the effect of DMOG on overall activity, which addresses whether non-cell autonomous neural activity could explain the effect of DMOG.

Nestin and Tbr2 antibodies were raised in the same animal and thus could not be used together, but Tbr2/DCX/BrdU address the same issue. These additional experiments do not alter any of the conclusions.

We also think the reviewer overstates the prior evidence, which was at 4 days post-mitosis in which they state that “14%” of their cells had some activity at high stimulation intensity, but the example shown in that paper does not fit with the expected kinetics of a GABAergic response. Thus we don't know how to interpret that data.</p><p>In any case, we did not find any evidence for synaptic innervation of immature adult-born granule cells at 3 days post-mitosis, based on assays of spontaneous events and the lack of response to high intensity 8 Hz stimulation synaptic responses. Reviewer 3 suggests that stimulation within the middle molecular layer (MML) could have missed possible synaptic connections arising from hilar cells (interneurons or mossy cells). However, hilar basket cells and hilar mossy cells are driven by excitatory feed-forward inputs from the perforant path (which we stimulated directly) as well as inputs from dentate granule cell mossy fiber axons (see Ribak, CE and Shapiro, LA (2007) Ultrastucture and connectivity of cell types in the adult dentate gyrus. in Scharfman, H.E (ed) The Dentate Gyrus, 157-160). To prove explicitly that our stimulation activates hilar cells, we stimulated the MML using the same stimulating electrode position, intensity, and train duration/frequency as shown in the manuscript and assayed hilar neurons with cell-attached and current-clamp recordings (n=4 cells). In every cell, we elicited depolarization, and in 3 of 4 cells, the cells showed repetitive spiking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2</xref>). Thus hilar cells were activated in the protocol shown in the manuscript, yet no neural activity in the 3 day-old cells was observed. We think this evidence is unequivocal that the cells at 3 d.p.i show no neural activity, thus justifying the conclusions in our manuscript.

The reviewer wanted us to also show similar data for hilar neurons. Thus we performed double immunohistochemistry with c-Fosand the GABAergic marker glutamic acid decarboxylase-67 (Gad-67). This paradigm allowed us to differentiate between activated hilar mossy cells (Fos+ only) and active hilar interneurons (Fos+/GAD67+).
