the nature of underlying spinal circuits remains elusive. Here we investigate how mechanosensory feedback shapes active locomotion in a genetic model organism exhibiting simple locomotion—the zebrafish larva. We show that mechanosensory feedback enhances the recruitment of motor pools during active locomotion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inputs from mechanosensory neurons increase locomotor speed by prolonging fast swimming at the expense of slow swimming during stereotyped acoustic escape responses. This effect could be mediated by distinct mechanosensory neurons. In the spinal cord, we show that connections compatible with monosynaptic inputs from mechanosensory Rohon-Beard neurons onto ipsilateral V2a interneurons selectively recruited at high speed can contribute to the observed enhancement of speed. Altogether, our study reveals the basic principles and a circuit diagram enabling speed modulation by mechanosensory feedback in the vertebrate spinal cord.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25260.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25260.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>sensory feedback</kwd><kwd>locomotion</kwd><kwd>mechanoception</kwd><kwd>spinal cord</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>genetic targeting</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>311673</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wyart</surname><given-names>Claire</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5U01NS090501</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wyart</surname><given-names>Claire</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Bioluminescence monitoring and selective silencing in zebrafish larva reveal a novel sensorimotor circuit modulating speed in the moving spinal cord.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The generation of complex motor behaviors at a given speed relies on the sequential selection and orderly activation of groups of muscles by the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bellardita and Kiehn, 2015</xref>). At the level of locomotor circuits in the spinal cord, premotor excitatory V2a interneurons and motor neurons are recruited in a frequency-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crone et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kimura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McLean et al., 2007</xref>), a feature thought to underlie speed control in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McLean et al., 2008</xref>). Recently, circuit-mapping experiments revealed preferential connectivity profiles between identified groups of V2a interneurons and motor neurons suggesting that distinct microcircuit modules could regulate the mobilization of individual muscles during locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ampatzis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bagnall and McLean, 2014</xref>). Genetic ablation of V2a interneurons in mammals is associated with deficits in left-right coordination and gait transitions suggesting that V2a interneurons play a key role in controlling speed across vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crone et al., 2008</xref>). The nature of spinal circuits involved in motor pattern generation and speed control has mainly been studied during fictive locomotion when sensory feedback is absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kiehn, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McLean and Dougherty, 2015</xref>). However, less is known about the cellular and circuit mechanisms regulating the timing of microcircuit selection in the spinal cord during movement, which incorporate proprioceptive feedback from muscle contraction.</p><p>Peripheral mechanosensory feedback plays a critical role in setting the timing of muscle activation during movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Windhorst, 2007</xref>). In particular, stimulation of afferent sensory neurons in decerebrate and paralyzed cats can reorganize the pattern of motor output during fictive locomotion, either by entraining or resetting the locomotor rhythm, depending on the nature of active spinal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conway et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guertin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jankowska, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McCrea, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rossignol et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, altering the development of peripheral sensory neurons leads to dramatic perturbations of motor sequences during walking and swimming in mice, suggesting that mechanosensory circuits can directly control the activity of spinal central pattern generators responsible for rhythmic motor outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Takeoka et al., 2014</xref>). However, the molecular identity of spinal neurons mediating these effects in mammals remains elusive.</p><p>To understand the contribution of mechanosensory feedback to speed control, we investigated the role of spinal mechanosensory neurons during acoustic escape responses in the zebrafish larva, a genetic model system with tractable locomotor behaviors that can be analyzed using fine kinematic analysis. We developed a bioluminescence-based assay to monitor the activity of populations of spinal motor neurons in moving animals and combined this approach with calcium imaging and quantitative kinematic analysis of locomotor behaviors to compare the dynamics of motor activity in active and fictive swimming. We demonstrate that glutamatergic mechanosensory neurons enhance the recruitment of spinal motor neurons during motion by increasing locomotor frequency, and consequently, the speed of locomotion. In particular, we show that mechanosensory feedback selectively enhances the fast regime over the slow regime during escape responses, thereby promoting the transition between fast and slow locomotion. Using optogenetics for circuit connectivity mapping, we identified a functional microcircuit module formed by mechanosensory Rohon-Beard neurons onto ipsilateral glutamatergic V2a interneurons selectively active during fast locomotion. Altogether our results reveal how spinal microcircuits controlling locomotor frequency can be selected by mechanosensory pathways to enhance speed during active locomotion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Monitoring the recruitment of spinal motor neurons in moving animals</title><p>In order to investigate the contribution of sensorimotor circuits during locomotor activity in zebrafish larvae, we used the bioluminescent calcium sensor GFP-Aequorin to monitor calcium activity emitted by identified neuronal populations in freely moving animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baubet et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Naumann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shimomura et al., 1962</xref>). To maximize expression of GFP-Aequorin in zebrafish motor circuits, we codon-optimized the Aequorin sequence and targeted its expression to spinal motor neurons. We recorded bioluminescence signals emitted from spinal motor neurons during active behaviors elicited by an acoustic stimulus in <italic>Tg(mnx1:gal4;UAS:GFP-aequorin-opt)</italic> zebrafish larvae at four days post-fertilization (dpf) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, see Materials and methods). To remove the concern of collecting unspecific signals following large changes in intracellular calcium concentration in muscle fibers during tail contractions, we systematically determined both in live animals and after GFP immunostainings that there was no expression in non-neuronal tissues such as muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, n = 5 larvae, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Acoustic stimulations triggered stereotypical escape responses characterized by an asymmetrical initial C-bend followed by fast swimming. In rare cases, possibly due to coelenterazine application, acoustic stimulations led to stereotypical slow swims characterized by symmetrical bends with undulations propagating from rostral to caudal along the tail (7.4% of trials, 21 out of 283 stimulations; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mirat et al. [2013]</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Videos 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">3</xref>, n = 10 larvae, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Budick and O'Malley, 2000</xref>). Each locomotor behavior was associated with a specific bioluminescence signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Videos 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">3</xref>). While time-to-peak and time decay of bioluminescence signals were invariant across maneuvers (data <italic>not shown</italic>), stereotypical escape responses generated larger bioluminescence amplitudes than slow swims (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>, mean bioluminescence amplitude = 30.8 + /- 1.4 photons/10 ms for escapes and 4.1 ± 1.6 photons/10 ms for slow swimming, p&lt;0.001). Bioluminescence signal amplitude correlated with the maximal angle of the tail bend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, R = 0.4, p&lt;0.001), suggesting that spinal motor neuron recruitment is increased during behaviors with larger tail bends and faster locomotor frequencies. However, monitoring global bioluminescence signals lacks the single cell resolution required to explain whether these increased bioluminescence signals result from the recruitment of additional motor neurons during fast locomotion or from increased signals in the same pool of active cells. To decipher between these possibilities we recorded the activity of pools of motor neurons using the genetically-encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f during spontaneous fictive slow swimming and elicited fictive escape responses in <italic>Tg(mnx1:gal4;UAS:GCaMP6f,cryaa:mCherry)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Böhm et al., 2016</xref>). This strategy allowed us to monitor dynamics of both individual neurons and populations of neurons during locomotor behaviors previously probed using bioluminescence. At 4 dpf, fictive locomotor burst frequencies ranged between 20–30 Hz for slow swims (left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Masino and Fetcho [2005]</xref>) and 20–80 Hz for escapes (right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). During slow swimming, a small fraction of ventral motor neurons was active (23.2%, left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). In contrast, the majority of motor neurons, including large dorsal motor neurons, was recruited during escapes (88.4%, right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>). Dorsalmost motor neurons showed larger calcium transients than ventral ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), and the averaged ΔF/F across all recruited motor neurons was higher during escapes compared to slow swims (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, mean ΔF/F/active cell = 91.1 + /- 4.7% during escape responses and 25.9 ± 3.8% during slow swimming, p&lt;0.001, n = 10 larvae). These data revealed that the generation of fast escape responses requires the recruitment of more spinal motor neurons compared to slow swimming and that the amplitude of calcium signals are higher in cells active during escapes compared to spontaneous swimming. Therefore, we conclude that high bioluminescence signal amplitude during escape responses compared to slow swims likely results from the combination of two effects: a larger pool of active cells driven by an increase in swimming frequency and larger calcium transients per active neuron.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25260.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Amplitude of bioluminescence signals in spinal motor neurons correlates with the type of locomotor maneuver during active swimming.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bioluminescence signals emitted from spinal motor neurons in <italic>Tg(mnx1:gal4;UAS:GFP-aequorin-opt)</italic> zebrafish larvae at 4 dpf were recorded using a photomultiplier tube under infrared illumination during active behaviors elicited by an acoustic stimulus.

To circumvent this potential issue we expressed the novel opsin CoChR-tdTomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>) in Rohon Beard cells and tested their responses to blue light stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We found that 1 to 5 ms blue light pulses were sufficient to elicit photocurrents driving single action potentials in Rohon-Beard neurons at 4 and 5 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and G</xref>, mean time to peak from the onset of the light pulse = 2.80 + /- 0.29 ms, n = 6 cells).

We found that RB stimulation led to short latency excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) in target V2a interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–E and G</xref>, mean delay from the onset of light pulse = 3.71 + /- 0.19 ms, n = 8 cells in 8 larvae). To assess whether RB-V2A ipsilateral connection might be monosynaptic, we analyzed the lag between RB spikes time-to-peak and V2a EPSCs onset and found that it was below 1 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>, 0.9 ms), a value compatible with monosynaptic connection (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al. [2007a]</xref>) where cutoff is set at 3 ms for monosynaptic connections). Assuming a synaptic delay of 0.5 ms, the estimated conduction velocity along the axon of RB neuron would be 0.75 m/s, a value compatible with previous measurement in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">2004a</xref>). EPSC amplitude induced by RB stimulation in V2a interneurons were on average 28.14 ± 3.9 pA, leading to estimated depolarization of 11.71 ± 2.59 mV on target V2a (n = 8). In some cases, RB inputs were therefore sufficient to elicit action potentials in V2a interneurons tested in current clamp mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Given the glutamatergic nature of RB neurons, we incubated the preparation with blockers of glutamatergic neurotransmission and found that it abolished EPSCs in target V2a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>, n = 2 cells). Altogether, these results indicate a monosynaptic connection between RB neurons and ipsilateral dorsalmost V2a interneurons and demonstrate the ability of RB neurons to recruit selectively a subpopulation of V2a interneurons controlling fast swimming in the dorsal spinal cord. This direct pathway from RB neurons onto ipsilateral ‘fast’ V2a neurons may act in concert with afferences from dorsal root ganglia and trigeminal neurons to enhance speed during active locomotion.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25260.015</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Rohon-Beard neurons selectively synapse onto ipsilateral dorsalmost V2a interneurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the optogenetic calibration of CoChR-mediated stimulation in RB neurons.

Although the state-dependent nature of spinal modulation by afferent muscle fibers has been appreciated for more than a century in limbed vertebrates, little is currently known on the role of mechanosensory feedback during ongoing locomotion. The reasons for this lie in the difficulty of recording and manipulating neural circuits in moving animals and in the fact that mechanosensory feedback is absent in fictive preparations. In this study, we took advantage of the genetic and optical accessibility of the zebrafish larva to unravel mechanisms of circuit and behavior modulation by mechanosensory feedback using a combination of optical methods for circuit interrogation during animal motion with electrophysiology and high-throughput kinematic analysis of locomotor behaviors. Our results demonstrate that mechanosensory feedback enhances swimming speed by providing excitation to spinal circuits controlling the frequency of motor output during fast locomotion, thereby controlling the timing of spinal microcircuit activation and the transition between fast and slow locomotion. As it allows zebrafish larvae to travel the same distance in a shorter time (about 15 ms), mechanosensory feedback also bears ecological implications for fitness. By speeding up escapes during a predator attack, mechanosensory feedback may help enhancing survival.</p><p>To probe the contribution of mechanosensory feedback during active locomotion in zebrafish, we used the bioluminescent GFP-Aequorin sensor in motor neurons. We found that the amplitude of Aequorin signals from motor neurons could be used as a signature for distinguishing locomotor maneuvers including slow swimming and fast escape responses that have specific ranges of swimming frequencies and distinct profiles of motor neurons recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liao and Fetcho, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Masino and Fetcho, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McLean et al., 2008</xref>). We found that eliminating mechanical sensory feedback originating from muscle contraction led to a decrease of bioluminescence signals from motor neurons during acoustic escape responses. Our observations suggest that mechanosensory feedback enhances the recruitment of motor circuits. However, the effect observed could be driven by a decrease in swimming frequency and /or a decrease in the number of active spinal motor neurons. The poor temporal resolution of GFP-Aequorin prevented us from resolving these possibilities.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Speed modulation by mechanosensory feedback</title><p>To determine how the deprivation of mechanosensory feedback affects motor neuron recruitment, we analyzed kinematic parameters of animals deprived of excitatory synaptic transmission in glutamatergic mechanosensory neurons using the genetically encoded Botulinum toxin. The perturbation of major kinematic parameters such as left/right coordination or locomotor frequency during fictive locomotion usually requires the ablation of entire classes of spinal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crone et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gosgnach et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Talpalar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). To identify the consequence of the selective silencing of mechanosensory feedback in the zebrafish spinal cord, we implemented a high-throughput kinematic analysis of acoustic escape responses in larvae deprived of neurotransmission in <italic>isl2b<sup>+</sup></italic> mechanosensory neurons versus their control siblings. Our analysis revealed that mechanosensory feedback increases the swimming frequency and corresponding locomotor speed without affecting the total number of oscillations during an escape. Inputs from mechanosensory neurons first contribute to reaching the maximum range of fast swimming frequencies and second set the transition time from fast to slow swimming frequencies. Without mechanosensory inputs, the initial swimming frequency is reduced and the transition from fast to slow swimming occurs earlier, which leads to an increase of locomotor event duration for the same number of oscillations and distance travelled, and therefore an overall slower escape response.</p><p>Contrary to mammals, there are no muscle spindles relaying mechanical information on muscle contraction to spinal circuits in fish. Instead, glutamatergic stretch receptor neurons that can sense body elongation in lamprey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grillner et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rovainen, 1974</xref>) project onto spinal sensory neurons, motor neurons and interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Di Prisco et al., 1990</xref>) and can entrain the locomotor central pattern generators (CPGs, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grillner et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McClellan and Sigvardt, 1988</xref>]).

Interestingly, the activation of each of these pathways, either during natural mechanical oscillations of the tail or optogenetic stimulations, is sufficient to trigger locomotor activity demonstrating that mechanosensory feedback can provide inputs to locomotor central pattern generator circuits in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Böhm et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fidelin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McClellan and Grillner, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wyart et al., 2009</xref>).

During swimming, excitation of commissural sensory interneurons from sensory neurons was shown to be filtered out by phase-locked inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Knogler and Drapeau, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sillar and Roberts, 1988</xref>), ensuring that the recruitment of RB neurons potentially arising from movement-related activation would not trigger the disynaptic cutaneous reflex.</p><p>Here we discovered a novel sensory disynaptic pathway originating from spinal sensory neurons. We demonstrate that mechanosensory Rohon-Beard neurons synapse onto dorsalmost V2a interneurons previously shown to drive fast swimming in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ampatzis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McLean et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">2007</xref>). Furthermore, we show that in some cases, this monosynaptic connection can provide suprathreshold inputs to V2a interneurons recruited during fast locomotion. Given that the <italic>isl2b</italic> transgenic line used in this study also labels dorsal root ganglia and trigeminal neurons, it is possible that the modulation of speed results from synergistic inputs from these three neuronal populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buhl et al., 2012</xref>). Dorsal root ganglia might in particular provide glutamatergic sensory inputs that could modulate locomotor frequency as well. Yet, we identified here a direct RB-V2a pathway that could contribute to the enhancement of speed triggered by mechanosensory feedback during the escape. The contribution of RB neurons to the enhancement of speed by mechanosensory feedback is consistent with previous experiments showing that stimulation of RB neurons can reset or increase locomotor frequency in <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadoples (for example,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sillar and Roberts, 1992</xref>]). The role of mechanosensory feedback to increase swimming speed is consistent with former observations in lamprey showing an entrainment of locomotion by mechanical stimulation of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grillner et al., 1981</xref>). Therefore, the direct connection we demonstrated here from spinal mechanosensory neurons onto a subtype of ipsilateral V2a interneurons recruited during fast swimming could underlie the effect we observed on swimming speed, along with other potential pathways involving dorsal root ganglia and trigeminal neurons.</p><p>RB neurons have complex processes branching under the skin as well as ascending and descending in the spinal cord. One critical experiment in the future will consist of recording the activity of RB neurons during muscle contraction in freely swimming animals. Recording reliable calcium transients associated with mechanical stimulation has been possible by combining fluorescent calcium sensors in one wavelength with another fluorescent protein enabling to control for cell position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Böhm et al., 2016</xref>). Nonetheless measuring activation of RB neurons during mechanical stimulation remains challenging due to the fact that RB neurons usually fire single action potentials ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roberts et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Winlove and Roberts, 2012</xref>) and most calcium indicator fail to report single spike without extensive averaging (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al. [2013]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tian et al. [2009]</xref>). Further studies will identify the connectivity diagrams of each of these mechanosensory cell types and devise genetic strategies to silence these neurons individually to probe their contribution to speed modulation during active locomotion. While local reflex pathways have been characterized at rest, further studies will decipher the mechanisms underlying the diversity of behavioral effects due to mechanosensory neuron recruitment: escapes for single touch at rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buchanan and Cohen, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Douglass et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roberts et al., 1983</xref>), struggling for continuous stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2007b</xref>) and enhancement of speed during active locomotion (this study).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Altogether, our results about the role of mechanosensory feedback in speed modulation can explain the general observation made in various invertebrate as well as vertebrate species that locomotion is faster in active compared to fictive conditions. In invertebrates, there is evidence in several species for fictive locomotor patterns being typically twice slower than real locomotion (sea slugs, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Morton and Chiel, 1993</xref>), 1993; crayfish, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bacqué-Cazenave et al., 2015</xref>); and fruit fly, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mendes et al., 2013</xref>). The leech is a particularly interesting example as it can perform both swimming and crawling. The effect of denervation is a systematic slowdown of locomotor activity, although it is much larger in crawling (twofolds) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baader and Kristan, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eisenhart et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kristan and Calabrese, 1976</xref>). In lamprey where the same animal was used to compare active and fictive locomotion, the frequency of fictive swimming appears 5–10 times slower than the frequency of active swimming recorded through electromyography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wallén and Williams, 1984</xref>). The general slowdown of locomotor frequencies when peripheral sensory feedback is removed is commonly observed in fictive locomotion in mice as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bellardita and Kiehn, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Talpalar et al., 2013</xref>).

Furthermore, our work demonstrates that microcircuit selection during locomotor behaviors is not only set by descending commands from supra-spinal centers but could rather result from a combination of inputs from descending and local spinal sensorimotor circuits recruited while the movement is performed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish care, generation and characterization of transgenic lines</title><p>All procedures were approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee at the Institut du Cerveau et de la Moelle épinière (ICM), Paris, France, the Ethical Committee Charles Darwin and received subsequent approval from the EEC (2010/63/EU).

Infrared light illumination for monitoring larval behavior was provided by an 850 nm LED (Effisharp, Effilux, France) mounted with 2 long-pass 780 and 810 filters (Asahi ZIL0780 and Asahi XIL0810, respectively) and a diffuser (DG10-120B, Thorlabs, Newton, NJ, USA). Video acquisition was performed at 1000 Hz using a high-speed infrared sensitive camera (Eosens MC1362, Mikrotron, Unterschleissheim, Germany; objective Nikkor 50 mm f/1.8D, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) at 320 × 320 pixels resolution controlled by the software Hiris (RD Vision, Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, France). Photons were counted with a photomultiplier tube (PMT, H7360-02, Hamamatsu, Japan) located under the larva arena and sent to an acquisition card (NI PCI 6602, National Instruments, Cos Cob, CT, USA). A band-pass filter (525 nm / 50 nm, ref. 489038–8002, Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA) and a short-pass filter (670 nm, XVS0670, Asahi, Japan) were placed between the larva and the PMT. A custom application-programming interface developed in collaboration with R&amp;D Vision synchronized the video acquisition with the photon count and the stimulus delivery using 30 trials batched TTL chronogram (EG Chrono, RD Vision, France).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Kinematics and bioluminescence analysis</title><p>The base and tip of the tail were manually determined for each larva and the tail was subsequently automatically tracked with a custom Matlab algorithm (R2012b, Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). The tail angle was computed for each frame and filtered using median filtering (window size = 10). The start of the movement was determined as the first frame followed by 3 with a differential tail angle value above 0.08. The end was determined as the end of the 20 frames with a differential tail angle value below 0.1 degree. Local minimal and maximal values of the tail angle occurred at least 2 ms apart and 1 degree above the 5 ms preceding value. Automated movement categorization was determined as follows: ‘escapes’ for all movements starting with an asymmetrical C-bend and number of cycles ≥ 1; ‘slow swims’ for all movements with symmetrical bends of amplitude &lt;25° and number of cycles &gt; 1.</p><p>Photons were counted with a temporal resolution of 1 ms and then binned every 10 ms. The signal was filtered using a running average with a window size of 10, giving a typical signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for active movements of 50 to 1. Noise was extrapolated from a linear fit of the cumulative photon count before the stimulus and subtracted from the signal. The start and end of the bioluminescent signal were computed as the first time point followed by three points with a differential value above 0.4 photons/10 ms and below 0.2 photons/10 ms, respectively. The time-to-peak was calculated between the start and the peak of the bioluminescent signal while the decay coefficient was derived from the one-term exponential fit between the peak and the end of the signal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Calcium imaging of spinal motor neurons and ventral nerve root recordings (VNR)</title><p>4 dpf <italic>Tg(mnx1:gal4; UAS:GCaMP6f,cryaa:mCherry)</italic> double transgenic larvae were screened for dense labeling and good expression of GCaMP6f in spinal motor neurons under a dissecting microscope equipped with an epifluorescence lamp (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Larvae were anaesthetized in 0.02% Tricaine-Methiodide (MS-222, Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in fish facility water and mounted on their lateral side in 1.5% low-melting point agarose in glass-bottom dishes filled with external solution ([NaCl] = 134 mM, [KCl] = 2.9 mM, [MgCl2] = 1.2 mM, [HEPES] = 10 mM, [glucose] = 10 mM and [CaCl2] = 2.1 mM; adjusted to pH 7.7–7.8 with NaOH and osmolarity 290 mOsm). Larvae were immobilized by injecting 0.1–0.3 nL of 0.5 mM α-Bungarotoxin (Tocris, Bristol, UK) in the ventral axial musculature. A portion of agar was removed using a razor blade in order to expose 2 to 3 segments. To achieve a strong signal-to-noise ratio during fictive locomotion recordings, the skin overlying these segments was removed using suction glass pipettes. Zebrafish larvae were imaged using a custom spinning disk microscope (Intelligent Imaging Innovation, Denver, CO, USA) equipped with a set of water-immersion objectives (Zeiss 20X, 40X, NA = 1). Recordings were acquired using Slidebook software at 20 Hz using a 488 nm laser. Gain and binning were optimized to maximize signal to noise ratio. Z-projection stacks showed full pattern of expression using Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Positions of cells along the D-V axis were computed using Fiji and Matlab (Mathworks, USA). Calcium signals were extracted online using custom scripts. Regions of interest (ROIs) were manually designed and calcium signals time series were extracted as the mean fluorescence from individual ROIs at each time point of the recording. We observed that out-of-focus signals varied between animals, from dorsal to ventral spinal cord regions in a behavior-dependent manner. To estimate the contribution of out-of-focus signals we systematically picked two background ROIs, one placed below the ventral limit of the spinal cord to capture out-of-focus signals at the level of ventral motor neurons during slow swimming, the second in the dorsalmost part of the spinal cord to capture out-of-focus signals in the dorsal spinal cord during the escape. We estimated the maximum out-of-focus signals observed during each behavior and used this value as a threshold for discriminating active from silent motor neurons. Thin-walled, borosilicate glass capillaries (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA, USA) were pulled and fire-polished from a Flaming/Brown pipette puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato) to obtain peripheral nerve recording micropipettes. Pipettes were filled with external solution and positioned next to the preparation using motorized micromanipulators under the microscope. Light suction was applied when the pipette reached the muscle region located at the vicinity of intermyotomal junctions, ventral to the axial musculature midline. VNR signals were acquired at 10 kHz in current clamp IC = 0 mode using a MultiClamp 700A amplifier (Molecular Devices–Axon Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), a Digidata series 1322A digitizer (Axon Instruments) and pClamp 8.2 software (Axon instruments). Recordings were considered for analysis when the background noise did not exceed 0.05 mV amplitude and signal to noise ratio for fictive locomotor events detection was above three. VNR recordings were analyzed offline and aligned to calcium imaging data using custom-made Matlab scripts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Fluorescence-guided whole-cell recordings and pharmacology</title><p>4 dpf larvae were pinned down in Sylgard-coated, glass-bottom dishes filled with external solution with thin tungsten pins through the notochord. Skin was removed from segments 5–6 to the end of the tail using sharp forceps. After removing the skin, one to two segments were dissected using glass suction pipettes. Patch pipettes (1B150F-4, WPI, Sarasota, FL, USA) were designed to reach a tip resistance of 8–12 MOhms and were filled with potassium-containing internal solution (concentrations in mM: K-gluconate 115, KCl 15, MgCl2 2, Mg-ATP 4, HEPES free acid 10, EGTA 0.5, 290 mOsm, adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH and supplemented with Alexa 647 at 4 mM). Cells were held at around −60 mV. We calculated the liquid junction potential in our experiments (−9 mV) but did not correct for it since it did not affect the outcome of our experiments. NMDA receptor antagonist (D-AP5, Tocris) and AMPA receptor antagonist (CNQX, Tocris) were bath applied at 10 µM final concentrations. Kinetic parameters of light-evoked currents and EPSCs were extracted and analyzed using custom-made Matlab scripts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Behavioral analysis of freely moving BoTxBLC larvae</title><p><italic>Tg(isl2b:gal4,cmlc2:eGFP;UAS:BoTxBLC-GFP)</italic> larvae were screened at 2 dpf for expression. At 6 dpf, larvae were tested 4 by 4: each larva was positioned in a separate dish (2 cm diameter) and illuminated from below, freely moving. Each swim arena contained 400 μL of external solution to minimize movement in the z-axis. Escapes were elicited by delivering a 500 Hz stimulus for 1 ms via 20W speakers. Each trial consisted of a 200 ms pretrial window followed by the stimulus and 800 ms subsequent recording. Five trials were performed in succession with 2 min long intertrial resting periods. Behavior was recorded at 650 fps with a high-speed camera (acA2000-340km, Basler, Ahrensburg, Germany) and analyzed using a tracking algorithm (ZebraZoom, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mirat et al., 2013</xref>]) and a custom Matlab script. Extracted kinematic variables are listed and defined as follows: duration (the amount of time during movement), distance (travelled distance), speed (distance/duration), number of oscillations (1/2 of the number of peaks in tail angle over time), and mean tail beat frequency (TBF, inverse of the duration between two subsequent peaks in the tail angle). Visual inspection of the unsmoothed tail angle was used to exclude trials in which erroneous tracking occurred. Trials fulfilling at least one of the following criteria were programmatically excluded: (i) Detected movement prior to the stimulus. In these cases, spontaneous pretrigger movement lingering into the post-trigger recording window can occlude escape-type movements. (ii) First peak in tail-angle occurring more than 20 frames after the stimulus. These no longer represent low-latency escapes and most likely represent a different category of movement altogether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Budick and O'Malley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu and Fetcho, 1999</xref>). (iii) First peak in tail-angle lower than 60 degrees. Bouts lacking an initial C-bend are not escapes and are most likely slow swim bouts or other movement types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Budick and O'Malley, 2000</xref>). Hemi-periods were calculated as the interval between two consecutive peaks in the tail angle, and subsequently used as a determinate to extract fast and slow components of the escape with a cutoff of 650/60 frames (30 Hz). Peaks which alternated between the cutoff value after the first appearance of a slow peak were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>SPSS 20 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used to perform all statistical analyses. Comparisons of bioluminescence signals parameters was conducted using a t-test for paired samples for repeated measures within subjects (that is, active versus paralyzed data). Mixed linear model analysis with repeated measures using an auto-regressive covariance structure was performed to compare the bioluminescence amplitude between movement categories in active assays, and between moving and immotile larvae in active versus fictive assays. The same model was used to analyze behavioral parameters in order to account for repeated measures in within-fish (trial number) and between-group comparisons (genotype). Bioluminescence time decay coefficients were included if the goodness of fit r-square value was &gt;0.95. A Pearson test was used to assess correlations for parametric data. Statistical significance is represented in the graphs as *** for p&lt;0.001, ** for p&lt;0.01, * for p&lt;0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons when needed. All data are provided in the figures and text as means +/- standard error of the mean (SEM).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Dr. Ludovic Tricoire (University Pierre et Marie Curie, France) for providing the original GFP-Aequorin sequence, Dr. Michael Granato (University of Pennsylvania, USA), Dr. Paul Brehm (Vollum Institute, USA) for providing the <italic>relaxed (cacnb1<sup>ts25</sup>)</italic> mutants, Dr. Maximilliano Suster and Prof. Koichi Kawakami (NIG, Japan) for sharing the <italic>Tg(UAS:BoTxBLC-GFP)</italic> transgenic line, Dr. Tom Auer and Dr. Filippo Del Bene (Institut Curie, France) for providing the <italic>mnx1</italic> and <italic>isl2b</italic> constructs and the <italic>Tg(isl2b:gal4,cmlc2:eGFP)</italic> line, and Dr. Minoru Koyama (Janelia Farm, USA) for the <italic>UAS:CoChR-tdTomato</italic> construct.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mechanosensory Neurons Control the Timing of Spinal Microcircuit Selection during Locomotion&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Ronald L Calabrese (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board or Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Mark A Masino (Reviewer #2); David McLean (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an elegant exploration of how sensory feedback affects escape and slow swimming in zebra fish larvae. Combing genetic, imaging, electrophysiological, optogenetic and kinematic analysis, the authors show that mechanosensory feedback enhances the recruitment of motor pools and controls the speed and duration of escape swimming. They then show that Rohon Beard neurons (spinal cord mechanoreceptors) make anatomical contacts and functional synaptic connections with V2a interneurons that are known to control speed of escape swimming. The experiments are carefully done with many thoughtful controls. The data shown is sufficient and analyzed with appropriate statistics. This work reveals microcircuits that underlie speed modulation by mechanosensory feedback in the vertebrate spinal cord and will thus be of wide interest.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There is no direct causal evidence that Rohon Beard neurons do indeed mediate the speed changes associated with active swimming, because they are not selectively silenced. Moreover, there is no direct demonstration that they are activated by the animals own movements during active swimming. These weaknesses can be mitigated in two ways.</p><p>1) An experiment where calcium imaging is used to monitor transients in RB neurons in partially embedded versus fully embedded and/or paralytic fish. This would demonstrate whether the RB cells participate in reafference.</p><p>2) More extensive analysis of the connectivity data between RB neurons and V2a neurons, including increases in the number of independent observations. Latency repeatability and jitter should be critically evaluated both for the EPSC and for the spike response of V2a neurons to RB cell photoactivation. We would like to be reassured that the nature of the connection is truly distinct from the one revealed by prior work, and is thus capable of influencing V2a activity during swimming.</p><p>The detailed reviews of two of the reviewers are included to help in revision but the focus of revision should be the two major points above.</p><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>1) The paper is well written within text but important details are missing from the legends that allow easy interpretation of the data. Some figures are too dense as if composed for a journal with restrictions on figure numbers.</p><p>All legends must be upgraded so that a reader can easily understand the data. Let me focus on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> to illustrate what must be done. What is going on in panels A and G? What are the superimposed lines in panel C (I know this but I am just saying be complete)? What is the color code in panel H and how does it relate to panel I. In panel I, I am really confused please explain the traces. Why are there multiple bumps in the left traces and what does the superposition mean in each set of traces? Please write figure legends that allow the data to be easily understood. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is also a problem. What do the arrow and the arrowhead point out in panel A? What are we looking at in the left most image of panel C and in the middle image of panel C and left image of panel D? What are the different colors showing? In all graphs like panel E1 the mean and SEM are just too difficult to see especially amid the blue points; make bold.</p><p>Split Panels G to K of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> into a separate figure. Consider splitting <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> also.</p><p>2) I am concerned about the morphological data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. Was this observation made in a number of larvae? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>, was this observation made in a number of larvae. The legend of panel C implies that it was but you must be explicit. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, was this observation made in a number of larvae?</p><p>3) There is no direct causal evidence that Rohon Beard cells do indeed mediate the speed changes associated with active swimming, because they are not selectively silenced or optogenetically activated. This needs to be more explicitly acknowledged.</p><p>4) Given the central effects of pancuronium bromide why wasn't α-bungarotoxin used to immobilize the larvae in the experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>? I am also concerned that you did not control for stimulus intensity in these experiments. In active fish and during pancuronium paralysis, is the size of the aequorin response dependent of stimulus amplitude? If it is, then comparisons of amplitudes across these two groups is suspect because different stimulus amplitudes were used.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>1) If RB neurons are encoding proprioceptive information in addition to the cutaneous exteroceptive information they are normally associated with, then activation of RB neurons during acoustic stimuli needs to be confirmed. The prediction is that RB neurons would respond to skin stimulation and acoustic stimulation when the tail can move, but not to acoustic stimuli when the tail is immotile. Without a better idea of whether RB neurons are in fact responding to self generated movements, then it is difficult to attribute the behavioral deficit to them and justify the ensuing circuit busting. For example, it could be that there are neurons in the DRG that are instead responsible.</p><p>2) There has been quite a bit of work in <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadpoles studying RB circuitry involved in cutaneous skin reflexes (e.g., Li et al., 2003, J Neurosci.; Li et al., 2004, J Neurophysiol). Abrupt stimulation of RB afferents generates a reflexive response away from the stimulus. Also, as I understand it, they demonstrate that drive from RB cells that potentially arises from movement-related stimulation would largely be filtered out by inhibition (Sillar and Roberts, 1988, Nature). However, RB neurons can reset or increase swimming rhythms when they are stimulated (e.g., Sillar and Roberts, 1992, J Neurosci), so there is clearly the potential for RB neurons to act as they are proposed to here. I think it would be worth explaining more how the findings here fit into previous work in tadpoles, as well as studies of dorsal cells (the RB equivalents) in lampreys (Buchanan and Cohen, 1982, J Neurophysiol; Christenson etal.,1988, Brain Res). I think the role of the RB-V2a connection would be worth considering in the context of struggling as well (Li et al., 2007, J Neurosci).</p><p>3) The optogenetic-electrophysiology data as currently presented don't provide sufficient temporal resolution to determine if the RB-V2a connection is monosynaptic or not. If it is, this would be novel, since studies of RB circuits in <italic>Xenopus</italic> have only revealed indirect connections from RBs to V2a-like neurons (with extremely short latencies though). In fact, the responses have multiple components which would be more consistent with a polysynaptic connection (especially since RB neurons tend to fire once). Given this is not the main goal of the work, I would suggest perhaps stepping back from saying it is a direct connection and instead focus on the excitatory nature of that connection, monosynaptic or not. Of course, this could all be moot if the RBs are not even active during body bending.</p><p>4) For the botulinum experiments it is largely assumed that the sensory populations are silenced, but it would be better if there was some confirmation in this line of fish. Patch recordings would be ideal, but if not possible a mention of whether the fish fail to respond to touch or not would suffice.</p><p>5) Since the RB driven response is specific to high frequency swimming commensurate with large deflections of the tail, I was expecting that the controls for the aequorin experiments would be zebrafish that are fully embedded so the tail can't move. Is it known if there is still less motor neuron recruitment in this condition comparable to toxin and mutants?</p><p>6) Work in lampreys studying the role of edge-cells seems appropriate to discuss more, since the function appears to be very similar to that proposed here and a lot of that work is performed while the tail is moving. Also the recent development of a rodent preparation is another precedence for neural recordings in moving animals (Hayes etal., 2009, J Neurophysiol; Hochman et al., 2012, Front. Biosci).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Mechanosensory Neurons Control the Timing of Spinal Microcircuit Selection during Locomotion&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Didier Stainier (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been greatly improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>A few more changes are necessary that do not require re-review by the expert reviewers.</p><p>1) There was concern that the authors overstated the case for monosynapticity in the Introduction and Results, subsection “Mechanosensory neurons synapse onto V2a interneurons involved in fast locomotion<bold><italic>”</italic></bold>, given that experiments with a high concentration of divalent ions – or the like – to eliminate (reduce the probability of) disynaptic events were not performed. We suggest that the text starting in subsection “Mechanosensory neurons synapse onto V2a interneurons involved in fast locomotion<bold><italic>”</italic></bold> be modified something like &quot;To assess whether RB-V2A ipsilateral connection might be monosynaptic, we analyzed the lag between RB spikes time-to-peak and V2a EPSCs onset and found that it was below 1 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>, 0.9 ms), a value compatible with monosynaptic connection (see (Li et al., 2007a) where cutoff is set at 3 ms for monosynaptic connections).&quot; The Introduction can be correspondingly edited.</p><p>2) Quoting one of the expert reviewers &quot;There is an underlying assumption that all UAS lines (GFP-aequorin-opt and GCaMP6f;cryaa:mCherry) will produce the same expression patterns when paired with this Gal4 (mnx1:gal4) line. Just because the icm23 line (mnx1:gal4-UAS:preEGFP) was characterized by Bohm et al., this does not mean that Gal4 will work the same with different versions of UAS (UAS:GFP-aequorin-opt or GCaMP6f;cryaa:mCherry). Have these lines been characterized? If so, references to that work must be made to show MN specificity/variegated expression patterns (if any).&quot;</p><p>Please make an effort to give any references that are relevant and provide any characterizations performed at least in Material and methods.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25260.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>There is no direct causal evidence that Rohon Beard neurons do indeed mediate the speed changes associated with active swimming, because they are not selectively silenced.

Yet, we searched extensively the literature and existing databases and could not find any transgenic line targeting RBs without trigeminal neurons &amp; dorsal root ganglia (see Kucenas et al.,2006 Neuroscience 138:641–652; Scott et al.,2007 Nature Methods 4:323 as well as Koichi Kawakami’s and Harry Burgess’s enhancer trap libraries).</p><p><italic>These weaknesses can be mitigated in two ways.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) An experiment where calcium imaging is used to monitor transients in RB neurons in partially embedded versus fully embedded and/or paralytic fish. This would demonstrate whether the RB cells participate in reafference.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting these experiments. The technical challenge of reliably detecting calcium transients in RB neurons lies in the fact that these cells usually fire single spikes in response to current steps in zebrafish larva (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> for one example and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>). This is also the case in the tadpole, as previously shown by the group of Alan Roberts using current steps and gentle touch (Winlove and Roberts, 2012, EJN 36:2926-40). In particular, Alan Roberts and collaborators found that touch led to few spikes while stronger potentially damaging stimuli led to multiple spikes (Roberts et al.,2011 Dev. Neurobiol. 575-584).</p><p>Nonetheless, to assess the recruitment of RB neurons during swimming, we performed three independent sets of experiments.</p><p>1) First, we drove expression of genetically encoded calcium indicators GCaMPs in <italic>isl2b+</italic> neurons in order to monitor the recruitment of RB neurons during active escape responses.</p><p>With GCaMP6f (Kd ~ 250 nM in solution, Chen et al., Nature 2013 and Loren Looger <italic>personal communication</italic>), we did not reach enough expression in RB neurons to perform calcium imaging experiments. On the contrary, with GCaMP5G (Kd = 373nM in solution, Tian et al., Nature Methods 2009 and Loren Looger <italic>personal communication</italic>), expression of the sensor was satisfactory (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2</xref>). Yet, we observed calcium transients during escape responses only in a minority (2 out of 10) of fish expressing GCaMP5G in RB neurons (see examples from one responding fish depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2</xref>). As such, RB responses were not representative of the 10 tested fish so we did not include them in the main manuscript.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25260.017</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Responses to RB neurons to electrical and optogenetic stimulations consists in single spikes (n = 5).</title><p>RB neurons respond to a long current step by a single action potential (top row).

Therefore by using these sensors in vivo, we can easily miss calcium transients associated with single spikes in RB neurons in response to tail contractions.</p><p>2) In order to optimize the imaging of calcium in RB neurons, we therefore retrogradely labeled RB neurons by injections in the spinal cord of Calcium Green Dextrans (Kd ~ 190-270 nM in solution, see Paredes et al., 2008 Methods 46:143-151). We attempted to detect single spikes in 6 RB neurons using an assay where the spinal cord is mechanically stimulated with a glass probe (see Böhm et al.,Nature Communications 2016). Skin stimulations are known to reliably activate RB neurons, which in turn fire single action potentials. However, the Calcium Green Dextran approach led to variation of fluorescence associated with RB neuron firing in a minority of neurons (1 out of 6 tested RB neurons using the mechanical probe).</p><p>3) As fluorescent calcium sensors failed to show transients in single cells, we took advantage of the bioluminescence assay to monitor the activity of <italic>isl2b<sup>+</sup></italic>neurons during acoustic escape responses before and after blockade of muscle contraction.

We analyzed the connectivity of 4 additional RB-V2a pairs, reaching a total of 8 out of 8 V2a interneurons in 8 different larvae receiving synaptic currents from ipsilateral RB neurons.</p><p>To demonstrate the monosynaptic nature of the RB-V2a connection, we first analyzed the time- to-peak of light-evoked action potentials in CoChR<sup>+</sup> RB neurons (5-ms blue light stimulations, n = 103 stimulations recorded in 6 cells) as well as the delay of ESPCs in <italic>chx10<sup>+</sup></italic>V2a neurons following RB stimulations (78 EPSCs recorded in 8 cells). Our analysis shows that RB fire single action potentials in average 2.8 ms ± 0.3 ms after the onset of the blue light pulse (see time-to- peak in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and G</xref>). EPSCs in V2a neurons were detected on average 3.7 ms ± 0.2 ms after the onset of the blue light pulse (see EPSC onset on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E, G</xref>). This means that the lag between RB spiking and V2a EPSC was <underline>0.9 ms on average</underline>, which is compatible with a monosynaptic connection from RB neurons onto V2a interneurons.</p><p>As a reference, in <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadpole, Wen-Chang Li in the Roberts lab used for double patch clamp recordings the criterion of 3 ms to distinguish mono- from polysynaptic currents (Li et al., 2007 Neural Development 2:17). In their conditions, monosynaptic connections identified by double patch clamp recordings were associated with delays ranging from 0.94 to 1.78 ms (mean, ± 0.10 ms, see Li et al., 2004 PNAS 101, 15488-493). From our study here on the connections from RB neurons onto ipsilateral V2a interneurons, we can estimate that the average axon distance to travel was approximately ~ 300 µm. Assuming a synaptic delay of 0.5 ms, the calculated conduction velocity was 0.75 m / s – a value compatible with previous reports in <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadpoles (Li et al.,2004 PNAS 101, 15488-493; Li et al.,2007 Neural Development 2:17).</p><p>We also added in the text a description of the EPSCs amplitude recorded in V2a interneurons, as well as the estimated depolarization induced in V2a cells (see lines subsection “Mechanosensory neurons synapse onto V2a interneurons involved in fast locomotion” in Results).</p><p>Our new results and analysis from physiology of the RB-V2a synapse are now detailed in the main text, subsection “Mechanosensory neurons synapse onto V2a interneurons involved in fast locomotion”. We added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref> the distribution of time-to-peaks for each RB cells and the EPSC delays for each V2a neurons. For each cell, we plotted the data’s standard deviation to illustrate the jitter.</p><p>Note that the jitter of EPSCs recorded in V2a neurons reflects both the variability in spike timing of the RB neurons in response to the optical stimulation as well as the variability in synaptic transmission from RB to V2a neurons. We therefore did not feel comfortable in using the jitter as an argument for monosynaptic connection, as it is used for double patch clamp recording where the precise timing of the presynaptic neuron is precisely known.</p><p><italic>We would like to be reassured that the nature of the connection is truly distinct from the one revealed by prior work, and is thus capable of influencing V2a activity during swimming.</italic> </p><p>Previous work from the Roberts lab in <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadpole showed connections from RB neurons onto commissural excitatory interneurons (dIc and ecINs, see Li et al.,2007 Neural Development 2:17; Roberts et al.,2011 Developmental Neurobiology 575-584), which enable a delayed excitation onto contralateral dINs and motor neurons.</p><p>Here, we show for the first time that the dorsalmost <italic>chx10+</italic> V2a interneurons recruited during fast locomotion as shown previously (McLean et al.,2007 Nature 1;446(7131):71-5, McLean et al.,2008 Nature Neuroscience 11(12):1419-29) are receiving direct monosynaptic inputs from ipsilateral RB neurons. These connections from ipsilateral RB onto dINs were rarely observed by the group of Roberts (see Li et al.,2007 Neural Development 2:17), most likely because the synapses from RB onto ipsilateral dorsalmost V2a neurons are located dorsally at the midline, which is altered by sectioning for the open book tadpole preparation.</p><p>As described above, we have strong evidence that the projection we discovered using anatomy and optogenetics from RB neurons onto ipsilateral V2a dorsalmost interneurons is monosynaptic. Of course, we cannot exclude that there may be polysynaptic inputs onto V2a interneurons in addition to this monosynaptic component.</p><p>This result has important implication for the sensory modulation of motor circuits controlling speed in the spinal cord. As stated now in the Results section, EPSC amplitude induced by RB stimulation in V2a interneurons were on average 28.14 ± 3.9 pA, leading to estimated depolarization of 11.71 ± 2.59 mV on the V2a target (n = 8). The RB to V2a synapse is therefore relevant for determining spiking in V2a. For some V2a tested in current clamp mode, RB inputs were sufficient to elicit an action potential in V2a neurons (see example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p><p>By this mean, RB neuron recruitment could therefore selectively feedback to interneurons driving high speeds and projecting onto a large pool of motor neurons downstream on the ipsilateral side. This point is now discussed in the Discussion, in light of results in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and lamprey.</p><p>Two important remarks on the relevance of this connection:</p><p>a) As mentioned previously, we cannot exclude that the behavioral effects we have described when silencing the output of <italic>isl2b+</italic> neurons with BotxLC-GFP could be due to connections from other sensory neurons targeted by the <italic>Tg(isl2b:gal4)</italic> line -- we therefore added to the revised manuscript a sentence to explain alternative interpretations of the behavior modulation via dorsal root ganglia and/or trigeminal neurons.</p><p>b) Interestingly, the connection from RB neurons onto ipsilateral V2a neurons is very selective for dorsal most V2a cells. When RB neurons are recruited at rest by a touch stimuli, an escape is triggered by initiation of a C bend on the contralateral side. This selective connection from RB onto dorsalmost V2a interneurons most likely is not sufficient to induce subsequent motor activity on the ipsilateral side at rest. However, this connection on the contrary could be modulatory and impact speed if RB neurons are recruited during active locomotion to modulate dorsalmost V2a spiking.</p><p> <italic>The detailed reviews of two of the reviewers are included to help in revision but the focus of revision should be the two major points above.</italic> </p><p> <italic>Reviewer #1</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) The paper is well written within text but important details are missing from the legends that allow easy interpretation of the data.

With this approach, single cell resolution is out-of-reach and specificity of the GFP-Aequorin expression pattern to the cells of interest is critical. Consequently, in the <italic>Tg(mnx1:gal4;UAS:GFP-Aequorin-opt)</italic> transgenic larvae, we had already previously verified that there was strictly no muscle expression by performing anti-GFP immunochemistry and complete larvae imaging on multiple larvae (n = 5, precision added in the main text, subsection “Mechanosensory neurons synapse onto V2a interneurons involved in fast locomotion” and in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> legend, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>. In all animals tested (5 out of 5), there was strictly no muscle expression.

For the anatomy in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> to B, we observed projections from RB neurons onto ipsilateral dorsalmost V2a neurons in 12 cells from 4 larvae. For the electrophysiology in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, we confirmed a monosynaptic connection in 8 out of from 8 recorded dorsal V2a neurons from 8 larvae that were selected based on the RB axonal projection observed onto V2a somata. Stimulating CoChR+ RB neurons led to reliable EPSCs with a short delay in all V2a neurons tested.

If it is, then comparisons of amplitudes across these two groups is suspect because different stimulus amplitudes were used.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing at this potentially confounding factor. In free-tailed animals, intensity of the auditory stimulus was gradually increased until it elicited an escape response in actively moving animals while in paralyzed animals, the intensity of the auditory stimulus was gradually increased until it elicited a bioluminescence signal. In immotile mutants, the intensity was set to the lowest value eliciting a bioluminescence signal. We checked that the amplitude of the bioluminescence signal was not correlated with the intensity of the acoustic stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 4</xref>). In the active versus paralyzed experiment, larger movements, and therefore signals, were actually obtained for <italic>smaller</italic> stimuli, whereas there was no correlation after paralysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 4</xref>, legend). Note also that the voltage controlling the acoustic stimulus was higher in the paralyzed and immotile conditions compared to controls.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) If RB neurons are encoding proprioceptive information in addition to the cutaneous exteroceptive information they are normally associated with, then activation of RB neurons during acoustic stimuli needs to be confirmed. The prediction is that RB neurons would respond to skin stimulation and acoustic stimulation when the tail can move, but not to acoustic stimuli when the tail is immotile. Without a better idea of whether RB neurons are in fact responding to self generated movements, then it is difficult to attribute the behavioral deficit to them and justify the ensuing circuit busting. For example, it could be that there are neurons in the DRG that are instead responsible.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer. As explained above, we tried to perform calcium imaging with single cell resolution on RBs. Due to technical constraint, GCaMPs did not appear sensitive enough for detecting calcium transients associated with single spikes. Nonetheless, we performed GFP- Aequorin experiments using the <italic>Isl2b</italic> driver and observed signals only when the tail is motile, suggesting mechanosensory neurons (Rohon Beard, Trigeminal or DRG) are recruited during active locomotion. These experiments indicate that at least one cell type among RB, TG and DRG is recruited during active acoustic escapes --- but we cannot pin it down to one or a combination within the three cell types.</p><p>Nonetheless, we would like to point out that the ipsilateral connection RB =&gt; V2a neurons that we described here – motivated by the effect we saw on speed in the behavior dataset – is actually very interesting by itself:</p><p>a) it was never described by Li and Roberts, most likely for technical limitations associated with the open book preparation;</p><p>b) the RB-V2a synapse was associated with large EPSCs that could modulate spike timing in the V2a target (“EPSC amplitude induced by RB stimulation in V2a interneurons were on average 28.14 ± 3.9 pA, leading to estimated depolarization of 11.71 ± 2.59 mV on the V2a target (n = 8)”); c) this circuit may enable a speed selective modulation by projecting onto a subset of V2a neurons (the dorsal most ones), as the anatomy of RB neurons is not compatible with projections onto the dendrites of more ventral V2a neurons.</p><p><italic>2) There has been quite a bit of work in Xenopus tadpoles studying RB circuitry involved in cutaneous skin reflexes (e.g., Li et al., 2003, J Neurosci.; Li et al., 2004, J Neurophysiol). Abrupt stimulation of RB afferents generates a reflexive response away from the stimulus. Also, as I understand it, they demonstrate that drive from RB cells that potentially arises from movement-related stimulation would largely be filtered out by inhibition (Sillar and Roberts, 1988, Nature). However, RB neurons can reset or increase swimming rhythms when they are stimulated (e.g., Sillar and Roberts, 1992, J Neurosci), so there is clearly the potential for RB neurons to act as they are proposed to here. I think it would be worth explaining more how the findings here fit into previous work in tadpoles, as well as studies of dorsal cells (the RB equivalents) in lampreys (Buchanan and Cohen, 1982, J Neurophysiol; Christenson etal.,1988, Brain Res). I think the role of the RB-V2a connection would be worth considering in the context of struggling as well (Li et al., 2007, J Neurosci).</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that this discussion is important and was missing from the original submission. We revised the Discussion accordingly, see new paragraph in Discussion of revised manuscript, see below:</p><p>“Previous studies have described a remarkably simple and conserved disynaptic cutaneous skin reflex relying on spinal mechanosensory neurons referred to as Rohon Beard neurons in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and zebrafish and “dorsal cells” in lamprey (Buchanan and Cohen, 1982; Christenson et al., 1988; Clarke et al., 1984; Easley-Neal et al., 2013; Li et al., 2003; Roberts et al., 1983). […]. While local reflex pathways have been characterized at rest, further studies will decipher the mechanisms underlying the diversity of behavioral effects of stimulating mechanosensory neurons: escapes for single touch at rest (Buchanan and Cohen, 1982; Douglass et al., 2008; Roberts et al., 1983), struggling for continuous stimulation (Li et al., 2007b) and enhancement of speed during active locomotion (this study).”</p><p><italic>3) The optogenetic-electrophysiology data as currently presented don't provide sufficient temporal resolution to determine if the RB-V2a connection is monosynaptic or not. If it is, this would be novel, since studies of RB circuits in Xenopus have only revealed indirect connections from RBs to V2a-like neurons (with extremely short latencies though). In fact, the responses have multiple components which would be more consistent with a polysynaptic connection (especially since RB neurons tend to fire once). Given this is not the main goal of the work, I would suggest perhaps stepping back from saying it is a direct connection and instead focus on the excitatory nature of that connection, monosynaptic or not. Of course, this could all be moot if the RBs are not even active during body bending.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing at this critical aspect. As stated above, we analyzed the synaptic connectivity from RB neurons in 4 additional V2a interneurons, reaching a total of 8 cells.</p><p>To demonstrate the monosynaptic nature of the RB-V2a connection we analyzed the time-to- peak of elicited action potentials in CoChR-tdtomato<sup>+</sup> RB neurons in response to 5 ms blue light stimulations (103 stimulations in 6 cells) as well as the delay of ESPCs in <italic>chx10<sup>+</sup></italic>V2a neurons following RB stimulations (78 EPSCs in 8 cells).</p><p>Our analysis shows that RB fire single action potentials in average 2.80 ± 0.29 ms after the onset of the blue light pulse. EPSCs in V2a neurons were detected 3.71 ± 0.19 ms after the onset of the blue light pulse. This means that, in average, there is a lag of 0.9 ms between the peak of RB spikes and V2a EPSCs, which is compatible with a monosynaptic component. See details on the jitter for each cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>, subsection “Mechanosensory neurons synapse onto V2a interneurons involved in fast locomotion” and Discussion above.</p><p> <italic>4) For the botulinum experiments it is largely assumed that the sensory populations are silenced, but it would be better if there was some confirmation in this line of fish. Patch recordings would be ideal, but if not possible a mention of whether the fish fail to respond to touch or not would suffice.</italic> </p><p>We previously showed evidence that BoTxBLC-GFP was effective at silencing synaptic release in motor neurons, GABAergic sensory neurons as well as glutamatergic V2a neurons (Sternberg et al., Current Biology 2016). In one case, we could perform the proper demonstration that silencing of GABA release was fully effective by recording the postsynaptic target while stimulating the presynaptic GABAergic sensory neurons using optogenetics. This demonstration was achieved in triple transgenic animals Tg(pkd2l1:gal4;<italic>UAS:BoTxBLC-GFP; UAS:ChR- mCherry</italic>) where the targets of GABAergic sensory neurons, CaP motor neurons, is obvious due to the basket structure formed by the axons of the GABAergic cells (see Hubbard <italic>et al.,</italic> Current Biology 2016; Sternberg <italic>et al., Current</italic> Biology 2016).</p><p>However, to demonstrate full blockade of synaptic release from mechanosensory neurons, we would need to have the opsin CoChR-tdTomato combined with the BotxBLC-GFP in RB neurons expressing Gal4, and a fluorescent tag in one of RB targets, such as CoPA or dorsalmost V2a neurons. This experiment would require to inject the construct (UAS: CoChR-tdTomato) in triple transgenic Tg(<italic>isl2b:gal4;UAS:BoTxLC-GFP; Chx10:DsRed</italic>) eggs. Unfortunately, we did not raise triple transgenic animals with this combination of transgenes and could not therefore attempt this experiment within few months.</p><p>In our silencing experiments, we have indications that in the <italic>Tg(isl2b:gal4;UAS:BoTxLC-GFP)</italic> double transgenic larvae only a fraction of mechanosensory neurons are silenced:</p><p>a) the <italic>Tg(isl2b:gal4;UAS:BoTxBLC-GFP)</italic> transgenic larvae do not show GFP in all RB neurons: due to variegation of the UAS/Gal4, only a fraction (between 1/3<sup>rd</sup> to 2/3<sup>rd</sup> depending on the fish) of the total number of RB neurons are labeled;</p><p>b) 2 dpf <italic>Tg(isl2b:gal4;UAS:BoTxBLC-GFP)</italic> transgenic larvae larvae upon touch stimulation respond in about half the cases – which is compatible with our point a). We added a comment on the effectiveness of our silencing method in the manuscript’s Result section, see below:</p><p>“Due to the fact that UAS/Gal4 labels cells in a variegated manner, we only observed BotxLCB- GFP in half the RB neurons so although the isl2b promoter drives expression in all RB neurons, dorsal root ganglia and trigeminal neurons. This suggests that the effect of silencing mechanosensory feedback in our behavior experiments are underestimated in our experiments.”</p><p><italic>5) Since the RB driven response is specific to high frequency swimming commensurate with large deflections of the tail, I was expecting that the controls for the aequorin experiments would be zebrafish that are fully embedded so the tail can't move. Is it known if there is still less motor neuron recruitment in this condition comparable to toxin and mutants?</italic> </p><p>From our previous observations during the study of GABAergic sensory neurons in the spinal cord (Böhm et al., Nature Communications 2016), non paralyzed larvae that are embedded in agar perform very strong local contractions locally, which look like transient “accordion” where the body is firmly contracting against the agar wall. During these local contractions of the tail confined in agar, there is most likely stimulation of RB neurons via friction against the agar. We therefore did not consider that this experimental paradigm would constitute a good negative control.</p><p> <italic>6) Work in lampreys studying the role of edge-cells seems appropriate to discuss more, since the function appears to be very similar to that proposed here and a lot of that work is performed while the tail is moving. Also the recent development of a rodent preparation is another precedence for neural recordings in moving animals (Hayes etal., 2009, J Neurophysiol; Hochman et al., 2012, Front. Biosci).</italic></p><p>We agree and added references to the extensive work performed in lamprey on edge cells in preparations where the tail is free in particular, see Discussion.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>1) There was concern that the authors overstated the case for monosynapticity in the Introduction and Results, subsection “Mechanosensory neurons synapse onto V2a interneurons involved in fast locomotion</italic><bold><italic>”</italic></bold><italic>, given that experiments with a high concentration of divalent ions – or the like – to eliminate (reduce the probability of) disynaptic events were not performed.

Just because the icm23 line (mnx1:gal4-UAS:preEGFP) was characterized by Bohm et al., this does not mean that Gal4 will work the same with different versions of UAS (UAS:GFP-aequorin-opt or GCaMP6f;cryaa:mCherry). Have these lines been characterized? If so, references to that work must be made to show MN specificity/variegated expression patterns (if any).&quot;</italic></p><p>So far, we only observed motor neurons when we used the mnx1 promoter to drive expression of GCaMP5G (Sternberg et al., Current Biology 2016) or Gal4 in a UAS:RFP line. However, we cannot exclude that other spinal neurons, distinct from motor neurons, may be targeted by this promoter. Therefore we added in the Material and methods the following lines:</p><p>Given the potential variability in expression patterns of Gal4 lines with different UAS, we characterized the Tg(mnx1:gal4;UAS:GCaMP6f,cryaa:mCherry) line and observed a similar expression in motor neurons as in the Tg(mnx1:gal4;UAS:GFP-aequorin-opt)<sup>icm09</sup> line. In both cases, we observed the targeting of spinal neurons exiting the spinal cord in the ventral root, and therefore referred to as motor neurons. However, we cannot exclude that the mnx1 promoter may target other spinal neurons, distinct from motor neurons.</p></body></sub-article></article>
