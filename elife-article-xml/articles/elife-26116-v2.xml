To properly execute a clean transition from proliferation to differentiation, cells must both efficiently shut down the preexisting proliferative program and properly initiate the differentiation program. Too little proliferation could lead to tissue degeneration or defective tissue repair, whereas too many divisions may facilitate progression to a tumorous state. Likewise, during embryonic development, cells must make clear decisions to escape a preexisting state and initiate a new program, often within one cell generation.</p><p>In the male and female germ cell lineages, germ cells undergo multiple mitotic transit amplifying divisions before switching to the specialized cell cycle of meiosis that leads to terminal differentiation into sperm or eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kimble, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pepling and Spradling, 1998</xref>). The transition from mitosis to meiosis in the germline is critical for the generation of haploid spermatozoa or oocytes throughout reproductive life. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germline, the DExH-box RNA helicase Benign gonial cell neoplasm (Bgcn) is required cell autonomously for mitotically dividing spermatogonia to stop proliferating and initiate meiosis and spermatocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gönczy et al., 1997</xref>). Male germ cells mutant for either <italic>bgcn</italic> or its binding partners <italic>bag-of-marbles</italic> (<italic>bam</italic>) or <italic>tumorous testis</italic> (<italic>tut</italic>) fail to enter meiosis and instead go through several extra rounds of mitosis before they eventually die (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gönczy et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McKearin and Spradling, 1990</xref>). Bgcn also plays an important role in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> female germline, but at an earlier stage of germ cell development, the switch from germline stem cell to transit amplifying oogonial cell. Loss of function of <italic>bgcn</italic> or <italic>bam</italic> results in ovariole tumors composed of stem cell-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McKearin and Ohlstein, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ohlstein et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> Bgcn and Bam regulate germ cell differentiation through post-transcriptional control, but with different accessory proteins and different target mRNAs in male versus female germ cells. In the male germline, Bgcn and Bam form a complex with the RNA-binding protein Tut and translationally repress <italic>meiotic protein-26</italic> (<italic>mei-P26</italic>) by binding the 3’ UTR of <italic>mei-P26</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Insco et al., 2012</xref>). In the female germline, Bam and Bgcn form a complex with Mei-P26 protein and the female-specific RNA-binding protein Sex-lethal (Sxl) in the cystoblast to translationally repress <italic>nanos</italic> (<italic>nos</italic>) mRNA via the <italic>nos</italic> 3’ UTR and promote differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chau et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2013b</xref>).</p><p>Here, we identify the mammalian homolog of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNA helicase Bgcn as YTHDC2 and show that it has a conserved, functional role as a critical regulator of the transition from mitosis to meiosis in the mouse germline. Similar to <italic>bgcn<sup>-/-</sup></italic> flies, <italic>Ythdc2</italic> mutant male and female mice are viable but infertile. In mouse, both male and female <italic>Ythdc2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> germ cells show defects soon after the mitosis to meiosis transition. In <italic>Ythdc2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> testes, germ cells attempt to enter meiotic prophase, but fail to properly express many meiotic markers, continue to express Cyclin A2, rapidly condense their chromosomes and initiate an aberrant mitotic-like division before undergoing apoptosis. Analysis of wild-type postnatal testes at the stage when the first wave of germ cells initiate meiotic prophase revealed that YTHDC2 binds a number of mitotic cell cycle RNAs, suggesting that YTHDC2 may play a direct role in turning off the mitotic proliferation program. In addition, YTHDC2 binds specific piRNA precursors and multiple RNAs necessary for terminal differentiation. Consistent with the presence of a YTH domain, 76% of the RNAs bound by YTHDC2 were also enriched in the N6-methyadenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) modified fraction of RNAs. Our studies indicate that YTHDC2 facilitates a clean transition from one cell state to the next and suggest that a deeply conserved post-transcriptional control mechanism underlies the germ cell-specific switch from mitosis to meiosis in metazoans.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of the mammalian homolog of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Bgcn</title><p>Analysis by tBlastn of the nr/nt mouse and human databases using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Bgcn protein sequence identified mouse YTHDC2 (E-value = 9e<sup>−78</sup>) and human YTHDC2 (E-value = 2e<sup>−61</sup>) as mammalian homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

We propose that action of YTHDC2 through post-transcriptional control of RNA is required during the early stages of meiotic entry in mice to both down-regulate the previous mitotic program and facilitate proper expression of meiotic and differentiation genes. Mouse YTHDC2-deficient male and female germ cells initiate entry into meiosis, as they express STRA8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baltus et al., 2006</xref>) as well as early meiotic markers such as SYCP3 and REC8. However, YTHDC2-deficient male germ cells failed to accumulate high levels of several meiotic proteins and many meiotic transcripts and instead maintained abnormal expression of Cyclin A2 into the leptotene stage of meiotic prophase. The failure to adequately shut down the mitotic program manifested at the cytological level as well, as YTHDC2-deficient male germ cells never reached the pachytene stage, but instead condensed their chromosomes early and entered a premature metaphase resembling mitosis, with 40 chromosomes rather than 20 bivalents. The co-expression of both mitotic and meiotic markers in YTHDC2-deficient male germ cells suggests that the cells have a mixed identity, which may contribute to the rapid loss of the mutant spermatocytes by apoptosis. Down-regulation of Cyclin A2 or other mitotic G2/M regulators in meiotic prophase may be critical to allow germ cells to set up the extended G2 period of meiotic prophase and prevent premature entry into M phase before homologous chromosome have properly paired, undergone recombination, and modified their kinetochores. In the mouse ovary, YTHDC2-deficient germ cells maintain expression of the G1 mitotic marker Cyclin D1 and also appear to enter metaphase rather than go into an extended meiotic prophase.</p><p>Results from immunoprecipitation of mouse YTHDC2 from wild-type P12 testis extracts followed by high-throughput sequencing (fRIP-Seq) revealed that YTHDC2 fRIP enriched several RNAs involved in the mitotic cell cycle, including <italic>Ccna2</italic>, <italic>Rad21</italic> and <italic>Wee1</italic>. Our finding that Cyclin A2 protein was expressed in <italic>Ythdc2</italic> mutant leptotene spermatocytes while absent in wild-type leptotene spermatocytes, suggests that YTHDC2 may be required to directly down-regulate expression of Cyclin A2 as germ cells enter meiotic prophase. fRIP for YTHDC2 also enriched for other mitotic mRNAs, raising the possibility that YTHDC2 may be required to repress the expression of a number of mitotic proteins. While the expression level of <italic>Ccna2</italic> mRNA was slightly higher in <italic>Ythdc2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> testes compared to wild type, the majority of RNAs bound by YTHDC2 at P12 were expressed at similar levels in wild-type and <italic>Ythdc2</italic> mutant testis, suggesting that YTHDC2 may play a role in translational repression of target RNAs or in regulating the subcellular localization of bound RNAs, rather than affecting RNA stability.</p><p>We and others have found that YTHDC2 physically interacts with MEIOC, and the phenotypes of testes and ovaries from <italic>Meioc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abby et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soh et al., 2017</xref>) and <italic>Ythdc2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice are strikingly similar, suggesting that YTHDC2 and MEIOC work together. As seen in <italic>Meioc</italic> mutants, juvenile testes from <italic>Ythdc2</italic> mutant mice showed markedly decreased expression of many meiotic transcripts. However, our global analysis of YTHDC2 target RNAs by fRIP-Seq at P12 did not show significant enrichment for meiotic prophase transcripts, suggesting that while YTHDC2 may bind a few meiotic transcripts, the role of YTHDC2 in expression or stabilization of many meiotic transcripts may be indirect or result from an inability of <italic>Ythdc2</italic> mutant cells to progress through later spermatocyte stages.</p><p>We found that the mouse and human YTHDC2 proteins localize to RNA granules in spermatocytes entering meiotic prophase. Furthermore, mouse YTHDC2 binds the germ granule components MIWI and MSY2, consistent with recent results indicating that mouse YTHDC2 is a component of chromatoid body germ granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meikar et al., 2014</xref>). Germ granules are mainly composed of RNAs and RNA binding proteins, and are key sites for regulating RNA translation and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Voronina et al., 2011</xref>). Along with their role in the piRNA pathway, MIWI and MSY2 have been shown to bind and stabilize and/or store spermiogenic mRNAs in cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) granules until the mRNAs are required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vourekas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2007</xref>). MIWI and MSY2 protein levels increase in late spermatocytes around the pachytene stage, the stage when YTHDC2 protein levels were the highest throughout the cytoplasm. We propose that YTHDC2 may have both an early role in spermatocytes, repressing expression of mitotic targets as the germ cells first enter meiotic prophase, and also a later role in more mature spermatocytes acting with MSY2 and MIWI to stabilize or store transcripts for later use (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref>).</p><p>YTHDC2 also bound several piRNA precursor RNAs including the pachytene piRNA precursor transcript 17-qA3.3–27363.1. Strikingly, the 17-qA3.3–27363.1 piRNA precursor was expressed at a significantly lower level in <italic>Ythdc2</italic> mutant versus wild-type testes. The transcription factor MYBL1 (also known as A-MYB), previously shown to regulate pachytene piRNA precursor transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2013a</xref>), was expressed at similar levels in P12 wild-type and <italic>Ythdc2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that transcription of piRNA precursor 17-qA3.3–27363.1 may not be affected in <italic>Ythdc2</italic> mutant testes. It is possible that YTHDC2 regulates the stability or processing of the piRNA precursors. Recent studies suggest that pachytene piRNAs may play a role in eliminating a large number of mRNAs, including meiotic transcripts, in late spermatocytes and early spermatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Watanabe et al., 2015</xref>). Likewise, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> testes, an RNA precursor expressed in primary spermatocytes from repeats on the Y chromosome is processed into piRNAs that down-regulate expression of the X-linked gene <italic>Stellate</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bozzetti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Quénerch'du et al., 2016</xref>). One possibility is that YTHDC2 may bind and sequester certain pachytene piRNA precursors in early spermatocytes and block them from being processed into mature piRNAs prematurely.</p><p>While loss of function of <italic>Ythdc2</italic> in mice, or <italic>bgcn</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> males prevents germ cells from properly executing the meiotic program, the phenotypes in mice and flies do differ. Mouse male germ cells lacking YTHDC2 function appear to attempt only one additional mitotic division before entering the apoptotic program, while <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germ cells lacking Bgcn function undergo several extra rounds of mitotic division before dying. A previous study suggested that the normal apoptotic pathway that involves a cascade of effector caspases does not appear to be active in <italic>Drosophila</italic> spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yacobi-Sharon et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, it is possible that strong apoptotic surveillance pathways in mouse germ cells, especially on the C57BL/6 background, prevent the aberrant male and female germ cells from continuing to proliferate.</p><p>YTHDC2 has several RNA-binding domains that are conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Bgcn, including an RNA helicase domain. Mouse and human YTHDC2 also contain a YTH domain not recognizably conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Bgcn. Several recent studies have shown that the YTH domain can bind the dynamic, reversible RNA modification N<sup>6</sup>-methyadenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dominissini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Patil et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). The m<sup>6</sup>A modification has been implicated in human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Batista, 2017</xref>), and it is required for driving the transition from pluripotency to differentiation in mammalian embryonic stem cells by marking pluripotency transcripts for rapid turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Batista et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geula et al., 2015</xref>).

Furthermore, the m<sup>6</sup>A-modification of RNA occurs only during meiosis in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and is required for efficient meiotic progression and sporulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agarwala et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clancy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schwartz et al., 2013</xref>), raising the possibility that a deeply conserved mechanism involving m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RNAs might regulate progression through meiotic prophase from yeast to humans.</p><p>The five known YTH-domain m<sup>6</sup>A reader proteins have different cellular localizations and appear to function through different post-transcriptional control mechanisms to dynamically regulate RNAs and allow fast changes in gene expression. For example, human YTHDF1 has been shown to promote efficient translation of m<sup>6</sup>A-marked mRNAs in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), while binding of YTHDF2 triggers degradation of target m<sup>6</sup>A-modified mRNAs in P-bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, a single YTH protein is not expected to bind all m<sup>6</sup>A-marked mRNAs present in a cell. We found that the RNAs bound by YTHDC2 by fRIP in P12 mouse testes are enriched for the m<sup>6</sup>A-modification compared to unbound RNAs, suggesting that the m<sup>6</sup>A modification may be one mechanism targeting YTHDC2 to RNAs via its YTH domain. The multiple RNA binding domains present in YTHDC2 may allow YTHDC2 to identify and function through different post-transcriptional control mechanisms on various RNA targets as well.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p> <italic>Ythdc2</italic> knockout mice were generated according to the scheme depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The conserved RNA helicase YTHDC2 regulates the transition from proliferation to differentiation in the germline&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper identifies YTHDC2 as a mammalian ortholog of Bgcn, a translational repressor involved in the differentiation and meiotic onset of germ line stem cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This paper primarily describes the knockout phenotype of YTHDC2 in the development of mouse germ cells. The authors found that mutants of Ythdc2 in both sexes exhibit aberrant germ cell development and infertility, with the abnormalities most visible at a critical stage of mitosis-meiosis transition. Based on knockout phenotypes and analyses of YTHDC2-bound transcripts, the authors concluded that YTHDC2 facilitates meiotic onset by directly clearing mitotic transcripts.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that this is an interesting manuscript that is informative about an important but poorly understood developmental process: the transition in the germline from mitosis to meiosis. It is, however, not currently appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> and further work will be needed, primarily to clarify and better describe the phenotype, but also to reconsider some of the interpretation.</p><p>The phenotypic description needs to be improved and more quantified. Assuming that the observations that are described have already been done in more than a single sample, this should not represent a major hurdle. This was agreed by all reviewers to be an important issue for much of the data presented.</p><p>Part of this more quantitative approach needs to include rigorous developmental staging of samples, to ensure that comparisons between wild-type and mutant samples are appropriate. For example, the authors need to ensure that the Ccna2 expression that they see in the Ythdc2 mutants represents abnormal expression of Ccna2 in a stage of spermatogenesis that does not normally express Ccna2 (leptotene) rather than wild-type spermatocytes progressing further in spermatogenesis than the Ythdc2 mutants resulting in different stages of spermatogenesis being compared (leptotene wild-type vs pre-leptotene mutant in the current images).</p><p>The authors concluded that the YTHDC2 represses mitotic program and thus facilitate the transition to meiotic program but the reviewers were not convinced that this is the only interpretation of the data. The transcriptome data from mutant testes do not show strong evidence of mitotic transcript clearance (i.e., only 27 transcripts are upregulated, and only Ccna2 appears to be related to cell cycle). Second, most transcripts bound by YTHDC2 (722 out of 758) do not show any differences in the transcript levels between wild-type and mutant testes. It could mean that YTHDC2-containing RNA granules simply act as reservoirs, and the fate of those transcripts is determined by the actions of other regulatory factors. It seems premature to conclude that the main function of YTHDC2 is through clearance of target transcripts. Translational control may also be a relevant mechanism.</p><p>More specific points</p><p>1) The authors describe Cyclin A2 as a mitotic cyclin, and use cyclin A2 to demonstrate failure to transition from mitosis to meiosis in Ythcd2 mutants. However, cyclin A2 is reported to be expressed at the RNA and protein level in preleptotene spermatocytes undergoing meiotic S phase (Ravnik and Wolgemuth, 1996). Could the authors please define which cell types the Abcam antibody to cyclin A2 is staining in their immunofluorescence assay. If cyclin A2 is expressed in the preleptotene stage it should not be described as mitotic/mitotic-specific, and the Ythcd2 phenotype may be more about regulating progression through meiosis (meiotic S phase to meiotic prophase transition) than meiosis vs mitosis.</p><p>2) It will be key for the authors to accurately determine whether the cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and 6E</xref> that co-express SYCP3 and cyclin A2 represent a normal stage in spermatogenesis or an aberrant combination of meiotic and mitotic markers as they suggest. The SYCP3 patterns in the Ythdc2 mutant cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and 6E</xref> look like preleptotene – a stage that is reported to normally express cyclin A2 (Ravnik and Wolgemuth, 1996). The SYCP3 pattern in the wild-type control cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> suggests that these cells are probably in zygotene, a stage that does not normally express cyclin A2 (Ravnik and Wolgemuth, 1996). Please can the authors show developmentally matched wild-type and mutant spermatocytes in the preleptotene stage of meiosis for this figure, and quantify the number of preleptotene cells that express/do not express cyclin A2 for each genotype.</p><p>3) The comparison between wild-type and Ythdc2 mutant spermatocytes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H-I</xref> could be better. The two overlapping nuclei in the wild-type image are in late zygotene/early pachytene, the mutant spermatocyte is in leptotene. Please show a wild-type spermatocyte at a similar stage of leptotene (similar extent of axial element formation) as the mutant spermatocyte.</p><p>4) The fRIP bioinformatic analysis would benefit from having candidate targets experimentally validated by qRT-PCR on fRIP'd material.</p><p>5) The co-IP between Ythdc2, Miwi and Msy2 would benefit from validation by co-IP'ing Ythdc2 with Miwi and Msy2 antibodies as the use of Ythdc2 mutant input lysate does not control for cross-reaction by the Ythdc2 antibodies.</p><p>6) The m6A analysis is preliminary and its conclusions are not fully supported by the data. The data shows that mRNAs that are modified by m6A are also enriched in the RNAs bound by YTHDC2. But the authors have not shown that the mRNA molecules bound by YTHDC2 contain m6A in support of their suggestion that YTHDC2 selects target RNAs through m6A (Discussion paragraph four). The authors need to show that m6A-containing RNAs are present in the YTHDC2 fRIP for this logic to hold. The enrichment itself is fairly modest, and given that only 603 m6A-modified mRNAs are bound by YTHDC2 but 7,105 m6A-modified mRNAs are not, the suggestion that YTHDC2 selects target RNAs through m6A (Results final sentence) is not compelling.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The conserved RNA helicase YTHDC2 regulates the transition from proliferation to differentiation in the germline&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

The authors use mouse genetics, histological and molecular phenotyping, transcriptomics and RNA-IP to show that Ythdc2 binds to mitotic RNAs and regulates their expression to ensure that they do not perturb meiosis. The authors show that Ythdc2 mutant germ cells ectopically express cyclin A2, prematurely exit meiotic prophase, and undergo cell death. These findings represents a significant advance in our understanding of how meiotic progression is regulated in mammals.</p><p>The authors have largely revised the text to take into account most of the reviewers comments. The revised data showing cyclin A2 mis-expression in Ythdc2 mutant spermatocytes are convincing, and the fRIP-PCR confirmations reinforce the findings from the fRIP-seq.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26116.050</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers agreed that this is an interesting manuscript that is informative about an important but poorly understood developmental process: the transition in the germline from mitosis to meiosis. It is, however, not currently appropriate for publication in eLife and further work will be needed, primarily to clarify and better describe the phenotype, but also to reconsider some of the interpretation.</p><p>The phenotypic description needs to be improved and more quantified. Assuming that the observations that are described have already been done in more than a single sample, this should not represent a major hurdle. This was agreed by all reviewers to be an important issue for much of the data presented.</p><p>Part of this more quantitative approach needs to include rigorous developmental staging of samples, to ensure that comparisons between wild type and mutant samples are appropriate. For example, the authors need to ensure that the Ccna2 expression that they see in the Ythdc2 mutants represents abnormal expression of Ccna2 in a stage of spermatogenesis that does not normally express Ccna2 (leptotene) rather than wild-type spermatocytes progressing further in spermatogenesis than the Ythdc2 mutants resulting in different stages of spermatogenesis being compared (leptotene wild-type vs pre-leptotene mutant in the current images).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that it is critical to compare similar developmental stages of spermatogenesis in order to make accurate comparisons between <italic>Ythdc2</italic> mutants and wild-type controls. We have carefully compared the levels of Cyclin A2 protein expression in wild-type and <italic>Ythdc2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> leptotene stage spermatocytes as requested, providing new images as well as quantification in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> as well as in the Results section (see below under point #2 for details).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors concluded that the YTHDC2 represses mitotic program and thus facilitate the transition to meiotic program but the reviewers were not convinced that this is the only interpretation of the data. The transcriptome data from mutant testes do not show strong evidence of mitotic transcript clearance (i.e., only 27 transcripts are upregulated, and only Ccna2 appears to be related to cell cycle). Second, most transcripts bound by YTHDC2 (722 out of 758) do not show any differences in the transcript levels between wild type and mutant testes. It could mean that YTHDC2-containing RNA granules simply act as reservoirs, and the fate of those transcripts is determined by the actions of other regulatory factors. It seems premature to conclude that the main function of YTHDC2 is through clearance of target transcripts. Translational control may also be a relevant mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that YTHDC2 may normally silence target transcripts by translational control, so it is premature to conclude that the main function of YTHDC2 is through clearance of target transcripts. Indeed, as the reviewers point out, for many of the target transcripts detected as bound by YTHDC2 by our fRIP analysis, expression levels did not change between wild-type and <italic>Ythdc2</italic> mutant testes. We represent these data in new volcano plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>. We have reworded our conclusions to indicate that both RNA degradation and translational control are potential mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More specific points</p><p>1) The authors describe Cyclin A2 as a mitotic cyclin, and use cyclin A2 to demonstrate failure to transition from mitosis to meiosis in Ythcd2 mutants. However, cyclin A2 is reported to be expressed at the RNA and protein level in preleptotene spermatocytes undergoing meiotic S phase (Ravnik and Wolgemuth, 1996). Could the authors please define which cell types the Abcam antibody to cyclin A2 is staining in their immunofluorescence assay. If cyclin A2 is expressed in the preleptotene stage it should not be described as mitotic/mitotic-specific, and the Ythcd2 phenotype may be more about regulating progression through meiosis (meiotic S phase to meiotic prophase transition) than meiosis vs mitosis.</p></disp-quote><p>See combined response for specific points 1 and 2 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It will be key for the authors to accurately determine whether the cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and 6E</xref> that co-express SYCP3 and cyclin A2 represent a normal stage in spermatogenesis or an aberrant combination of meiotic and mitotic markers as they suggest. The SYCP3 patterns in the Ythdc2 mutant cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and 6E</xref> look like preleptotene – a stage that is reported to normally express cyclin A2 (Ravnik and Wolgemuth, 1996). The SYCP3 pattern in the wild-type control cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> suggests that these cells are probably in zygotene, a stage that does not normally express cyclin A2 (Ravnik and Wolgemuth, 1996). Please can the authors show developmentally matched wild-type and mutant spermatocytes in the preleptotene stage of meiosis for this figure, and quantify the number of preleptotene cells that express/do not express cyclin A2 for each genotype.</p></disp-quote><p>Although Ravnik and Wolgemuth, 1996, reported that Cyclin A2 is expressed in mitotic spermatogonia and preleptotene spermatocytes, a subsequent paper by Wolgemuth et al. suggested that Cyclin A2 is highly expressed in differentiated A1 to B spermatogonia, but is down-regulated in preleptotene spermatocytes (Int. J. Dev. Biol., 2013). We revisited this analysis with the current antibody reagents and in the C57BL/6 mouse background on which our <italic>Ythdc2</italic> mutants were made.</p><p>Based on our Cyclin A2 and SYCP3 immunofluorescence staining, we found that in wild-type testes, Cyclin A2 protein expression was high in mitotic spermatogonia and decreased in preleptotene spermatocytes (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A-A''</xref>). <italic>Ythdc2</italic> mutant testis cross-sections stained in parallel showed higher levels of Cyclin A2 expression in preleptotene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B-B''</xref>) compared to wild-type. We then extended our analysis to leptotene-stage spermatocytes, which have entered meiotic prophase, taking care to assess developmentally-matched wild-type and <italic>Ythdc2</italic> mutant cells where both appeared to be in leptotene based on the SYCP3 pattern. In wild-type, Cyclin A2 is normally fully down-regulated in leptotene cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A- A''</xref>), in agreement with Ravnik and Wolgemuth, 1996, and Wolgemuth et al., 2013. However, in <italic>Ythdc2</italic> mutant testes, Cyclin A2 protein remained highly expressed in leptotene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B-B''</xref>). New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> now provides images of wild-type and <italic>Ythdc2</italic> mutant leptotene spermatocytes at both low and high magnification, as well as quantification of the number of wild-type and <italic>Ythdc2</italic> mutant leptotene cells that express Cyclin A2. All of the preleptotene and leptotene images were taken from the same staining, and the wild-type and <italic>Ythdc2</italic> mutant testis sections were stained in parallel to allow proper comparison of Cyclin A2 expression levels. In addition, we have clarified our wording throughout the text to indicate that <italic>Ythdc2</italic> mutant germ cells do enter meiosis but fail to properly progress through meiotic prophase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The comparison between wild-type and Ythdc2 mutant spermatocytes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H-I</xref> could be better. The two overlapping nuclei in the wild-type image are in late zygotene/early pachytene, the mutant spermatocyte is in leptotene. Please show a wild-type spermatocyte at a similar stage of leptotene (similar extent of axial element formation) as the mutant spermatocyte.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced the wild-type spermatocyte image (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) to show a similar stage of leptotene to match the <italic>Ythdc2</italic> mutant image.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The fRIP bioinformatic analysis would benefit from having candidate targets experimentally validated by qRT-PCR on fRIP'd material.</p></disp-quote><p>We have validated multiple targets by independent fRIP followed by qRT-PCR, including <italic>Ccna2, Meioc</italic> and the piRNA precursor <italic>17qA3.3-27363</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and 8E</xref>). In addition to these positive fRIP targets, we also included several negative controls, which our fRIP-Seq analysis indicated were not bound by YTHDC2.

However, the experiments requested are not feasible in vivo with current techniques. We have reworded the text in the Introduction, Results and Discussion sections to state that our results agree with the hypothesis that YTHDC2 binds m<sup>6</sup>A modified RNAs, as shown in previous publications, but further work will have to be performed to dissect how much the YTH domain (which binds m<sup>6</sup>A modified RNAs) versus the other predicted RNA binding domains of YTHDC2 contribute to target selection by YTHDC2. We also now mention in the Discussion section that since there are five different YTH domain family members, which have different cellular localization and different effects on RNAs, we do not expect a single YTH protein to bind all m<sup>6</sup>A-marked RNAs in a cell.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has clearly been improved.
