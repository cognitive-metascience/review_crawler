compounds prompted us to explore the potential for dormancy and its contribution to failed drug treatments in this infection. We document the development of non-proliferating intracellular amastigotes in vivo and in vitro in the absence of drug treatment. Non-proliferative amastigotes ultimately converted to trypomastigotes and established infections in new host cells. Most significantly, dormant amastigotes were uniquely resistant to extended drug treatment in vivo and in vitro and could re-establish a flourishing infection after as many as 30 days of drug exposure. These results demonstrate a dormancy state in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> that accounts for the failure of highly cytotoxic compounds to completely resolve the infection. The ability of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> to establish dormancy throws into question current methods for identifying curative drugs but also suggests alternative therapeutic approaches.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34039.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Chagas disease is one of the most harmful tropical diseases in the Americas. It affects millions of people, predominantly in Latin America. It is usually spread by kissing bugs infected with <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> parasites. It is considered a neglected tropical disease because few effective treatments and preventive methods are routinely used.</p><p>Several drugs can kill <italic>T. cruzi</italic> parasites, but they often fail to cure the infection. Many people with Chagas disease go on to have life-long infections and eventually develop heart failure. The reason for the high rate of treatment failure is not known. It does not appear to be the result of the parasites developing resistance to the drugs. One possibility is that the parasites can hide in a dormant state in the body, dodging the toxic drugs and living to reproduce another day.</p><p>Now, Sánchez-Valdéz et al. identify a dormant form of the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> parasite that allows the infection to persist after treatment. In the experiments, a non-reproducing form of the so-called amastigote stage of the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> parasite inside the host cells was observed in infected mice and human cells. While some of the amastigote parasites continue multiplying, a few stop even without drug treatment – but can resume multiplication at a later time. They may also be able to change into the trypomastigote form of the parasite, which can infect new cells. These non-multiplying amastigotes can survive drug treatment for as long as 30 days, whereas the multiplying amastigotes are killed by such drugs. However, the surviving amastigotes then reestablish active infections after treatment has stopped.</p><p>The experiments explain why treatment so often fails to cure Chagas disease. This suggests new treatment strategies are needed, including using existing drugs for a longer time perhaps with less frequent doses. New therapies that kill the dormant amastigotes may also help. Treatments that overcome the parasite’s ability to hide, could stop the progression of the disease and prevent heart-related deaths in those with persistent <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Trypanosoma cruzi</kwd><kwd>Chagas disease</kwd><kwd>dormancy</kwd><kwd>drug resistance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI108265</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tarleton</surname><given-names>Rick L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI124692</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tarleton</surname><given-names>Rick L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OD021719</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tarleton</surname><given-names>Rick L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Intracellular amastigotes of the Chagas disease agent <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> can spontaneously enter an extended state of replicative dormancy, during which time they are resistant to drug treatment both in vitro and in vivo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Parasitic diseases have been particularly resistant to the development of effective vaccines and safe and curative therapeutic drugs. The drugs that have been put into use often suffer from one or more of the problems of inefficiency, high toxicity and/or selection of drug resistant mutants.</p><p>Despite being one of the highest impact infectious diseases in the Americas, <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection in humans is relatively rarely treated. Initially this was because of the misconception that Chagas disease had an autoimmune, rather than pathogen persistence etiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tarleton, 2003</xref>) but more recently the substantial toxic side effects and the limited supply of benznidazole (BZN) and nifurtimox (NFX), drugs that have been in use for decades, has also contributed significantly to their low rate of utilization. However, the highly variable outcome of treatment regimens employing these compounds – ranging from 0% to 100% depending on the study - and the difficulty of accurately assessing these outcomes, also keep utilization as low as 1% of those infected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Castro et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Guedes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Navarro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yun et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The reason for the high variability in the efficacy of BZN and NFX is not known but has been primarily attributed to the broad genetic diversity of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> isolates. Importantly, the lack of drug efficacy is almost certainly not a result of selection of genetic resistance by drug use or misuse, as neither BZN nor NFX have been widely or indiscriminately used and the induction of stable resistance to these drugs is difficult to produce in vitro or in vivo. Further, the variable and often low contribution of humans to infection of insect vectors (many infections in insects originate from feeding on non-human mammals, within which <italic>T. cruzi</italic> circulates widely and at high levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohen and Gürtler, 2001</xref>]), offers very few opportunities to drive and spread resistance even if it were to develop.</p><p>In addition to classical genetic-based drug resistance, it has become increasingly appreciated that in bacterial infections, ‘persister’ cells develop that are transiently unaffected by chemotherapy, due in most cases to metabolic dormancy (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Harms et al., 2016</xref>]). Such persisters can arise spontaneously in the presence or absence of stress signals and can reemerge after the termination of environmental challenges – such as antibiotic treatment.</p><p>In this study, we document the occurrence of dormancy in the protozoan <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and link this phenomenon to the resistance of this parasite to otherwise highly effective and cytotoxic drugs. We show that both in vitro and in vivo, <italic>T. cruzi</italic> exhibits a biphasic kill curve, with the rapid death of most parasites but the persistence of transiently non-replicating intracellular parasites that are resistant to high level and prolonged drug exposure.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The anti-<italic>T. cruzi</italic> drugs BZN and NFX are normally dosed in animals (including humans) for 30–60 days, although shorter treatment times can occasionally be curative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bustamante et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Viotti et al., 2011</xref>). This general requirement for a long treatment course and the variability in outcome is inconsistent with the documented rapid trypanocidal activity of BNZ for <italic>T. cruzi</italic> in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Moraes et al., 2014</xref>), although to our knowledge, kill rates had not previously been determined in vivo. To directly assess the activity of BNZ in vivo, we first established a localized infection of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> in the footpads of mice and then used a transgenic luciferase reporter to monitor the loss of parasites subsequent to a single oral dose of BNZ. We first determined that <italic>T. cruzi</italic> trypomastigotes delivered in the footpad or skin, primarily infect host cells at the infection site (rather than distributing systemically) and expand as amastigotes within these host cells during the subsequent ~96 hr (Padilla, et al., in preparation). Administration of a single oral dose of BZN reduced intracellular amastigotes at the initial infection site by ~90% within 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). A similarly rapid reduction in parasite load occurs in mice with established systemic infections within a few days after the initiation of oral BZN treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). In this later experiment we used multiple <italic>T. cruzi</italic> isolates, including two (colombiana and ARC-0704) previously determined to be relatively more resistant to BZN in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bustamante et al., 2014</xref>). The rate of parasite clearance, approaching the limit of detection by imaging, was similar for all three strains and in the case of the colombiana infection, the 5 days of treatment resulted in a &gt; 3 log<sub>10</sub> reduction in systemic parasite load. Thus, consistent with previous in vitro assessments, BZN rapidly and highly effectively kills both ‘resistant’ and ‘susceptible’ <italic>T. cruzi</italic> strains in vivo.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34039.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rapid decrease of parasite load following short-term BZN treatment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic experimental protocol.

This disconnect implicates a mechanism by which <italic>T. cruzi</italic> can resist highly effective trypanocidal drugs for an extended period of time. To investigate whether dormant/non-replicating forms of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> might be present in infected hosts and possibly contributing to this requirement for long treatment regimens, we used in situ labeling with nucleotide analog 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) to determine the replication status of parasites within tissues of infected mice. We first established the in vivo EdU labeling protocol in acutely infected mice with high tissue parasite load, finding that the vast majority of amastigotes incorporated EdU during a 24 hr period after EdU injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then applied this protocol to mice with established chronic <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infections and again found that most intracellular amastigotes incorporated EdU over the 24–72 hr of exposure. However a small fraction of intracellular amastigotes failed to show evidence of replication over the 72 hr after EdU injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, these apparently non-replicating amastigotes were within host cells in which the other amastigotes were clearly replicating, suggesting that there is a heterogeneity of amastigotes in infected cells. Since the low parasite load in chronically infected mice makes it highly unlikely that a single host cell is infected by more than one trypomastigote, this heterogeneity in replication appears to establish within host cells from a single infecting parasite <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34039.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Rare amastigotes fail to incorporate EdU in chronically infected mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental protocol for assessing proliferation of amastigotes in established in vivo infections.

One possible reason for the failure to replicate is that some amastigotes might die within host cells (perhaps as a result of lethal damage to DNA, defective cytokinesis, or unequal dispersal of chromosomes/organelles during prior replication, among other possible reasons).

Not only could trypomastigotes from minimally replicating amastigotes infect new host cells, re-convert to amastigotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), and begin a new round of replication, but progeny of this replication can also stop dividing soon after invasion and retain dye for &gt;6 days while other progeny of this dormant amastigote divided extensively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

The obvious question remaining is ‘Does this cessation of replication play a critical role in the failure of drugs to effectively clear <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection?’ More specifically, are these replication-arrested parasites resistant to drug treatment? To directly address these questions, we infected mice with Tdtomato-expressing and CellTrace Violet-stained trypomastigotes and confirmed 2 days post-infection the presence in adipose tissue of parasites displaying both of these markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). As expected based on previous experiments, over the span of the 2 day infection, several strongly violet-positive parasites are obvious in cells along with a larger number of parasites in which the violet dye was faint or not detectable, indicating both slow or non-replicating and actively replicating progeny of the infecting trypomastigotes. On days 2 and 3, similarly infected mice were treated with BZN or left untreated and on day 4, examined for the presence of parasites. Remarkably, in the BZN-treated mice, the only parasites detected were brightly violet and present at 1 and occasionally two per infected cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

A resumption of parasite replication was evident in treated mice 9 days after the last of the 2 BNZ treatment doses, demonstrating that dormant, and therefore drug resistant amastigotes, could also resume division in vivo. To further address the drug resistance and recovery potential of dormant amastigotes in vivo, we repeated these experiments in interferon-gamma deficient mice, which lack the ability to develop immune control of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection.

Parasite recovery following drug treatment/washout was monitored globally by whole-well fluorescence detection of the Tdtomato reporter, and at the individual cell level by microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In the absence of treatment, parasite numbers peak near the time of the completion of the first round of intracellular replication (~day four after infection). In all cases, even following 30 days of high dose BZN treatment, parasites can rebound and begin replication after BZN is removed.

A rare bright spot in potential interventions for Chagas disease is the increased availability of drugs such as BZN, which have substantial curative efficacy. However, although BZN and NFX have been in use for decades, have relatively clear mechanisms of action and do not appear to readily encourage development of genetic-based drug resistance, their unpredictable treatment outcome coupled with their modest to severe side effects has limited their use primarily to acute, childhood, or immunosuppression-exacerbated infections. This situation leaves largely untreated the millions of individuals with chronic <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection, many of whom will eventually develop chagasic cardiomyopathies. Furthermore, human clinical trials of new therapies judged to be promising based upon limited studies in experimental models have been colossal failures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Molina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">STOP-CHAGAS Investigators et al., 2017</xref>) and ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT01489228, NCT02498782, and NCT01162967), demonstrating these compounds to be clearly inferior to BNZ and NFX.</p><p>This study initially sought to determine why compounds like BZN that can, and often do, provide sterile cure in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection, also frequently fail. This and previous studies have largely ruled out several mechanisms as primary reasons for the variable efficacy of BZN. Although there is parasite strain variation with respect to BZN susceptibility in vivo, this variation does not appear to be due to direct resistance to the trypanocidal activity of BZN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Parasite lines obtained from failed drug treatments are no more resistant to BZN than the pre-treatment parasites (Sup <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), and although BZN resistance can be induced by drug selection in vitro, such partially resistant lines are crippled with respect to initiating and maintaining an infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mejia et al., 2012</xref>). Thus resistance to BZN treatment is relative, not complete, is not easily selectable, and is not associated with any specific genetic lineage of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> nor with host genetics.</p><p>The results of the current study firmly connect drug treatment failure in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection to the presence of a previously unrecognized player in this parasite’s life cycle, the transiently dormant amastigote. We denote these stages as dormant based primarily on their failure to replicate over an extended period of time and their resistance to trypanocidal compounds over &gt;30 days of exposure. These dormant amastigotes appear at a consistently detectable frequency and are present in many infected host cells in vitro and in vivo. Dormancy occurs spontaneously and is often observed soon after host cell infection – as shown by the ability of parasites to retain cell division monitoring dyes through several rounds of host cell invasion and expansion. However dormancy may also occur at other points throughout the 4–5 day replication cycle within host cells, as suggested by the presence of multiple EdU-negative amastigotes in heavily infected cells and supported by time lapse imaging of infected cells. Importantly, these dormant parasites are not permanently arrested, as they resume replication days to weeks after entering dormancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These dormant amastigotes also readily respond to the cues that drive conversion to trypomastigote forms within host cells, a process that appears to occur only when the host cell is nearly bursting with amastigotes. Candidates for the inducer of stage conversion would include depleted host cytoplasmic components or byproducts of parasite metabolism that could accumulate inside the host cell. Thus the dormant amastigotes have two potential fates besides continued dormancy: to re-initiate replication like conventional amastigotes – likely to occur when there are none or a limited number of other amastigotes in the cell - or to convert to trypomastigotes in concert with the actively replicating amastigotes undergoing that process within the same cells. An extremely rare outcome for amastigotes in host cells is death, as determined by the paucity of degrading amastigotes detected in host cells (Sup <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Dormancy is well-studied in bacteria and plays a critical role in their adaptation to changing environments. This phenomenon had been missed by previous investigations in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> likely because extended dormancy (which would be required to survive during weeks of drug treatment) is relatively rare. In vitro studies often report very high efficiency of drugs such as BZN to kill &gt;99% of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> amastigotes – and the assumption has been that this was in fact 100% killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Moraes et al., 2014</xref>), but this is clearly not the case. To our knowledge, this is the first report of extended dormancy in an otherwise replicating stage of any trypanosomatid. In the related protozoan <italic>Leishmania</italic> sp, intracellular amastigotes exhibit greatly reduced proliferation and metabolism relative to the extracellular promastigote forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jara et al., 2017</xref>) and have been described as ‘semi-quiescent’ but steadily replicating in vivo with a doubling time of 12 days for <italic>L. mexicana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kloehn et al., 2015</xref>). Studies in <italic>L. major</italic> by Mandell and Beverley documented slow growing (~60 hr doubling time) and even slower dividing, BrdU-non-incorporating intracellular amastigotes in mouse infections but the technical limitations of the labeling procedure prevented a definitive conclusion of dormancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Mandell and Beverley, 2017</xref>). The dormancy we describe here for <italic>T. cruzi</italic> is clearly very distinct from but perhaps most similar to the scantly studied arrested hypnozoite liver stages of <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic>. Hypnozoites appear responsible for relapse of vivax malaria even years after the initial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Markus, 2012</xref>), although studies in human liver chimeric mice suggest that hypnozoites may actually not be fully metabolically inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mikolajczak et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Cyst stages of apicomplexans such as <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> and <italic>Cryptosporidium sp</italic> exhibit greatly reduced if not fully quiescent metabolism, consistent with a life cycle stage that is resistant to potentially harsh environmental conditions associated with transmission to a new host. For <italic>T. cruzi</italic> it is much less clear what the evolutionary advantage of dormancy is since transmission depends on putting extracellular parasites into the mammalian host bloodstream for ingestion by its blood feeding reduviid vector. Although we show that dormancy provides a degree of protection from drug-mediated clearance, drug resistance itself cannot be the selective force for this developmental pathway as all the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> lines we have examined, including ones that had not been previously exposed to these or other drugs, generate dormant amastigotes.</p><p>If dormancy is programmed and essential for <italic>T. cruzi</italic> survival, then the property would seem most likely associated with evasion of host immune responses, the major stressor with which <italic>T. cruzi</italic> amastigotes have to contend. <italic>T. cruzi</italic> induces a robust and highly effective immune response that greatly reduces parasite transmission to insect vectors. Although it is relatively rare, this immune response can lead to complete resolution of the infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dias et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tarleton, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Viotti et al., 2006</xref>). Dormancy could facilitate parasite persistence if some trypomastigotes entering host cells immediately went quiescent and as a result were not detected by the immune system. Such persisters could then ‘wake-up’ and begin replication weeks or months later. But those reawakened parasites would likely remain low in numbers as they would have to contend with the now established anti-<italic>T. cruzi</italic> immune response in order to expand and have an increased chance of being transmitted. Thus the selective pressure for development or retention of a dormancy pathway for this purpose alone seems very low.</p><p>Alternatively, dormancy might be a consequence of the biology of <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, rather than an evolutionarily selected process for low-level persistence. <italic>T. cruzi</italic> very rarely undergoes sexual recombination but instead depends heavily on gene amplification and recombination, as well as horizontal gene transfer, for generating genetic diversity. The resorting of genetic material likely takes place in amastigotes, one of the two replicating stages in the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> life cycle. Parasites that enter dormancy soon after host cell invasion could be pre-recombination, ‘stem-like’ cells that would be useful should the genetic recombination events in the replicating parasites go awry. Alternatively, parasites might enter dormancy in order to sort out the result of recombination events before proceeding with additional rounds of replication.</p><p>Whether stochastic or programmed, the mechanisms for entering and exiting the dormant state by <italic>T. cruzi</italic> is a complete black box. Hints about the process may come from understanding the events involved in transitioning from replicating stages to non-replicating stages in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> (e.g. epimastigotes to infective metacyclic trypomastigote and amastigote to blood stage trypomastigote) or in the related African trypanosome <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, which although lacking an intracellular stage, makes several well-characterized transitions from replicating to non-replicating forms.</p><p>The biggest practical message from the current study is that dormancy in the mammalian infection cycle of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> is key to the failure of current drug treatments for <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection. While other factors, including the differential tissue tropism of parasite strains and tissue distribution of potential drugs, certainly also impact treatment outcomes, only dormancy has been definitively linked. Given this new understanding of dormancy and its impact on drug treatment, simply identifying more compounds that effectively kill metabolically active parasites is not likely on its own to be the solution to achieving more dependable cure in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection. The development of new assays that can screen for compounds capable of overcoming dormancy should also be part of the paradigm for identifying new, more effective compounds. The use of current drugs in extended, less intensive dosing routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Álvarez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bustamante et al., 2014</xref>) that extend beyond the dormancy potential of <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, in place of the current highly intensive regimens, should also be further explored.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top"><bold>Additional information</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background</td><td valign="top">Trypanosoma cruzi</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/NCBITaxon:5693">NCBITaxon:5693</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Trypanosma cruzi</italic>, colombiana)</td><td valign="top">TdTomato and luciferase coexpresors; Luciferase- and Tdtomato-expressing parasites.</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">Cotransfected with pTREX-Luciferase and pTREX-Td-tomato plasmids.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>T. cruzi,</italic> colombiana)</td><td valign="top">Colombiana strains expresing luciferase</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">Transfected with the pTREX-Luciferase plasmid.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>T. cruzi</italic>, CL3)</td><td valign="top">CL-3 strain expresing luciferase</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">Transfected with the pTREX-Luciferase plasmid.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>T. cruzi</italic>, ARC0704)</td><td valign="top">ARC-0704 strain expresing luciferase.</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">Transfected with the pTREX-Luciferase plasmid.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>T. cruzi</italic>, colombiana)</td><td valign="top">TdTomato expresing parasites.</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">Transfected with pTREX-Tdtomato plasmid.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line</td><td valign="top">VERO 76</td><td valign="top">American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)</td><td valign="top">CRL 1587; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0603">CVCL_0603</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line</td><td valign="top">Human Foreskin Fibroblasts (HFF)</td><td valign="top">other</td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top">HFF cells were a gift from Dr. D.

Trypomastigotes of the colombiana, CL, Brazil or ARC-0704 strains were used to infect dishes at a ratio of 10 parasites to one host cell. After ON infection, cell cultures were washed with RPMI and incubated with 100 µM EdU for 24, 48 or 72 hr prior to fixation, staining and mounting in ProLong Diamond anti-fade mounting solution (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) containing 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) to stain nuclear and kinetoplast DNA.

Before bioluminescence imaging, mice were transcardially perfused with 1x PBS and then with D-luciferin (0.3 mg/ml) diluted in 1x PBS. Tissue-specific ex vivo luciferase imaging was performed with tissues soaked in D-luciferin (0.3 mg/ml). Luciferase positive thick tissue sections were excised and consecutive imaging and sectioning were performed to reduce non-luminescent area and increase chances to localize amastigote infected tissues.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: John M Kelly and David Sacks.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors provide sound evidence that <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> can be found in a dormant/latent state both in vitro and in vivo experimental models. Using CellTRace Violet to track and isolate the few non-dividing parasites from infected cells in vitro, the authors were able to show that the dormant/quiescent parasites can establish a second round of infection in new host cells. They also provided good in vivo evidence that the non-dividing parasites persist following treatment with benzinidazole and are capable of re-initiating an infection. The data presented are novel and will be of much interest to those involved in finding curative treatments for this important neglected tropical infection. Indeed, the existence of non-replicating amastigotes is an important discovery that might explain the widely observed treatment failure as outcome of Chagas disease therapy and the poor efficacy of some compounds despite their promising curing properties.</p><p>Although no data on the mechanisms of this process are reported, the results are of significant value, and will no doubt stimulate much downstream research to unravel the mechanism(s), determine the biological role, and understand the consequences for drug development.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The in vitro infections shown in Figure 3 and 4 could have been exploited to provide more quantitative data regarding the proportion of non-dividing cells that arise within each generation, and to estimate if this frequency changes during successive generations as the numbers of intracellular amastigotes increases. It would also have been informative to more carefully quantify for comparison the subsequent infections initiated by the CellTrace Violet-positive and negative trypomastigote populations for their intracellular growth and the frequency of non-dividing forms that they give rise to. The limited data provided in Figure 5 shows a single Vero cell with a massive infection initiated by the CellTrace Violet-positive population. Only a single non-dividing parasite is indicated, which seems quite low compared to the frequencies observed in Figures 3 and 4.</p><p>2) The evidence that the non-dividing parasites are the only persisting organisms following treatment and that they are responsible for re-establishing infection is not so clear, particularly from the in vivo data:</p><p>The experiments shown in Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplements 1 and 2 are the key results of the paper but are difficult to assess. The results are meant to indicate that only non-dividing parasites remain after drug treatment, and that these parasites can reinitiate a productive infection. What is actually shown in Figure 6 from the tissue of 3-4 mice treated mice, however, is a single non-dividing parasite. It is not at all clear what this 'representative' result refers to. How many cells, or how much tissue was examined? Were there absolutely no Td-tomato staining cells that were CellTrace Violet-negative? Even a few may have contributed to the re-established infection. Is there some way to quantify this data, by flow cytometry perhaps?

For example, with neither the CellTrace Violet nor with EdU is it possible to assess if parasites stop dividing at later points (rounds) during infection in a host cell (i.e. once CellTrace Violet is diluted due to replication, it is difficult to observe cessation of replication without monitoring individual parasites by time lapse). We have done such time lapse monitoring of a limited number of host cells and have not yet observed amastigotes that were actively dividing, stop dividing. Further, in the in vivo and in vitro drug treatment/washout experiments, <italic>all</italic> parasites that are detected are CellTrace Violet-positive – and thus would have had to have arrested early in the replication cycle within host cells. Thus, we conclude that dormancy occurs preferentially and possibly exclusively soon after host cell invasion and conversion to amastigotes. It would be very challenging to generate highly quantitative frequency data on dormant parasites in different experiments (especially through 2 rounds of cell invasion as shown in Figure 5), under different culture conditions or with different isolates. Our attempts to do so suggest that there is not an increased frequency of dormancy in particular strains. With specific reference to the comment comparing the frequency of dormant parasites in host cells in Figures 3 and 4 compared to Figure 5, multiple trypomastigotes may enter the same host cell in our standard in vitro assays (where the standard parasite:host cell ratio is 10:1) while this is very highly unlikely in the experiment shown in Figure 5 where a very limited number of parasites were used to infect monolayers of host cells. The images we have selected for inclusion in this manuscript accurately reflect the fact that while dormancy occurs routinely, it is not uniform in every infected cell, hence our conclusion that it is not highly programmed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The evidence that the non-dividing parasites are the only persisting organisms following treatment and that they are responsible for re-establishing infection is not so clear, particularly from the in vivo data:</p><p>The experiments shown in Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplements 1 and 2 are the key results of the paper but are difficult to assess.

For these experiments, the peritoneal adipose tissue sample from each mouse is ~0.3 g of tissue spread over a surface of ~ 1.6 cm<sup>2</sup> when mounted for microscopic analysis. In tissue harvested on day 6 of infection (prior to treatment), detection of infected cells is relatively easy and 3-4 infected cells can be observed within 15 minutes of scanning. Based on the observation of approximately 30 infected cells containing a total of 140 amastigotes, we estimate the frequency of Violet+ amastigotes among all amastigotes at this point is ~ 2%. Following 12 days of treatment this same amount of tissue must be exhaustively scanned for up to 3 hrs per sample to detect between 4 and 5 infected cells per sample. Every one of these infected cells contained only violet-positive parasite, generally only 1 parasite per cell. Scanning tissues from more than 12 mice using this process never revealed a violet-negative parasite during or at the conclusion of treatment. Figure 6 does indeed show a single dormant parasite – but the purpose of the supplementary figures is to indicate that this was not the only one found – collectively we have found dozens but did not feel that it was necessary to show them all. It is impossible to prove that there is <italic>not</italic> a non-dormant parasite in mice or animals after 20-30 days of drug treatment – but we have not ever observed them while we do, albeit with great effort, observe non-replicating parasites.</p><p>Some of this additional description has been added to the figure legends to indicate the vigor with which we searched for dormant and non-dormant parasites.</p><p>We do not believe that it will be especially informative to quantify dormant parasites before and after treatment in large part because the timing of “awakening” from dormancy is clearly variable. We know that brief BZN treatment of animals or cell cultures results in higher detectable levels of violet+ dormant parasites than longer-term treatment, suggesting that dormant parasites can exit dormancy while under drug treatment and as a result, be killed. One could argue that BZN is slowly killing parasites while they are dormant but then one would have to explain how some dormant parasites can resist BZN killing for 30 days or more.</p><p>Estimating the number of dormant parasites in the tissue by flow cytometry is quite difficult due to the scarcity of parasites surviving the BZN treatment and the process of the tissue necessary for flow cytometry (requiring enzymatic digestion, etc.). We unsuccessfully tried this approach originally with skeletal muscle of animals chronically infected with Td-tomato expressing parasites and moved to the microscopic analysis of adipose tissue with better results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Overall the quality of the data presented needs to be improved:</p><p>Several fluorescence microscopy images are of poor quality, pixelated (e.g. Figure 4B, Figure 6B), saturated (e.g. Figure 2B, C; Figure 3 24 hrs and 72 hrs; Figure 2—figure supplements 1 and 2), out of focus (e.g. Figure 4F; Figure 5A Merge; Figure 5B; Figure 6B, C; Figure 7B); these images cannot be published as presented, considering the importance of the findings.</p><p>The use of Cell Trace Violet to identify the dormant amastigotes is quite clever but some images of these parasites are rather poor (e.g. Figure 7B).

Figure 4F, G: it would be nice to have images of samples from the other representative fractions of the cellTrace/Tc-Tomato plot.</p></disp-quote><p>Overall quality of the images has been improved. An ImageStream example of Td-tomato positive- violet-negative parasite for Figure 4F is shown and sharper images selected for ImageStream figures. Images from live cultures using the Cytation 5 or from thick adipose tissue samples represent a challenge and usually those techniques have inherent limitations that prevent obtaining images of the same crispness as for those of monolayers or sections by the confocal microscopy (Figure 4E). We increased the resolution of all the pictures to 300dpi. In Figure 2B and C and Figure 7B the saturation and exposure were decreased as much as possible. In Figure 3, saturation and exposure were decreased in the pictures of 24hrs and 72 hrs. Pixelation and focus was corrected/optimized for Figure 4B, Figure 5Figure 6B and 7C. The image in Figure 6C at 6 days was changed to a picture containing a nest with a violet amastigote.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 7A: the authors assume that rebound fluorescence is due to dormant amastigotes:</p><p>No direct proof is presented since few resistant parasites (although rare) could give rise to the fluorescence peaks.

Would it be possible to generate parasites transfected with fluorescence reporters for these components in order to directly monitor dormancy in vitro and in vivo? How do the authors distinguish dormancy from slow growth/long generation times?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers suggest a more detailed biochemical and metabolic characterization of the dormant parasites in order to discriminate them from proliferating amastigotes and to demonstrate true dormancy. We agree that this would be nice, but is well beyond this initial report. We have begun such investigations, attempting as suggested to engineer parasites expressing a reporter for ATP levels. However, although such reporters have been successfully used in mammalian cells (Tantama, et al., Nat Commun, 2013; Yaginuma, et al., Sci Rep, 2014), they did not function in <italic>T. cruz</italic>i, perhaps because ATP levels in the parasites are not within the reporter range of the cytoplasmic ATP sensor. Measuring enzymatic activity would also be useful, but very challenging in these intracellular parasites, where host enzyme activity and substrate availability must also be dealt with.</p><p>We unsuccessfully attempted a TUNEL/EdU double detection – the two protocols were incompatible in our hands. However, as described in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 the detection of TUNEL positive amastigotes dying inside cells is extremely rare and does not correlate with the proportion of EdU negative or violet-positive parasites detected in similar conditions. Further, we show that previously dormant parasites can convert to trypomastigotes, reinvade new host cells, and resume replication – all properties inconsistent with being dead.</p><p>Our experiments of infection of fresh cultures with sorted violet-positive parasites (Figure 5) as well as the rebound after drug treatment (Figure 6 and 7) suggest that parasites resistant to drugs under these conditions are not fixed indefinitely in a non-proliferative dormant state but are totally viable and capable of further proliferation. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to think that those parasites could just display a slower replication. Although we have observed in the time lapse experiments different frequency of division in some amastigotes, the lack of EdU incorporation in some parasites exposed to EdU in vitro for over nearly the entire replication cycle inside the cells, suggests that these parasites have not divided (or did so only just following invasion), in clear contrast to amastigotes actively proliferating in the same cell.</p><p>Parasites that resist BZN treatment for 20-30 days are not stably resistant to BZN in the classical sense- they can be killed as easily as parasites never exposed to BZN once they become metabolically active Figure 7—figure supplement 7). Thus, a few BZN-resistant parasites are not responsible for our observations, unless BZN-resistance is transient – e.g. the parasites are dormant. The difference between very slow growth and dormancy is ultimately semantics – if very slow growth means not dividing for 30 days, then we would agree with that description. But again, this is a transient property – once dormant parasites exit dormancy, they have a “normal” rate of growth. In short, we believe the sum of the data here argue for a state of dormancy. Determining the metabolic and biochemical markers of dormancy will not be easy but it is in our plans.</p></body></sub-article></article>
