N-terminal presequences that direct them to the organelle. The main driving force for their translocation across the inner membrane is provided by the presequence translocase-associated motor (PAM) which contains the J-protein Pam18. Here, we show that in the PAM of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> the function of Pam18 has been replaced by the non-orthologous euglenozoan-specific J-protein TbPam27. TbPam27 is specifically required for the import of mitochondrial presequence-containing but not for carrier proteins. Similar to yeast Pam18, TbPam27 requires an intact J-domain to function. Surprisingly, <italic>T. brucei</italic> still contains a bona fide Pam18 orthologue that, while essential for normal growth, is not involved in protein import. Thus, during evolution of kinetoplastids, Pam18 has been replaced by TbPam27. We propose that this replacement is linked to the transition from two ancestral and functionally distinct TIM complexes, found in most eukaryotes, to the single bifunctional TIM complex present in trypanosomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Trypanosoma</italic></kwd><kwd>mitochondrial protein import</kwd><kwd>j domain containing protein</kwd><kwd>presequence translocase</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>175563</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schneider</surname><given-names>Andre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NCCR RNA and Disease</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schneider</surname><given-names>Andre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Consolidator grant 648235</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Warscheid</surname><given-names>Bettina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>403222702/SFB 1381</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Warscheid</surname><given-names>Bettina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Germany's Excellence Strategy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CIBSS - EXC-2189 - Project ID 390939984</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Warscheid</surname><given-names>Bettina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Excellence Initiative of the German Federal and State Governments</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC 294 BIOSS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Warscheid</surname><given-names>Bettina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Peter und Traudl Engelhorn foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harsman</surname><given-names>Anke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mitochondrial inner membrane translocation of presequence-containing proteins by the single bifunctional TIM complex of <italic>T. brucei</italic> requires an non-canonical J domain-containing protein.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondria evolved from a single endosymbiotic event between an ancestral alpha-proteobacterium and an archaeon-related host cell. During the gradual conversion of the endosymbiont into an organelle, most of the many genes encoded in the genome of the proto-mitochondrion were either lost or transferred to the host genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Archibald, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dacks et al., 2016</xref>). The mitochondrial genes that are now encoded in the nucleus, are translated on cytosolic ribosomes and imported into the various mitochondrial subcompartments. Mitochondrial protein import is executed by several protein complexes, which were thought to be well conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pfanner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hansen and Herrmann, 2019</xref>). How these translocase complexes originally evolved is important for understanding early eukaryotic evolution specifically, and host-symbiont integration, more generally. However, as mitochondria have a billion-year history and can be traced back to the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roger et al., 2017</xref>), it is difficult to gain unambiguous information about their origin and diversification. Although (nearly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Karnkowska et al., 2016</xref>) all eukaryotes have mitochondria or related organelles, recent studies have shown that mitochondria and their import apparatuses are considerably diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dolezal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harsman and Schneider, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gray, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fukasawa et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, it is important to investigate variation across eukaryotes in order to understand how these absolutely essential import systems have evolved and diversified over the last billion years of eukaryotic evolution.</p><p>Mitochondrial protein import has best been studied in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and much of this work can, in principle, be generalized to most eukaryotic lineages. However, more recent work has also characterized mitochondrial import pathways in the parasitic protozoan <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>. These investigations have revealed the extreme divergence of the <italic>T. brucei</italic> import machinery compared to other eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harsman and Schneider, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schneider, 2018a</xref>). The translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> comprises seven subunits, of which three are conserved across all eukaryotic lineages and can be traced to LECA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maćasev et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mani et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, the atypical translocase of the outer membrane (ATOM) in trypanosomes also consists of seven subunits, but only two of these are shared with all eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mani et al., 2015</xref>). In the case of the translocase of the inner membrane (TIM) complexes, the situation is even more extreme. Most eukaryotes have two TIM complexes (TIM22 and TIM23) which do not have any subunits in common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harsman and Schneider, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Žárský and Doležal, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marom et al., 2011</xref>). The TIM22 complex is specialized for membrane insertion of proteins that contain multiple membrane-spanning domains such as mitochondrial carrier proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferramosca and Zara, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pfanner and Neupert, 1987</xref>). The TIM23 complex mediates membrane translocation and insertion of presequence-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pfanner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hansen and Herrmann, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marom et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mokranjac and Neupert, 2010</xref>). Surprisingly, trypanosomes have only a single TIM complex that, with minor variations, functions in both import of presequence-containing and carrier proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harsman et al., 2016</xref>). The only TIM complex component shared between trypanosomes and other eukaryotes is TbTim17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harsman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Singha et al., 2012</xref>), an orthologue of the Tim22 subunit of the TIM22 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Žárský and Doležal, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pyrihová et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>How and why did these extreme changes in the trypanosomal TIM complex occur? Is the divergence observed due to some unseen selective pressure, or could it have evolved through neutral evolutionary processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stoltzfus, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lukeš et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wideman et al., 2019</xref>)? To start addressing these questions, here we focused on the presequence translocase-associated motor (PAM) of <italic>T. brucei</italic>.</p><p>In order to translocate presequence-containing proteins, the TIM23 complex must associate with the matrix-localized PAM, which in yeast, consists of five essential subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marom et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schulz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Craig, 2018</xref>). These are (i) the mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 (mHsp70) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Horst et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kang et al., 1990</xref>) and (ii) its nucleotide exchange factor Mge1, which mediate the transport of presequence-containing substrates across the mitochondrial membranes; (iii) Tim44 which recruits mHsp70 to Tim23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2015</xref>), the pore-forming subunit of the TIM23 complex.; (iv) Pam18, a J protein with an N-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD) that stimulates ATP hydrolysis of mHsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">D'Silva et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Truscott et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mokranjac et al., 2006</xref>), and is itself regulated by associating with (v) the soluble J-like protein Pam16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frazier et al., 2004</xref>). These PAM subunits are relatively well conserved across eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fukasawa et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We predict that the single bifunctional <italic>T. brucei</italic> TIM complex needs to associate with a PAM complex to import presequence-containing proteins into the matrix. However, the nature of this trypanosomal PAM is presently unknown. Single trypanosomal orthologues of mHsp70 and Mge1 are readily identified, and an ORF resembling Tim44 (Tb927.7.4620) is detected through HHPred profile-profile analyses. Furthermore, a number of J and J-like proteins are present in the mitochondrial proteome of <italic>T. brucei</italic>, including putative orthologues of Pam 16 and 18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fukasawa et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we confirm the identity of the Pam16 and Pam18 orthologues in the mitochondrion of <italic>T. brucei</italic> and we demonstrate that they, surprisingly, do not function in the PAM complex. Instead, we show that the J protein TbPam27 is an essential component of the trypanosomal PAM. This suggests that TbPam27 convergently evolved to replace the function of the ancestral Pam18 in kinetoplastids, probably via neutral evolutionary processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of J domain-containing putative PAM subunits in <italic>T. brucei</italic></title><p>We searched for J domain-containing proteins that could be part of the PAM complex that cooperates with the single bifunctional TIM complex of <italic>T. brucei</italic>. To do so, we first built a protein similarity network of the J protein superfamily from a set of 46 diverse representative eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We identified four clusters in this network that correspond to putative PAM subunits and selected them for further experimental analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Two clusters correspond to the Pam16 and Pam18 subfamilies of J proteins which are found in diverse eukaryotic representatives, including euglenozoans (e.g., kinetoplastids, diplonemids and euglenids). Moreover, two euglenozoan-specific clusters were of note. One was of special interest since its member in <italic>T. brucei</italic> is a 27 kDa protein (Tb927.10.13830, termed TbPam27) previously found to be associated with the single trypanosomal TIM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harsman et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, our analysis revealed another kinetoplastid-specific cluster whose member in <italic>T. brucei</italic> is Tb927.4.650 and which appeared closest in similarity to Pam18 and Pam16 in profile Hidden Markov Model (HMM) searches. Thus, our network and phylogenetic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) of J proteins confirms that <italic>T. brucei</italic> has not only orthologues of Pam16 (Tb927.9.13530, termed TbPam16) and Pam18 (Tb927.8.6310, termed TbPam18) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fukasawa et al., 2017</xref>) but also kinetoplastid-specific J proteins of which TbPam27 appears to be associated with the TIM complex.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sequence analysis of the J protein superfamily in eukaryotes and euglenozoans.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Similarity network of DnaJ and Pam16 domain-containing proteins clustered by CLANS with a P-value threshold value of 1 × 10<sup>−12</sup>.

Cell extractions with low concentration of digitonin show that the four C-terminally epitope-tagged proteins co-fractionate with the mitochondrial marker ATOM40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Moreover, the four proteins are all present in the mitochondrial proteome defined by ImportOmics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peikert et al., 2017</xref>). All proteins are also exclusively recovered in the pellet when a crude mitochondrial fraction is subjected to carbonate extraction at high pH, suggesting they are integral membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

To analyze the relation of the four candidate proteins to the single trypanosomal TIM complex in more detail, we surveyed the three previously published SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture)-IP experiments of TIM subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harsman et al., 2016</xref>). In these experiments TbTim17, TbTim42 and the small Tim protein TbTim13, a fraction of which is tightly associated with the TIM complex, were used as the baits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harsman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wenger et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, we also performed an analogous SILAC-IP experiment, using the C-terminally triple myc-tagged TIM subunit acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACAD) as the bait. The results of all four SILAC-IP experiments are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. The figure depicts the relative enrichment factors for our candidate proteins and for the detected TIM core subunits, compared to the epitope-tagged bait proteins. Interestingly, TbPam27 was efficiently enriched in three out of four experiments. TbPam18, TbPam16 and Tb927.4.650, however, were either not detected in any of the four experiments, or in the case of TbPam16, in the ACAD pull down experiment, not enriched. Thus, TbPam27, but not TbPam18, TbPam16 or Tb927.4.650, is associated with the trypanosomal TIM. This is remarkable, since our protein similarity network shows that TbPam27 is more similar to other members of the J protein superfamily, than to TbPam16 and TbPam18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We, therefore, decided to carry out the reciprocal SILAC-IP experiments, using C-terminally HA-tagged TbPam18 and TbPam16 as baits. For TbPam16, the protein that was enriched the most and significantly detected, besides the bait, was TbPam18 (5.7-fold), suggesting that the two proteins interact. Most importantly, however, neither of the eight detected TIM subunits was enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, left panel; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>).

Unexpectedly, essentially all the proteins with the highest significant enrichment are either annotated as ER proteins or predicted to be involved in ER-related processes, such as glycosylation or glycosyl-phosphatidyl inositol (GPI) anchoring. Of all the detected mitochondrial proteins, in contrast, only TbPam18 itself was enriched more than 3-fold, and the 11 detected TIM subunits show only a marginal enrichment of 1.6–1.8-fold, considering the 26.3-fold enrichment of the bait. TbPam16 was not detected, which suggests that the C-terminal tag of TbPam18 might prevent the interaction between the two proteins.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>TbPam27, but not TbPam18, TbPam16 and Tb927.4.650, is associated with the TIM complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cell lines expressing the indicated C-terminally triple myc- or HA-tagged proteins were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP). 5% each of crude mitochondrial fractions (Input) and unbound proteins (Unbound), as well as 100% of the final eluates (IP) were separated by SDS-PAGE.

In these crude mitochondrial fractions significant amounts of the ER are present. Moreover, both TbPam16 and TbPam18 contain predicted N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequences.

The only identified difference between the two forms of the complex was that the two rhomboid-like proteins, TimRhom I and TimRhom II, were specifically associated with the presequence translocase. To investigate whether TbPam27 is associated with the active presequence translocase, we co-expressed TbPam27-myc with a fusion protein. This fusion protein is composed of the presequence and part of the mature form (1–160 aa) of the trypanosomal matrix protein dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (LDH), and mouse dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) carrying a C-terminal triple HA-tag. Addition of aminopterin to this cell line irreversibly fixes the DHFR in its 3D conformation, causing the LDH part of the substrate to be stuck in both the ATOM and the TIM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harsman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schneider, 2018b</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shows that CoIP experiments using the stuck substrate in the presence of aminopterin as the bait, not only recover the LDH-DHFR-HA along with ATOM40 and the TIM components TbTim17 and TimRhom I, as expected, but also the myc-tagged TbPam27.

To do so, we used SILAC combined with high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS). Uninduced and induced TbPam27 RNAi cells were grown in medium containing different stable isotope-labelled forms of arginine and lysine. After 1.5 days of RNAi induction equal cell numbers of uninduced and induced cultures were mixed and mitochondria-enriched fractions were prepared for further analysis by quantitative MS. At this time point, growth of the induced cells is essentially identical to the uninduced ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The proteins detected in this analysis, were filtered for mitochondrial proteins, using the recently published mitochondrial proteome of <italic>T. brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peikert et al., 2017</xref>). It has previously been shown that a reduction in the abundance of mitochondrial proteins in these types of experiments, is mainly due to inhibition of mitochondrial protein import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peikert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pusnik et al., 2011</xref>).

Here, we show that TbPam27 is an essential mitochondrial IM protein. It is associated with the presequence translocase but not with the carrier translocase version of the trypanosomal TIM and functions analogously to fungal Pam18. Like Pam18, TbPam27 is an integral IM protein and requires an intact J domain for its function. However, unlike Pam18 subfamily members, which have N-terminal TMDs, TbPam27 is C-terminally anchored in the IM membrane. Consequently, the J domain of TbPam27 has a reverse orientation relative to the IM when compared to Pam18 of yeast and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mokranjac et al., 2006</xref>). It is unclear if this topological reorientation is functionally significant.</p><p>PAM has been studied in-depth exclusively in fungi and animals. There are some data which show that <italic>Trichomonas</italic> and <italic>Giardia</italic> Pam18s localize to hydrogenosomes and mitosomes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dolezal et al., 2005</xref>). A rudimentary functional conservation has been demonstrated as the J domain of the <italic>Trichomonas</italic> Pam18 can complement the J domain of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Pam18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rada et al., 2011</xref>). The PAM subunit Tim44 has orthologues in essentially all eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clements et al., 2009</xref>) including <italic>Trichomonas</italic> and <italic>Giardia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pyrihová et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martincová et al., 2015</xref>). Trypanosomes, on the other hand, lack a clear Tim44 orthologue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pyrihová et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martincová et al., 2015</xref>). A protein, whose C-terminal domain shows similarity to Tim44 by HHPred has been identified in <italic>T. brucei</italic>. However, it has been shown that this protein is not associated with the trypanosomal TIM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harsman et al., 2016</xref>). These data suggest that <italic>Trichomonas</italic> and <italic>Giardia</italic> may have a somewhat conventional PAM complex. The TIM-PAM complex in <italic>T. brucei</italic> is thus an outlier. Therefore, it constitutes an excellent system to investigate how a process can be evolutionarily conserved in the midst of sequence divergence and component replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wideman et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, <italic>T. brucei</italic> retains orthologues of Pam16 and Pam 18 in its mitochondrion. However, we show that neither of the two proteins is associated with the TIM complex, nor does their ablation interfere with the formation of the presequence pathway intermediate. Furthermore, unlike TbPam27, they are not essential for the bloodstream form of <italic>T. brucei</italic>. These data indicate that they are not subunits of the trypanosomal PAM. Instead, the ancestral function of Pam18 has likely been taken over by TbPam27. Previous examples of convergent evolution for the mitochondrial protein import system of <italic>T. brucei</italic> have been described. They include the two OM import receptors ATOM46 and ATOM69 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mani et al., 2015</xref>) as well as pATOM36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vitali et al., 2018</xref>). In these cases, functionally similar proteins convergently evolved likely due to similar selective pressures.</p><p>In the case of the TIM complex of kinetoplastids, we have a different story. Previous work has shown that LECA most likely already had both, TIM23 and TIM22 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fukasawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Žárský and Doležal, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pyrihová et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, how an ancestor with two specialized import systems evolved to have a single bifunctional TIM complex is a curious affair. We suggest that a neutral replacement of the ancestral Pam18, and possibly also Pam16, by TbPam27 took place in an ancestor of the kinetoplastids, or even possibly at the dawn of the Glycomonada (Kinetoplastea and Diplonemea), as an orthologue of TbPam27 is found in <italic>Diplonema sp.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cavalier-Smith, 2016</xref>). This replacement could explain the transition to a single TIM complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). The core subunits of the ancestral TIM22 and TIM23-PAM complexes were likely very similar to the ones seen in extant yeast and animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). TbTim17, a <italic>T. brucei</italic> TIM core subunit, is most closely related to Tim22, which forms the pore of the TIM22 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Žárský and Doležal, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pyrihová et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the transition from the ancestral state of two TIM complexes, to a single bifunctional TIM complex, required modifications of the TIM22 complex that would allow for compensation of the loss of the TIM23 complex. This means that an ancestral version of the trypanosomal TIM22 complex acquired the ability to translocate presequence-containing proteins. A speculative, yet plausible, scenario for this conversion looks as follows: A J domain-containing protein with a C-terminal TMD, the ancestor of TbPam27, that possibly arose by gene duplication, was recruited to the mitochondrial IM. This protein by chance interacted with the TIM22 complex and facilitated its interaction with TbmHsp70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). This modification would have originally been neutral but could have been the first step towards a bifunctional TIM22 complex since it may have buffered eventual deleterious mutations that led to the loss of the TIM23 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). TimRhom I and TimRhom II are specifically associated with the presequence translocase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harsman et al., 2016</xref>). The recruitment of these proteins as auxiliary components that facilitate the import of presequence-containing proteins, may have further promoted the transition to a single TIM complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Evolutionary scenario explaining the homologue replacement observed in the <italic>T. brucei</italic> PAM.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ancestral situation predicted for LECA.

Only Pam18, Pam16 and mHsp70 are shown. (<bold>B</bold>) The J domain-containing protein TbPam27 (light orange) is recruited to the ancient pro-kinetoplastid TIM22 complex and may has enabled interaction with mHsp70. Initially this would have been neutral. (<bold>C</bold>) The TIM22 complex of the ancient kinetoplastid acquires the capability to translocate presequence-containing proteins, possibly through the recruitment of the trypanosomal presequence translocase specific TimRhom I and TimRhom II (<bold>D</bold>). This allows for deleterious mutations and eventual disappearance of the trypanosomal TIM23 complex. TbPam18 and TbPam16 were retained because they either acquired a new as yet unknown function, or hold an overlooked ancestral role.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-52560-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Importantly, the fact that we have identified orthologues of Pam18 and Pam16, which do not retain their ancestral function, puts a wrench into comparative genomic investigations that assume retention of ancestral features means conservation of function. Moreover, our findings raise the question of why Pam16 and Pam18 are still maintained in <italic>T. brucei</italic> and other kinetoplastids, even though they are no longer necessary for the presequence import pathway. We see two possibilities to explain this. The first is simply by neo-functionalization. The proteins may have picked up a novel function in the kinetoplastid lineage during the course of the evolution of the bifunctional TIM complex. The second possibility is that TbPam16 and TbPam18 have retained an as yet unknown ancestral function that is required in all eukaryotes, but has not been identified due to the focus on their role in the PAM complex. It is currently unclear what the functions of TbPam18 and TbPam16 are. Interestingly, unlike its yeast homologue, TbPam18 seems to be dually localized in the ER and in mitochondria. Moreover, retention of both proteins in all kinetoplastids and the fact that their RNAi-mediated ablation in <italic>T. brucei</italic> specifically interferes with growth of the procyclic but not the bloodstream forms provides both, further information and constraints regarding their possible function. Investigation of TbPam16 and TbPam18 functions will be an interesting topic for future research.</p><p>In summary, our study illustrates the intricate and variable paths evolution may take in different phylogenetic groups to achieve the same aim, namely, to import and sort more than 1000 cytosolically-synthesized proteins into mitochondria. Our work underscores the necessity to combine bioinformatics with functional data to allow for a meaningful comparative analysis that can provide insight into eukaryotic diversification.</p></sec><sec

eukaryotes, with an emphasis on euglenozoans (i.e., kinetoplastids, euglenoids, diplonemids), was assembled. HMMER searches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eddy, 1998</xref>) using the Pfam profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs) for the DnaJ (PF00226) and Pam16 (PF03656) domains, and leniant E-values of 0.1 in order to capture divergent DnaJ domains, were performed against each proteome individually. The hit sequences were then used to build a local custom database of DnaJ- and Pam16 domain-containing proteins. Additionally, reciprocal BLASTp searches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altschul et al., 1990</xref>) using ScPam16 and ScPam18 and the putative TbPam16 and TbPam18 as queries (identified through the network analysis) were performed. This was done to retrieve highly divergent proteins in some eukaryotes (e.g. in euglenozoans) that could not be captured from the curated Pfam profile HMMs. The reciprocal best BLAST hits retrieved were then added to the database of DnaJ and Pam16 domain-containing proteins built with pHMM searches. Duplicates were removed and the redundancy of the database was further reduced with CD-HIT and a threshold of 95% identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li and Godzik, 2006</xref>).

The similarities (i.e., local alignments) among all DnaJ- and Pam16-domain containing proteins were visualized as a 2D protein similarity network with the software CLANS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frickey and Lupas, 2004</xref>). Each DnaJ domain-containing protein (a node) is iteratively placed (for at least 1000 rounds) in a two-dimensional space according to attraction and repulsion values derived from BLAST P-values (edges). Edges correspond to P-values and nodes to protein sequences. Some isolated peripheral nodes and weakly intraconnected clusters were removed for a better visualization of the core similarity network.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Assembly of diplonemid transcriptomes</title><p>Illumina short reads for RNA-Seq experiments of the diplonemids <italic>Diplonema ambulator</italic> (SRR5998378 and SRR5998379), <italic>Diplonema</italic> sp.

animals. In contrast to fungi and animals, only one TIM machinery is used by the proteins that translocate to the mitochondrial matrix and the proteins, such as carriers, that integrate into the inner mitochondrial membrane. Interestingly, the study shows that a novel protein TbPam27 takes the role of presequence translocase associated motor (PAM) and its J protein, Pam18, in the TIM complex serving an important role during the protein import into mitochondria. The study provides an interesting example of the functional and architectural replacement of proteins during the transition into bifunctional TIM complex in the evolution.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Homologue replacement in the import motor of the mitochondrial inner membrane of trypanosomes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Dominique Soldati-Favre as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Patrick R D' Silva (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers are overall positive, however they identified several issues that must be addressed in the revision of this work.</p><p>All of them agree that the this work does not sufficiently demonstrate the interactions as well as the role Pam27 in relation to other Pam proteins at the TbTIM complex.</p><p>Concerning the architecture of TIM and Pam27 specifically, the authors should examine immunoprecipitation experiments for other known components of the TIM complex, either via antibodies and/or mass spectrometry analyses. The reverse immunoprecipitations should also be performed, also using Pam18 and Pam16 as baits. All the experiments addressing the assemblies of the TbTIM complex should be carefully controlled including negative controls.</p><p>The reviewers are not convinced that a single entity ThTIM complex exists. Another possibility is that they are several sub-pools of this complexes, some of them without Pam27. The authors should consider some of the following experiments to address this issue: testing whether TbPam18 and TbPam16 are recruited to TIM-complex in the absence of TbPam27, testing the levels of TbPam18 and TbPam16 in TbPam27 RNAi cells. An interesting input can also be obtained from BN analyses.</p><p>A functional aspect of the study must be strengthened in general, and also to provide more insights into functionally identical vs. diverse complex assemblies. TbPam16, TbPam18 and TbPam27 are all essential proteins. However, the roles of TbPam16 and TbPam18 for protein import unclear. The authors should elucidate this in more depth, by utilizing import assays, and also for example by mass spectrometry of cells in which these components were depleted.</p><p>Other specific points of reviewers should or may be considered prior to submission of the revised version:</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>1) Figure 2 – evidence for inner membrane localisation is weak and indirect. This should be done using a mitochondrial subfractionation assay, probing with and without protease.</p><p>2) Figure 4 uses MCP1Δ as a control for LDH-DHFR, however given this is control precursor is not fused to DHFR it is not an appropriate control? Given this, the outcome of this figure, i.e. carrier biogenesis is not affected is not convincing enough. The authors should also show both OM and IM IP controls for DHFR blocking as spans both membrane.</p><p>3) Figure 5, Blots in A (right panel) are inconsistent with the time frame of graph (missing day 4) and remainder of blots shown in figure.</p><p>4) Figure 7, need complementary SDS PAGE analysis to show levels of Myc protein and levels of TIM subunits. In panel B the authors suggest the carrier intermediate is not affected (in the text), but it clearly is when looking at the data. This data should not be misinterpreted and the possibility that carrier import is also affected should be considered.</p><p>Figure legend and description of which samples go into (C) is not clear. Perhaps also state in axis label what the band intensity was calculated from.</p><p>Top left: what does the 34.4% correspond too? Not mentioned in main text or legend.</p><p>Top right: label some of most significant presequence-containing proteins.</p><p>Bottom left: how is the 8.3% calculated? Poorly described in text/not at all in legend.</p><p>Bottom right: make bottom left (and give letters) as referred to first in text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>Figure 8 contains little information and should be shifted into the supplements. Instead, the mass spec data shown in Figure 9 should be further analyzed. For example, measurements of the proteomes after short or longer times of ablation might allow to distinguish direct from indirect effects. In particular proteins would be interesting, which disappear very early after downregulation of TbPam27.<italic>Reviewer 3:</italic></p><p>1) VDAC is recently shown to interact with yeast TIM22-complex for the efficient import of Carrier proteins (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2018.12.014); therefore, the observed pull-down of TbTim17 and VDAC with Tb927.4.650-HA might be specific (although having lesser affinity), thereby Tb927.4.650 could be a subunit of Tb TIM complex required for carrier protein import. Similarly, VDAC might be cooperating with the TbTIM complex during carrier protein import.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52560.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers are overall positive, however they identified several issues that must be addressed in the revision of this work.</p><p>All of them agree that the this work does not sufficiently demonstrate the interactions as well as the role Pam27 in relation to other Pam proteins at the TbTIM complex.</p><p>Concerning the architecture of TIM and Pam27 specifically, the authors should examine immunoprecipitation experiments for other known components of the TIM complex, either via antibodies and/or mass spectrometry analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>The composition of the trypanosomal TIM complex has been extensively analyzed by proteomic analysis of SILAC immunoprecipitations (IP) using the tagged TIM subunits TbTim17, TbTim42 and TbTim13 (a TIM complex-associated small TIM chaperone) as baits (1). Moreover, the same analysis was also done using a stalled presequence-containing precursor protein or a stalled mitochondrial carrier as a bait (1). In the revised manuscript we have now complemented this data by a new SILAC-IP, which uses the tagged TIM subunit ACAD as a bait (new Figure 3—source data 1). A summary of the six reciprocal IPs is provided in the table shown in &quot;Figure 3—figure supplement 1&quot; of the revised manuscript. It shows that TbPam27 is enriched in 5 out of 6 IPs, whereas TbPam18, TbPam16 and Tb927.4.650 are either not detected or not significantly enriched in any of the 6 IPs (compared to VDAC which is used as a control).</p><p>The new analysis is discussed in the revised manuscript (subsection &quot;TbPam27, but not TbPam18, TbPam16 or Tb927.4.650, is associated with the TIM complex&quot;, second paragraph and subsection &quot;TbPam27 is part of the active presequence translocase&quot;, third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reverse immunoprecipitations should also be performed, also using Pam18 and Pam16 as baits. All the experiments addressing the assemblies of the TbTIM complex should be carefully controlled including negative controls.</p></disp-quote><p>We preformed the reverse SILAC proteomics-based IPs using C-terminally tagged TbPam18 and TbPam16 as baits, as suggested (new Figure 3B in the revised manuscript). Again, the results were very clear, none of the detected TIM subunits in these experiments was significantly enriched in either of the two IPs. This indicates that — in contrast to TbPam27 — neither TbPam18 nor TbPam16 interacts with the TIM complex. — Further results we gained from these experiments were: i) that TbPam16 essentially exclusively interacts with TbPam18, and that ii) TbPam18 likely has a dual localization in the mitochondrion and the ER. TbPam16 and TbPam18 have predicted N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequences, it is therefore unlikely that the C-terminal tag interferes with their localization.</p><p>The new results are discussed in the revised manuscript (subsection &quot;TbPam27, but not TbPam18, TbPam16 or Tb927.4.650, is associated with the TIM complex&quot;).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers are not convinced that a single entity ThTIM complex exists. Another possibility is that they are several sub-pools of this complexes, some of them without Pam27.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a misunderstanding, we don't claim that there is only a single entity of the TIM complex. In fact the pulldown experiments using the two different arrested import substrates show that TbPam27 is preferentially associated with the precursor and not the carrier translocase. — What we claim is that there is no evidence that either TbPam18 or TbPam16 is associated with any form of the TIM complex that we can detect in six different SILAC-IPs (see new Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and new Figure 3B in the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should consider some of the following experiments to address this issue: testing whether TbPam18 and TbPam16 are recruited to TIM-complex in the absence of TbPam27, testing the levels of TbPam18 and TbPam16 in TbPam27 RNAi cells. An interesting input can also be obtained from BN analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We did the requested experiment (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1 of the revised manuscript). The results show i) that there is no compensatory accumulation of TbPam16 or TbPam18 upon ablation of TbPam27 and ii) that pull down experiments in TbPam27 ablated cells using tagged versions of TbPam16 or TbPam18 still do not recover the TIM subunits TbTim17 or TimRhom I.</p><p>The new results are discussed in revised manuscript (subsection &quot;Neither TbPam16 nor TbPam18 is required for mitochondrial protein import&quot;, last paragraph).</p><p>We tried to do BN-PAGE analysis, however, the tagged TbPam18 or TbPam16 could not be detected in this type of analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A functional aspect of the study must be strengthened in general, and also to provide more insights into functionally identical vs. diverse complex assemblies.

For some cells linesthey do not work at all, even when using mitochondria from uninduced cells, which should not show a phenotype. Moreover, we only have a single substrate that works efficiently. The information that can be gained from such <italic>in vitro</italic> import experiments is therefore limited.</p><p>SILAC MS analysis of TbPam18 and TbPam16 RNAi cells could be done. However, the manuscript is about TbPam27 and we don't claim to know what the function of TbPam18 and TbPam16 is, except that they are not involved in import of presequence-containing proteins.</p><p>Instead we decided to do another experiment, which provides important information regarding the function of TbPam16 and TbPam18. <italic>T. brucei</italic> has a complex life cycle, alternating between an insect and a mammalian host. Mitochondrial protein import is essential for both insect stage and bloodstream forms of the parasite. We now show that only TbPam27, but neither TbPam16 nor TbPam18, is essential for growth of the bloodstream form (new Figure 5C and new Figure 6B of the revised manuscript). These results are consistent with the role of TbPam27 as a PAM subunit in mitochondrial protein import. Moreover, they show that the essential function of TbPam16 and TbPam18 is restricted to the insect stage of the parasite and, therefore, cannot be mitochondrial protein import.</p><p>The new results are discussed in the revised manuscript (subsection &quot;TbPam27 with an intact J domain is essential for mitochondrial protein import&quot;, second paragraph and subsection &quot;Neither TbPam16 nor TbPam18 is required for mitochondrial protein import&quot;, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other specific points of reviewers should or may be considered prior to submission of the revised version:</p><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p>1) Figure 2 — evidence for inner membrane localisation is weak and indirect.

The two import intermediates have been described in detail in a previous publication (1). There it was also shown that the stalled presequence substrate spans both membranes, whereas the truncated carrier intermediate accumulates in the inner membrane only. Fusing the truncated carrier substrate to DHFR would block both the presequence and the carrier pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 5, Blots in A (right panel) are inconsistent with the time frame of graph (missing day 4) and remainder of blots shown in figure.</p></disp-quote><p>The missing data for day 4 has been added</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 7, need complementary SDS PAGE analysis to show levels of Myc protein and levels of TIM subunits. In panel B the authors suggest the carrier intermediate is not affected (in the text), but it clearly is when looking at the data. This data should not be misinterpreted and the possibility that carrier import is also affected should be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>The complementary SDS PAGE analysis has been added (Figure 7 of the revised manuscript). It monitors the levels of the TIM complex core subunit TbTim17 as well as the levels of LDH-DHFR and the MCP12ΔI substrates, respectively. (Note that for the LDH-DHFR substrate addition of aminopterin results in shift of the band on the SDS gel).</p><p>It is stated in the text that &quot;…accumulation of the truncated MCP12ΔI was not affected for at least two days&quot;. This is indeed what Figure 7B shows. — We do see an effect on the carrier intermediate, but only after three days (and even then it is much less than in the case of the presequence intermediate), but these are likely pleiotropic effects caused by the growth arrest, which starts after day one. — It is important to note that eventually import of all proteins will be affected since import of some TIM core subunits (e.g. ACAD), which are required for import of both presequence-containing as well as mitochondrial carrier proteins, have predicted mitochondrial targeting sequences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure legend and description of which samples go into (C) is not clear.

For example, measurements of the proteomes after short or longer times of ablation might allow to distinguish direct from indirect effects. In particular proteins would be interesting, which disappear very early after downregulation of TbPam27.</p></disp-quote><p>SILAC proteomics experiments are costly, which is why we analyzed a single time point only. However, we believe that the extent to which proteins get downregulated after ablation of TbPam27, can serve as a proxy for a time course. Thus, we hypothesize that the more efficiently downregulated proteins (we use a cutoff of 1.5-fold) are directly affected by the lack of TbPam27. Having said that, it is important to realize that these are complex <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments and there are always parameters that cannot be controlled, which may confound the results for a few proteins (e.g. the degree of downregulation is influenced by the half-life of the protein in question). The power of the analysis comes from the fact that we have data for 899 different proteins (83% of the mitochondrial proteome).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p>1) VDAC is recently shown to interact with yeast TIM22-complex for the efficient import of Carrier proteins (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2018.12.014); therefore, the observed pull-down of TbTim17 and VDAC with Tb927.4.650-HA might be specific (although having lesser affinity), thereby Tb927.4.650 could be a subunit of Tb TIM complex required for carrier protein import. Similarly, VDAC might be cooperating with the TbTIM complex during carrier protein import.</p></disp-quote><p>The amount of TbTim17 and VDAC detected in the Tb927.4.650 pull downs is approximately the same as in the other tested cell lines, which is why we considered it not to be specific. It is true that we cannot exclude a low affinity association of the two proteins with Tb927.4.650. However, we did not further investigate Tb927.4.650 in the present study because, its ablation does not cause a growth arrest.</p></body></sub-article></article>
