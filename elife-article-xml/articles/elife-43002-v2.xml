ribosomes every minute. Although ribosomes are essential in all cells, natural disruptions to ribosome biogenesis lead to heterogeneous phenotypes. Here, we model these perturbations in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and show that challenges to ribosome biogenesis result in acute loss of proteostasis. Imbalances in the synthesis of r-proteins and rRNAs lead to the rapid aggregation of newly synthesized orphan r-proteins and compromise essential cellular processes, which cells alleviate by activating proteostasis genes. Exogenously bolstering the proteostasis network increases cellular fitness in the face of challenges to ribosome assembly, demonstrating the direct contribution of orphan r-proteins to cellular phenotypes. We propose that ribosome assembly is a key vulnerability of proteostasis maintenance in proliferating cells that may be compromised by diverse genetic, environmental, and xenobiotic perturbations that generate orphan r-proteins.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43002.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells are made up of thousands of different proteins that perform unique roles required for life. To create all of these proteins, cells use machines called ribosomes that are partly formed of elements known as r-proteins. When cells grow and divide, the ribosomes have to make copies of themselves through a process called ribosome biogenesis.</p><p>Although all cells need ribosomes, certain types of cells are especially sensitive to events that interfere with ribosome biogenesis. For example, patients that have mutations in genes needed for ribosome biogenesis produce fewer red blood cells, but their other cells and tissues are mostly healthy. It is not clear why some cells are more sensitive than others.</p><p>Ribosome biogenesis is very similar between different organisms, so researchers often use budding yeast as a model to study the process. Here, Tye et al. used genetic and chemical tools to interfere with ribosome biogenesis on short time scales, which made it possible to detect early on what was going wrong in the cells.</p><p>The experiments found that when ribosome biogenesis was disrupted, r-proteins that were waiting to be assembled into ribosomes quickly stuck to one another and formed clumps that reduced the ability of the yeast cells to grow. The cells responded by switching on a protein called Hsf1, which restored their ability to grow. Yeast cells that were growing quickly, and therefore making more ribosomes, were more sensitive to abnormal ribosome biogenesis than slow-growing cells.</p><p>These results indicate that how actively a cell is growing, and its ability to cope with r-proteins sticking together, may in part explain why certain cells are more vulnerable to events that interfere with ribosome biogenesis. Since human cells also have Hsf1, future experiments could investigate whether turning it on might also protect fast-growing human cells from such events.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>proteostasis</kwd><kwd>ribosome biogenesis</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd><kwd>protein aggregation</kwd><kwd>Hsf1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013171680</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tye</surname><given-names>Blake W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35-GM128813</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wühr</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004944</institution-id><institution>Department of Energy, Labor and Economic Growth</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-SC0018420</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wühr</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM120122</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Springer</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-HG007173</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Churchman</surname><given-names>L Stirling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM117333</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Churchman</surname><given-names>L Stirling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Rapidly proliferating cells are at risk of compromised cell fitness due to proteostasis collapse from perturbations that interfere with ribosome biogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ribosomes are large macromolecular machines that carry out cellular protein synthesis. Cells dedicate up to half of all protein and RNA synthesis to the production of ribosomal protein (r-protein) and RNA (rRNA) components required to assemble thousands of new ribosomes every minute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Warner, 1999</xref>). rRNAs and r-proteins are coordinately synthesized and matured in the nucleolus and cytosol, respectively, in response to growth cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lempiäinen and Shore, 2009</xref>). R-proteins are co- and post-translationally folded, requiring general chaperones as well as dedicated chaperones called escortins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pillet et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, ribosome assembly requires the coordinated synthesis and assembly of macromolecules across cellular compartments, and must be performed at extremely high rates.</p><p>The balanced synthesis of rRNA and r-protein components in proliferating cells is frequently disrupted by genetic and extracellular insults, leading to a wide range of phenotypes. Environmental stressors, such as heat shock and viral infection, and xenobiotics, such as DNA-damaging agents used as chemotherapeutics, interfere with rRNA processing and nucleolar morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kos-Braun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pelham, 1984</xref>). In zebrafish, and possibly in humans, hemizygous loss of r-protein genes can drive cancer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amsterdam et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goudarzi and Lindström, 2016</xref>). Diverse loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding r-proteins, r-protein assembly factors, and rRNA synthesis machinery result in tissue-specific pathologies in humans (ribosomopathies), such as red blood cell differentiation defects in patients with Diamond–Blackfan anemia (DBA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Draptchinskaia et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Khajuria et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Narla and Ebert, 2010</xref>). Not all the phenotypes caused by defects in ribosome biogenesis are wholly deleterious: in budding yeast, loss of r-protein genes increases stress resistance and replicative lifespan and reduces cell size and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jorgensen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Steffen et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Steffen et al., 2012</xref>), and mutations in r-protein genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> also extend lifespan. Collectively, then, despite the fact that ribosomes are required in all cells, disruptions in ribosome biogenesis lead to an array of phenotypic consequences that depend strongly on the cellular context.</p><p>Phenotypes resulting from perturbations to ribosome assembly have both translation-dependent and -independent origins. As expected, when ribosomes are less abundant, biomass accumulation slows and growth rates decreases. Furthermore, reduced ribosome concentrations alter global translation efficiencies, impacting the proteome in cell state–specific ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Khajuria et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mills and Green, 2017</xref>). In many cases, however, cellular growth is affected before ribosome pools have appreciably diminished, indicating that perturbations of ribosome assembly have translation-independent or extraribosomal effects. The origins of these effects are not well understood, but may involve unassembled r-proteins. In many ribosomopathies, excess r-proteins directly interact with and activate p53, presumably as a consequence of imbalanced r-protein stoichiometry. However, p53 activation is not sufficient to explain the extraribosomal phenotypes observed in ribosomopathies or in model organisms experiencing disrupted ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">James et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, r-proteins produced in excess of one-another are normally surveyed by a ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McShane et al., 2016</xref>), which appears to prevent their aberrant aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sung et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sung et al., 2016b</xref>).</p><p>To determine how cells respond and adapt to perturbations in ribosome assembly, we took advantage of fast-acting chemical-genetic tools in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> to rapidly and specifically disrupt various stages of ribosome assembly. These approaches capture the kinetics of cellular responses, avoid secondary effects, and are far more specific than available fast-acting chemicals that disrupt ribosome assembly, such as transcription inhibitors, topoisomerase inhibitors, and nucleotide analogs. Furthermore, by performing this analysis in yeast, which lacks p53, we obtained insight into the fundamental, p53-independent consequences of perturbations of ribosome biogenesis.</p><p>We found that in the wake of perturbed ribosome assembly, cells experience a rapid collapse of protein folding homeostasis that independently impacts cell growth. This proteotoxicity is due to accumulation of excess newly synthesized r-proteins, which are found in insoluble aggregates. Under these conditions, cells launch an adaptive proteostasis response, consisting of Heat Shock Factor 1 (Hsf1)-dependent upregulation of chaperone and degradation machinery, which is required for adapting to r-protein assembly stress. Bolstering the proteostasis network by exogenously activating the Hsf1 regulon increases cellular fitness when ribosome assembly is perturbed. The high degree of conservation of Hsf1, proteostasis networks, and ribosome assembly indicates that the many conditions that disrupt ribosome assembly and orphan r-proteins in other systems may also drive proteostasis collapse, representing a key extraribosomal vulnerability in cells with high rates of ribosome production.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Imbalanced rRNA:r-protein synthesis elicits upregulation of proteostasis machinery via heat-shock factor 1 (Hsf1)</title><p>Ribosome biogenesis commences in the nucleolus, where rRNA is synthesized and processed, and many r-proteins are assembled concomitantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As a first class of disruption to ribosome biogenesis, we examined the consequences of imbalances in rRNA and r-protein production. Specifically, we focused on nuclease factors involved in several different stages of processing rRNAs for the large (60S) ribosomal subunit: endonuclease Las1, 5’-exonucleases Rat1 and Rrp17, and 3’-exonuclease Rrp44/Dis3 (exosome) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kressler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Turowski and Tollervey, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Woolford and Baserga, 2013</xref>). We tagged the target molecules with an auxin-inducible degron (AID), which allows rapid depletion of a tagged protein upon addition of the small molecule auxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nishimura et al., 2009</xref>), thereby acutely shutting down production of mature rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The rRNA processing factors were depleted by 75–90% within 10–20 min of auxin addition, and precursor rRNA (pre-rRNA) accumulated by 20 min, confirming that depletion of these factors rapidly interfered with rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Depletion also led to a detectable reduction in the level of free 60S subunits, indicating that the cell was failing to assemble new 60S, but had no effect on the mature ribosome pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43002.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Imbalanced rRNA:r-protein synthesis elicits upregulation of proteostasis machinery via Heat-Shock Factor 1 (Hsf1).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Brief schematic overview of ribosome biogenesis.

For this purpose, we auxin-treated (or mock-treated) each strain for 20 min, and then performed gene expression profiling by RNA-seq. WT cells exhibited no alteration of the transcriptome in the presence of auxin, whereas each AID-tagged strain exhibited the same compact response. Remarkably, the induced genes are known targets of Heat-Shock Factor 1 (Hsf1), a conserved master transcription factor that controls protein folding and degradation capacity in stress, aging, and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akerfelt et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Upregulation of Hsf1-dependent genes coincided with an increase in Hsf1 occupancy at their promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and was independent of the translational stalling pathway (Rqc2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Hsf1-target transcripts, measured by Northern blot, were maintained at high levels over an 80 min time-course of auxin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). AID-tagged Rrp17 acted as a partial loss-of-function allele, as indicated by the accumulation of pre-rRNA even in the absence of auxin and reduced cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and data not shown), potentially explaining the mild and more transient upregulation of Hsf1 target transcripts following auxin addition in the strain expressing this protein. Nevertheless, depletion of all four rRNA processing factors each led to strong and specific activation of the Hsf1 regulon.</p><p>Importantly, we ruled out the possibility that the depletion strategy itself resulted in Hsf1 activation. Depletion of several factors not involved in rRNA processing via AID did not activate Hsf1, including the RNA surveillance exonuclease Xrn1, mRNA decapping enzyme Dxo1, and transcription termination factor Rtt103 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Additionally, nuclear depletion of an rRNA processing factor using an orthogonal method that does not require proteasome-mediated degradation (‘anchor-away’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haruki et al., 2008</xref>) likewise led to Hsf1 activation, whereas anchor-away depletion of another nuclear protein did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C–F</xref>).</p><p>Stress conditions and xenobiotics in yeast characteristically activate a ‘general’ environmental stress response (ESR), driven by the transcription factors Msn2/4, which rewires metabolism and fortifies cells against further stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>). Strikingly, Msn2/4-dependent ESR genes were not activated after depletion of rRNA processing factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). By contrast, treatment of WT cells with the oxidative agent diamide for 15 min potently activated both Hsf1- and Msn2/4-dependent genes, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Highly specific activation of Hsf1 in the absence of ESR has only been observed in circumstances in which cellular proteostasis is acutely strained: treatment with azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (AZC), a proline analog that interferes with nascent protein folding, resulting in aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Trotter et al., 2002</xref>), or overexpression of an aggregation-prone mutant protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geiler-Samerotte et al., 2011</xref>). Comparison of the kinetics of pre-rRNA and Hsf1-dependent transcript accumulation revealed that cells activate Hsf1 within minutes after rRNA processing is disrupted, indicating a rapid strain on proteostasis, as observed in instantaneous heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>The results of acute disruption of rRNA processing suggest that Hsf1 is activated by an excess of newly synthesized r-proteins relative to rRNAs. To determine whether the reverse phenomenon (i.e. a surplus of rRNAs relative to new r-proteins) could also activate Hsf1, we treated cells with rapamycin to inhibit r-protein expression by inactivating TORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). During the first 15–30 min of low-dose rapamycin treatment, cells strongly repress synthesis of r-proteins while maintaining normal levels of rRNA transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reiter et al., 2011</xref>). Precursor rRNA accumulated due to r-protein limitation, as expected, but the Hsf1-dependent gene <italic>BTN2</italic> was not upregulated during rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Similarly, halting translation, and thus r-protein synthesis, with cycloheximide (CHX) resulted in pre-rRNA accumulation but no upregulation <italic>of BTN2</italic>. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that when r-proteins are in excess relative to what can be assembled into ribosomes, yielding orphan r-proteins, cells activate a proteostatic stress response driven by Hsf1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Orphan r-proteins are sufficient to activate the Hsf1 regulon</title><p>As an orthogonal means of testing the model that orphan r-proteins activate the Hsf1 regulon, we directly inhibited assembly of r-proteins. To this end, we treated cells with a small molecule, diazaborine (DZA), that blocks cytoplasmic assembly of several r-proteins into the 60S subunit by specifically inhibiting the ATPase Drg1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Loibl et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Moreover, Hsf1-dependent transcripts returned to basal levels at 90 min, indicating that Hsf1 activation was an adaptive response. Importantly, a DZA-resistant point mutant of Drg1 (V725E) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Loibl et al., 2014</xref>) restored cell growth and reduced accumulation of Hsf1-dependent transcripts, confirming that DZA contributes to Hsf1 activation via the expected mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with a functional role of Hsf1 activation, we found that DZA treatment protected cells from subsequent lethal heat stress (thermotolerance) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In cells treated with DZA for 15 or 45 min, RNA-seq revealed activation of the same response that was induced by depletion of rRNA processing factors: upregulation of Hsf1-dependent proteostasis genes in the absence of Msn2/4-dependent general stress genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Using the estradiol induction system for V5-tagged ORFs, we followed the fate of newly synthesized r-proteins in mock- or DZA-treated cells. We found that newly synthesized Rps26, Rpl10, and Rpl3 shifted three- to fivefold to the insoluble fraction upon DZA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,F</xref>). Interestingly, the levels of Rpl4 and Rps3 in the pellet increased modestly if at all, possibly due to their distinct biochemical characteristics, protection from aggregation by chaperones, or rapid assembly into precursor ribosome subunits. Treating extracts with the nuclease benzonase did not solubilize aggregated r-proteins, indicating that they were not in RNA- or DNA-dependent assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To compare these results with the behavior of mature, assembled r-proteins, we grew V5-tagged Rpl10 and Rpl3 strains continuously for 5 hr in estradiol prior to DZA treatment. Under these conditions, most of the tagged r-proteins should reside in mature ribosomes, with a small fraction existing unassembled. After DZA treatment, only a modest amount of tagged r-proteins were present in the pellet, likely due to the small unassembled fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). We performed quantitative mass spectrometry to test the generality of r-protein aggregation during RPAS, and found that a broad complement of r-proteins accumulate in aggregates following DZA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Despite observing 3–5-fold increases of newly synthesized Rps26, Rpl3, and Rpl10 in the aggregate fraction following DZA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), none of these proteins were in the highest ranking aggregating proteins in the mass spectrometry data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). As the mass spectrometry data are not specifically assaying newly synthesized proteins, the fold increase in aggregation is likely an underestimate, which would explain the discrepancy. Nevertheless, we observed a clear and general shift of r-proteins to the aggregate fraction following DZA treatment, beyond those that are directly downstream of Drg1 (the target of DZA) function in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,H</xref>). Together, we conclude that RPAS results in specific aggregation of orphan r-proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>RPAS disrupts nuclear and cytosolic proteostasis</title><p>In addition to finding r-proteins, particularly those that are in the large 60S subunit, amongst the strongest aggregators in DZA, we found a prominent group of nucleolar ribosome biogenesis factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This group contained 17 proteins, including 66S (pre-60S) associated factors such as Nop53, Nsa2, Mak16, and Cic1. Intriguingly, a number of factors involved in rRNA processing were found to be strong aggregators in DZA, including four of the components of the nuclear exosome: Lrp1, Rrp41, Rrp43, and the catalytic Rrp6. These data suggest that, in addition to causing aggregation of r-proteins downstream of Drg1 function in the cytosol, DZA treatment leads to aggregation of r-proteins assembled in the nucleus and collateral aggregation of nucleolar ribosome biogenesis factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G,H</xref>).</p><p>Misfolded and aggregated proteins in the cell are often toxic and have the potential to sequester proteins with essential cellular activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gsponer and Babu, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Holmes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stefani and Dobson, 2003</xref>). Accordingly, in addition to upregulating proteostasis factors, cells utilize spatial quality control mechanisms to minimize the deleterious effects of aggregates. For example, cells triage proteins into cytosolic aggregate depots, referred to as Q-bodies or CytoQ, where the Hsp40/70 chaperones and Hsp104 disaggregase collaborate to resolve and refold misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hill et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>). Aggregates also form in the nucleus, in the intranuclear quality control compartment (INQ), which is thought to be involved in their degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hill et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Miller et al., 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Miller et al., 2015b</xref>).</p><p>We used confocal fluorescence microscopy to follow the localization of the Hsp70 co-chaperone Sis1, which recognizes substrates and participates in nuclear aggregation and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Malinovska et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Park et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Summers et al., 2013</xref>). In normal growing populations, Sis1-YFP was distributed evenly throughout the nucleus except in the nucleoli; the nucleolar protein Cfi1-mKate, which localized at the periphery of the nucleus, exhibited little or no colocalization with Sis1. Upon treatment with DZA, Sis1 drastically relocalized within the nucleus, moving to the nuclear periphery, where it formed a ring-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). At the same time, Cfi1 relocalized from the periphery toward the middle of the nucleus, adjacent to the Sis1 ring structure. The effect of DZA on Sis1 and Cfi1 was completely blocked by inhibiting translation with CHX, consistent with the idea that newly synthesized orphan r-proteins drove the response. The subnuclear relocalization of Sis1 in response to RPAS is consistent with a role in the INQ, although the ring-like structure is distinct from the single subnuclear puncta observed following heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Malinovska et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, we analyzed the localization of the disaggregase Hsp104, which colocalizes with aggregates and resolves them, including in a variety of proteotoxic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glover and Lindquist, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tkach and Glover, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>).

Because many of these single-gene deletions do not have gross phenotypes, we used a competitive fitness assay to sensitively detect small differences in cell fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Breslow et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).

Deletion of most factors had no effect on fitness under any condition tested, likely due to redundancy in the mechanisms responsible for restoring proteostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, loss of the transcription factor <italic>RPN4</italic>, which controls the basal and stress-induced levels of the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fleming et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang et al., 2008</xref>), conferred a substantial growth defect in the presence of DZA (~25 fold more severe than in the absence of drug on day 3), at 37°C, and in the presence of AZC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), suggesting that the proteasome plays a critical role in the response to RPAS.

Because Hsf1 responds to and is required for growth under RPAS, we uncoupled Hsf1 from the proteostasis network and placed it under exogenous control to test whether enhanced proteostasis would modulate the DZA-induced growth defect. For this purpose, we placed a chimeric fusion of the Hsf1 DNA-binding domain with the transactivation domain VP16 (Hsf1<sup>DBD</sup>-VP16) under the control of an estradiol-responsive promoter in a strain lacking wild-type <italic>HSF1</italic>, allowing exogenous upregulation of the Hsf1 regulon by addition of estradiol.

We propose a model wherein excess orphan r-proteins that arise from aberrations in ribosome biogenesis drive proteotoxicity and impact cellular fitness under r-protein assembly stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In turn, the master proteostasis transcription factor Hsf1 is activated to increase the abundance of folding and degradation machineries, likely following sequestration of chaperones such as Hsp40 and Hsp70 by r-protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). The proteostatic response supports cell fitness and is capable of protecting cells from r-protein assembly stress. Thus, proliferating cells accept a tradeoff between the risk of proteotoxicity and the growth benefits of high ribosome production. The resulting balancing act is vulnerable to disruption by a variety of genetic and chemical insults, necessitating protective mechanisms capable of restoring the balance. Interestingly, several r-proteins are produced in excess, for instance in human tissue culture cells, and are rapidly targeted for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abovich et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lam et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McShane et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sung et al., 2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sung et al., 2016b</xref>). We therefore propose that in the perturbations modeled in this work, cells are challenged with a larger proportion of orphan r-proteins that overwhelms the canonical clearance mechanisms, necessitating an increase in proteostasis capacity, consistent with the importance of both Hsf1 and Rpn4 in RPAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,D</xref>).</p><p>It is possible that, rather than aggregated r-proteins, pre-40S/60S precursors accumulated in the nucleolus elicit RPAS. Though we cannot definitively test this alternative model, we find it unlikely for several reasons. First, many lines of evidence point towards Hsf1 activation requiring accumulation of misfolded/aggregated proteins that titrate chaperones away from binding and inactivating Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>), making it difficult to envision a model wherein precursors per se drive Hsf1 activation independent of r-protein aggregation. Second, the RPAS response is also activated by depletion of rRNA processing factors, which remove the platform (rRNA) for precursor assembly altogether. Third, in the case of DZA treatment, we found many additional r-proteins that aggregate beyond those that are downstream of Drg1 function, including many that assemble at the earliest stages of precursor formation in the nucleolus. Thus, we favor a model wherein aberrations in ribosome biogenesis that affect both rRNA production and r-protein assembly lead to RPAS due to aggregation of orphan r-proteins in the nucleus and cytosol.</p><p>Given the conservation of proteostasis mechanisms and ribosome biogenesis, we suspect that disrupted ribosome assembly might also cause proteotoxic stress in other eukaryotes. Certainly, many conditions have the potential to orphan r-proteins, thereby straining proteostasis. For example, DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents like etoposide, camptothecin, and 5-fluorouracil and transcription inhibitors like actinomycin D disrupt the nucleolus and rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burger et al., 2010</xref>).

Imbalanced production of r-proteins arises in mutations found in ribosomopathies, as well as in aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">David et al., 2010</xref>) and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guimaraes and Zavolan, 2016</xref>). Because ribosome biogenesis is not a constitutive process, but instead fluctuates in response to nutrient availability, stress, cell growth, and differentiation cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lempiäinen and Shore, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mayer and Grummt, 2006</xref>), these conditions are likely to acutely challenge ribosome biogenesis and lead to periodic disruptions to proteostasis. The severity of the resulting phenotype may relate to cell growth rate and the required level of ribosome production in a cell type/state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>), which suggests a possible mechanism for why certain cell types are especially vulnerable to disrupted ribosome biogenesis, such as in ribosomopathies.</p><p>Proteotoxic stress has been extensively linked to overall disruption of cellular homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gsponer and Babu, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Holmes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stefani and Dobson, 2003</xref>). While the molecular basis for how protein aggregates compromise cell health is not fully understood, one demonstrated possibility is that aggregates sequester other proteins with essential functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Olzscha et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the proteotoxic stress elicited by RPAS has the potential to severely disrupt cellular homeostasis, consistent with our findings that alleviating proteotoxic stress enhances cell growth under RPAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Differences among cell types in the ability to withstand proteotoxic conditions might contribute to the phenotypic variability in response to ribosome assembly defects.</p><p>The gene expression response mounted by cells experiencing RPAS provides clues regarding how the cell deals with toxic orphan r-proteins. The requirement for an Hsf1-mediated response suggests that upregulation of the folding and/or degradation machinery contributes to this resolution. The extreme sensitivity of <italic>rpn4</italic> cells to RPAS suggests an important role for proteasome-mediated degradation of orphan r-proteins. Consistent with this, yeast and human cells degrade r-proteins produced in excess, and cells lacking this quality control mechanism contain aggregated r-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McShane et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sung et al., 2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sung et al., 2016b</xref>). Indeed, the proteotoxicity of excess r-proteins may explain why cells evolved mechanisms to prevent their accumulation above stoichiometric levels, even in aneuploid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dephoure et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Activation of the Hsf1 regulon in RPAS is the consequence of newly synthesized r-proteins that cannot reach their normal destination and therefore fail to assemble into a cognate complex, leading to their aggregation. Similarly, the mitochondrial unfolded protein response is activated when assembly of mitochondrial complexes is disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yoneda et al., 2004</xref>). Blocking import of organellar proteins into the ER or mitochondria results in cytosolic proteotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Weidberg and Amon, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wrobel et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, aberrant accumulation of orphan proteins – that is, those that do not arrive at their appropriate complex or subcellular location – is a hallmark of proteostasis loss, which is resolved by pathways tailored for each cellular compartment. Given that the nucleolus is morphologically disrupted and recruits chaperones such as Hsp70 under stress, including heat shock and proteasome inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lam et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pelham, 1984</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that RPAS is responsible, at least in part, for Hsf1 activation in response to various stress stimuli. Consistently, new r-proteins undergo ubiquitination, localize in protein aggregates, and associate with chaperones under heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ruan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shalgi et al., 2013</xref>). R-proteins, due to their exceptionally high abundance, complex assembly pathway, and aggregation-prone nature, represent a particularly vulnerable group of proteins.</p><p>Particular cell types and cell states, such as tumor cells or differentiating erythropoietic precursors, have exceptional demand for high ribosome production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mills and Green, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pelletier et al., 2018</xref>). Intriguingly, both of these cell states are unusually sensitive to disruption of proteostasis. Erythroid differentiation is highly reliant on Hsp70 availability, as evidenced by the fact that Hsp70 sequestration can result in the anemic phenotype of beta-thalassemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arlet et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, cancer cells are sensitized to small molecules that dampen the proteostasis network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Joshi et al., 2018</xref>). In this work, we showed that exogenous activation of the Hsf1 regulon protects yeast from RPAS. Future studies should seek to determine whether an analogous strategy can therapeutically mitigate phenotypes of disrupted ribosome biogenesis in disease processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal <break/>anti-V5</td><td valign="bottom">Invitrogen</td><td>Invitrogen:R960-25; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2556564">AB_2556564</ext-link></td><td>1:2000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal <break/>anti-Pgk1</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Abcam:ab113687; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10861977">AB_10861977</ext-link></td><td>1:10,000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal <break/>anti-Rpb1</td><td>Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td valign="bottom">Santa Cruz:sc-25758; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_655813">AB_655813</ext-link></td><td>1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal <break/>anti-Hsp104</td><td>Enzo Life Sciences</td><td>Enzo:ADI-SPA-1040</td><td>1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal <break/>anti-Hsp70</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Abcam:ab5439; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_304888">AB_304888</ext-link></td><td>1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit monoclonal <break/>anti-phos-Rps6 <break/>(Ser235/236)</td><td>Cell Signaling Technology</td><td>Cell Signaling:4858; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_916156">AB_916156</ext-link></td><td>1:2000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal <break/>anti-phos-eIF2α (Ser51)</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>Invitrogen:44–728G; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2533736">AB_2533736</ext-link></td><td>1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>auxin (indole-3-acetic acid)</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich:I3750</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>diazaborine</td><td>Millipore Sigma</td><td>Millipore Sigma:530729</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>cycloheximide</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich:C4859</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>L-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich:A0760</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>diamide</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich:D3648</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>rapamycin</td><td>LC Labs</td><td>LC Labs:R-5000</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>beta-estradiol</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich:E2758</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strain construction and growth</title><p>Strains were constructed by standard transformation techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gietz and Schiestl, 2007</xref>).

Query strains (WT and deletions) expressing <italic>TDH3p-mCherry</italic> were co-cultured with a reference strain expressing <italic>TDH3p-YFP</italic>. All strains were inoculated from single colonies into liquid YPD and grown to saturation. Query and reference strains were mixed 1:1 (v:v) at a total dilution of 1/100 and grown for 6 hr to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.2–0.5. Co-cultured cells were diluted 1/10 to a final OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.02–0.05 in YPD alone or YPD with: 0.1% (v/v) DMSO (vehicle), 15 μg/mL DZA, 30 μg/mL DZA, or 5 mM AZC and grown at 30°C.

The culture was immediately split into two flasks (20 ml each), and one was treated with 20 μl 2 μM estradiol (final concentration 2 nM). Mock and estradiol-treated cultures were grown for 3 hr and then treated with DMSO (vehicle), 8 μg/ml DZA, or 2.5 mM AZC, grown for an additional 21 hr, and OD<sub>600</sub> measured. ‘Relative growth’ is the OD<sub>600</sub> for each condition relative to the mock (no estradiol), DMSO only control.

Evidence is presented that it is the accumulation of newly synthesized unassembled (orphan) ribosomal proteins (RPs), most likely in aggregates, that is the triggering event, which evokes a reduction in RP gene (RPG) expression and reduced translation independently of the TOR or Gcn2 signalling pathways. Apart from this, they show that ribosomal protein assembly stress (dubbed RPAS) evokes altered nuclear localization of an Hsp70 co-chaperone (Sis1) and a nucleolar marker (Cfl1) and altered cytoplasmic localization of chaperone Hsp104, from which they conclude that both nuclear and cytosolic proteostasis is disrupted. Consistent with the last conclusion, both Hsf1 and the transcription factor Rpn4, which induces proteasome formation, are required for growth per se (Hsf1) or cellular fitness in a growth competition assay (Rpn4) under conditions of RPAS. These findings are significant in revealing previously unknown cellular consequences of impairing ribosome biogenesis in yeast, including specific induction of the Hsf1 regulon (and not the stereotypical ESR), and in down-regulating translation independently of TOR/Gcn2. These findings are relevant to the cellular basis of ribosomopothies, and other stresses or disease states that disrupt ribosome biogenesis in mammals.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It was noted that previous results were published indicating that yeast and human cells degrade ribosomal proteins produced in excess, and that cells lacking this quality control mechanism contain aggregated ribosomal proteins (McShane et al., 2016; Sung et al., 2016a, 2016b). Hence, the most novel findings of the current paper involve the specific induction of the Hsf1 regulon (and not the stereotypical ESR), and the down-regulation of ribosomal protein mRNAs and bulk translation independently of TOR/Gcn2. As such, the reviewers feel that the results of these previous publications should be cited in the Introduction, and that additional experiments should be carried out to further elucidate the novel stress responses uncovered here, as follows:</p><p>- New experiments are likely required to investigate whether the specific induction of Hsf1, without eliciting the general environmental stress response, is triggered by accumulation of pre-ribosomes in the nucleolus/nucleus or only by the accumulation/aggregation of excess ribosomal proteins in the cytoplasm.</p><p>- It is also important to investigate whether the reduced expression of RPG mRNAs observed here is a common response to proteotoxic stress, e.g. induced by AZC, or rather is a more specific response to accumulation/aggregation of excess ribosomal proteins.</p><p>2) It was felt that because no evidence was provided for ribosomal over-production or aggregation in wild-type cells under conditions of high versus low ribosome production, the title of the paper, statement in the Abstract that ribosome assembly is a &quot;lynchpin of cellular homeostasis&quot;, and certain related statements in the Discussion appear to be overinterpretations. Either they should provide such evidence or revise the paper to correct these overstatements. Also, the Abstract should be modified to eliminate the claim that overproduction of rRNAs has been examined in this study.</p><p>All other comments raised by the reviewers should be addressed with suitable alterations of text, or an explanation as to why no alterations are required.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is a very well-designed, well-executed and interesting study showing that impairment of ribosome processing in budding yeast by various genetic and pharmacological interventions evokes induction of the Hsf1 regulon, without triggering the more general environmental stress response (ESR). Evidence is presented that it is the accumulation of newly synthesized unassembled (orphan) ribosomal proteins (RPs), most likely in aggregates, that is the triggering event, which evokes a reduction in RP gene (RPG) expression and reduced translation independently of the TOR or Gcn2 signalling pathways. (The mechanism for the latter response is left unresolved.) Apart from this, they show that ribosomal protein assembly stress (dubbed RPAS) evokes altered nuclear localization of an Hsp70 co-chaperone (Sis1) and a nucleolar marker (Cfl1) and altered cytoplasmic localization of chaperone Hsp104, from which they conclude that both nuclear and cytosolic proteostasis is disrupted. Consistent with the last conclusion, both Hsf1 and the transcription factor Rpn4, which induces proteasome formation, are required for growth per se (Hsf1) or cellular fitness in a growth competition assay (Rpn4) under conditions of RPAS.</p><p>These findings are significant in revealing previously unknown cellular consequences of impairing ribosome biogenesis in yeast, including specific induction of the Hsf1 regulon (and not the stereotypical ESR), and in down-regulating translation independently of TOR/Gcn2. These findings are relevant to the cellular basis of ribosomopothies, and other stresses or disease states that disrupt ribosome biogenesis in mammals. The experiments are generally incisive and the quality of the data is uniformly high. However, there are a few issues to be addressed concerning the evidence for a general induction of nuclear and cytoplasmic loss of proteostasis, which seems inadequate. Also, the notion that the process of ribosome biosynthesis is inherently susceptible to conferring loss of proteostasis and puts cells at risk at high growth rates is an interesting idea, but not really well enough established by data to serve as the title of the paper.</p><p>- In Figure 4D, owing to the reduced general translation in DZA-treated cells, only Rps26 shows accumulation in aggregates at levels higher than in the DMSO-treated control cells, meaning that only 1 of the five RPs tested in Figure 4B-F can be said to accumulate in aggregates in cells with impaired ribosome biogenesis. One wonders if this is sufficient to disrupt nuclear and cytosolic proteostasis. The latter is being inferred primarily by the relocalization of Sis1-YFP and Cfi1-mFate within the nucleus and Hsp104-Kate in the cytoplasm, but are these phenotypes incisive indicators of the disruption of nuclear and cytosolic proteostasis? Wouldn't assaying the activity of a protein that is prone to sequestration in aggregates of unfolded proteins greatly complement these cell biological phenotypes? In addition, one would like to see that these cellular phenotypes are also triggered by inducing RPAS genetically rather than pharmacologically, e.g. with the rat1-AID strain, and to know whether they are triggered by any other known inducers of proteotoxic stress, e.g. AZC, and if not why? It also seems important to determine whether the unfolded protein response is triggered by RPAS, which can be assayed with a reporter gene, which could potentially provide additional evidence for loss of cytoplasmic proteostasis.</p><p>- Discussion, first paragraph: They conclude that induction of proteotoxic stress by RPAS compromises other cellular processes, but what are they? Is the reduced expression of RPG mRNAs and reduced translation a common response to proteotoxic stress, e.g. is it induced by AZC, or is this a more specific regulatory response to decreased ribosome biogenesis capacity that is unrelated to proteotoxic stress? As indicated above, one would like to see evidence that some other cellular process commonly impaired by loss of proteostasis is compromised by DZA treatment to the same/similar degree as observed in response to AZC or heat-shock.</p><p>- The title of the paper and text in the first paragraph of the Discussion, describes the interesting notion that the high demands of proliferating cells for ribosomes puts them at risk of disrupting proteostasis. However, it's not clear that the data support this notion. Relatively low levels of certain unassembled RPs appears to be sufficient to induce Hsf1 (Figure 4D), and this might well occur at low levels of ribosome assembly on a relatively poor carbon or nitrogen source compared to glucose medium with plenty of nitrogen. Can they show that lower levels of DZA are sufficient to induce Hsf1 in cells growing in rich medium vs. poor medium where the rates of ribosome production markedly differ? If not, they should consider choosing a different, less provocative title for the paper that is captures the findings that are best established by the data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The results are interesting and I think that the conclusions are likely to be generally correct. The question of induction of Hsf1 etc. by pre-ribosome accumulation should be addressed. However, I expect that the authors will be able to satisfactorily argue this point.</p><p>Not sure about the title, which sounds striking but actually seems a bit tangential to the topic of the paper.</p><p>The authors report that accumulation of ribosomal proteins in excess of the requirements for ribosome production is toxic through aggregation. The conclusions are of interest and the manuscript is suitable for <italic>eLife</italic> if suitable revised.</p><p>1) Figure 5: It might have been anticipated that RPs synthesized in excess of their escortins, would accumulate in the cytoplasm. DZA treatment blocks a late step in 60S subunit synthesis and it seems possible that the altered nuclear localization of co-chaparones reflects association with defective pre-ribosomes. This raises the question of whether the defects induced by ribosome synthesis inhibition primarily reflect RP or pre-ribosome accumulation. This concern should be addressed more explicitly in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Tye et al. studied the effects of perturbations of ribosome protein and RNA levels on protein homeostasis. They determined that disruption of the formation of properly assembled ribosomes leads to activation of the heat shock response (HSR). This was determined to be likely due to aggregation of ribosomal proteins (r-proteins). Additionally, the effect of r-protein aggregation on cellular fitness was exacerbated by proteasome impairment.</p><p>The paper does a good job of demonstrating that having excess r-proteins unable to form proper ribosomes will aggregate and induce the HSR. Several major conclusions of the paper, however, are not supported in the data. The title states that there is a &quot;risk-reward tradeoff of high ribosome production,&quot; yet provides no evidence that high ribosome production leads to an excess of r-proteins or the associated stress described in the paper. The Abstract states that &quot;imbalances in synthesis&quot; between the r-proteins and rRNAs leads to a compromise of proteostasis. However, it is explicitly an overproduction of r-proteins (and not rRNAs) that leads to HSR activation. This is less novel, as it has been demonstrated (as noted in the paper for mitochondrial complexes) that imbalances in protein complex stoichiometry will often lead to misfolded protein and therefore a stress response. The only conditions in which the described stress is seen is in conditions of artificially limiting rRNA levels or artificially disrupting complex formation. Given that there is no evidence of r-protein overproduction occurring during high ribosomal production (as stated in the title) or in any stress condition beyond specific disruption of ribosomes, it is an overreach to call ribosome assembly a &quot;lynchpin of cellular homeostasis&quot; (as stated in the Abstract).</p><p>The central premise that cells must balance the reward of high ribosome production with the risk of aggregation of excess r-proteins is intriguing, however it is critical to show that this stress exists in conditions beyond the specific case of directly manipulating ribosome stoichiometry or assembly. Specifically, the authors must show that this stress occurs under conditions of high ribosome production (or too-high ribosome production) and is alleviated when ribosome production drops. This would show the tradeoff between high ribosome production and proteotoxic stress implied by the title. In current form, the scope of the data is limited to a thorough and convincing demonstration that excess r-proteins will aggregate and activate Hsf1 if not properly assembled into ribosomes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43002.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It was noted that previous results were published indicating that yeast and human cells degrade ribosomal proteins produced in excess, and that cells lacking this quality control mechanism contain aggregated ribosomal proteins (McShane et al., 2016; Sung et al., 2016a, 2016b).

Comparing the band intensities of the pellet across samples is not informative.</p><p>To supplement these data, we now include new experiments to obtain a broader understanding of how RPAS disrupts proteostasis. As described above in “Essential Revisions”, we applied quantitative proteomics to analyze aggregates from DZA-treated cells to obtain an unbiased view of which proteins aggregate in their wild-type form. These experiments reveal that r-proteins as a whole are enriched in the pellet after DZA treatment (see Figure 4G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The latter is being inferred primarily by the relocalization of Sis1-YFP and Cfi1-mFate within the nucleus and Hsp104-Kate in the cytoplasm, but are these phenotypes incisive indicators of the disruption of nuclear and cytosolic proteostasis?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. Hsp104 functions in protein disaggregation at cytosolic quality control (Q-) bodies and insoluble protein deposits (IPOD), and is widely used as a marker for all types of protein aggregation under many conditions of proteotoxic stress (Glover and Lindquist, 1998; Tkach and Glover, 2004; Kaganovich, Kopito and Frydman, 2008; Zhou et al., Cell, 2014). The Hsp70 co-chaperone Sis1 functions in clearing misfolded proteins that accumulate in the nucleus at subnuclear bodies termed the intranuclear quality control compartment (INQ) (Summers et al., 2013; Park et al., 2013; Hill, Hanzen and Nystrom, 2017). Furthermore, relocalization of Sis1 to subnuclear sites under proteotoxic stressors such as heat shock has been previously reported (Malinovska et al., MBoC, 2012).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Wouldn't assaying the activity of a protein that is prone to sequestration in aggregates of unfolded proteins greatly complement these cell biological phenotypes?</p></disp-quote><p>The cell biological phenotypes we observe by microscopy are now corroborated by new data.

Our data demonstrate that protein homeostasis is disrupted at levels that mirror perturbations such as heat, oxidative stress, or AZC; Hsf1 activation level and markers like Hsp104 foci formation are comparable for RPAS and other stresses.
