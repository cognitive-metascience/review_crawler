of particular interest as targets to enhance neuronal repair, but few have yet been identified. Planarians can regenerate their entire CNS using pluripotent adult stem cells, and this process is robustly regulated to ensure that new neurons are produced in proper abundance. Using a high-throughput pipeline to quantify brain chemosensory neurons, we identify the conserved tyrosine kinase <italic>tec-1</italic> as a negative regulator of planarian neuronal regeneration. <italic>tec-1</italic>RNAi increased the abundance of several CNS and PNS neuron subtypes regenerated or maintained through homeostasis, without affecting body patterning or non-neural cells. Experiments using TUNEL, BrdU, progenitor labeling, and stem cell elimination during regeneration indicate <italic>tec-1</italic> limits the survival of newly differentiated neurons. In vertebrates, the Tec kinase family has been studied extensively for roles in immune function, and our results identify a novel role for <italic>tec-1</italic> as negative regulator of planarian adult neurogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>S. mediterranea</italic></kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>cell death</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01GM129339</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petersen</surname><given-names>Christian P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PGSD3-471547-2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bonar</surname><given-names>Nicolle A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM130835</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petersen</surname><given-names>Christian P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>RNAi screening in planarians finds that inhibition of the TEC-family protein tyrosine kinase <italic>tec-1</italic> increases the regeneration of neurons through enhancement of cell survival.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The capacity for adult neural repair varies across animals and bears a relationship to the extent of adult neurogenesis in the absence of injury. Adult neural proliferation is absent in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and rare in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, leaving axon repair as a primary mechanism for healing damage to the CNS and PNS. Mammals undergo adult neurogenesis throughout life, but it is limited to particular brain regions and declines with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tanaka and Ferretti, 2009</xref>). By contrast, select organisms can undergo more extreme neural repair and also typically undergo more extensive ongoing neural differentiation through adulthood. Axolotls and zebrafish are able to repair extensive damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tanaka and Ferretti, 2009</xref>), while organisms such as planarians and hydra are able to regenerate an entirely new brain through whole-body regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tanaka and Reddien, 2011</xref>). Based on identification of similar mechanisms of regeneration from the distantly related planarians and acoels, whole body regeneration has been proposed to be an ancestral feature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gehrke and Srivastava, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Reddien, 2018</xref>). Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of adult neurogenesis could therefore reveal methods to enhance neural repair across species. In particular, specific negative regulators of neurogenesis would be important targets for repair enhancement, but few have yet been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">He and Jin, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The planarian <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> undergoes complete brain regeneration within 1–2 weeks after injury and also perpetual homeostatic replacement of brain tissue, making this species an ideal model to identify such factors. The planarian brain is composed of an anterior bi-lobed cephalic ganglia with axon-rich neuropils containing interneurons and glia, as well as lateral branches with chemosensory, mechanosensory, and other neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agata et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mineta et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nakazawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Roberts-Galbraith et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Two ventral nerve cords relay signals to the body through a peripheral nervous system, with many neuron subtypes, including serotonergic, GABAergic, dopaminergic, octopaminergic, cholinergic, and glutaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nishimura et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nishimura et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cebrià, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nishimura et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nishimura et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nishimura et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, planarian cell atlas projects recently revealed the existence of ~50 distinct types of neurons, pointing to considerable complexity of regulation for producing and maintaining neurons through ongoing differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fincher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Plass et al., 2018</xref>). Planarian tissues are maintained and regenerated by <italic>piwi-1+</italic> neoblast stem cells, a mesenchymal cell population found in a parenchymal region and constituting the animal’s only proliferative cells. Transcriptional profiling and candidate approaches have identified subpopulations of neoblasts specified for participation in distinct tissue lineages including a subpopulation of TSPN+ neoblasts that can give rise to all cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lapan and Reddien, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cowles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cowles et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Scimone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>). Neural progenitors have been identified as neoblast subpopulations expressing either pro-neurogenic transcription factors or transcription factors expressed in unique differentiated neurons, and some have been assigned to particular lineages through RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Molinaro and Pearson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fincher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Plass et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ross et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, neoblasts and their differentiating progeny sustain ongoing neurogenesis in the absence of injury as well as in regeneration of a new head.</p><p>Brain regeneration in planarians is a robust process that always ensures a proper restoration of relative neuron abundance in the animal. Decapitation triggers waves of wound-induced signals, bursts of proliferation, a patterning process to sense missing tissues, and differentiation of new tissues within an outgrowing blastema. Planarians do not grow appreciably as they regenerate, so the end of regeneration is characterized by a return to uninjured cell and tissue proportionality with respect to body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oviedo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hill and Petersen, 2015</xref>). In addition, the regeneration process involves re-scaling and integrating pre-existing tissues with new tissues. For example, regenerating head fragments reduce the size of their brain while they form a small tail blastema until they reach appropriate proportionality. The robustness of the regeneration process suggests first that the system is well suited for identifying subtle phenotypes affecting adult neurogenesis. Secondly, the planarian’s ability to attain and maintain a predictable relative abundance of neurons suggests the process is under both positive and negative control.</p><p>We report here the identification of a Tec non-receptor tyrosine kinase gene through RNAi screening in planarians that limits neuron abundance in regeneration and homeostatic tissue maintenance. Analysis of <italic>tec-1</italic>’s mechanism of action reveals it is unlikely to control the process of differentiation, but instead negatively regulates neuron survival. These results suggest that like neural development, both regeneration and stem-cell dependent adult neurogenesis both involve an initial overproduction of new neurons and identify a new factor involved in limiting the specific amplification of cells produced by adult neurogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>tec-1</italic> limits the regeneration of brain neurons</title><p>To identify negative regulators of neuronal regeneration in planarians, we conducted an RNAi screen of ~50 kinases and receptors with expression enriched in neoblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In order to quantitatively measure effects on neuronal regeneration, we used a histological assay for staining and enumerating chemosensory neurons of the brain expressing the <italic>cintillo</italic> gene homologous to the Degenerin superfamily of sodium channels (<italic>cto</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>cto</italic>-expressing neurons are arranged in a stereotyped pattern in close proximity to the lateral brain branches, and their numbers scale with overall animal and brain size. Because these cells adopt a planar and well-spread configuration, quantification of whole animal <italic>cto</italic> cell number through automated image segmentation is straightforward and robust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oviedo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hill and Petersen, 2015</xref>). Decapitated animals which initially lack <italic>cto</italic>+ cells regenerate them as they form a new head until an appropriate ratio of <italic>cto</italic>+ cells to body size is attained. We treated animals with dsRNA and amputated to produce head, tail, and trunk fragments that were fixed and stained in 96-well mesh plates after regeneration. In order to maximize the effects of RNAi, regenerating trunk fragments were amputated again and scored for their ability to regenerate <italic>cto+</italic> cells after the second round of regeneration, whereas tail and head fragments were only fixed and scored after a single round of regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Reddien et al., 2005</xref>). After imaging, numbers of <italic>cto+</italic> cells and total animal area were measured using a CellProfiler pipeline, and differences in relative <italic>cto</italic>+ cell regeneration due to RNAi treatment were determined by computing a normalized log2-fold change ratio as compared to groups treated with a non-targeting dsRNA (<italic>C. elegans unc-22</italic>). Treatment with a positive control dsRNA targeting <italic>ndk</italic>, a factor that restricts head regionalization in planarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cebrià et al., 2002</xref>), produced increased numbers of <italic>cto</italic>+ cells in the screen. The screen identified four genes whose inhibition reduced numbers of <italic>cto</italic>+ cells attained through regeneration (log2FC &lt; −1 and padj &lt;0.05), though several other treatments caused smaller <italic>cto+ </italic>cell decreases that did not meet the false-discovery corrected statistical cut-off (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Because these factors could either be required for expression of <italic>cto</italic> in mature neurons, be required for differentiation from neural progenitors, or be required for maintenance of neoblasts in general, we did not pursue any further analysis of them here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>An RNAi screen identifies regulators of neuronal regeneration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Design of RNAi screen.

To verify these effects, we inhibited <italic>tec-1</italic> in a similar design as the screen but with an increased sample size. These experiments confirmed that inhibition of the Tec homolog resulted in a robust ~50–100% increase to the number of <italic>cto</italic>+ cell numbers, which had approximately normal spatial distribution in the animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). <italic>tec-1</italic> knockdown led to an increase in <italic>cto</italic>+ cell number both in decapitated animals regenerating an entirely new head and also in head fragments undergoing tissue remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This increase in relative <italic>cto+</italic> cell abundance was not due to a change in overall animal size, but rather to an increase in absolute numbers of <italic>cto+</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Regeneration of head and tail fragments involves extensive stem cell-dependent production of new brain neurons and control of the rates of cell death, as well as injury-induced signals that initiate the process. Uninjured planarians undergo perpetual homeostatic regeneration of all cell types, including neurons of the brain, but lack expression of injury induced factors. In order to test whether <italic>tec-1</italic>’s function depended on wound signaling, we fed animals <italic>tec-1</italic> dsRNA for 60 days in the absence of injury and found that <italic>cto</italic>+ cell number increased to a similar extent as in amputated fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Therefore, <italic>tec-1</italic> functions to limit numbers of neurons independent of injury signaling.</p><p>To examine a possible redundancy of function, we scanned the <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> genome and transcriptome and identified a second Tec family kinase, which we named <italic>tec-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Therefore, <italic>tec-2</italic> likely does not act redundantly with <italic>tec-1</italic> for control of <italic>cto+</italic> cell abundance.</p><p>RNAi phenotypes that modify body patterning (such as <italic>nou darake</italic> RNAi) can result in production of excess <italic>cto+</italic> cells as a consequence of axis transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gurley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Iglesias et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Petersen and Reddien, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lander and Petersen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Scimone et al., 2016</xref>), so we tested whether <italic>tec-1</italic> could operate similarly. Whereas <italic>ndk</italic> inhibition increased <italic>cto</italic>+ cell number concomitant with increasing the size of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cebrià et al., 2002</xref>), <italic>tec-1</italic> inhibition did not alter brain size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

We chose to investigate regenerating head fragments undergoing brain remodeling because <italic>tec-1</italic> inhibition caused a rapid attainment of excess neurons compared to control animals, so we reasoned these fragments would provide a context in which <italic>tec-1</italic>-dependent regulation is prominent. Neoblasts are the only proliferative cells in adult planarians, so a pulse of BrdU initially marks these cells, followed by labeling their newly-born post-mitotic descendants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Newmark and Sánchez Alvarado, 2000</xref>). In order to measure rates of neuron production, we soaked animals with BrdU earlier on same the day of amputation (d0) or at 2 or 4 days after amputations to generate head fragments, then fixed the animals at 6, 8, 10 and 12 days post-amputation in order to detect BrdU incorporation into new mature neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We chose to analyze BrdU incorporation into <italic>ppl-1+</italic> brain neurons because they are under robust control by <italic>tec-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and they are more numerous than cell types such as <italic>cto+</italic> or <italic>gad</italic>+ neurons, thus maximizing the ability to detect any influence of <italic>tec-1</italic> on neuron differentiation given possible inefficiencies in BrdU label uptake. However, numbers of <italic>ppl-1</italic>+BrdU+ cells were not significantly different in control versus <italic>tec-1(RNAi)</italic> animals over a range of timepoints of BrdU pulsing and fixation in regeneration. These data indicate that <italic>tec-1</italic> inhibition can increase numbers of neurons without modifying rates of differentiation, pointing instead to a function in controlling neuron survival.</p><p>A model in which <italic>tec-1</italic> controls neuronal survival would predict that <italic>tec-1</italic> does not influence the abundance of neural progenitor cells that are the intermediates between pluripotent neoblast stem cells and differentiated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). <italic>coe</italic> encodes a transcription factor expressed in a subpopulation of <italic>piwi-1+</italic> neoblasts as well as in a variety of differentiated neurons, and its inhibition reduces the abundance of several types of neurons, including <italic>gad</italic>+ and <italic>cto</italic>+ neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cowles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cowles et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>tec-1</italic> inhibition did not alter numbers of <italic>coe+piwi-1</italic>+ cells in a timeseries between 2 and 12 days of head regeneration, despite detection of an overall decreasing abundance of such progenitors in both control and <italic>tec-1(RNAi)</italic> animals over time as regeneration proceeds. To confirm these observations, we examined a subpopulation of <italic>piwi-1+</italic> neoblasts expressing the proneural transcription factor <italic>pax6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Scimone et al., 2014</xref>) and found that its abundance was also unaltered by <italic>tec-1</italic> inhibition in the same time period. <italic>coe</italic> and <italic>pax6</italic> mark broad classes of neural progenitors, so we also sought to test the abundance of neural progenitors that produce individual neural cell types. <italic>pitx</italic> transcription factor is required for production of <italic>sert</italic>+ serotonergic neurons and <italic>pitx</italic> is expressed within a <italic>piwi-1+</italic> neoblast subpopulation proposed to be the progenitors for these cells. Although <italic>tec-1</italic> inhibition increased the abundance of <italic>sert</italic>+ neurons in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), <italic>tec-1</italic> RNAi did not alter numbers of <italic>pitx+piwi-1</italic>+ serotonergic neuron progenitors near the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>We next examined <italic>tec-1</italic> expression by double-FISH to determine whether this gene could be expressed preferentially within neurons, neural progenitors, or other cell types.

The requirement of <italic>tec-1</italic> under conditions of both homeostasis and regeneration would then suggest that, as in embryonic development in other organisms, regenerated brain neurons in planarians undergo an initial overproduction followed by rapid cell death. The regeneration of a new head in decapitated animals represented a condition in which we reasoned this phenomenon would be most easily detected, because in that context the new production of brain neurons is synchronized by amputation. However, detailed time course analysis of new neuron production in such animals has not yet identified such overproduction, suggesting that ongoing neuron production during the ~1–2 weeks of head regeneration might mask these effects. Therefore, we sought a means to isolate the fates of a limited cohort of neurons produced only within a narrow time window after amputation. To do this, we used lethal irradiation early during head regeneration to eliminate neoblasts acutely, followed by a timeseries of fixation and staining, to measure the survival of a cohort of neurons produced only within in a specific time frame. After <italic>tec-1</italic> inhibition and head amputation, planarian fragments were irradiated 6 days later then fixed in a time series in the absence of proliferating cells.

Future work delineating <italic>tec-1</italic> signaling targets could clarify this aspect of <italic>tec-1’s</italic> anti-survival function.</p><p>Tec family kinases (TFKs) are non-receptor tyrosine kinases similar to Src family kinases. TFKs are perhaps best known for signaling downstream of antigen receptors in hematopoietic differentiation and lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rickert, 2013</xref>). However, they are also involved in a wide variety of signaling pathways downstream of GPCRs, integrins, and both receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases, and are known to regulate apoptosis, cell adhesion, and the actin cytoskeleton in addition to differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Takesono et al., 2002</xref>). In mammals, a majority of studies have found that Tec kinases such as BTK are essential for the survival or proliferation of immune cells, including phagocytic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Takesono et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jongstra-Bilen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Melcher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Palmer et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that planarian <italic>tec-1</italic> might not act cell autonomously within neurons to promote death. Alternatively, in some contexts, Tec kinases have been reported to function as cell autonomous tumor suppressor genes that promote p53-mediated cell death pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rada et al., 2018</xref>). Within the mammalian brain, chemical inhibition of the Tec-family kinase BTK increased brain cell survival after ischemic brain injury, an effect attributed to the modification of macrophage activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ito et al., 2015</xref>). It is possible that Tec kinases could regulate conserved functions in adult neurogenesis to control of neuron abundance in other organisms.</p><p>The requirement for <italic>tec-1</italic> for neuron suppression in regeneration and homeostasis in planarians additionally suggests that developmental cell death of neurons might be a common feature of adult neurogenesis across species. Cell death is extensively used throughout the animal kingdom to sculpt the developing nervous system, from nematodes to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yamaguchi and Miura, 2015</xref>). Among well-studied invertebrates, adult neurogenesis has been detected in <italic>Drosophila</italic> within the medulla cortex, where it can also mediate injury repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernández-Hernández et al., 2013</xref>). However, the bulk of neurogenesis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> occurs at embryonic or larval stages prior to adulthood, so the precise roles of cell death for adult neurogenesis and ways they may be conserved across distant phyla have yet to be fully elucidated. Based on TUNEL staining and the observation that mouse mutants defective for cell death in the nervous system overproduce neurons in multiple regions of the brain, developmental cell death of neurons is integral to adult neurogenesis in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biebl et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Winner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sun et al., 2004</xref>), and cell death after differentiation has been confirmed through direct observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pilz et al., 2018</xref>). Regulation of cell death at the level of neural progenitors may control brain morphology by preventing hyperplasia or may define where crucial morphogenic signals are expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haydar et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nonomura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yamaguchi and Miura, 2015</xref>), while regulation of the survival of newly formed neurons has been proposed to provide mechanisms to ensure proper connectivity or limit interneuron cell number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Southwell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dekkers et al., 2013</xref>). During brain development, preventing neurotransmitter secretion results in assembly of a mostly normal brain followed by massive neuronal apoptosis, suggesting that regulated cell death plays a role in the maturation of newly-differentiated neurons during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Verhage et al., 2000</xref>). Reliance on neurotransmitter signaling to promote survival of immature neurons is also used extensively in murine adult neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Petreanu and Alvarez-Buylla, 2002</xref>), among other cell-type specific mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pfisterer and Khodosevich, 2017</xref>). Many of these pathways converge on promoting survival through BCL2 family members, while death is promoted by Bax and Bak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Motoyama et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shindler et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sun et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Savitt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nakamura et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, inhibitors of core cell death pathways have been proposed as therapeutic agents to assist in damage repair after brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Degterev et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Loane and Faden, 2010</xref>), though these would be expected to have substantial effects on other organ systems. If the ability of Tec kinases to limit neuron production ultimately proves to be conserved, they would be potential targets for enhancing neural repair in other species.</p><p>The identification of negative regulators of neurogenesis may be an important step in understanding neural regeneration in planarians and other systems. Suppressors of mTOR and JAK/STAT signaling in vertebrates can be inhibited to increase axon growth after spinal cord injury in laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Park et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sun et al., 2011</xref>).

Additionally, while canonical Wnt signaling appears to promote neural regeneration in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Strand et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Patel et al., 2017</xref>), non-canonical Wnt signaling inhibits axon guidance and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Onishi et al., 2014</xref>). A more complete understanding of negative inputs into adult tissue homeostasis could provide new and more specific targets for the enhancement of neural tissue repair or treatment of degenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Trounson and McDonald, 2015</xref>). Our results suggest that planarians, which undergo extensive homeostasis of the CNS in adulthood, can be a model for efficiently identifying such negative regulators of adult neurogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Tec-1</td><td valign="top">Planmine</td><td valign="top">dd_Smed_v6_4818_0_1</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Polyclonal rabbit anti-digoxigenin-POD, Fab fragments</td><td valign="top">Sigma/Roche</td><td valign="top"># 11207733910 <break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_514500">AB_514500</ext-link></td><td valign="top">1:2000 dilution</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Polyclonal rabbit anti-fluorescein-POD, Fab fragments</td><td valign="top">Sigma/Roche</td><td valign="top">#11426346910 <break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_840257">AB_840257</ext-link></td><td valign="top">1:2000 dilution</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Polyclonal rabbit digoxigenin-AP</td><td valign="top">Sigma/Roche</td><td valign="top">#11093274910</td><td valign="top">1:4000 dilution</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rat polyclonal Anti-BrdU</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">6326</td><td valign="top">1:1000 dilution</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-ser10 Histone H3</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling</td><td valign="top">D2C8</td><td valign="top">1:3000 dilution</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse monoclonal anti-TUBULIN-ALPHA AB-2</td><td valign="top">Thermo/Fisher</td><td valign="top">MS581P1</td><td valign="top">1:1000 dilution</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">TUNEL labeling kit</td><td valign="top">Thermo/Fisher</td><td valign="top">EP0162</td><td valign="top">N/A</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Goat polyclonal anti-rat HRP</td><td valign="top">Jackson ImmunoResearch</td><td valign="top">112-036-072</td><td valign="top">1:1000 dilution</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Planarian culture</title><p>Asexual strain CIW4 of the planarian <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> were maintained in 1 × Montjuic salts at 19°C as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Petersen and Reddien, 2011</xref>).

Head and tail fragments were fixed at 23 days following amputation (‘A-score’ heads and tails), while trunk fragments were fed again at d10 and amputated to remove heads and tails then regenerating trunk fragments were fixed 12 days later (‘B score’ trunks). Fixations, fluorescence in situ hybridizations, and Hoechst stainings to detect <italic>cto</italic> expression were carried out as described previously but in 96-well mesh-bottomed plates (Milipore Multiscreen Plates, MANMN4010) incubating in either Multiscreen receiver plates or rectangular 1-well dishes (VWR 73521–420). Stained animals were mounted and imaged at 40x using a fluorescence dissecting microscope to obtain a view of <italic>cto</italic> expression within the head and also at 25x to obtain a Hoechst-stained view of the entire fragment. A CellProfiler pipeline for automated image analysis was developed to quantify numbers of <italic>cto</italic>+ cells and also to measure area of the fragment as detected by Hoechst staining. Automated cell counting was optimized by adjusting the fixed detection threshold and object size range. Processed images were manually inspected for proper segmentation and scored manually in the event of visible errors in automated counting. Numbers of <italic>cto</italic>+ cells scale with animal length, so we normalized <italic>cto</italic> cell number to the square root of animal area as an approximate of animal length. Log2-fold change of normalized <italic>cto</italic> cell number was computed for each specimen by comparison to the average of control RNAi treatments, and these values for all fragment types (A-score heads and tails, B-score trunks), were binned and plotted in R using ggplot2. T-tests comparing area-normalized <italic>cto</italic>+ cell numbers between each RNAi condition and RNAi controls were adjusted for false discovery using the Benjamini-Hochberg method as implemented in R.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Phylogenetic analysis</title><p>Protein sequences were aligned using MUSCLE with default settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chojnacki et al., 2017</xref>).

Through an RNAi screen that includes a focal set of kinases, authors noticed that knockdown of <italic>tec-1</italic> increased the abundance of several types of neurons in the planarian brain during regeneration and homeostasis. Follow-up experiments suggested that <italic>tec-1</italic> functions through facilitating neuronal cell death rather than controlling neuronal differentiation, although the exact molecular mechanism remains unknown. This work presents an intriguing example of negative regulation of neurogenesis, particularly considering the broad conservation of Tec kinases.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In order to consider this manuscript further, several major issues in terms of the phenotype and interpretation need to be addressed. These are:</p><p>1) The expression of <italic>tec-1</italic> is unclear. While the cell atlas suggests it is broadly expressed and perhaps concentrated in the neuronal progenitors, where is it expressed during regeneration? Does the expression pattern change throughout the regeneration time course? This information is essential, as it should inform the interpretation of phenotypes in terms of whether <italic>tec-1</italic> functions autonomously or non-autonomously. Is <italic>tec-1</italic> co-expressed with any of the neuronal or progenitor types looked at in the paper? Or is it co-expressed with macrophage/phagocytic markers? If FISH is challenging in whole-mount, it is worth trying in sections and dissociated cells.</p><p>2) Control and <italic>tec-1</italic>RNAi animals were compared in terms of differences in differentiation 8 days upon amputation. A BrdU pulse was delivered on day 2 to capture to trace the progeny of cells that were in S phase during the pulse (the duration of this pulse is not specified but should be). The result of this experiment is clear – no significant difference in the number of BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the ppl+ cell population (which was affected in <italic>tec-1</italic>RNAi much like <italic>cto+</italic> cells). While this work supports the conclusion that <italic>tec-1</italic>RNAi does not affect differentiation of cells in S-phase on day 2, it does not rule out differences in differentiation that may occur prior to or later than this time point. The numbers of progenitors marked by coe, pax6, and pitx were only compared 8 days post amputation, which also does not eliminate the idea that differentiation might be affected by <italic>tec-1</italic> at other time points. Is it known that commitment to differentiated fates only begins on day 2 and that differentiation commitment later than day 2 does not contribute to fully differentiated cell types in a significant way? Or that differentiation rates are constant over time as the worms regenerate? Could the original observation that <italic>tec-1</italic>RNAi animals show larger numbers of <italic>cto+</italic> cells later in regeneration be explained by really early (before day 2) differences?</p><p>3) Does <italic>tec-1</italic> function similarly during regeneration and homeostasis? In Figure 4A, the difference between control and <italic>tec-1</italic>RNAi increases over time, suggesting more neurons should be removed as regeneration progresses. But the system has to reach a steady state eventually, but there is no data showing this. How and when might the steady state be reached in this case? Is it possible that <italic>tec-1</italic>RNAi animals just have a delayed peak of neuronal deaths? In this case, the steady states may be similar between control and RNAi. The comparison of neurons between control and RNAi conditions should be performed after the system reaches a steady state.</p><p>4) In the <italic>tec-1</italic>RNAi the numbers of many neuronal cell types go up, in particular in the brain region, but the size of the brain doesn't change. It is clearly visible in the staining that the density of the evaluated neuronal cell types is increased. But how does this work? Is the general cell density in the brain region higher? Are the cells smaller? Or are there compensatory losses of other cell types in the region? Could the detected loss in glial cells be sufficient to compensate?</p><p>5) The authors state that there are no changes in polarity or global patterning genes, but Figure 2B shows a clear increase in the number of notum-expressing cells, and Figure 3B clearly shows disorganized photoreceptors. This suggests that there are definitely some – possibly subtle – changes in anterior organization. It would be very interesting to understand whether the change in notum levels could induce this change in responsiveness to apoptotic signals. In addition, there have been some indications that apoptosis is not constant along the A-P axis (e.g. Peiris et al., 2016), and it would be worth taking into consideration whether this might explain some of the observed phenotype.</p><p>6) Is there an anterior bias in the detected neuronal cell increase? Most of the neuronal cell types are evaluated in the anterior region. Only the bottom panel in Figure 3A shows a change in a more posterior region. Are the effects mostly detected in the anterior, or are neuronal cell increases in the posterior just as strong?</p><p>7) Is it possible that <italic>tec-1</italic>RNAi causes a prolonged differentiation? There is a caveat in terms of Figure 4C showing <italic>tec-1</italic>'s disinvolvement with rate of neuronal differentiation. The regenerating tail fragments were examined at day 8 post-amputation, at which point Figure 4A suggests has only a slight increase in neuronal abundance and thus is statistically unlikely to be noticeable at this stage within a smaller subset of neuronal types. A different time point may address the possibility of delayed differentiation.</p><p>8) The phenotype should be characterized and discussed with greater depth. Do the ratios between different neuronal types change? This can be assayed with double FISH. If the ratios have changed, how should we understand the activity of <italic>tec-1</italic> in different neuronal populations? Are there any neuronal types within the CNS or PNS that reduce in numbers or are not affected after RNAi? Neuronal types unaffected by <italic>tec-1</italic> may bring important insights and hypotheses. Readers would appreciate the authors' insights to these questions. If all neuronal types increase in numbers within a constant brain size, it might suggest that the neurons must reduce their sizes as they experience a cellular overcrowding effect. Is this effect measurable (e.g., through nucleus-nucleus distance)? Are the changes in number density and cell size consistent? The authors have shown that glial cell number mildly decreases, which is very interesting, but is this change enough to compensate the increase of all neurons? How should we interpret this result – is it explained by the hypothesis of a distinct cell population killing neurons, or might this have any basis in a potential differentiation pathway?</p><p>9) The choice of timing for the irradiation experiment needs to be explained as well. This experiment shows that in the absence of new cell production, <italic>tec-1</italic>RNAi animals continue to expand numbers of <italic>cto+</italic> cells, whereas control RNAi animals show a decrease in <italic>cto+</italic> cells at day 12 relative to day 10. However, Figure 4B showed a statistically significant different in <italic>cto+</italic> cells between control and <italic>tec-1</italic> RNAi animals on day 10 (which was also detectable as significant on day 8). If differentiation is not a source of <italic>cto+</italic> differences between control and <italic>tec-1</italic>RNAi animals, one would expect the differences to be the same upon elimination of the contribution of new cells (at least at day 8). What explains the non-significant differences at day 8 and 10 in Figure 5B? Do the results argue that both differentiation and cell survival are affected?</p><p>10) The authors report that Tec kinases are known to control inflammation and recovery following traumatic brain injury by regulating macrophages, which does not directly imply that Tec kinase homologs regulate neuronal cell numbers via controlling their survival. Therefore, the next statement (“We suggest that Tec kinases could regulate specific and perhaps conserved functions in adult neurogenesis process in control of neuron abundance”) is not well-supported. There are no data presented that enable the proposal of a putative conserved function for <italic>tec-1</italic>. The authors' finding that planarian regeneration involves overproduction of neural cells followed by cell death bears overall similarity to the mechanisms of vertebrate development where cell death plays a major role in shaping the nervous system. However, given the lack of demonstrated similarity of function of the ortholog of <italic>tec-1</italic> in neural development in vertebrates, the claims of <italic>tec-1</italic> being a promising new target for therapeutic interventions are premature.</p><p>11) Finally, the finding of increased density of glial cells in <italic>tec-1</italic>RNAi is interesting, and the authors should discuss if this could be suggestive of <italic>tec-1</italic> being involved in a fate choice – could glial cells and <italic>cto+</italic> cells be differentiating from a shared progenitor population?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47293.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In order to consider this manuscript further, several major issues in terms of the phenotype and interpretation need to be addressed.

Indeed, in confirmation of the scRNAseq data, we find <italic>tec-1</italic> FISH signal to be broadly distributed, with co-expression analysis confirming expression in several different neurons, <italic>piwi-1+</italic> cells, and glia (Figure 4—figure supplement 3). We also examine overall <italic>tec-1</italic> expression during regeneration (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) and find it is also broadly expressed during regeneration with no obvious injury-induced expression behavior. The broadness of expression implies that we cannot at present rule out the possibility of <italic>tec-1</italic> acting within either neural progenitors, differentiated neurons, or some other cell type to exert its function on neuron numbers, and we clarify this interpretation in the text (Discussion paragraph three).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Control and tec-1 RNAi animals were compared in terms of differences in differentiation 8 days upon amputation. A BrdU pulse was delivered on day 2 to capture to trace the progeny of cells that were in S phase during the pulse (the duration of this pulse is not specified but should be). The result of this experiment is clear – no significant difference in the number of BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the ppl+ cell population (which was affected in tec-1 RNAi much like cto+ cells). While this work supports the conclusion that tec-1 RNAi does not affect differentiation of cells in S-phase on day 2, it does not rule out differences in differentiation that may occur prior to or later than this time point. The numbers of progenitors marked by coe, pax6, and pitx were only compared 8 days post amputation, which also does not eliminate the idea that differentiation might be affected by tec-1 at other time points. Is it known that commitment to differentiated fates only begins on day 2 and that differentiation commitment later than day 2 does not contribute to fully differentiated cell types in a significant way?

Could the original observation that tec-1 RNAi animals show larger numbers of cto+ cells later in regeneration be explained by really early (before day 2) differences?</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated the BrdU experiment by adding multiple time points for BrdU soaking and animal fixation during regeneration in Figure 4B (all combinations of soaking at day 0, 2, 4 and fixing at regeneration day 6, 8, 10, 12). These experiments did not find any differences between numbers of BrdU+<italic>ppl-1</italic>+ cells across all timepoints of regeneration or soaking tested. To support these conclusions, we also conducted an expanded neural progenitor counting experiments across a large range of timepoints in regeneration (Figure 4C), and confirm that we could not detect any excess rates of differentiation in <italic>tec-1</italic>RNAi animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Does tec-1 function similarly during regeneration and homeostasis? In Figure 4A, the difference between control and tec-1 RNAi increases over time, suggesting more neurons should be removed as regeneration progresses. But the system has to reach a steady state eventually, but there is no data showing this. How and when might the steady state be reached in this case? Is it possible that tec-1 RNAi animals just have a delayed peak of neuronal deaths? In this case, the steady states may be similar between control and RNAi. The comparison of neurons between control and RNAi conditions should be performed after the system reaches a steady state.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include a longer time course showing that the steady state is reached by day 14 and the phenotype persisted through at least 28 days of regeneration (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Based on observing similar overall phenotypes in regeneration or homeostasis assays, we suggest <italic>tec-1</italic> has a common role in negatively regulating neurogenesis, with each particular assay influencing the kinetics of response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the tec-1 RNAi the numbers of many neuronal cell types go up, in particular in the brain region, but the size of the brain doesn't change. It is clearly visible in the staining that the density of the evaluated neuronal cell types is increased. But how does this work? Is the general cell density in the brain region higher? Are the cells smaller? Or are there compensatory losses of other cell types in the region? Could the detected loss in glial cells be sufficient to compensate?</p></disp-quote><p>To consider this, we performed 3D segmentation of <italic>cintillo</italic> cells from confocal stacks and made measurements of cell volume and the nearest-neighbor distances for each cell. This approach found that in <italic>tec-1 RNAi, cintillo</italic> cells were more numerous and slightly smaller, and also that they are more densely packed with respect to each other (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). We suggest that increased density along with reduced size accounts for how more neurons physically occupy apparently similar brain volumes in <italic>tec-1</italic>RNAi.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors state that there are no changes in polarity or global patterning genes, but Figure 2B shows a clear increase in the number of notum-expressing cells, and Figure 3B clearly shows disorganized photoreceptors.

These excess cells were found to be within a previously described set of <italic>notum+chat+</italic> cells of the brain (Figure 2—figure supplement 1), which we interpret to be consistent with the supported role of <italic>tec-1</italic> to limit numbers of multiple types of neurons. We suggest based on our analysis that <italic>tec-1</italic> likely acts in an independent process from other known head patterning genes (such as <italic>notum, wnt11-6/wntA, ndk</italic>, etc), because <italic>tec-1</italic> inhibition primarily influences neuron cell density versus head regionalization.</p><p>We appreciate the suggestion to consider whether <italic>tec-1</italic> could be part of the previously characterized A-P axis apoptotic pathway. To test this, we searched the recently published scRNAseq planarian cell atlas to find a neuron subtype that was broadly distributed but disperse enough that total animal cell quantifications could be carried out confidently. Of the tested neuron subtypes, we found one marker (<italic>dd2223</italic>, labeling nonciliated neuron cluster#32 identified by Fincher et al., 2018) that was strongly sensitive to <italic>tec-1</italic> inhibition. In <italic>tec-1</italic>RNAi animals, we found an equivalent increase in <italic>dd2223+</italic> neuron cells in anterior versus posterior body regions (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). Therefore, our findings suggest <italic>tec-1</italic> can exert its influence independent of A-P axis position, so we suggest it is likely part of a distinct pathway from factors specifically influencing anterior versus posterior cell survival.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Is there an anterior bias in the detected neuronal cell increase? Most of the neuronal cell types are evaluated in the anterior region. Only the bottom panel in Figure 3A shows a change in a more posterior region. Are the effects mostly detected in the anterior, or are neuronal cell increases in the posterior just as strong?</p></disp-quote><p>Similar to above, to test this, we searched the recently published scRNAseq planarian cell atlas to find a neuron subtype that was broadly distributed but disperse enough that total animal cell quantifications could be carried out confidently. Of the tested neuron subtypes, we found one marker (<italic>dd2223</italic>, labeling nonciliated neuron cluster#32 identified by Fincher et al., 2018) that was strongly sensitive to <italic>tec-1</italic> inhibition. In <italic>tec-1</italic>RNAi animals, we found an equivalent increase in <italic>dd2223+</italic> neuron cells in anterior versus posterior body regions (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). Therefore, <italic>tec-1</italic> can exert its influence independent of AP axis position.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Is it possible that tec-1 RNAi causes a prolonged differentiation? There is a caveat in terms of Figure 4C showing tec-1's disinvolvement with rate of neuronal differentiation. The regenerating tail fragments were examined at day 8 post-amputation, at which point Figure 4A suggests has only a slight increase in neuronal abundance and thus is statistically unlikely to be noticeable at this stage within a smaller subset of neuronal types. A different time point may address the possibility of delayed differentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We tested the possibility of delayed differentiation through an extended set of measurements over time (2, 4, 8, 12 days head regeneration) and for 3 different neural progenitors during regeneration. In all three cases (<italic>coe, pax6A, pitx</italic>), we found that both control and <italic>tec-1</italic>RNAi animals undergo a similar reduction of progenitor numbers during regeneration. There was no significant difference in progenitor numbers between control and <italic>tec-1</italic>RNAi animals at all timepoints throughout regeneration (day 2-day 12) (Figure 4C). Therefore, we do not find evidence for <italic>tec-1</italic> inhibition prolongs a period of higher differentiation in regeneration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The phenotype should be characterized and discussed with greater depth. Do the ratios between different neuronal types change? This can be assayed with double FISH. If the ratios have changed, how should we understand the activity of tec-1 in different neuronal populations? Are there any neuronal types within the CNS or PNS that reduce in numbers or are not affected after RNAi? Neuronal types unaffected by tec-1 may bring important insights and hypotheses. Readers would appreciate the authors' insights to these questions. If all neuronal types increase in numbers within a constant brain size, it might suggest that the neurons must reduce their sizes as they experience a cellular overcrowding effect. Is this effect measurable (e.g., through nucleus-nucleus distance)? Are the changes in number density and cell size consistent? The authors have shown that glial cell number mildly decreases, which is very interesting, but is this change enough to compensate the increase of all neurons? How should we interpret this result – is it explained by the hypothesis of a distinct cell population killing neurons, or might this have any basis in a potential differentiation pathway?</p></disp-quote><p>Using double-FISH, we now include experiments to examine the ratio of <italic>cto</italic>+ neurons to other neuron types in Figure 3—figure supplement 3. These revealed no alteration of cto:gad or cto:ppl1 cell ratios after <italic>tec-1</italic>RNAi, suggesting <italic>tec-1</italic>concordantly affects the abundance of multiple neuron types.</p><p>To expand the analysis of the phenotype we examined five additional neuron subtypes identified in the recent scRNAseq cell atlas for planarians. Though planarians may have ~50 different types of neurons, the effect size of the <italic>tec-1</italic>RNAi phenotype led us to focus on cell types for which total body enumeration could be performed at a high degree of precision. Of the 5 genes we found to meet this criteria, 4 underwent tec-1 dependent increases (Figure 3A and Figure 3—figure supplement 2): <italic>dd2223, dd3733, spp-4, dd17258</italic>) and the other did not change in abundance after <italic>tec-1</italic>RNAi (<italic>dd2723</italic>). Altogether, our analysis now finds 10 of 13 neuron types increased after <italic>tec-1</italic>RNAi, and 3 of 13 did not change (note we found none that decreased in number). Those unaffected by <italic>tec-1</italic> inhibition did not have any known discernable commonality in terms of location or distribution (opsin+ photoreceptor neurons, <italic>ppl1+</italic> pharyngeal neurons, <italic>dd2723+</italic> CNS cells of the brain, ventral nerve cords, and pharynx). These findings, in combination with the broad expression of <italic>tec-1</italic>, prevented us from identifying a best hypothesis at this time for why some neurons are affected by <italic>tec-1</italic> and some are not.</p><p>We appreciate the suggestion to determine how extra neurons in <italic>tec-1(RNAi)</italic> animals physically pack in space, given for example that overall brain size is not affected. To address this, we performed 3D segmentation on <italic>cintillo</italic>-stained animals and computed volume and nearest neighbor distances between the cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). This approach found that <italic>tec-1</italic> inhibition indeed results in overcrowding of <italic>cto+</italic> neurons, leading to higher neuron densities and smaller volumes of <italic>cto+</italic> cells. Perhaps as extra neurons grow, some process constrains overall tissue volume, leading to these cells attaining reduced sizes. Based on the separation of regions occupied by glia and the affected neuron cell types, we believe the crowding effect to be a separate phenomenon than loss of glial abundance or size. In combination with additional experiments showing lack of support for increased differentiation of neurons (BrdU staining, progenitor counting), our analysis suggests <italic>tec-1</italic> is unlikely to function in a switch to control glial-vs-neuron differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The choice of timing for the irradiation experiment needs to be explained as well. This experiment shows that in the absence of new cell production, tec-1 RNAi animals continue to expand numbers of cto+ cells, whereas control RNAi animals show a decrease in cto+ cells at day 12 relative to day 10. However, Figure 4B showed a statistically significant different in cto+ cells between control and tec-1 RNAi animals on day 10 (which was also detectable as significant on day 8). If differentiation is not a source of cto+ differences between control and tec-1 RNAi animals, one would expect the differences to be the same upon elimination of the contribution of new cells (at least at day 8). What explains the non-significant differences at day 8 and 10 in Figure 5B? Do the results argue that both differentiation and cell survival are affected?</p></disp-quote><p>We chose this timing in order to attempt to generate a pulse of new neurons whose behavior could be assessed over time. In contexts of head regeneration, the exact timing of the onset of the <italic>tec-1</italic> excess <italic>cto+</italic> cell phenotype was somewhat variable across experiments, dependent on feeding schedule and fragment type (note that Figure 4A analyzed tail fragments while Figure 5B analyzed trunk fragments). For the irradiation experiment, we chose trunk fragments because they can survive for longer as compared to irradiated tail fragments. In those fragments, we never observed the excess <italic>cto+</italic> phenotype at d8 but only observed it emerge at later times – by day 12 in head regeneration, the phenotype was always observed. We repeated the experiment in Figure 5B three times and observed in each case the <italic>tec-1</italic>RNAi phenotype in irradiated animals by day 12. Our interpretation of the BrdU labeling and progenitor counting experiments is that we were unable to observe any effect of <italic>tec-1</italic> inhibition on differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The authors report that Tec kinases are known to control inflammation and recovery following traumatic brain injury by regulating macrophages, which does not directly imply that Tec kinase homologs regulate neuronal cell numbers via controlling their survival. Therefore, the next statement (“We suggest that Tec kinases could regulate specific and perhaps conserved functions in adult neurogenesis process in control of neuron abundance”) is not well-supported. There are no data presented that enable the proposal of a putative conserved function for tec-1. The authors' finding that planarian regeneration involves overproduction of neural cells followed by cell death bears overall similarity to the mechanisms of vertebrate development where cell death plays a major role in shaping the nervous system. However, given the lack of demonstrated similarity of function of the ortholog of tec-1 in neural development in vertebrates, the claims of tec-1 being a promising new target for therapeutic interventions are premature.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion to the presentation. We clarified our reference to the study noted above, that it found an increase in brain cell survival (ie, reduced staining of cell death markers) in an ischemic brain injury model after pharmacological inhibition of the Tec-family kinase BTK in mammals (Discussion paragraph five).</p><p>We also modified the text suggesting that our study necessarily implies the existence of a conserved activity of <italic>tec-1</italic> to suppress neurogenesis. Given that some components of neurogenesis are broadly conserved, we think it is worthwhile to raise the idea that future studies could address this possibility. In addition, we now tone down statements of the concept for a potential use for <italic>tec-1</italic> inhibition to enhance neurogenesis (given additional study). We hope our revised text makes clear that we do not present evidence for a conserved function in this study:</p><p>Abstract: “In vertebrates, the Tec kinase family has been studied extensively for roles in immune function, and our results identify a novel role for <italic>tec-1</italic> as negative regulator of planarian adult neurogenesis.”</p><p>Discussion paragraph five: “If the ability of Tec Kinases to limit neuron production ultimately proves to be conserved, they would be potential targets for enhancing neural repair in other species.”</p><p>Discussion paragraph four: “It is possible that Tec kinases could regulate conserved functions in adult neurogenesis processes in control of neuron abundance.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Finally, the finding of increased density of glial cells in tec-1 RNAi is interesting, and the authors should discuss if this could be suggestive of tec-1 being involved in a fate choice – could glial cells and cto+ cells be differentiating from a shared progenitor population?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion, as it was indeed our initial hypothesis leading us to examine the glia in <italic>tec-1</italic>RNAi. We have added text discussing the hypothesis of a <italic>tec-1</italic> functioning in a neuron-glial differentiation switch, but also how our experiments would suggest against this model because of finding no evidence for <italic>tec-1</italic> inhibition to increase rates of neuron differentiation (subsection “<italic>tec-1</italic> suppresses neuronal cell number by regulating cell survival”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
