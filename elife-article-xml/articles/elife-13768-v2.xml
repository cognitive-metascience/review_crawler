Here we identify a transcription factor, ABA INSENSITIVE GROWTH 1 (ABIG1) required for abscisic acid (ABA) mediated growth inhibition, but not for stomatal closure. <italic>ABIG1</italic> mRNA levels are increased both in response to drought and in response to ABA treatment. When treated with ABA, <italic>abig1</italic> mutants remain greener and produce more leaves than comparable wild-type plants. When challenged with drought, <italic>abig1</italic> mutants have fewer yellow, senesced leaves than wild-type. Induction of ABIG1 transcription mimics ABA treatment and regulates a set of genes implicated in stress responses. We propose a model in which drought acts through ABA to increase <italic>ABIG1</italic> transcription which in turn restricts new shoot growth and promotes leaf senescence. The results have implications for plant breeding: the existence of a mutant that is both ABA resistant and drought resistant points to new strategies for isolating drought resistant genetic varieties.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13768.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13768.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>stress</kwd><kwd>abscisic acid</kwd><kwd>drought</kwd><kwd>Class II HD-ZIP transcription factors</kwd><kwd>stay green</kwd><kwd>leaf development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#0929413</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barton</surname><given-names>M Kathryn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Carnegie Institution for Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Endowment</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barton</surname><given-names>M Kathryn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants slow growth and jettison leaves in response to drought via a mechanism that involves the transcription factor ABIG1.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>One way for plants to withstand drought is to slow, or stop, new growth thereby conserving resources until better times return (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dolferus, 2014</xref>). Growth arrest coincides with predictable dry periods during the life cycle – such as in seed development or seasonal bud dormancy. Growth arrest or reduction can also occur in response to sporadic drought (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marc and Palmer, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Verelst et al., 2013</xref>) More extreme than growth arrest is a response in which parts of the plant are sacrificed, as for instance in drought induced leaf senescence, allowing the plant to recover nutrients and to reduce the water cost of maintaining the leaf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Munné-Bosch et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Among plant hormones, abscisic acid (ABA) is the best known for its ability to allow plants to withstand drought. In response to desiccation, levels of the ABA biosynthetic enzyme AtNCED3 in the vascular parenchyma increase in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Endo et al., 2008</xref>). This causes an increase in ABA which causes plants to close stomatal apertures, thus reducing water loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schroeder et al., 2001</xref>). Increases in ABA concentration during seed development impose maturation and dormancy on seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Finkelstein, 2013</xref>). ABA acts by binding to PYR-like co-receptors and bringing them together with PP2C family phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cutler et al., 2010</xref>). This frees downstream SNRK2 kinases from repression by the PP2C phosphatase, allowing the kinase to modify protein targets at the plasma membrane - to alter turgor in guard cells - or to modify a set of transcription factors - to promote maturation and dormancy in the developing seed.</p><p>The role of ABA in controlling vegetative growth is less clear. Exogenously applied ABA slows growth of roots and shoots: it promotes dormancy in axillary buds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shimizu-Sato and Mori, 2001</xref>), inhibits formation and growth of leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marc and Palmer, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Verelst et al., 2013</xref>) and inhibits root growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DeSmet et al., 2003</xref>). ABA also can promote drought induced leaf senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Munné-Bosch and Alegre, 2004</xref>). Paradoxically, ABA appears to be required for growth as well. This conclusion is based on the observation that biosynthetic mutants with reduced levels of ABA are smaller than wild type plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrero et al., 2005</xref>). Supplementation with ABA restores growth of plants grown under well watered conditions indicating the growth defect is not a secondary consequence of water loss. Taken at face value, these observations indicate that ABA promotes growth as well as inhibits it.</p><p>In this paper, we describe a transcription factor that is required for inhibition of growth in response to ABA. We propose that this factor does not act on the canonical ABA events of stomatal closure and seed dormancy but rather in a branch through which environmental stresses act through ABA to restrict growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A tenet of systems biology is that agents inhabiting the same node of a regulatory network share a biological function.

Cross sections show GUS expression in the petiole to be highest in the vascular parenchyma associated with the tracheary elements of the xylem. It is noteworthy that xylem is adaxial to the phloem. This may explain the observed regulation of <italic>ABIG1</italic> transcription by the REVOLUTA and KANADI regulators of ad/abaxial leaf polarity.</p><p>Consistent with the Q-RTPCR measurements above, the transfer of heterozygous <italic>abig1/+</italic> plants to solid media containing 5 microMolar ABA resulted in an increase in the intensity and extent of GUS expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,K</xref>). Expression extended radially in the hypocotyl and further up the cotyledon midvein. These patterns of expression are consistent with observations showing exogenously added ABA traveling upward from the root toward the shoot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Waadt et al., 2014</xref>). The location of <italic>ABIG1/HAT22</italic> mRNA expression in the vascular parenchyma is also consistent with the location of increased ABA biosynthetic enzymes in response to drought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Endo et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>HD-ZIPII proteins are known to bind to their own promoters and negatively regulate their own transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ciarbelli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Turchi et al., 2013</xref>).

ABA treatment did not increase the already high levels of reporter expression seen in <italic>abig1-1</italic> homozygotes. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L,M</xref>). This suggests that ABA acts indirectly to increase <italic>ABIG1</italic> levels by interfering with the negative autoregulatory action of the ABIG1 protein.

Six genes passed this filter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In addition to the ABA catabolic enzyme gene, CYP707A2, induction of ABIG1 also regulates At2g17820/HK1, a gene encoding a receptor that mediates ABA, drought and salt stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wollbach et al., 2008</xref>) and the gene encoding the ethylene receptor ERS2. Finally, two transcription factor genes in the jasmonate pathway, <italic>ORA59</italic> and <italic>TIFY7</italic> were down-regulated in this experiment. The identities of these regulated genes support a model in which ABIG1 promotes drought-induced senescence in part by changing the amount of ABA in the plant while also altering the sensitivity of the cell to ABA, ethylene and jasmonate. While all of these changes occur rapidly (within hours) after the induction of ABIG1 mRNA synthesis, the effects may nonetheless be indirect since these hormone pathways are known to cross-regulate one another. It is therefore unclear which of these genes are primary, direct targets of ABIG1 binding and which are secondary, indirect targets.</p><p><italic>SAG113/HAI1/AT5g59220</italic> encodes a PP2C phosphatase homologous to those in the core ABA signaling pathway.

A role for <italic>ABIG1/HAT22</italic> in mediating ABA signaled growth inhibition and leaf senescence does not necessarily mean that this effect is direct nor that the pathway does not involve additional plant growth hormones. Ethylene, in particular, has been tightly linked to ABA signaling. Abscisic acid was first discovered for, and is in fact named for, its ability to promote organ abscission, a process known to be regulated by ethylene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Patterson and Bleecker, 2004</xref>). More recent examples of links between ABA signaling and ethylene signaling include: Two ethylene receptors, ETR1 and ETR2, regulate the sensitivity of germination to ABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wilson et al., 2014</xref>); Absicisic acid biosynthetic enzymes are required for ethylene signaling in the inhibition of rice root growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ma et al., 2014</xref>); A screen for ABA insensitive mutants in Arabidopsis root growth resulted in the recovery of mutations in the ethylene signaling pathway as well as in the auxin signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Thole et al., 2014</xref>). The link between ABA signaling and ethylene signaling appears to be ancient as the central signaling kinase of the ethylene signaling pathway, CTR1, mediates both ABA and ethylene signaling in the moss Physcomitrellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yasumura et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The finding that induction of <italic>ABIG1/HAT22</italic> alters levels of mRNAs for genes encoding components of the ethylene, ABA and jasmonate pathways (all pathways that have been shown to promote senescence) as well as the senescence regulating transcription factor GRF5 suggests that <italic>ABIG1</italic> promotes leaf yellowing and senescence by invoking multiple pathways.</p><p>How can the action of ABA as a growth inhibitor in response to drought be reconciled with the reduced growth observed in ABA biosynthesis mutants? This is especially puzzling since reduced growth in both circumstances - exogenous addition of ABA and reduced ABA due to a mutation in a biosynthetic mutation - have been shown to be mediated in part through the ethylene pathway (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sharp and Noble, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Thole et al., 2014</xref>) It is possible that ABA has varying effects at different doses. But it is also possible that the phenotypes caused by loss of function mutations in ABA biosynthesis genes are misleading. For one thing, the phenotypes of these mutants reflect the cumulative effect of secondary, tertiary and higher order consequences of ABA deficiency throughout the history of the plant. For another, loss of function in a step of a biosynthetic pathway may cause accumulation of precursors and/or increased flow through side branches of the biosynthetic pathway. The latter appears to be the case for an earlier step in the ABA biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avendaño-Vázqueza, 2014</xref>) and for some mutants in the auxin biosynthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brumos et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the phenotypes of hormone biosynthetic mutants are more correctly considered as reflecting the cumulative (over development) consequence of missing or reduced enzyme activity rather than reflecting solely the reduction in the levels of the particular hormone in question. As such, the phenotype of biosynthetic mutants may not accurately reflect the role of environmentally induced hormone production in an otherwise normal plant.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The role of Class II HD-ZIP proteins in the plant</title><p>Class II HD-ZIP proteins are transcription factors that have been shown to regulate shoot growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Turchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rice et al., 2014</xref>). They include a DNA binding homeodomain and a leucine zipper dimerization domain. Class II HD-ZIP proteins bind to a palindromic sequence as dimers and in several cases have been shown to repress their own transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ohgishi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ciarbelli et al., 2008</xref>). Several members of this family, including the ABIG1/HAT22 protein include an EAR like domain which can interact with TOPLESS family co-repressors to mediate transcriptional inhibition.</p><p>Many of the genes within the HD-ZIPII family of genes, like <italic>ABIG1/HAT22,</italic> are regulated by one or both <italic>REVOLUTA</italic> and <italic>KANADI</italic> transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reinhart et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandt et al., 2012</xref>). Three of these, ATHB4, ATHB2 and HAT3 are required for normal leaf development and blade growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Turchi et al., 2013</xref>). The expression of two of them, ATHB4 and HAT3, is most prominent in the adaxial leaf domain where REVOLUTA is active and KANADI is excluded. Whether they are involved in the establishment of organ polarity or whether they are the executors of growth control in response to ad/abaxial cues in the leaf is unclear.</p><p>The localization of <italic>ABIG1/HAT22</italic> expression primarily to the vascular parenchyma associated with the tracheary elements - the adaxial portion of the vascular strand - may rely on regulation by REVOLUTA (positive) and KANADI (negative) thus explaining the regulation by these developmental regulators.</p><p>In addition to regulation by developmental factors, mRNA levels for several of the class II HD-ZIP genes are also regulated by environmental and hormonal inputs, including ABA, auxin and red/far red light with the exact response to stimulus dependent on the particular Class II HD-ZIP gene in question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ciarbelli et al., 2008</xref>). It seems likely that a general role for HD-ZIPII proteins is to link environmental and tissue specific signals to growth control.</p><p>Two of the ten Class II HD-ZIP genes in Arabidopsis are the distantly related alpha type Class II HD-ZIP genes <italic>ATHB17</italic> and <italic>ATHB18.</italic> Like <italic>ABIG1/HAT22, ATHB17</italic> mRNA is also increased by ABA and by salt and drought stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 2013</xref>). Also like <italic>ABIG1/HAT22, ATHB17</italic> activity inhibits growth and <italic>athb17</italic> mutant seedlings are resistant to ABA mediated growth inhibition. However, unlike the case for <italic>ABIG1/HAT22, athb17</italic> loss of function mutant seedlings were more drought resistant and <italic>ATHB17</italic> overexpressors were more drought sensitive. Another difference between <italic>ABIG1/HAT22</italic> and <italic>ATHB17</italic> is that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hymus et al. (2013)</xref> found that <italic>ATHB17</italic> overexpressing plants led to greener, more chloroplast dense cells while we find that overexpressing <italic>ABIG1/HAT22</italic> causes leaves to be yellow and less green. Thus, these distantly related class II HD-ZIPs may share some functions (growth control, regulation by drought) with <italic>ABIG1/HAT22</italic> but differ in others (leaf yellowing versus greening).</p><p>Regulation of plant growth through manipulation of class II HD-ZIP factors may lead to crop plants with improved growth characteristics. Recently, transgenic maize lines overexpressing a truncated form of the <italic>Arabidopsis ATHB17</italic> gene, a type alpha class II HD-ZIP gene, lacking a presumed transcriptional repression domain and presumed to act as a dominant negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rice et al., 2014</xref>), have been permitted for crop use by USDA (Monsanto Petition (14-213-01p) for Determination of Non-regulated Status for Increased Ear Biomass MON 874Ø3 Maize.) This is one of a very few GMO traits approved for crop use. In this application, the ATHB17 overexpressing plants are described as having greater ear biomass. This is presumed to result from inhibition of other class II HDZIP proteins by the truncated ATHB17 protein, thus preventing them from inhibiting growth.</p><p>Another way to improve growth of crop plants, in particular in response to drought stress conditions, may be to generate simple loss of function mutations in drought regulated class II HD-ZIP genes such as <italic>ABIG1</italic> and thereby reduce growth inhibition in response to environmental stress. Such an approach does not require the introduction of a transgene and may therefore be acceptable to a broader range of consumers.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Proposed pathway</title><p>We propose that drought acts through <italic>ABIG1</italic> to inhibit growth and to accelerate senescence. Drought has been shown to increase levels of the ABA biosynthetic enzyme, NCED9, in the parenchyma cells surrounding the xylem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Endo et al. 2008</xref>). We propose that increased ABA in the vascular parenchyma acts through the ABI1 ABA co-receptor to increase <italic>ABIG1</italic> mRNA levels. Increased levels of ABIG1 transcription factor in turn regulate a suite of genes, through direct or indirect action, that includes those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. These targets, many of which are previously implicated in stress response and hormone signaling, in turn trigger reduction of growth at shoot apices and hasten leaf yellowing and evocation of the senescence pathway in leaves.</p><p>The action of ABA to increase <italic>ABIG1</italic> mRNA levels need not be direct – in fact we did not find any ABRE elements upstream of the <italic>ABIG1</italic> gene. Nevertheless, Q-RTPCR analysis shows that regulation occurs within hours of ABA application and gene trap analysis shows that <italic>ABIG1</italic> expression is strengthened and expanded in the vasculature in response to ABA. Thus, there is potential for a close temporal and spatial linkage of increased ABA and increased <italic>ABIG1</italic> mRNA levels. Our experiments also show that increased ABIG1 levels have profound consequences on the plant, resulting in growth inhibition and leaf yellowing. While it is possible for ABA to formally act through <italic>ABIG1</italic> in a manner that does not require up-regulation of the <italic>ABIG1</italic> transcript, the experimental observations point to ABA up-regulation of ABIG1 transcript, through an as yet and possible indirect pathway, as a simple mechanism through which ABIG1 action is modulated by ABA. Furthermore, the finding that <italic>ABIG1</italic> can down-regulate a gene encoding an ABA catabolic enzyme suggests that ABA can act to increase its own levels via a positive feedback loop that includes <italic>ABIG1/HAT22.</italic> </p><p>An unexpected finding of this work is the discovery of mutations, i.e. loss of function <italic>abig1</italic> mutations, that are resistant to ABA and also resistant to drought. To date ABA resistance has been correlated with drought sensitivity presumably due to the inability of stomata to close in mutants compromised in ABA signaling (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 2013</xref>). The normal germination and stomatal closure in <italic>abig1-1</italic> mutants indicates that the branches of the ABA regulatory pathways controlling these processes are intact in the <italic>abig1-</italic>1 mutant. We propose that <italic>ABIG1</italic> participates in a parallel path in which ABA regulates growth and the decision to undergo senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We note that an increase in ABA levels precedes an increase in <italic>ABIG1/HAT22</italic> levels in maturing and senescing leaves as found in transcriptome inventories of developing Arabidopsis leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breeze et al., 2011</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13768.014</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for <italic>ABIG1</italic> action in the plant.</title><p>ABA concentration increases following drought. ABIG1 mRNA increases in response and, in a pathway that is distinct from the pathways controlling germination and stomatal closure, causes a reduction in growth and triggers early senescence. In the absence of ABIG1, plant growth is less affected by drought and leaf senescence is less likely to be triggered by drought.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13768.014">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13768.014</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-13768-fig7-v2"/></fig></p><p>In crop plants such as sorghum and rice, drought conditions often induce premature senescence. Varieties that resist this induced senescence are referred to as possessing a 'stay green' phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thomas and Ougham, 2014</xref>). Stay green traits from wild relatives have been incorporated into a variety of crop plants to breed drought resistant varieties. The <italic>abig1-1</italic> mutant behaves like a stay green mutant in its ability to remain green and to maintain an upright shoot under drought conditions. Screens for additional mutants resistant to ABA during plant growth, as opposed to screens for resistance at the germination stage, should be a productive means of selecting novel mutants with stay green phenotypes that can be used to inform breeding of new drought resistant plant varieties.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant growth</title><p>Soil grown plants were grown in 4 inch pots in ProMix PGX soil mix.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The Arabidopsis transcription factor <italic>ABIG1</italic> relays ABA signaled growth inhibition and drought induced senescence&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel as the Senior editor and two reviewers, including Rick Amasino who is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The insensitivity of the <italic>abig</italic> mutant to ABA-mediated growth inhibition and senescence, but not to other classic ABA effects on seed germination, guard cell closure, and inhibition of primary root growth is an interesting finding. Your work indicates that <italic>ABIG1</italic> appears to define a branch of the ABA pathway that regulates growth and leaf senescence. That the phenotype of inducible overexpression is &quot;opposite&quot; to that of the mutant lends support to the role of <italic>ABIG</italic> in ABA-mediated growth inhibition and senescence, although a minor point is that the &quot;opposite phenotype&quot; is a &quot;sickly&quot; plant, and overexpression of many proteins might cause this.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One issue is the extent to which <italic>ABIG</italic> is in fact regulated by the core ABA response pathway. There is not a strong effect of <italic>abi1</italic> or ABA. Of course <italic>ABIG</italic> could be an important component of a branch of the ABA pathway that regulates growth and leaf senescence even if it is not itself regulated strongly at the level of mRNA abundance by the ABA pathway. This issue could be more clearly defined in the paper.</p><p>2) The leaf senescence phenotype could be presented more rigorously. For example, in the section &quot;<italic>ABIG1/HAT22</italic> mutants show less leaf yellowing in response to drought&quot; there is only a visual assessment of leaf yellowing. A visual assessment is subjective, and also the degree of leaf senescence based upon visual observation can be obscured by differences in anthocyanin accumulation. This is particularly important to consider in the descriptions of leaf senescence in whole plants. A paper by Hensel et al. (Plant Cell. 1993. 5:553-64) provides an example of a simple assay of chlorophyll content as a more quantitative measure of leaf senescence. Also, for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> (percentage of leaves that had turned yellow) there is no mention of the number of plants or leaves analyzed in the figure legend or in Methods. For the lodging phenotype it is noted that &quot;mutant plants remained erect.&quot; Although it is not necessary to create another figure for this, perhaps a bit more could be said in the text about the range of this phenotype.</p><p>3) As noted above, the yellowing, wilting, and growth phenotypes indicate there is a specific branch in the ABA response pathway that regulates these things, but the molecular characterization by transcriptomics is not very specific. A great deal has been published about senescence and its associated molecular events. For example, many senescence-induced genes are ABA-regulated at the transcriptional level quite quickly after ABA application (before yellowing occurs). Are the <italic>abig1</italic> mutants defective in ABA-mediated regulation of such senescence-associated transcripts? We recognize that the transcriptomics using the inducible XVE construct addresses this issue to some extent, but more specifically evaluating the role of <italic>ABIG1</italic> in expression of genes known to be involved of ABA-controlled responses would better define this branch of the pathway. For example, SAG113 is an ABA/senescence regulated PP2C (a.k.a. HAI1 (highly aba induced 1) and some NAC transcription factors are reported to be induced during and involved in ABA signaling during senescence.</p><p>4) The authors note that selectively blocking ABA-mediated senescence might be an efficient route to improved stress tolerance and promote a desirable stay-green phenotype. The authors should discuss this idea in the context of cytokinin as well, because the same phenotypic outcome has been engineered by using increasing cytokinin content under drought (e.g., see work from Blumwald and colleagues).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors conclusion that &quot;<italic>ABIG1</italic> function is required for ABA-mediated inhibition of leaf production and petiole growth&quot; appears to be well substantiated by results – for example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the difference in the 5 μm ABA effect in wt versus the <italic>abig1</italic> mutant is quite striking. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the inducible overexpression phenotype is quite striking as well, although I suspect that many proteins if sufficiently overexpressed will &quot;muck things up&quot; and result in a striking phenotype.</p><p>The weakest part of the paper is the section entitled &quot;<italic>ABIG1/HAT22</italic> mutants show less leaf yellowing in response to drought.&quot; Yellowing is a very subjective thing and the degree of leaf senescence based upon visual observation can be obscured by differences in anthocyanin accumulation (i.e., impaired anthocyanin accumulation can be mistaken for more rapid senescence). For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> (percentage of leaves that had turned yellow) there is no mention of the number of plants or leaves analyzed in the figure legend or in Methods.</p><p>Also in this section are other phenotypes like &quot;mutant plants remained erect.&quot; One trusts that this is highly reproducible, but that ought to be discussed.</p><p>In the Discussion, the Monsanto stuff is not &quot;tied in&quot; well to the theme of the paper. &quot;In this application, the ATHB17 overexpressing plants are described as having greater ear biomass. This is presumed to result from inhibition of other class II HDZIP proteins by the truncated ATHB17 protein.&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Liu et al. report on the characterization of <italic>ABIG1</italic> and its role in ABA-mediated senescence and growth inhibition. <italic>ABIG1</italic> was identified as a transcript that is oppositely regulated by Kanadi and Revoluta, a class of genes the authors have previously defined as ORKs. The link between <italic>ABIG1</italic> and ABA was made because ORKs are enriched in genes involved in ABA responses. <italic>ABIG1</italic> has previously been described as the homeodomain-containing gene <italic>HAT22</italic>. Prior data has shown that <italic>HAT22</italic>'s mRNA levels are regulated by water stress, and that phenotype is recapitulated in this work and attributed, at least in part, to regulation by the core ABA-response pathway.</p><p>In comparison to previously reported mutants that affect ABA signaling, the novelty reported in this paper is that <italic>abig1</italic> mutants are less sensitive to ABA-mediated growth inhibition and senescence than wild type, but do not display defects in other classic ABA responses such as seed germination, guard cell closure and inhibition of primary root growth. Thus, <italic>abig1</italic> appears to define a branch of the ABA pathway that regulates growth and leaf senescence, two under studied but important components of ABA action. Over-expression of <italic>ABIG1</italic> using a XVE-inducible form yields expected phenotypes that are opposite to those observed in the loss-of-function mutant alleles. Using a water deprivation experiment the authors make the observation that <italic>abig1</italic> loss-of-function mutants are more drought tolerant, as suggested by increased shoot and root growth, reduced leaf senescence, and reduced lodging. This observation suggests that selectively blocking ABA-mediated senescence might be an efficient route to improved stress tolerance and inter-related stay-green phenotypes. The authors should probably discuss this idea in the context of cytokinin as well, because the same phenotypic outcome has been engineered by using increasing cytokinin content under drought (i.e. see work from Blumwald and colleagues).</p><p>The most critical point of the work is that it implies a new branch in the ABA response pathway that regulates both senescence and growth, but the molecular characterization of both these processes is quite cursory. A great deal has been written about senescence and its associated molecular events, but all we can say from the work presented is that the leaves in the <italic>abig1</italic> mutants don't yellow as much. For example, many senescence-induced genes are ABA-regulated at the transcriptional level quite quickly after ABA application and before yellowing occurs. Are the <italic>abig1</italic> mutants defective in ABA-mediated regulation of senescence-associated transcripts? I recognize that the inducible XVE constructs go somewhat towards addressing this issue, but a clearer delineation of the necessity for <italic>ABIG1</italic> in mediating a subset of ABA-controlled responses would add to the work substantially. The direct link between ABA and <italic>ABIG1</italic> hinges on an increase in <italic>ABIG1</italic> transcript levels that is only partially affected by the <italic>abi1-1</italic> mutation. How direct is the regulation?</p><p>Overall, I believe this is a potentially important and pioneering paper, but it would benefit from greater depth in its physiological analyses and by building a stronger case for a direct molecular link between components of the ABA signaling network and <italic>ABIG1</italic>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13768.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) One issue is the extent to which ABIG is in fact regulated by the core ABA response pathway.

We’ve also rearranged the section on <italic>abig1/+</italic> enhancer trap expression in hypocotyls in response to ABA which shows more clearly the increase in strength and extent of expression in response to ABA.</p><p><italic>2) The leaf senescence phenotype could be presented more rigorously.

We have used the method by Hensel et al., suggested by the reviewers to measure chlorophyll levels in wild type and in <italic>abig1</italic> mutant plants in response to drought. This experiment required us to set up a replicate of the drought experiment and has taken the bulk of the time in preparing this revision. The new data are in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and largely parallel what we have seen before.

Upregulation occurs similar to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) indicating that for this senescence upregulated gene, <italic>ABIG1</italic> function is dispensable. Given the likely role of <italic>ABIG1</italic> as a transcriptional repressor, it is possible that most ABA/senescence upregulated genes are activated through a parallel pathway.</p><p><italic>4) The authors note that selectively blocking ABA-mediated senescence might be an efficient route to improved stress tolerance and promote a desirable stay-green phenotype. The authors should discuss this idea in the context of cytokinin as well, because the same phenotypic outcome has been engineered by using increasing cytokinin content under drought (e.g., see work from Blumwald and colleagues).</italic> </p><p>The reviewers have asked us to discuss cytokinin and its role in drought resistance. We do this and reference papers by Blumwald and coworkers. We also include qRTPCR data showing that steady state levels of a cytokinin biosynthetic enzyme are increased in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

That said, overexpression of Class I (A. Himmelbach et al., 2002, EMBO J. 21:3029), Class III (multiple observations by Barton and colleagues) and Class IV HD-ZIP (Ohashi et al., 2002, Plant Journal 29: 359.) and even more distantly related families of class II HD-ZIP (Park et al., 2013) proteins do not result in the yellowing stunted growth phenotype so this is at least a unique response to overexpression within the HD-ZIP clade of transcription factors.</p><p><italic>The weakest part of the paper is the section entitled &quot;ABIG1/HAT22 mutants show less leaf yellowing in response to drought.&quot; Yellowing is a very subjective thing and the degree of leaf senescence based upon visual observation can be obscured by differences in anthocyanin accumulation (i.e., impaired anthocyanin accumulation can be mistaken for more rapid senescence).

The authors should probably discuss this idea in the context of cytokinin as well, because the same phenotypic outcome has been engineered by using increasing cytokinin content under drought (i.e. see work from Blumwald and colleagues).</italic> </p><p>See point 4 above for addition of experiments and text addressing the potential role of cytokinin in drought resistance in <italic>abig1</italic> mutant plants.</p><p><italic>The most critical point of the work is that it implies a new branch in the ABA response pathway that regulates both senescence and growth, but the molecular characterization of both these processes is quite cursory. A great deal has been written about senescence and its associated molecular events, but all we can say from the work presented is that the leaves in the abig1 mutants don't yellow as much. For example, many senescence-induced genes are ABA-regulated at the transcriptional level quite quickly after ABA application and before yellowing occurs. Are the abig1 mutants defective in ABA-mediated regulation of senescence-associated transcripts?</italic> </p><p>See point 3 above for addition of experiments and text addressing the role of ABIG1 in regulating senescence associated transcripts.</p><p><italic>I recognize that the inducible XVE constructs go somewhat towards addressing this issue, but a clearer delineation of the necessity for ABIG1 in mediating a subset of ABA-controlled responses would add to the work substantially. The direct link between ABA and ABIG1 hinges on an increase in ABIG1 transcript levels that is only partially affected by the abi1-1 mutation. How direct is the regulation?</italic> </p><p><italic>Overall, I believe this is a potentially important and pioneering paper, but it would benefit from greater depth in its physiological analyses and by building a stronger case for a direct molecular link between components of the ABA signaling network and ABIG1.</italic> </p><p>See point 1 above for discussion of direct vs. indirect regulation of ABIG1 transcription by ABA.</p></body></sub-article></article>
