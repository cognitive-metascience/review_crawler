Derived from secondary endosymbiosis, the apicoplast depends on novel, but largely cryptic, mechanisms for protein/lipid import and organelle inheritance during parasite replication. These critical biogenesis pathways present untapped opportunities to discover new parasite-specific drug targets. We used an innovative screen to identify actinonin as having a novel mechanism-of-action inhibiting apicoplast biogenesis. Resistant mutation, chemical-genetic interaction, and biochemical inhibition demonstrate that the unexpected target of actinonin in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is FtsH1, a homolog of a bacterial membrane AAA+ metalloprotease. <italic>Pf</italic>FtsH1 is the first novel factor required for apicoplast biogenesis identified in a phenotypic screen. Our findings demonstrate that FtsH1 is a novel and, importantly, druggable antimalarial target. Development of FtsH1 inhibitors will have significant advantages with improved drug kinetics and multistage efficacy against multiple human parasites.</p></abstract><kwd-group

for antimalarials with novel mechanisms-of-action to combat resistance to frontline drugs. The apicoplast is a plastid organelle uniquely found in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites that cause malaria and related apicomplexan pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McFadden et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">KÃ¶hler et al., 1997</xref>). Though non-photosynthetic, the apicoplast is required for the biosynthesis of essential metabolites in the organisms that retained it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jomaa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mazumdar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vaughan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nair et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yeh and DeRisi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ke et al., 2014</xref>). Acquired by a secondary eukaryote-eukaryote endosymbiosis, it utilizes bacterial and organellar pathways distinct from those of mammalian host cells. Given its unique and essential biology, the apicoplast is an ideal source of parasite-specific drug targets that minimize host off-target toxicity.</p><p>Despite its biomedical potential, development of broadly effective antimalarials targeting the apicoplast has met with significant roadblocks. The first class of apicoplast inhibitors to be identified was drugs like doxycycline, clindamycin, and chloramphenicol that block prokaryotic protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fichera and Roos, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dahl et al., 2006</xref>). The antimalarial effects of these clinically-approved antibiotics were noticed well before they were shown to inhibit the bacterial-like ribosome in the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geary and Jensen, 1983</xref>). Unfortunately translation inhibitors cause a characteristic âdelayed deathâ in vitro in which parasite growth inhibition occurs in the second replication cycle after drug treatment. The delayed effect is related to their mechanism-of-action and is also seen with DNA replication and transcription inhibitors that block apicoplast gene expression. Delayed death manifests as a slow onset-of-action of translation inhibitors that limits their antimalarial efficacy and clinical use.</p><p>The next druggable targets in the apicoplast were several prokaryotic metabolic pathways. Fosmidomycin, an inhibitor of MEP isoprenoid precursor biosynthesis in the apicoplast, causes parasite growth inhibition in a single replication cycle in vitro and rapid parasite clearance in human clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jomaa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oyakhirome et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lanaspa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guggisberg et al., 2016</xref>). Unfortunately initial parasite clearance is followed by recrudescent infections in 50% of patients. These treatment failures have brought into question the clinical utility of fosmidomycin and other MEP inhibitors. Yet despite the expectation that the apicoplast would serve many essential functions, we showed that only isoprenoid precursor biosynthesis is required during the symptomatic blood stage of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yeh and DeRisi, 2011</xref>). The apicoplastâs limited function in blood-stage <italic>Plasmodium</italic> precludes opportunities to target alternative metabolic pathways.</p><p>The pipeline for essential and druggable apicoplast targets has run dry. New approaches are needed to identify drug targets that avoid the known liabilities of targeting apicoplast gene expression and metabolism. Until now, identification of drug targets in the apicoplast has been based on conserved bacterial and primary chloroplast pathways whose functions can be inferred from model organisms. However, many essential pathways for protein/lipid import into the apicoplast and organelle inheritance during parasite replication will be unique to secondary plastids and evolutionarily divergent from model eukaryotic biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Waller et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vaishnava and Striepen, 2006</xref>). Drug targets in these organelle biogenesis pathways are likely to be (1) essential to parasite survival, even in the context of the apicoplastâs drastically reduced metabolic function, (2) required for all proliferative stages of the parasite life cycle, and (3) conserved across apicomplexan parasites. Thus apicoplast biogenesis represents a promising but unexplored frontier in antimalarial drug discovery.</p><p>While forward genetic screens have been extremely powerful in uncovering novel cellular pathways in model organisms, they are not currently tractable in <italic>Plasmodium.</italic> To circumvent these limitations, we took a chemical-genetic approach from phenotypic screening to target identification. We first identified the natural product actinonin as a novel inhibitor of apicoplast biogenesis. We then uncovered the essential role of the membrane metalloprotease FtsH1 in organelle biogenesis in apicomplexan pathogens. FtsH1 is a druggable target in apicoplast biogenesis that offers advantages over the mechanisms-of-action of existing apicoplast inhibitors and has a ready hit compound to pursue drug development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of a novel apicoplast biogenesis inhibitor</title><p>We screenedÂ &gt;400 growth-inhibitory antimalarial compounds with unknown mechanisms-of-action to identify novel inhibitors of apicoplast biogenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spangenberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wiesner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dahl and Rosenthal, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gisselberg et al., 2017</xref>). Our selection criteria aimed to identify compounds that (1) caused parasite growth inhibition (essential target) in a single replication cycle (avoiding delayed death), (2) were specific in their disruption of the apicoplast, and (3) resulted in loss of the apicoplast during parasite replication. This unique inhibition phenotype distinguished selected compounds from known apicoplast gene expression or metabolism inhibitors, ensuring discovery of a novel class of inhibitors.</p><p>A single natural product antibiotic, actinonin, matched our criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gordon et al., 1962</xref>). Consistent with its reported antimalarial activity, actinonin caused <italic>P. falciparum</italic> growth inhibition in a single replication cycle (EC<sub>50</sub>Â =Â 3.2 Î¼M; 95% CI 2.5â4.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wiesner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goodman and McFadden, 2014</xref>). Because isoprenoid precursor biosynthesis is the only essential function of the apicoplast in blood-stage <italic>P. falciparum,</italic> any disruption of the apicoplast, including complete loss of the organelle, can be rescued by addition of the isoprenoid precursor, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), in the growth media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yeh and DeRisi, 2011</xref>). Indeed actinoninâs EC<sub>50</sub> shifted nearly 20-fold in the presence of IPP to 61 Î¼M (95% CI 50â75). Although the translation inhibitor chloramphenicol also caused growth inhibition rescued by IPP, parasite growth inhibition and resulting apicoplast biogenesis defects were delayed by one replication cycle following drug treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2a,c</xref>). Compared to chloramphenicol, actinonin clearly had more rapid antimalarial activity. These results demonstrate that actinonin specifically inhibits the apicoplast without a delayed death phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29865.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Actinonin inhibits apicoplast biogenesis in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Structure of actinonin.

Absent IPP rescue, the MEP inhibitor fosmidomycin also showed a block in apicoplast development.

We sought to clarify these earlier observations using IPP rescue to distinguish between specific apicoplast defects caused by the inhibitor and nonspecific defects observed in a non-replicating parasite.

Pyrimethamine inhibits parasite dihydrofolate reductase and was used as a control for a non-apicoplast targeting drug that inhibits growth in a single lytic cycle. As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Camps et al., 2002</xref>), clindamycin, an apicoplast translation inhibitor, gave a âdelayed deathâ phenotype in <italic>T. gondii</italic> characterized by completed cell divisions and host re-invasion during drug treatment in the first lytic cycle, followed by halted cell division in the second lytic cycle. Actinonin also led to growth inhibition in the second lytic cycle, suggesting that it also targets the apicoplast. Error bars represent the SEM of two biological replicates.

The first mutation encoded a N805S variant in the metalloprotease domain of the membrane-bound AAAÂ +protease <italic>TgFtsH1</italic> (TGGT1_259260) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2âsource data 1</xref>).

Though both candidates may be involved in the mechanism of resistance to actinonin, <italic>Tg</italic>FtsH1 was more compelling as the actinonin target for three reasons. First, <italic>Tg</italic>FtsH1 localizes to the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Karnataki et al., 2007</xref>). Second, actinonin is a peptide mimetic containing a metal-binding hydroxamic acid, a class of molecules that typically binds metalloproteases in their active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ganji et al., 2015</xref>). Third, the N805S variant of <italic>Tg</italic>FtsH1 is within the metalloprotease domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), raising the possibility that actinonin binding to the <italic>Tg</italic>FtsH1 metalloprotease active site may be prevented by this variant. Indeed, replacement of the endogenous <italic>TgFtsH1</italic> locus with the allele encoding <italic>TgFtsH1(N805S)</italic> caused a 3.5-fold shift in the actinonin EC<sub>50</sub>, fully accounting for the resistance observed in the actinonin-resistant clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Notably growth inhibition at this higher actinonin concentration did not result in delayed death, suggesting that actinonin no longer bound FtsH1 and growth inhibition was the result of secondary targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1b</xref>). In contrast, no increase in the actinonin EC<sub>50</sub> was observed when the endogenous locus was replaced with the WT allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).

Because the phenotypic screen and the mechanism-of-action elucidation were unbiased, the identification of apicomplexan FtsH1 as actinoninâs molecular target was surprising in a number of ways. First, the actinonin target in bacteria and mammalian mitochondria is PDF, and <italic>Pf</italic>PDF was presumed to be the target in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2004</xref>). However, our functional assays did not support this hypothesis. Identification of antimalarial drug targets based on homology with known drug targets in distantly related organisms can be misleading. For example, the misidentification of fatty acid enzyme <italic>Pf</italic>FabI as the target of triclosan, based on its inhibition of bacterial homologs, led to failed drug development programs when fatty acid biosynthesis was later shown to be dispensable in blood-stage <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vaughan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Surolia and Surolia, 2001</xref>). Instead, consistent with actinoninâs chemical structure, both bacterial PDF and apicomplexan FtsH1 are metalloproteases. The target in each organism will depend on its biological activity in the cell and relative binding affinity to actinonin.</p><p>Second, though <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>T. gondii</italic> share conserved apicoplast biogenesis pathways, it was uncertain whether <italic>T. gondii</italic>âs tractable culture system and genetics could be leveraged to identify the actinonin target in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. Fortunately, actinonin caused apicoplast biogenesis defects in both <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>T. gondii</italic> supporting a common mechanism-of-action. Specifically, actinonin-treated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> formed âapicoplast-minus parasitesâ with IPP rescue while <italic>T. gondii</italic> formed them spontaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yeh and DeRisi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2001</xref>). Importantly we show that, unlike in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, disruption of apicoplast biogenesis does not necessarily lead to delayed death in <italic>P. falciparum.</italic> Based on our experience, drug resistance selection in <italic>T. gondii</italic> to aid in elucidating antimalarial mechanism-of-action, where resistant <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cannot be selected, is a powerful approach. The evidence for FtsH1 as the common actinonin target in these two related organisms greatly strengthens the target identification.</p><p>Third, we identified an actinonin-resistant mutation in <italic>Tg</italic>FtsH1 but, since <italic>P. falciparum</italic> contains 3 FtsH homologs, it was not initially clear which of them was the <italic>Tg</italic>FtsH1 ortholog. Almost all eukaryotes contain at least two FtsH homologs located in the mitochondrial inner membrane: The i-AAA has a single transmembrane domain with catalytic domains facing the intermembrane space, while the m-AAA has two transmembrane domains and faces the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Janska et al., 2013</xref>). PF3D7_1119600 is the only homolog predicted to have two transmembrane domains and phylogenetically clusters with human and yeast m-AAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tanveer et al., 2013</xref>). Of the two homologs with a single transmembrane domain, PF3D7_1464900 is more closely related to mitochondrial i-AAA from human and yeast, leaving <italic>Pf</italic>FtsH1 as the apparent ortholog of <italic>Tg</italic>FtsH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tanveer et al., 2013</xref>). However this pairing contradicted localization studies assigning <italic>Tg</italic>FtsH1 to the apicoplast and <italic>Pf</italic>FtsH1 to the mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Karnataki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tanveer et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Tg</italic>FtsH1 was shown to undergo <italic>C</italic>-terminal processing associated with its trafficking to the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karnataki et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, we showed that <italic>Pf</italic>FtsH1 undergoes <italic>C</italic>-terminal processing dependent on the presence of the apicoplast. This shared functional phenotype strongly suggests that <italic>Pf</italic>FtsH1 also traffics to the apicoplast. Therefore, the most parsimonious assignment for the three <italic>Plasmodium</italic> FtsH homologs is PF3D7_1119600 and PF3D7_1464900 are mitochondrial and PfFtsH1 is in the apicoplast. Unfortunately, we were unable to generate endogenously-tagged knockdown strains of either PF3D7_1119600 or PF3D7_1464900 to perform localization and functional studies (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods).</p><p>Finally, there are multiple potential metalloproteases in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>T. gondii</italic> that may be inhibited by actinonin. However, our evidence demonstrates that the primary target of actinonin in these parasites, associated with its disruption of apicoplast biogenesis, is FtsH1. Using IPP rescue to gauge apicoplast specificity, we assayed for secondary targets in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and detected a non-IPP rescuable target at an actinonin concentration 20-fold higher than that for its apicoplast-specific target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1a</xref>). Similarly, in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, the loss of âdelayed deathâ growth inhibition (and its associated formation of apicoplast-minus parasites) signified actinoninâs inhibition of a secondary target at a concentration 3.5-fold greater than its specific inhibition of <italic>Tg</italic>FtsH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1b</xref>). Moreover, actinonin preferentially targets metalloproteases from MEROPS clan MA composed of structurally homologous proteins with a conserved metal-binding HEXXH motif and catalytic Glu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rawlings and Barrett, 2017</xref>). Out of six metalloproteases predicted to localize to the apicoplast, only FtsH and PDF are in clan MA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bracchi-Ricard et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tanveer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Dooren et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mallari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ponpuak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2006</xref>). Curiously, <italic>Pf</italic>FtsH1 is the first FtsH homolog shown to be inhibited by a small molecule.</p><p>Overall, we conclude that apicomplexan FtsH1 is the target of actinonin based on (1) an actinonin-resistant N805S variant in <italic>Tg</italic>FtsH1, (2) disruption of apicoplast biogenesis upon <italic>Pf</italic>FtsH1 knockdown, phenocopying actinoninâs biogenesis defect, (3) specific actinonin-induced sensitization to <italic>Pf</italic>FtsH1 knockdown, and (4) in vitro inhibition of <italic>Pf</italic>FtsH1 protease activity by actinonin. The unpredicted outcome underscores the power of unbiased screens to uncover novel drug targets in unique but poorly characterized cellular pathways. As the first phenotypic screen for drug targets in essential apicoplast biogenesis pathways, the approach highlighted in our study provides a framework for similar screens in the future.</p><p>Our finding also presents an exciting opportunity for antimalarial drug discovery and clearly demonstrates that there are still untapped opportunities to target the apicoplast for antiparasitic therapy. FtsH1 inhibitors will have significant advantages over existing antimalarials that target apicoplast metabolism or gene expression. Whereas metabolic needs vary throughout the parasite lifecycle and even between the same stage of different <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Srivastava et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shears et al., 2015</xref>), apicoplast biogenesis is required at every proliferative stage of the parasite lifecycle and is highly conserved among apicomplexan parasites. For example, apicoplast translation inhibitors have broad clinical application as malaria prophylaxis and a partner drug, in combination with faster-acting compounds, for acute malaria, toxoplasmosis, and babesiosis. In fact, the utility of these antibiotics as antiparasitics would be greater if not for their slow activity. Inhibition of FtsH1 retains all the benefits of targeting apicoplast biogenesis with no delay in the onset-of-action. Moreover, our inability to select actinonin-resistant <italic>Plasmodium</italic> contrasts with the ready selection of in vitro resistance against antibiotics and MEP inhibitors and indicates a lower likelihood of clinical resistance to FtsH1 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dharia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guggisberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sidhu et al., 2007</xref>). Taken together, FtsH1 inhibitors have potential for rapid onset, multi-stage efficacy against multiple parasitic infections, and minimal clinical resistance.</p><p>In addition to its promising biological properties, FtsH1 is a druggable target. There are clear precedents for active-site inhibitors of metalloproteases advancing as clinical candidates in human trials. Clinically tested inhibitors of human matrix metalloproteases (MMP; e.g. marimastat, rebimastat) and bacterial PDF (e.g. GSK1322322, LBM-415, BB83698) were also peptide mimetics with a metal-binding group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vandenbroucke and Libert, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sangshetti et al., 2015</xref>). Based on the development of MMP and PDF inhibitors, metalloprotease inhibitors require optimization for metabolic stability and selectivity. For example, hydroxamate-based inhibitors, such as actinonin, are labile to liver metabolism, which can be addressed by replacement of this metal-binding group with stable bioisosteres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Skipper et al., 1980</xref>). Similarly, selectivity depends on specific recognition of protein features beyond the active-site metal, which is shared by many metalloproteases. Notably, bacterial PDF inhibitors have shown excellent safety profiles in human clinical trials, demonstrating that metal-chelating peptide mimetics can achieve selectivity for pathogen targets allowing for their use as acute treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sangshetti et al., 2015</xref>). An alternative strategy is to identify small molecule binding pockets outside of the FtsH1 metalloprotease active site that may affect regulation of its protease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vandenbroucke and Libert, 2014</xref>). Such small molecule regulation has been demonstrated for the functionally-related bacterial ClpP proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gersch et al., 2015</xref>). Both the in vitro PfFtsH1 activity assay and the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> FtsH1 knockdown strain reported in our study can be adapted to perform high-throughput screens for optimized FtsH1 inhibitors. Structure-function studies of <italic>Pf</italic>FtsH1 will also aid in design of active site and allosteric inhibitors. Importantly, optimization of <italic>Pf</italic>FtsH1 inhibitors will benefit enormously from a âpiggybackâ strategy to access compound libraries, counterscreens for off-target activity against human metalloproteases, and knowledge about drug properties of metalloprotease active-site inhibitors, which have already been established for bacterial PDF inhibitor programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sangshetti et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Finally, while molecular players involved in apicoplast biogenesis have been identified based on functional conservation and bioinformatics screens for apicoplast proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sheiner et al., 2011</xref>), apicomplexan FtsH1 is the first novel molecular player in apicoplast biogenesis identified in a phenotypic screen. Acquired by secondary endosymbiosis of an alga, the apicoplast is evolutionarily distinct. FtsH1âs role in organelle biogenesis is not conserved in homologs found in mitochondria or primary chloroplasts and likely represents a novel pathway unique to secondary endosymbionts in this parasite lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vaishnava and Striepen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van Dooren et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moore et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spork et al., 2009</xref>). FtsH homologs have broad substrate specificity to perform general degradation of misfolded membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Janska et al., 2013</xref>). However they have also been shown to catalyze the proteolysis of native cytosolic proteins under specific conditions critical for cellular regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bittner et al., 2017</xref>). For example, the essential function of <italic>E. coli</italic> FtsH is its regulated proteolysis of LpxC, the key enzyme in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ogura et al., 1999</xref>). In <italic>Bacillus subtilis,</italic> FtsH-dependent degradation of SpoIVFA regulates spore differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rudner and Losick, 2002</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Ec</italic>FtsH also regulates the lysis-lysogeny decision by phage lambda by degrading a CII transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shotland et al., 1997</xref>) and regulates levels of intracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> by degrading a Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporter MgtA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Based on these regulatory functions of bacterial FtsH homologs, we propose that apicomplexan FtsH1 regulates the proteolysis of key apicoplast membrane protein(s) during parasite replication. Ongoing experiments to understand the molecular mechanism of FtsH1 are focused on identification of FtsH1 substrates. A candidate substrate is the RING finger domain-containing protein associated with actinonin-resistant <italic>T. gondii.</italic> FtsH1 offers a rare foothold into a novel apicoplast biogenesis pathway evolved from secondary endosymbiosis and will yield deeper insight into the molecular mechanisms of eukaryogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MaterialsÂ andÂ methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemicals</title><p>Fosmidomycin was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and 10 mM aliquots were prepared in water.

Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, one of whom, Jon Clardy, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. One of the other reviewers, Vasant Muralidharan, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>They were uniformly enthusiastic about the suitability of the manuscript for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The enthusiasm focused on the ingenuity of the chemical genetic approach to identifying actinonin's target as PfFtsH1. The reviewers also had a number of suggestions for improvement, and the major points are summarized below:</p><p>1) The manuscript focuses more on the molecule, actinonin, than the target while the reviewers felt that the target was of greater significance. The emphasis begins with the title as the phrase 'first-in-class' is usually reserved for drugs. Actinonin is not very potent and its anti-malarial activity, but not its target, were known. The emphasis ends with the concluding paragraph that summarizes the steps needed to transform actinonin from an inhibitor, or biological probe, to a drug. Refocusing the manuscript to focus on how the screen led to a new and likely druggable target rather than the discovery of a potential antimalarial compound is strongly recommended.</p><p>2) A deeper discussion of the molecular nature of actinonin, including its structure, would be useful for many readers, and it would also link with potential liabilities of the molecule and target. A short discussion of strengths and weaknesses of protease inhibitors would also be informative to many readers.</p><p>3) Several potential ambiguities of the analysis should be addressed including: 1) increased actinonin sensitivity to parasites with lowered levels of FtsH1, 2) the fold change in ftsH1 mutants, 3) identifying the mutations other than those if ftsH1 that conferred resistance, and 4) the possibility that a ploidy change could confound the quantitative real-time PCR results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29865.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The manuscript focuses more on the molecule, actinonin, than the target while the reviewers felt that the target was of greater significance.

To this end, we have refocused the title to highlight the inhibition of FtsH1 instead of the inhibitor. We have removed âfirst-in-classâ from all parts of the manuscript including the title and Abstract to draw attention away from actinonin, which is an early hit and not an optimized drug. The penultimate paragraph describing drug development of actinonin derivatives is now rewritten as a drug development strategy for general FtsH1 inhibitors. The manuscript ends with a discussion of the biological mechanism of FtsH1. We added additional new references that discuss the role of proteolysis of FtsH1 substrates in other organisms and describe how these examples have affected our view of the role of apicomplexan FtsH1 in apicoplast biogenesis.</p><p><italic>2) A deeper discussion of the molecular nature of actinonin, including its structure, would be useful for many readers, and it would also link with potential liabilities of the molecule and target. A short discussion of strengths and weaknesses of protease inhibitors would also be informative to many readers.</italic> </p><p>We have included the structure of actinonin in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. We have extended the Discussion to include a brief description of other similar metalloprotease drug targets that made it to clinical trials, such as the bacterial peptide deformylase (PDF) and human matrix metalloproteases (MMP) targeted for cancer treatment. Like actinonin, the inhibitors developed against these targets bound the metalloprotease active site. We discuss some of the lessons learned from the PDF and MMP inhibitor programs, including ways to increase the selectivity and prevent liver metabolism.</p><p><italic>3) Several potential ambiguities of the analysis should be addressed including: 1) increased actinonin sensitivity to parasites with lowered levels of FtsH1, 2) the fold change in ftsH1 mutants, 3) identifying the mutations other than those if ftsH1 that conferred resistance, and 4) the possibility that a ploidy change could confound the quantitative real-time PCR results.</italic> </p><p>1) We specify the exact shift in the actinonin EC<sub>50</sub> (58-fold) upon knockdown of <italic>Pf</italic>FtsH1 in the updated manuscript.</p><p>2) We specify the exact shift in the actinonin EC<sub>50</sub> (3.5 to 4-fold shift) of the <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains selected for actinonin resistance in the updated manuscript. Importantly the FtsH(N805S) variant fully accounts for the observed resistance.</p><p>3) We describe all the mutations that arose in multiple independent selections and include a new summary table of these mutations in Table 2âsource data 1. We have another candidate resistance gene (RING finger containing protein; TGGT1_232160) for which validation is in progress. Importantly the FtsH(N805S) fully accounts for the observed resistance, suggesting that this second mutation may be a passenger mutation or compensatory. The scope of this work was to identify a new drug target in apicoplast biogenesis, which the current data strongly support. Validation of the RING domain containing protein will take more than 60 days and is beyond the scope of this work. We believe the other SNV, if it has a role, may address the mechanism of the identified target.</p><p>4) We specify that all qPCR samples were taken during the ring stage to avoid noise in our analysis caused by changes in ploidy during apicoplast genome replication.</p></body></sub-article></article>
