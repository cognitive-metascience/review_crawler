segregation. The molecular mechanism underlying the formation of these ParB networks is unclear. We show here that while the central DNA binding domain is essential for anchoring at <italic>parS</italic>, this interaction is not required for DNA condensation. Structural analysis of the C-terminal domain reveals a dimer with a lysine-rich surface that binds DNA non-specifically and is essential for DNA condensation in vitro. Mutation of either the dimerisation or the DNA binding interface eliminates ParB-GFP foci formation in vivo. Moreover, the free C-terminal domain can rapidly decondense ParB networks independently of its ability to bind DNA. Our work reveals a dual role for the C-terminal domain of ParB as both a DNA binding and bridging interface, and highlights the dynamic nature of ParB networks in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromosome segregation</kwd><kwd>bacterial centromere</kwd><kwd>Spo0J</kwd><kwd>single-molecule</kwd><kwd>NMR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>100401 and 077368</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Higman</surname><given-names>Victoria A</given-names></name><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>James A</given-names></name><name><surname>Craggs</surname><given-names>Timothy</given-names></name><name><surname>Dillingham</surname><given-names>Mark Simon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1363883</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fisher</surname><given-names>Gemma LM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>681299</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moreno-Herrero</surname><given-names>Fernando</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FIS2014-58328-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moreno-Herrero</surname><given-names>Fernando</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>Heath</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combination of structural, biochemical, single-molecule and in vivo methods are used to show how ParB locally condenses the bacterial chromosome near the origin and earmarks this region for segregation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacterial chromosomes are actively segregated and condensed by the ParABS system and condensin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Song and Loparo, 2015</xref>). In <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, this machinery is physically targeted to the origin proximal region of the chromosome by eight palindromic DNA sequences called <italic>parS</italic> (consensus sequence 5′-TGTTNCACGTGAAACA-3′) to which the ParB (Spo0J) protein binds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Breier and Grossman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin and Grossman, 1998</xref>). These nucleoprotein complexes act as a positional marker of the origin and earmark this region for segregation in a manner somewhat analogous to eukaryotic centromeres and their binding partners.</p><p>ParB is an unusual DNA binding protein. In addition to sequence-specific interactions with the <italic>parS</italic> sequence, the protein also spreads extensively around the site for about 18 kbp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Breier and Grossman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murray et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lynch and Wang, 1995</xref>). The mechanistic basis for this behaviour is not well understood and a matter of active debate. Earlier models envisioned a lateral 1D spreading around <italic>parS</italic> to form a filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murray et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rodionov et al., 1999</xref>), principally because spreading can be inhibited in a polar manner by ‘roadblocks’ placed to the side of <italic>parS</italic> sequences. However, ParB foci appear to contain fewer proteins than are necessary to form a filament, and single molecule analyses using direct imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Graham et al., 2014</xref>) and magnetic tweezers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>) have shown that binding of DNA by ParB is accompanied by condensation. These ‘networks’ were inferred to be dynamic and poorly-ordered, consisting of several DNA loops between distally bound ParB molecules. In cells, they are presumably anchored at <italic>parS</italic> sites by sequence-specific interactions but must also contain many interactions with non-specific DNA (nsDNA), as well as self-association interactions that bridge ParB protomers to form DNA loops. Modelling suggests that a combination of 1D spreading and 3D bridging interactions can explain the condensation activity and recapitulate the polar effect of roadblocks on ParB spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Broedersz et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, single-molecule imaging of the F-plasmid SopB led to a broadly similar model, defining ParB networks as fluid structures that localise around <italic>parS</italic> using a ‘nucleation and caging’ mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sanchez et al., 2015</xref>). Despite these recent experiments converging on DNA bridging models to explain the ParB spreading phenomenon, the mechanism underpinning this behaviour remains unresolved. In particular, the relationship between these dynamic nucleoprotein complexes and the molecular architecture of the ParB protein is unclear and is the subject of the work presented here.</p><p>Genomically-encoded ParB proteins comprise three distinct domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B and C</xref>). Our understanding of their structure is limited to the N-terminal domain (NTD) which binds ParA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouet and Funnell, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davey and Funnell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davis et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Radnedge et al., 1998</xref>) and the central DNA binding domain (CDBD) which binds <italic>parS</italic> and possibly also nsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leonard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schumacher and Funnell, 2005</xref>). A structure of <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> ParB lacking the C-terminal domain (CTD) revealed a compact dimer in which the helix-turn-helix (HtH) motifs were symmetrically arranged in a manner suitable for binding to the palindromic <italic>parS</italic> sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leonard et al., 2004</xref>). Analysis of the CTD by analytical ultracentrifugation suggested that it also formed a dimer, and it was argued that this interface might promote spreading interactions. Recently, a structure of <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> ParB, in which the protein was also truncated by removal of the CTD, showed a strikingly different conformation, where the NTD had moved away from the CDBD domain to form a tetrameric self-association interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). The CDBD was bound to a <italic>parS</italic> half site, and it was argued that tetramerisation of the NTD could be responsible for bridging interactions between specific and nsDNA bound to the CDBD.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28086.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A hypothetical model for ParB-mediated condensation of the origin of replication region.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domains and regions as identified in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartosik et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kusiak et al., 2011</xref>).

Whilst it is known that ParB is dimeric in solution, the primary dimerisation interface is unclear and possibly condition-dependent. Structural evidence suggests that this could occur between the N-terminal and central DNA-binding domains or between the C-terminal domains. Additional structural evidence suggests that the NTD may flip away from the CDBD to form higher order ParB oligomers via a tetrameric interface.

This idea was attractive to us for several reasons. Firstly, in a single DNA binding locus model, it is not straightforward to reconcile the strict localisation of ParB networks to just a few <italic>parS</italic> sites (and their surroundings) with the limited discrimination between specific and nsDNA binding that is observed in vitro (a &lt;10 fold apparent difference in affinity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Broedersz et al., 2014</xref>). Secondly, although binding to <italic>parS</italic> protects the CDBD region from proteolysis, binding to nsDNA affords no such protection, implying that it interacts elsewhere on the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>). Thirdly, the distantly-related ParB protein from plasmid P1 provides a precedent for a second DNA binding locus in a Type I centromere binding protein (albeit an additional <italic>specific</italic> DNA binding site), and highlights the CTD as the putative candidate region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schumacher et al., 2007</xref>). However, the lack of any structural information for the CTD of a genomically-encoded ParB prevents a rigorous comparison of the systems because the primary structure similarity in this region is negligible.</p><p>In this work, we have probed the role of the CDBD and CTD of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> ParB using a combination of structural, biochemical, single molecule and in vivo approaches. We find that while the CDBD is responsible for specific recognition of <italic>parS</italic>, the CTD provides both a second nsDNA binding site and a self-association interface that is important for bridging interactions and DNA condensation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The R149 residue within the HtH motif is essential for specific binding to <italic>parS</italic>, but not required for non-specific binding and condensation</title><p>Genetic and structural analyses have suggested that residue R149 may be critically important for specific binding to <italic>parS</italic> at the HtH locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Graham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Autret et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gruber and Errington, 2009</xref>). To probe the role of the HtH motif using biochemical techniques, we compared binding of <italic>parS</italic> by wild type ParB and ParB<sup>R149G</sup> using electrophoretic mobility shift assays containing Mg<sup>2+</sup> cations (TBM-EMSA). As reported previously, inclusion of divalent cations in both the gel composition and running buffer enables the clear differentiation of specific and nsDNA-binding activities of ParB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>). As expected, binding of wild type ParB to <italic>parS</italic>-containing DNA produced a distinct band shift corresponding to the ParB<sub>2</sub>-<italic>parS</italic> complex, as well as poorly migrating species at high [ParB] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These latter complexes are also formed on DNA that does not contain <italic>parS</italic>, and are therefore indicative of ParB bound to nsDNA flanking the central <italic>parS</italic> sequence. ParB, and mutants thereof, were purified to homogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). EMSA experiments with ParB<sup>R149G</sup> fail to produce the specific ParB<sub>2</sub>-<italic>parS</italic> complex whereas the formation of nsDNA complexes is largely unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The retention of nsDNA binding activity in ParB<sup>R149G</sup> is further supported by data using gels lacking Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions (TBE-EMSA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), as well as a solution-based protein-induced fluorescence enhancement (PIFE) assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), in which an increase in Cy3 intensity reports ParB binding.

The dimer interface is formed via an intermolecular β-sheet and two domain-swapped C-terminal helices.

Analytical ultracentrifugation, native mass spectrometry and circular dichroism (CD) thermal melt scans further confirmed that the CTD was primarily dimeric in solution and measured a T<sub>m</sub> of 68°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>).

Residues with large chemical shift perturbations (CSPs, Δδ &gt; 0.08) are either directly involved in DNA-binding or undergo a conformational change as an indirect result of DNA-binding, and these were mapped onto the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Two regions of interest were identified: D231-V233, and K252-K259, which are found on the intermolecular β-sheet face and proximal loop regions to form a large, concave and positively-charged interaction surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p><p>To confirm that this surface was responsible for DNA binding we substituted several Lys residues with Ala and monitored the effect on DNA binding using EMSA and PIFE assays. In the first instance, a dual K255A/K257A substitution was studied in the context of both the CTD-only construct (CTD<sup>KK</sup>) and the full length ParB protein (ParB<sup>KK</sup>). CTD<sup>KK</sup> displayed a greatly reduced affinity (~50 fold) for DNA, but the binding was not completely abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Bi</xref>). CD thermal melt analysis confirmed that this defect was not attributable to global misfolding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The full length ParB<sup>KK</sup> variant showed a sigmoidal DNA binding isotherm in a PIFE assay, indicating strong positive cooperativity as observed for wild type ParB but the apparent K<sub>d</sub> was 6-fold weaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In EMSA assays, this variant showed no defect in specific binding to <italic>parS</italic> as would be expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Somewhat more surprisingly however, these lysine substitutions appeared to have a negligible effect on nsDNA binding when assessed using the TBE-EMSA assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Bii</xref>). This may well reflect the complexity that arises when a partially defective nsDNA binding locus is physically attached to the wild type CDBD domain (which is still fully competent to bind DNA).</p><p>We next designed a triple K252A/K255A/K259A variant with the aim of fully dissipating the positive charge density across the surface of the CTD, rather than only targeting the loop-proximal regions. EMSA analysis showed that DNA binding was completely abolished in CTD<sup>KKK</sup> up to concentrations of 50 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Ci</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). CD thermal melt analysis showed that CTD<sup>KKK</sup> was equivalently folded to wild type CTD at ambient temperatures, but with a reduced T<sub>m</sub> (53°C) indicating a moderate destabilising effect of the mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Interestingly, analysis of full length ParB<sup>KKK</sup> showed a clear and consistent defect in all nsDNA binding assays used. TBM-EMSA gels showed that ParB-<italic>parS</italic> complexes were still formed, although it should be noted that their yield was reduced relative to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I</xref>). TBE-EMSA gels showed a complete eradication of the discrete lower mobility bands which arise from nsDNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Cii</xref>). Moreover, nsDNA binding was undetectable using the PIFE analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Interestingly, EMSA analysis showed that DNA-bound ParB<sup>KKK</sup> networks do still form as very low mobility species that assemble co-operatively at high ParB concentrations. Given that the ParB<sup>KKK</sup> protein retains a functional HtH motif, this property might well reflect a role for the CDBD in binding to nsDNA, albeit weakly compared to the <italic>parS</italic> sequence. This highlights the potential complexity of nsDNA binding in ParB which might involve synergistic binding by both the CDBD and CTD domains.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>DNA binding by the CTD is essential for DNA condensation and bridging in vitro</title><p>We next exploited our double- and triple-lysine mutant ParB proteins to test the role of the DNA-binding activity associated with the CTD in forming condensed ParB networks.

This is consistent with the expected requirement for multiple protein-protein and/or protein-DNA interfaces to promote DNA looping and condensation. Incubation of full length ParB<sup>KK</sup> with single DNA tethers resulted in defective DNA condensation compared to wild type ParB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). When it was observed, condensation was sudden (rather than progressive, as for wild type ParB) and full condensation required the applied force to be dropped to an exceptionally low value (0.09 pN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1Aii</xref>). The DNA molecules also showed unusually large steps when decondensed by force, suggesting that ParB<sup>KK</sup> was infrequently stabilising <italic>in cis</italic> DNA-bridging interactions between isolated DNA regions (data not shown). Co-incubation of ParB<sup>KKK</sup> with single DNA tethers under our standard experimental conditions resulted in no measurable condensation events, even under applied forces as low as 0.02 pN and at elevated concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1Aiii</xref>). The average work done by ParB compared to the variant proteins during these condensation events was determined from the difference between the integral of the force-extension curve in the presence of the protein and that of DNA alone. This provides a means to quantitatively compare the condensation efficiency between mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Any deviation of DNA extension from that expected of bare DNA is indicative of supercoiled regions being stabilised by ParB. ParB<sup>KK</sup> could stabilise DNA-bridging interactions between isolated DNA regions but this was often characterised by large steps in the DNA tether extension increase which is unlike the behaviour of wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

However, the inclusion of excess free CTD rapidly disrupted ParB networks, with some degree of decondensation observed in 94% of all the molecules tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Bii</xref>). Moreover, those molecules which did not decondense spontaneously could be stretched by force, but were then unable to recondense when permissive forces were restored. This ability of the CTD to decondense ParB networks demonstrates that the protein-protein and/or protein:DNA interfaces that maintain the condensed state under a low force regime are dynamic (i.e. they are exchanging while the overall structure of the network is maintained).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28086.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The CTD of ParB both inhibits and disrupts ParB-dependent DNA condensation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mean force-extension curves for DNA molecules co-incubated with 1 µM ParB<sub>2</sub> in the presence or absence of 5 µM CTD<sub>2</sub>.

At least two DNA:protein and three protein:protein interfaces have been identified (greek letters), which together result in the formation of ParB networks on DNA, but only dimers in free solution. In free solution, the interfaces supporting dimerisation of ParB are unclear, but scenarios in which the CTD is dimerised may be considered to be more likely because the purified CTD has been shown to be a tight dimer. (<bold>B</bold>) Hypothetical mechanisms to explain CTD-induced DNA condensation. Scenario 1: The CTD dimer (which can bind dsDNA but not support condensation itself) simply competes for the DNA substrate in the magnetic tweezers, displacing full length ParB and therefore decondensing the DNA. Alternatively, the CTD exchanges with full length ParB forming inactive heterodimers in free solution that can no longer exchange with the ParB network (Scenario 2) or heterooligomers that retain DNA binding activity but which are not able to condense DNA because important bridging interactions are ‘capped’ by the CTD (Scenario 3). In scenario 3, we cannot exclude the idea that the interaction with the truncated CTD somehow has an allosteric effect on a different bridging interface, but the simplest explanation is that the CTD is itself responsible for key bridging interactions between DNA segments.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-28086-fig6-figsupp2-v1"/></fig></fig-group><p>We have shown above that the CTD binds tightly to nsDNA. Therefore, its ability to prevent condensation and induce decondensation might simply reflect competition for the nsDNA that becomes available during exchange of ParB:DNA interfaces. Indeed, we have shown previously that free DNA is a potent inducer of network decondensation in the MT apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>). To test the idea that the CTD dimerisation interface is also important for maintaining the condensed state, we repeated our experiments with the CTD<sup>KK</sup> and CTD<sup>KKK</sup> constructs, which are defective and apparently unable (respectively) to bind nsDNA. Both mutant proteins were as effective as wild type in preventing condensation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and both were able to induce decondensation in approximately 95% of all molecules tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Biii and D</xref>). This strongly suggests that CTD-dependent ParB network dissipation is primarily mediated by competition for the CTD dimerisation interface and further confirms that the CTD<sup>KKK</sup> construct is folded. This competition presumably results from the formation of heteroligomers between full length ParB and the CTD, which disrupts interactions that are essential for condensation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The CTD is critical for the formation of ParB foci in vivo</title><p>To test the importance of the CTD dimerisation and DNA binding interfaces in vivo, we compared the ability of wild type and mutant ParB-GFP proteins to form foci in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells when expressed from the endogenous locus.

Overexpression of CTD significantly decreased the signal around <italic>parS</italic> (up to ~4 fold), indicating that it interferes with spreading. Western blotting of cells grown under equivalent conditions to the ChIP-qPCR assay and using the same batch of polyclonal anti-ParB antibody suggests that the CTD is not preferentially recognised over the endogenous full length ParB protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

This ParB ‘spreading’ activity is a conserved property across chromosomal and plasmid segrosomes, yet the interaction interfaces involved have remained elusive, particularly for genomically-encoded systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Graham et al., 2014</xref>). This is, in part, due to the variable structures of ParB proteins and their cognate centromere sequences, even within the type I subclass of which <italic>B. subtilis</italic> ParB is a member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerdes et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schumacher, 2008</xref>). Increasing evidence indicates that ParB spreading is the result of a DNA-bridging activity mediated by ParB-ParB oligomerisation interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Graham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Broedersz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sanchez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sanchez et al., 2013</xref>). However, a complete understanding of the relationship between ParB structure and function has been hindered by the lack of any full length structure for a chromosomally-encoded ParB. Indeed, the organisation of the N-terminal (NTD), central DNA-binding (CDBD) and C-terminal (CTD) domains appears to be quite complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). For the type I ParB protein class, there is evidence to suggest that dimerisation and/or tetramerisation can occur at the NTD and CDBD, and that dimerisation can occur at the CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leonard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schumacher and Funnell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Alongside an ability to bind DNA both specifically and non-specifically, a combination of some or all of these protein:protein interfaces must support ParB spreading and network formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>To address the putative role of the CTD in spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leonard et al., 2004</xref>), we resolved the first structure of a genomic ParB CTD. The structure revealed a conserved lysine-rich surface and we showed that this binds to DNA in an apparently non-specific manner. This novel DNA binding locus is distinct from the sequence-specific DNA binding site for <italic>parS</italic> formed by the classical HtH motif within the CDBD domain. In this respect, there are parallels with the plasmid-encoded ParB proteins P1 and SopB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schumacher et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schumacher et al., 2010</xref>). In these systems, the CTDs share similar surface electrostatics in which a polar distribution of charged residues results in both positively- and negatively- charged surfaces on opposite faces of the domain. In both <italic>B. subtilis</italic> ParB and P1 ParB, the Lys/Arg rich surface has been shown to bind to DNA using structural or biochemical techniques ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schumacher and Funnell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schumacher et al., 2007</xref>] and this work), but experiments with SopB do not support the idea that it shares this activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ah-Seng et al., 2009</xref>). The integrity of the CTD may also be important for stabilising the N-terminal region of the protein. When SopB was truncated ahead of the CTD, it could not bind <italic>sopC</italic> (the F-plasmid equivalent of <italic>parS</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kusukawa et al., 1987</xref>), and analogous results have been obtained with <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> ParB ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leonard et al., 2004</xref>) and unpublished observations).</p><p>Our CTD structure facilitated the design of separation of function mutations to test the importance of the dimerisation and DNA binding activities using a variety of in vitro and in vivo readouts of ParB function. We showed that the DNA binding interface in the CTD is not required for <italic>parS</italic> binding, and that this is instead dependent on the HtH motif found within the CDBD domain as predicted in several previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Graham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Autret et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gruber and Errington, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerdes et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bignell and Thomas, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Theophilus and Thomas, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lobocka and Yarmolinsky, 1996</xref>). In contrast, the CTD is essential for the formation of nsDNA complexes that are observed as ladders of decreasing mobility in EMSA assays. Mutant proteins that were unable to bind DNA at the CTD locus were severely defective in both DNA condensation assays in vitro and ParB foci formation assays in vivo. Moreover, ParB proteins that were designed to be unable to form oligomeric structures by mutation of the CTD-CTD dimerisation interface were completely unable to form ParB foci. Finally, we showed that the free CTD domain can disrupt ParB networks, both in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of the CTD in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> can lead directly to the assembly of heterodimers or heterooligomers with full length ParB that interfere with wild-type function. However, this is not the case when using purified proteins in vitro, and we envision at least two non-exclusive explanations for the CTD-induced decondensation we observe in the MT assay (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>): the CTD could simply compete for binding to the DNA substrate (scenario 1 in the figure), or the CTD could exchange with full length ParB to form mixed species (scenarios 2 and 3). The first possibility can be excluded as being solely responsible for decondensation, because a CTD construct that is devoid of DNA binding activity has the same dominant negative effect. In the second scenario, the CTD might form inactive heterodimers with the full length ParB in free solution, such that it can longer exchange with the condensed network. Alternatively, the CTD could interact with the full length ParB that remains bound to DNA in the network. This could ‘cap’ the bridging interactions, if indeed the CTD interface were important for such interactions (although we cannot exclude the alternative idea that binding of the CTD has an allosteric effect on a different bridging interface). In either case our results highlight a critical function for the CTD interface in overall ParB function, but we favour the second idea. Although our NMR experiments indicate that exchange of the CTD interface does occur, it is on a timescale of hours to days. This is too slow to account for the effect we observe in the MT if it is simply based on monomer exchange between the CTD dimer and the full length ParB dimer <italic>in free solution</italic>. However, the situation in the ParB network is very different, because the opposing force generated by the MT can dramatically increase the rate of exchange of bridging interactions that hold the DNA in a condensed state. Ultimately, a direct demonstration of this idea will require a correlative measurement of DNA extension with the observation of ParB/CTD binding under conditions of controlled force, and this will be the subject of future studies. Taken together, our observations support the idea that the CTD is essential for both DNA binding and for ParB-ParB bridging interactions that support DNA condensation in vitro.</p><p>We propose that the presence of two DNA binding loci in ParB can help to explain how ParB networks are anchored at <italic>parS</italic> in vivo. Importantly, this architecture resolves the paradoxical observation that the apparent specificity for <italic>parS</italic> in vitro (&lt;10 fold greater affinity for <italic>parS</italic> versus nsDNA) is insufficient to explain the strict localisation of ParB around just eight sites in a ~4 Mbp genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Broedersz et al., 2014</xref>). In a two DNA binding site model, specific and non-specific binding can be semi-independent activities that are architecturally-coupled only when ParB oligomerises into networks. This model can also explain why DNA condensation does not require <italic>parS</italic> in vitro, whereas the absence of <italic>parS</italic> sites prevents the formation of ParB-DNA foci in vivo ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Graham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sanchez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Erdmann et al., 1999</xref>) and this work). In a test tube, whenever ParB is present at concentrations that licence oligomerisation, it is always in large stoichiometric excess over binding sites and all available DNA will be bound. In cells, the situation is very different because there is a limited pool of ParB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Graham et al., 2014</xref>). Specific interaction with <italic>parS</italic> preferentially anchors the ParB network at <italic>parS</italic>, leaving a vast number of unoccupied sites. If <italic>parS</italic> sites are absent in cells, ParB might still form networks, but these would not be anchored at specific sites and would therefore fail to form foci, as has been observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Erdmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sullivan et al., 2009</xref>). A rigorous proof of these ideas will require a modelling approach that will be the subject of future work.</p><p>Previously, high-resolution SIM and ChIP-seq data have suggested that ParB-DNA partition complexes involve stochastic and dynamic binding of ParB to both DNA and other ParB proteins, resulting in the formation of fluid intra-nucleoid ‘ParB cages’ on DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sanchez et al., 2015</xref>).

Cell pellets, produced as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>), were resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl and 1 mM BME (TNB buffer) with the addition of 10 mM imidazole, 5% (v/v) glycerol and protease inhibitor cocktail set II (Millipore), before being snap-frozen and stored at −80°C. Cells were lysed by sonication in the presence of 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation and loaded onto a 5 ml HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) equilibrated with TNB buffer +10 mM imidazole. CTD elution was achieved with a linear gradient of 10 mM to 500 mM imidazole. Peak fractions were assessed by SDS-PAGE and pooled accordingly.

Protein-G Dynabeads (750 µg, Invitrogen) were equilibrated by washing with bead buffer (100 mM Na<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.01% Tween 20), resuspended in 50 µl of bead buffer, and then incubated with the sample supernatant for 3 hr at room temperature. The immunoprecipated complexes were collected by applying the mixture to a magnet and washed once with the following buffers for 5 min in the respective order: 0.5X IP buffer; 0.5X IP buffer + NaCl (500 mM); stringent wash buffer (250 mM LiCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.5% Tergitol-type NP-40, 0.5% C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>39</sub>NaO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM EDTA). Finally, the complexes were washed a further three times with TET buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.01% Tween 20) and resuspended in 112 µl of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA). Formaldehyde crosslinks of both the total DNA and the immunoprecipate was reversed by incubation at 65°C for 16 hr. The reversed DNA was then removed from the magnetic beads and transferred to a clean PCR tube and stored at 4°C for qPCR analysis.</p><p>To measure the amount of DNA bound to ParB, GoTaq (Promega) qPCR mix was used for the PCR reactions and qPCR was performed in a Rotor-Gene Q Instrument (Qiagen) using serial dilution of the immunoprecipitate and the total DNA control as the template. Oligonucleotide primers were then designed that amplify at an interval of ~500–1000 bp away from <italic>parS</italic><sup>359˚</sup> and were typically 20–25 bases in length and amplified a ~ 200–300 bp PCR product (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Sodium azide (0.5%; Sigma) was added to exponentially growing cells to prevent further metabolism. Chromosomal DNA was isolated using a DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen). GoTaq (Promega) qPCR mix was used for PCR reactions. Q-PCR was performed in a Rotor-Gene Q Instrument (Qiagen). For quantification of the origin, the intergenic region between <italic>dnaA</italic> and <italic>dnaN</italic> was amplified using primers 5’-GATCAATCGGGGAAAGTGTG-3’ and 5’-GTAGGGCCTGTGGATTTGTG-3’. For quantification of the terminus, the region downstream of <italic>yocG</italic> was amplified using primers 5’-TCCATATCCTCGCTCCTACG-3’ and 5’-ATTCTGCTGATGTGCAATGG-3’. By use of crossing points (C<sub>T</sub>) and PCR efficiency a relative quantification analysis (ΔΔC<sub>T</sub>) was performed using Rotor-Gene Software version 2.0.2 (Qiagen) to determine the <italic>ori/ter</italic> ratio of each sample. These results were normalised to the <italic>ori/ter</italic> ratio of a DNA sample from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> spores which only contain one chromosome and thus have an <italic>ori/ter</italic> ratio of 1. Error bars indicate the standard deviation of three technical replicates.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Benjamin Bardiaux for providing the Aria software, and also Chris Williams, Joe Beesley and Antony Burton for assistance with NMR, CD and AUC data acquisition, respectively.

The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Using a combination of structural and single-molecule biophysical approaches, the authors study the structure of the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> ParB protein (Spo0J), how it interacts with specific and nonspecific DNA, and how it forms supramolecular structures. In general, the experiments are well designed and multiple approaches were used to examine DNA binding and condensation. The structure of the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Spo0J C-terminal domain (CTD) is new. Particularly, the authors demonstrate that the central DNA-binding domain (CDBD) is required for specific DNA binding but not needed for interaction with nonspecific DNA and that the CTD is responsible for the intramolecular dimerization and the binding to nonspecific DNA. They specifically distinguish between the CTD-DNA and CTD-CTD interactions by using a CTD mutant that does not bind DNA but is shown to interfere with compaction. The mechanism proposed explains a large amount of previously reported data and represents a significant step forward in our understanding of bacterial chromosome segregation. However, before publication is considered, additional experimental data are needed to address the concerns detailed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The CTD-CTD interaction:</p><p>The authors use the CTD peptide both in in vitro competition and in vivo interference assays. They observe an inhibition of DNA condensation in vitro, and the absence of foci formation in vivo, from which they conclude on the direct involvement of the CTD in these activities. However, another interpretation of the results would be that the CTD from the peptide and the full-length exchange between dimers resulting in equilibrium with heterodimers as the major species. In particular, in vivo this would lead to an important decrease in ParB2 concentration that would greatly reduce the possibility to spread on the DNA and thus to form visible foci. Moreover, the overexpression of CTD reduces significantly the specific binding of ParB to <italic>parS</italic>, while the spreading activity in the vicinity of <italic>parS</italic> is not reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This data appears in direct contradiction with the author's proposition of the roles of the CTD for which we would expect no reduction in <italic>parS</italic> binding and the absence of spreading away from <italic>parS</italic>. In the same vein, in vitro, the formation of heterodimers would also prevent the formation of the DNA binding domain (alignment of the two HTH motifs in the ParB dimer) resulting in the absence of DNA compaction.</p><p>A major concern surrounds the implication that the C-terminal dimerization domain exists as a monomer (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and/or can exchange during DNA binding (exchange is mentioned several times in the Results but not in the Discussion). As far as I know, in all ParBs tested at physiological, solution concentrations (low μm and nM), C-terminal fragments are always dimers and N-terminal fragments are never dimers. The N-terminal interactions have been uncovered only at crystallographic concentrations. In the third paragraph of the Introduction, for example, the compact dimer of <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> Spo0J referred to here is not seen in biochemical experiments in the same study – the N-terminal fragments are monomers in solution.</p><p>In contrast to the situation proposed, the P1 ParB C-terminal dimer interaction is very strong and requires denaturation with GuHCl and renaturation to allow exchange and heterodimerization (JBC 2000, 275:8213). Otherwise dimer exchange does not happen during the time scale of DNA binding (&gt; many minutes), although may occur with longer incubations (and likely would if coexpressed in vivo). The NMR H-D experiment cited but not presented (subsection “The structure of <italic>Bs</italic>ParB CTD reveals a dimer with a putative DNA binding interface”) does not allow interpretation without knowing concentrations and time scales. If exchange is significantly slower than DNA binding, then the ability to exchange is not relevant to the model. Similarly, the competition experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> seem to preincubate the CTD with ParB, so it is not clear for how much time exchange has been allowed to occur. I would expect exchange to occur eventually if the two proteins are mixed together in vitro or expressed together in vivo, but the question of time-scale is critical here. Finally, exchange is not necessary for the bridging interactions to be necessary for condensation, nor do the data exclude roles for the N-terminal region (which previous studies, e.g. Graham et al., 2014, also show). I think the authors need to support the idea of exchange (during DNA binding) by reporting kinetics. They could measure the kD of dimerization directly. They could show that with their ParB, heterodimer ParB/DNA complexes form readily by EMSA, for example. Or their model could be modified or described differently if I have misinterpreted the implications here.</p><p>2) The non-specific DNA binding activity:</p><p>- In the absence of a totally defective mutant in the HTH motif, the author could not discriminate between the contribution of the HTH and the CTD domains for non-specific DNA binding. They cannot formally exclude that the HTH is not providing the main non-specific DNA binding activity as observed in some plasmid counterparts. Also, with the ParB<sup>R149G</sup> variant, they cannot conclude that &quot;the HTH motif is dispensable for non-specific binding and condensation&quot; as point mutants in the second helix of HTH usually remains fully proficient for non-specific DNA binding.</p><p>- The non-specific activity measured by EMSA corresponds to DNA that is stuck in the wells. This retention occurs at the same protein concentration for all tested variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). For the triple KKK mutant, which is proposed to be defective in ns-DNA binding activity, the same retention in the well is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I</xref>) and occurs at the same concentration as for the WT, thus preventing to conclude initially that this activity (retention in the wells) arises from the non-specific DNA binding activity of the CTD.</p><p>- in vivo, the triple KKK mutant does not form foci as the WT ParB does. However, this variant displays a specific DNA binding activity on <italic>parS</italic> DNA that is strongly reduced (&gt; 20-fold; compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), preventing directly the nucleation at <italic>parS</italic> and subsequently the formation of the foci. This variant could thus not serve as validating in vivo that the loss of the positively charge residues in the CTD prevents forming the ParB foci.</p><p>- The authors use in their rational that ParB of plasmid P1 harbors a DNA binding activity in the CTD but this is due to an extra loop in this dimerization domain that binds specifically to direct repeats in the cognate <italic>parS</italic> sequence, and thus could not be compared per se to the putative non-specific DNA binding interface.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The structural basis for dynamic DNA binding and bridging interactions which condense the bacterial centromere&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance. The reviewers comment on the need for clarification and rephrasing of interpretations in a number of places of the manuscript. While these issues can likely be addressed without the need for new experiments, a revised manuscript will need to include the suggestions put forward by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript has been improved by adding schematics for the binding interfaces and by expending the discussion on the networking interactions and on the free-CTD experiments (– Discussion, third paragraph). Also the authors have removed some over-interpretations as mentioned in their rebuttal. Lastly, some rewriting – for instance subsection “The CTD binds DNA non-specifically via a lysine-rich surface”, last paragraph; subsection “The CTD is critical for the formation of ParB foci in vivo”, first and third paragraphs – clarify the interpretation of the experiments.</p><p>Amongst the new experiments provided within the rebuttal, it seems to me that at least Figure 2Ai-ii and Figure 2Bii should be included in the manuscript as supplementary data to support the arguing on the low exchange rate between subunits (as fully discussed in the new version).</p><p>However, the authors do not provide a direct evidence for the respective contribution of the HTH and CTD motifs to non-specific DNA binding activity, while some rationales/arguments have not been changed thus some sentences are still misleading to me:</p><p>- &quot;we hypothesised that ParB contains a second DNA binding locus for nsDNA that functions independently of the helix-turn-helix motif. This idea was attractive to us for several reasons&quot;. As acknowledged by the authors in their rebuttal, the binding mode is very different for ParB of P1 as it binds specifically to dedicated motifs of <italic>parS</italic>. But, the 3rd reason still suggests that the CTD of ParB P1 is a precedent for nsDNA binding despite this argument should be removed.</p><p>- &quot;This is in contrast to the P1 ParB system where the CTD can bind two 16-mers&quot;. This comparison should not be made as this compares two different activities (specific versus non-specific binding) by two different interfaces (loops versus positively charged faces).</p><p>- &quot;Together, these data show that mutation of the HtH motif effectively eliminates the ability of ParB to interact specifically with its cognate parS site, while nsDNA binding and condensation is relatively unaffected. This is consistent with the idea that nsDNA binding may occur at a second DNA binding locus.&quot; The specificity of binding is totally lost with the point mutation (R149G), but nothing is shown concerning the remaining non-specific DNA binding activity from the HtH motif. Thus, testing only for the loss of specific DNA binding could not provide a direct argument for searching a &quot;second binding locus&quot; for non-specific DNA binding and should not be written as such as a rational.</p><p>- &quot;A striking feature of the structure is a highly electropositive face of the dimer arising from several conserved Lys residues analogous to the plasmid-encoded SopB and P1 ParB proteins&quot;. The authors have to discuss at some point the difference with SopB for which, despite the presence of the high electropositive face in the CTD, no residual non-specific DNA binding activity was reported in a triple HtH mutant by contrast to a point mutant in the HtH (equivalent to ParB-R149G) that eliminates the <italic>parS</italic> DNA binding but not nsDNA binding (Ah-seng et al., 2009), both mutants harboring the highly electropositive face of the CTD.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this revision, Fisher et al. have further clarified the details of the activities and structure of the ParB C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD) in DNA binding and condensation. With one exception (see #1), they have addressed my concerns here. In this study, the major new information is the identification of non-specific DNA binding activity of the CTD. In addition, they present the first structure of the CTD of a bacterial ParB, which turns out to be similar to those of two plasmid ParBs published previously. The authors use sophisticated biophysical approaches, such as magnetic tweezers, to examine the condensation (considered as bridging) activities of ParB and their dependence on the CTD, and these approaches are uncommon and an elegant way to dissect these complexes. The idea that the dimerization domain is involved in bridging and condensation is not new and has been proposed and observed in several studies (e.g. Graham et al., 2014; Sanchez et al., 2015; Schumacher and Funnell, 2005; Schumacher, Mansoor and Funnell, 2007), but these experiments directly probe the role of the CTD in condensation.</p><p>1) My major concern is with the models (represented in cartoons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, form Y), that the CTD is monomeric in solution, a concern from the original review, to which the authors did not respond here. In their figures, they represent ParB as dimerized either by CTD or NTD in solution (but not both). As mentioned in previous reviews, the dimer forms of Spo0J/ParB lacking the CTD were seen only in the crystal structures, and the <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> Spo0J fragment was shown in the same paper to be monomeric in solution. I also note that the DNA binding experiments in the latter study were also done at crystallographic, not physiological, concentrations of protein. As well as published experiments from other ParBs, the current authors' own experiments presented here show that the CTD exchanges extremely slowly in solution, evidence of a very tight kD. I accept their arguments here that exchange may be different when bound to DNA, but this is not represented in their cartoons. Similarly, the poor folding and insolubility of the CTD leucine mutants (dimer interface) also supports that the CTD is never &quot;free&quot;.</p><p>This (CTD monomers in solution) may not be what the authors intend, but it is misleading and needs to be changed (or clarified) in these cartoons.</p><p>2) Are the CTD or ParB KK and KKK mutants still dimers? The NMR structure clearly predicts that these mutations do not damage the dimer interface, and I expect this to be the case, but this should be confirmed experimentally and reported. Otherwise the authors cannot conclude that the effects of these mutations can be directly attributed to DNA binding defects. Similarly, they argue that CTD interference is due to dimerization since the KKK mutants also interfere; this is a circular argument without independent evidence that the mutations do not interfere with dimerization.</p><p>3) &quot;we showed that the CTD is not required for <italic>parS</italic> binding&quot;: where are the experiments in this study to support the conclusion; i.e. <italic>parS</italic> binding in the absence of the CTD? The ParB/CTD-KKK mutants presumably still dimerize (comment #2) and indeed they contribute to the affinity of <italic>parS</italic> binding. I think that they mean that the CTD DNA binding interface is not required for <italic>parS</italic> binding, which should be clarified.</p><p>4) Subsection “The R149 residue within the HTH motif is essential for specific binding to <italic>parS</italic>, but not required for non-specific binding and condensation”, last sentence: The lack of specific DNA binding by the R149G mutation does not mean that the authors have destroyed (or even significantly damaged) the DNA binding interface in the HTH region; it means that they have destroyed a critical specificity determinant. Therefore although it is consistent with the idea of another DNA binding interface, it is equally consistent with a damaged recognition (but not other contacts) of the HTH interface. This is particularly relevant since, in several ParB structures, there are several nonspecific, phosphate contacts with the DNA by the HTH. The authors are careful with their terminology, but it still seems somewhat misleading to not point out that the results are consistent with both possibilities.</p><p>5) &quot;a secondary role for the CDBD in binding to nsDNA, albeit weakly compared to the <italic>parS</italic> sequence&quot; – however not weakly compared to the CTD nsDNA binding activity. Given that only one ParB dimer can occupy <italic>parS</italic>, most ParBs presumably will bind nsDNA via the HTH in the context of condensed complexes/foci. This would still be important for the condensation activities. I would delete the word &quot;secondary&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28086.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The CTD-CTD interaction:</p><p>The authors use the CTD peptide both in in vitro competition and in vivo interference assays.

The referees were concerned about the molecular interpretation of this dominant negative effect.</p><p>In the manuscript, we discussed two non-exclusive explanations for the effect in vitro (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; we will return later to the in vivo situation below). (1) The CTD simply competes with wild type ParB for binding to the DNA or (2/3) the CTD oligomerisation interface exchanges between the truncated CTD-only construct and the full length ParB. (Other formal explanations are possible although we think highly unlikely, e.g. the CTD-only construct acting as an unfoldase for the full length ParB.)</p><p>Explanation (1) can be excluded because a mutant CTD-only construct that can’t bind to DNA has the same effect. In scenarios (2) and (3), the CTD-only construct somehow poisons the wild type protein by forming heterodimers or heteroligomers that are unable to condense the DNA, and this could be thought about as occurring in two ways; either (2) heterodimerisation of the free ParB in solution inactivating the protein such that it no longer exchanges with the ParB network, eventually leading to decondensation or (3) heteroligomerisation on the ParB:DNA nucleoprotein complex that is being monitored in the magnetic tweezers (MT) apparatus, with the CTD-only construct acting as a “cap” for the CTD protein:protein interfaces, thereby dissolving the bridges in the network and leading to decondensation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for cartoon). We <italic>think</italic> that it is the distinction between options (2) and (3) where the referees are concerned, and where we may have failed to fully discuss and/or explain the relevance of our data in discriminating between the two. Note that, in either case, we would argue that the dominant negative effect of the CTD points to a critical role of the CTD interface in ParB function, which is our central conclusion.</p><p>Alongside the original data, our new data suggest that option (2) is unlikely and provides direct evidence in support of (3). In line with the reviewers’ comments, and certainly in the case of the truncated CTD-only construct, the CTD interface does not exchange in free solution (i.e. in the <italic>DNA-free state</italic>) on a timescale that could simply titrate out the wild type protein dimer. Indeed, although our original NMR data shows that subunit exchange can occur, it is on a slower timescale (1/2 life &gt;4hrs) than the effect we observe in minutes in the tweezers (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> for details and discussion). On this basis, scenario (2) is unlikely.</p><p>However, the situation with the ParB nucleoprotein complex held in the MT apparatus is very different. The ParB binds co-operatively to DNA and transitions to a new, higher order configuration which leads to the DNA forming a compact condensed state under zero externally-applied force conditions. This condensed state is fully reversible by application of high force, which can be imposed by the MT apparatus (or potentially by the crowded nucleoid in vivo). By definition, these reversible force-dependent molecular interactions are the “bridges” that join DNA segments to condense the substrate. The dissociation rate for a non-covalent bond rises exponentially with opposing force, such that small changes in force can exert large effects on the exchange of the bridging interfaces (Bell, 1978; Evans and Ritchie, 1997), leaving them exposed for heterotypic interactions with appropriate interfaces in free solution. Under conditions where the CTD-only construct is at high concentration and in large excess over the ParB-DNA complex as in our MT experiments, it should rapidly interact with and “cap” the interface. This phenomenon is perhaps best demonstrated by the fact that one can repeatedly condense and decondense ParB-DNA nucleoprotein complexes by cycling through high and low force regimes, even in the absence of free ParB (Figure S5 in Taylor et al., 2015; original manuscript Figure 6Bi), but that this cycle is broken by the addition of free CTD to the system, leaving the DNA in a permanently decondensed state (original manuscript Figure 6bii).</p><p>Directly demonstrating that this subunit exchange occurs <italic>on the DNA</italic> is not trivial. In addition to performing blue-native PAGE on the free proteins, we have performed EMSA as suggested by the referees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The results are equivocal because the higher order complexes formed by ParB run in the wells, so we have no resolution to monitor the exchange of subunits. They do however suggest that the CTD does not prevent full length ParB from binding to DNA, which is a feature of model (3). Instead, we have recently developed a more direct method to test model (3), which uses a combined TIRF-MT correlative approach to monitor DNA condensation and fluorescent ParB/CTD binding simultaneously, under conditions of controlled external force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The experiments show that ParB binds to DNA without DNA condensation if the force is non-permissive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), and that the ParB CTD inhibits the condensation of DNA-bound ParB without detectably displacing ParB from DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This shows that the inhibitory effect of the CTD on the full length ParB arises from the uncoupling of DNA binding from condensation, which strongly suggests to us that the CTD plays a role in bridging between segments of DNA in the network. Further experiments of this type will be the subject of a future publication.</p><p>We now return to the question of the dominant negative effect of the CTD in vivo, which is perhaps more straightforward to understand. As noted by the referees, since the polypeptides are translated together in the cell, they could heterodimerize immediately to form species that are inactivated and cannot go on to form higher order ParB structures (i.e. there is no need to invoke exchange of subunits). Alternatively, they could interfere with the ParB structures once formed as per our interpretation of the in vitro experiments described above. Again, we would argue that either scenario confirms the general importance of the CTD interface in the overall function of ParB in vivo.</p><p>Regarding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, the referees also stated that “the overexpression of CTD reduces significantly the specific binding of ParB to <italic>parS</italic>, while the spreading activity in the vicinity of <italic>parS</italic> is not reduced”. This would contradict our model, which predicts that, upon CTD overexpression, binding around <italic>parS,</italic> but not<italic>precisely</italic> at the <italic>parS</italic> sequence, would be reduced. Unfortunately, the ChIP-PCR method does not offer the resolution to measure specific binding alone, because regions of the DNA amplified very close to the <italic>parS</italic> sequence score for both specific binding and non-specific binding in the immediate vicinity. The data shows significant decreases in enrichment of DNA very close to <italic>parS</italic>, but also for other regions of non-specific DNA extending to ~3.5 kbp away from <italic>parS</italic> (original manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>; 359.45<sup>o</sup>). Note also that the background is higher for the CTD expression experiment, as defined by the percentage of DNA immunoprecipitated at the terminus (146<sup>o</sup>), such that the fold-enrichment at each of the probed sites is smaller than may be immediately apparent. We can conclude that non-specific DNA interactions are reduced, but we are unable to say whether specific interactions are also reduced, or are maintained at wild type levels.</p><p>Taking into account all of the above, we have made the following modifications to the manuscript:</p><p>We have added further details for the CTD-mediated decondensation experiment in the Materials and methods so that the timescale for potential exchange of substrates is clear to the reader. We have also clarified the timescale for HD exchange in the NMR experiments in the Results section.</p><p>We have produced a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> in the modified manuscript) which more thoroughly presents the possible mechanisms for ParB network formation. This figure also enables significant further discussion of ParB exchange, and the extent to which we can differentiate between different models for the dominant negative behaviour of the CTD in vitro and in vivo, including the lack of evidence for <italic>rapid</italic> exchange of ParB in free solution.</p><p>We have more explicitly explained the limitations in interpreting the ChIP-PCR experiment with respect to specific DNA binding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The non-specific DNA binding activity:</p><p>- In the absence of a totally defective mutant in the HTH motif, the author could not discriminate between the contribution of the HTH and the CTD domains for non-specific DNA binding.

The referees were concerned that we should not dismiss the role that the HtH motif may also play in this activity, partly by analogy to plasmid-encoded ParBs. We agree with this point, and had not intended to give the impression that the HtH motif and the CTD were exclusively responsible for specific and non-specific binding respectively. Indeed, several aspects of our own data highlight the fact that non-specific binding to DNA is more complex than a simple interaction of a CTD dimer with a duplex, and that there must be some overlapping function for the CDBD and CTD, especially in the context of condensed DNA (illustrated for example by the very interesting behaviour of the “KKK” mutant under conditions of high free [Mg<sup>2+</sup>] which the referees have highlighted).</p><p>The referees also questioned whether the KKK mutant could unequivocally establish the importance of the CTD nsDNA binding in vivo because, although nsDNA binding is completely abrogated, there is also defect in <italic>parS</italic> binding. We accept this point and have modified the Discussion accordingly (see below).</p><p>Finally, the referees pointed out that the role of the CTD of P1 is rather different to that proposed here for genomic BsParB.

While these issues can likely be addressed without the need for new experiments, a revised manuscript will need to include the suggestions put forward by the reviewers.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript has been improved by adding schematics for the binding interfaces and by expending the discussion on the networking interactions and on the free-CTD experiments (Discussion, third paragraph). Also the authors have removed some over-interpretations as mentioned in their rebuttal. Lastly, some rewriting – for instance subsection “The CTD binds DNA non-specifically via a lysine-rich surface”, last paragraph; subsection “The CTD is critical for the formation of ParB foci in vivo”, first and third paragraphs – clarify the interpretation of the experiments.</p><p>Amongst the new experiments provided within the rebuttal, it seems to me that at least Figure 2Ai-ii and Figure 2Bii should be included in the manuscript as supplementary data to support the arguing on the low exchange rate between subunits (as fully discussed in the new version).</p><p>However, the authors do not provide a direct evidence for the respective contribution of the HTH and CTD motifs to non-specific DNA binding activity, while some rationales/arguments have not been changed thus some sentences are still misleading to me:</p><p>- &quot;we hypothesised that ParB contains a second DNA binding locus for nsDNA that functions independently of the helix-turn-helix motif. This idea was attractive to us for several reasons&quot;. As acknowledged by the authors in their rebuttal, the binding mode is very different for ParB of P1 as it binds specifically to dedicated motifs of parS. But, the 3rd reason still suggests that the CTD of ParB P1 is a precedent for nsDNA binding despite this argument should be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>The P1 structure does nevertheless provide a precedent for the CTD binding to DNA which we feel is highly relevant to our work. We appreciate that this is not a nonspecific DNA binding activity and that the binding mode is different. To be absolutely clear to the reader, we have modified the text in the Introduction to explain this.</p><p>“Thirdly, the distantly-related ParB protein from plasmid P1 provides a precedent for a second DNA binding locus in a Type I centromere binding protein (albeit an additional specific DNA binding site), and highlights the CTD as the putative candidate region”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- &quot;This is in contrast to the P1 ParB system where the CTD can bind two 16-mers&quot;. This comparison should not be made as this compares two different activities (specific versus non-specific binding) by two different interfaces (loops versus positively charged faces).</p></disp-quote><p>This related to point (1) above. We now explicitly clarify that the DNA binding mode is significantly different.</p><p>“This is in contrast to the P1 ParB system where the CTD operates in a different binding mode, and can bind two 16-mers”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- &quot;Together, these data show that mutation of the HtH motif effectively eliminates the ability of ParB to interact specifically with its cognate parS site, while nsDNA binding and condensation is relatively unaffected. This is consistent with the idea that nsDNA binding may occur at a second DNA binding locus.&quot; The specificity of binding is totally lost with the point mutation (R149G), but nothing is shown concerning the remaining non-specific DNA binding activity from the HtH motif. Thus, testing only for the loss of specific DNA binding could not provide a direct argument for searching a &quot;second binding locus&quot; for non-specific DNA binding and should not be written as such as a rational.</p></disp-quote><p>Given that we would subsequently directly demonstrate non-specific DNA binding at the CTD, we were attempting to guide the reader through our paper. For clarification we have modified the text to acknowledge other possible interpretations of the R149G mutation on nsDNA binding. (see also our response to reviewer #3, point 4).</p><p>“This is consistent either with the R149G mutation exclusively affecting nucleobase-specific contacts in the ParB-parS complex, and/or with the idea that nsDNA binding may occur at a second DNA binding locus.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– &quot;A striking feature of the structure is a highly electropositive face of the dimer arising from several conserved Lys residues analogous to the plasmid-encoded SopB and P1 ParB proteins&quot;. The authors have to discuss at some point the difference with SopB for which, despite the presence of the high electropositive face in the CTD, no residual non-specific DNA binding activity was reported in a triple HtH mutant by contrast to a point mutant in the HtH (equivalent to ParB-R149G) that eliminates the parS DNA binding but not nsDNA binding (Ah-seng et al., 2009), both mutants harboring the highly electropositive face of the CTD.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fair and important point. We have now added a comment pointing out the distinction between ParB and SopB and the appropriate reference (Ah-seng et al., 2009).</p><p>[In both <italic>B. subtilis</italic> ParB and P1 ParB, the Lys/Arg rich surface has been shown to bind to DNA using structural or biochemical techniques ((Schumacher and Funnell, 2005; Schumacher, Mansoor and Funnell, 2007) and this work), but experiments with SopB do not support the idea that it shares this activity (Ah-seng et al., 2009).]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this revision, Fisher et al. have further clarified the details of the activities and structure of the ParB C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD) in DNA binding and condensation. With one exception (see #1), they have addressed my concerns here. In this study, the major new information is the identification of non-specific DNA binding activity of the CTD. In addition, they present the first structure of the CTD of a bacterial ParB, which turns out to be similar to those of two plasmid ParBs published previously. The authors use sophisticated biophysical approaches, such as magnetic tweezers, to examine the condensation (considered as bridging) activities of ParB and their dependence on the CTD, and these approaches are uncommon and an elegant way to dissect these complexes. The idea that the dimerization domain is involved in bridging and condensation is not new and has been proposed and observed in several studies (e.g. Graham et al., 2014; Sanchez et al., 2015; Schumacher and Funnell, 2005; Schumacher, Mansoor and Funnell, 2007), but these experiments directly probe the role of the CTD in condensation.</p><p>1) My major concern is with the models (represented in cartoons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, form Y), that the CTD is monomeric in solution, a concern from the original review, to which the authors did not respond here. In their figures, they represent ParB as dimerized either by CTD or NTD in solution (but not both). As mentioned in previous reviews, the dimer forms of Spo0J/ParB lacking the CTD were seen only in the crystal structures, and the T. thermophilus Spo0J fragment was shown in the same paper to be monomeric in solution. I also note that the DNA binding experiments in the latter study were also done at crystallographic, not physiological, concentrations of protein. As well as published experiments from other ParBs, the current authors' own experiments presented here show that the CTD exchanges extremely slowly in solution, evidence of a very tight kD. I accept their arguments here that exchange may be different when bound to DNA, but this is not represented in their cartoons. Similarly, the poor folding and insolubility of the CTD leucine mutants (dimer interface) also supports that the CTD is never &quot;free&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not aware of any data reporting the protein:protein interfaces which are associated in free solution in full length genomic ParB. However, the referee is correct to point out that we failed to illustrate the possibility that both CTD and NTD interfaces are satisfied in free solution. We have now illustrated all possible dimer structures in our cartoon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) and have also indicated in the legend that scenarios in which the CTD is dimerised may be considered to be more likely because the purified CTD is a tight dimer in free solution.</p><p>“In free solution, the interfaces supporting dimerization of ParB are unclear, but scenarios in which the CTD is dimerised may be considered to be more likely because the purified CTD has been shown to be a tight dimer.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This (CTD monomers in solution) may not be what the authors intend, but it is misleading and needs to be changed (or clarified) in these cartoons.</p><p>2) Are the CTD or ParB KK and KKK mutants still dimers? The NMR structure clearly predicts that these mutations do not damage the dimer interface, and I expect this to be the case, but this should be confirmed experimentally and reported. Otherwise the authors cannot conclude that the effects of these mutations can be directly attributed to DNA binding defects. Similarly, they argue that CTD interference is due to dimerization since the KKK mutants also interfere; this is a circular argument without independent evidence that the mutations do not interfere with dimerization.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. We showed in the paper that WT, KK and KKK variants of the CTD display similar CD spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We now also explain in the Materials and methods that the WT, KK and KKK variants of the CTD (and the full length protein) run almost identically on preparative size exclusion columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> shows normalised UV traces for elution of the CTDs indicated from a Superdex 75 column).</p><p>“The wild type, K255A+K257A and K252A+K255A+K259A variants of ParB behaved equivalently during purification, and run almost identically on preparative size exclusion columns (both in the context of the CTD and full length protein), suggesting that they are all dimeric.”</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28086.021</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-28086-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) &quot;we showed that the CTD is not required for parS binding&quot;: where are the experiments in this study to support the conclusion; i.e. parS binding in the absence of the CTD? The ParB/CTD-KKK mutants presumably still dimerize (comment #2) and indeed they contribute to the affinity of parS binding. I think that they mean that the CTD DNA binding interface is not required for parS binding, which should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>The referee is quite correct here; we are referring to the binding interface and not the entire CTD domain. We have corrected this in the text.</p><p>“We showed that the DNA binding interface in the CTD is not required for parS binding, and that this is instead dependent on the HtH motif found within the CDBD domain as predicted in several previous studies.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “The R149 residue within the HTH motif is essential for specific binding to parS, but not required for non-specific binding and condensation”, last sentence: The lack of specific DNA binding by the R149G mutation does not mean that the authors have destroyed (or even significantly damaged) the DNA binding interface in the HTH region; it means that they have destroyed a critical specificity determinant. Therefore although it is consistent with the idea of another DNA binding interface, it is equally consistent with a damaged recognition (but not other contacts) of the HTH interface. This is particularly relevant since, in several ParB structures, there are several nonspecific, phosphate contacts with the DNA by the HTH. The authors are careful with their terminology, but it still seems somewhat misleading to not point out that the results are consistent with both possibilities.</p></disp-quote><p>This is related to point (3) made by the reviewer #2 above. The text now explains that the lack of specific binding in R149G is consistent with two possible interpretations that are not mutually exclusive. See above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) &quot;a secondary role for the CDBD in binding to nsDNA, albeit weakly compared to the parS sequence&quot; – however not weakly compared to the CTD nsDNA binding activity. Given that only one ParB dimer can occupy parS, most ParBs presumably will bind nsDNA via the HTH in the context of condensed complexes/foci. This would still be important for the condensation activities. I would delete the word &quot;secondary&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We accept this point and have changed the text accordingly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
