linking GPCRs to Erk1/2 signaling. However, their role in GPCR-operated Erk1/2 activation differs between GPCRs and the underlying mechanism remains poorly characterized. Here, we show that activation of serotonin 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors, which engage Erk1/2 pathway via a β-arrestin-dependent mechanism, promotes MEK-dependent β-arrestin2 phosphorylation at Thr<sup>383</sup>, a necessary step for Erk recruitment to the receptor/β-arrestin complex and Erk activation. Likewise, Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation is involved in β-arrestin-dependent Erk1/2 stimulation elicited by other GPCRs such as β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic, FSH and CXCR4 receptors, but does not affect the β-arrestin-independent Erk1/2 activation by 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor. Collectively, these data show that β-arrestin2 phosphorylation at Thr<sup>383</sup> underlies β-arrestin-dependent Erk1/2 activation by GPCRs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

ability to turn-off the coupling of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to G proteins and thereby inhibit G protein-dependent GPCR signaling. Over the last decade, it has become evident that β-arrestins are also important signal transducers and that a number of biological functions exerted by GPCRs are mediated by β-arrestin-dependent signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shenoy and Lefkowitz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lefkowitz and Shenoy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Latapy and Beaulieu, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beaulieu et al., 2007</xref>). β-arrestins act as multifunctional scaffolds that recruit multiple signaling molecules, such as the core Extracellular signal-regulated kinase Erk1/2 signaling module, composed of Raf1, MAP kinase kinase MEK1 and MAP kinases Erk1/2, a process leading to Erk1/2 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reiter and Lefkowitz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeFea et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luttrell et al., 2001</xref>). Typically, most GPCRs induce temporally distinct and spatially segregated G protein-dependent and β-arrestin-dependent activation of Erk: G protein-mediated Erk activation is rapid and transient, reaching a maximal level within a few minutes and is followed by translocation of activated Erk into the nucleus to promote gene transcription and cell proliferation. In contrast, β-arrestin-mediated Erk1/2 activation is slower in onset, requiring 5–10 min to reach maximal level, persists more than 1 hr and mainly occurs in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reiter and Lefkowitz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shenoy et al., 2006</xref>). However, Erk1/2 signaling elicited by certain GPCRs does not fit this classic bimodal activation pattern: for example, the activation of Erk1/2 pathway by 5HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors is entirely dependent on β-arrestins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Labasque et al., 2008</xref>), whereas the engagement of this pathway by the 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor does not require β-arrestin recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barthet et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, some GPCRs such as µ-opioid receptor induce β-arrestin-dependent activation of Erk1/2 that translocate to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zheng et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Accumulating evidence indicates that β-arrestin recruitment to GPCRs and engagement of β-arrestin-mediated signaling depend on both receptor conformational state and a complex pattern of receptor phosphorylation elicited by GPCR kinases (GRKs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reiter and Lefkowitz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shukla et al., 2011</xref>). This phosphorylation barcode is translated into specific β-arrestin conformations that dictate selective signaling and the nature of β-arrestin intracellular functions. Another mechanism that might underlie β-arrestin dependency of receptor-operated signaling is the phosphorylation of β-arrestins themselves. Several phosphorylated residues have been identified in the β-arrestin sequences, including Ser<sup>412</sup> for β-arrestin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barthet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 1999</xref>) and Thr<sup>276</sup>, Ser<sup>361</sup> and Thr<sup>383</sup> for β-arrestin2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paradis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2002</xref>). These phosphorylation events affect GPCR internalization and/or sequestration and, consequently, steady-state level of GPCR cell-surface expression: phosphorylation of β-arrestin1 at Ser<sup>412</sup> by Erk1/2 as well as the phosphorylation of β-arrestin2 at both Ser<sup>361</sup> and Thr<sup>383</sup> reduce their ability to induce internalization of β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2002</xref>), whereas phosphorylation of β-arrestin2 at Ser<sup>14</sup> and Thr<sup>276</sup> promotes intracellular sequestration of CXCR4 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paradis et al., 2015</xref>). These results indicate that β-arrestin2 phosphorylation exerts contrasting effects on GPCR trafficking that may depend on the nature of the phosphorylated residue(s) and of the GPCR. Another phosphorylated site (Ser<sup>178</sup>) was identified in rat/mouse β-arrestin2 and its phosphorylation state affects endosomal trafficking of various GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Khoury et al., 2014</xref>). However, this serine residue is not conserved in other species including human, suggesting different regulations of endosomal GPCR trafficking between species. Additional phosphorylated residues have been found on β-arrestin2 in large-scale phosphoproteomics screens, but their functional relevance remains to be established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pighi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sharma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballif et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Villén et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choudhary et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jørgensen et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast to its role in GPCR trafficking, the influence of β-arrestin phosphorylation on GPCR-operated β-arrestin-dependent signaling such as Erk1/2 activation remains unexplored.</p><p>Here, we investigated the impact on β-arrestin1 and 2 phosphorylation of expression/stimulation of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> and 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors, two GPCRs that differ in their β-arrestin dependency to promote Erk1/2 activation, using high-resolution mass spectrometry. We identified several previously described as well as novel phosphorylated residues on β-arrestin2, while only one phosphorylated site was found on β-arrestin1. Of these, only phosphorylation of β-arrestin2 at Thr<sup>383</sup> exhibited a strong increase upon 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor stimulation. Furthermore, Thr<sup>383</sup> was poorly phosphorylated in cells expressing 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor and its phosphorylation was only slightly enhanced by agonist treatment. These findings prompted functional studies to evaluate the influence of this phosphorylation event in Erk1/2 phosphorylation elicited by stimulation of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor and other GPCRs known to engage Erk signaling in a β-arrestin-dependent manner, in comparison with 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor stimulation, which induces Erk1/2 activation through a β-arrestin-independent mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>5-HT<sub>2C</sub> and 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor stimulation induce distinct patterns of β-arrestin phosphorylation</title><p>To characterize in a global manner the impact of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> and 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor expression/stimulation on the phosphorylation state of β-arrestins, YFP-tagged versions of β-arrestin1 or β-arrestin2 were co-expressed with Myc-tagged 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> or 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors in HEK-293 cells. Cells were then treated with vehicle or 5-HT for 5 or 30 min. β-arrestins were immunoprecipitated using GFP nanobodies coupled to sepharose beads (GFP-Trap), resolved by SDS-PAGE, detected by colloidal Coomassie blue staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and digested in-gel with trypsin. Analysis of the resulting peptides by nano-LC-MS/MS yielded 88% and 85% sequence coverage for β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2, respectively, with a p-value threshold of 0.01 for peptide identification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Only one phosphorylated site (Thr<sup>374</sup>) was identified on β-arrestin1, but the corresponding phosphorylated peptide was only detected in cells expressing 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor, and with a low phosphorylation index, as estimated by dividing the MS signal intensity of the phosphorylated peptide by the sum of MS signal intensities of the phosphorylated and the corresponding non-phosphorylated peptide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, see also the fragmentation spectrum that pinpoints the position of the phosphorylation site on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Previous studies using a phosphorylated site-specific antibody have identified Ser<sup>412</sup> as an additional phosphorylated residue on β-arrestin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barthet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 1999</xref>). They also indicated that Ser<sup>412</sup> phosphorylation state is modified upon activation of various GPCRs, including the 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barthet et al., 2009</xref>). Our MS/MS analyses did not identify this phosphorylated residue, but a low-intensity ion signal corresponding to the theoretical m/z of a peptide comprising the phosphorylated Ser<sup>412</sup> was detected in cells expressing the 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor and exposed for 30 min to 5-HT.</p><p>Six phosphorylated residues (Thr<sup>178</sup>, Ser<sup>194</sup>, Ser<sup>267/268</sup>, Ser<sup>281</sup>, Ser<sup>361</sup> and Thr<sup>383</sup>) were identified on β-arrestin2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">5</xref>). Note that the fragmentation spectrum of the CPVAQLEQDDQVSPp(S<sup>267</sup>S<sup>268</sup>)TFCK peptide did not provide enough information to discriminate between a phosphorylation at Ser<sup>267</sup> or at Ser<sup>268</sup>, but the precursor peptide m/z clearly showed that it carries only one phosphorylated residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Relative quantification of MS signals of β-arrestin2 phosphorylated peptides showed that the phosphorylation of these residues except for Thr<sup>383</sup> was not affected by 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> or 5HT<sub>4</sub> receptor expression or stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). In cells expressing the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor, Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation showed a marked elevation after a 5-min 5-HT stimulation, which persisted 30 min after the onset of the treatment. Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation slightly but not significantly increased after the 30-min 5-HT challenge in cells expressing 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor and was much less pronounced than that measured in presence of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). We next examined whether 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor stimulation likewise induces phosphorylation of endogenous β-arrestin2 at Thr<sup>383</sup>, but did not detect any ion signal corresponding to the phosphorylated peptide comprising this residue in cells not transfected with the YFP-β-arrestin2 plasmid. We thus generated a polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes β-arrestin2 phosphorylated at Thr<sup>383</sup> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Western blot experiments using this antibody showed that 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor stimulation induces a substantial increase in endogenous β-arrestin2 phosphorylation at Thr<sup>383</sup>, while activation of the 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor did not affect its phosphorylation level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>), corroborating the MS/MS analysis of ectopic β-arrestin2 phosphorylation.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23777.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>5-HT<sub>2C</sub> and 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor stimulation promotes β-arrestin2 phosphorylation in HEK-293 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ribbon diagram of rat β-arrestin2 showing the position of phosphorylated residues identified by LS-MS/MS.

GPS search also suggested that Thr<sup>383</sup> is a potential site for phosphorylation by MAP2K1 (MEK1, GPS score 6.0). Numerous studies have shown that β-arrestins associated with a GPCR can interact with different signaling proteins including c-Src and several proteins of the Erk signaling module (Raf/MEK/Erk), and that these interactions depend on β-arrestin conformational state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xiao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gurevich and Gurevich, 2003</xref>).</p><p>In line with these findings, we have recently modeled the complex between a GPCR, β-arrestin2, c-Src and the Erk module from the 3D structure of each partner, using the Protein-Protein cOmplexes 3D structure pRediction (PRIOR) docking algorithm, and validated experimentally the previously unknown interaction regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourquard et al., 2015</xref>). This model predicts that the unfolded C-terminal part of β-arrestin comprising Thr<sup>383</sup> is located in the vicinity of the MEK active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating a possible role of MEK bound to β-arrestin2 in its phosphorylation. Based on this model, we hypothesized that the mechanism of β-arrestin-dependent activation of Erk consists in the following steps: (i) Raf and MEK assemble to β-arrestin2 bound to agonist-stimulated receptor, resulting in MEK activation, (ii) MEK phosphorylates β-arrestin2 at Thr<sup>383</sup>, resulting in a large conformational change of the β-arrestin2 region comprising residues 350–393, (iii) the receptor C-terminus associates with β-arrestin2 using the region previously occupied by the 383–393 β-strand within the β-arrestin2 C-terminal tail and (iv) Erk binds to the complex and can be activated by MEK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, pretreatment of cells with the MEK pharmacological inhibitor U0126 (5 µM) abolished Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation elicited by 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Expression of a MEK1 dominant-negative inhibitor (MEK1DN) also strongly reduced Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> for controls showing strong MEK inhibition induced by both approaches, as assessed by monitoring phosphorylation of Erk1/2). In contrast, pretreating cells with FR180204 (10 µM), a selective pharmacological inhibitor of Erk1/2, did not affect Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The ability of FR180204 treatment to inhibit Erk1/2 activity without affecting MEK activity in our experimental conditions was assessed by monitoring phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and their substrate Elk1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Collectively, these results identify MEK as the major kinase involved in phosphorylation of β-arrestin2 at Thr<sup>383</sup> upon 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor stimulation. To further confirm the ability of MEK to directly phosphorylate this residue, we performed an in vitro kinase assay using purified active MEK1 and YFP-β-arrestin2 purified from transfected HEK-293 cells as substrate, followed by Western blotting using the anti-phospho-Thr<sup>383</sup>β-arrestin2 antibody. MEK1 induced a strong elevation in the immunoreactive signal that was abolished by adding U0126 in the incubation medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). As expected, no increase in immunoreactive signal was observed in experiments using YFP-Thr<sup>383</sup>Ala β-arrestin2 mutant as substrate, thus validating the specificity of the antibody for β-arrestin2 phosphorylated at Thr<sup>383</sup>. This result was confirmed using a radioactive kinase assay, which also showed comparable efficacy of MEK1 to promote phosphorylation of purified β-arrestin2 and its canonical substrate Erk2 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 2—figure supplement 3—source data 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>β-arrestin2 phosphorylation at Thr<sup>383</sup> neither affects translocation of β-arrestin2 to 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> and 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors nor agonist-induced receptor internalization</title><p>To explore whether Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation affects the recruitment of β-arrestin2 by 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> and 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors, we monitored interaction between each receptor and either wild type or Thr<sup>383</sup>Ala or Thr<sup>383</sup>Asp β-arrestin2 mutants using a BRET-based assay.

To explore the impact of Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation on conformational changes of β-arrestin2 induced by 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor activation <italic>vs.</italic> 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor activation, we used an optimized intramolecular BRET biosensor consisting of β-arrestin2 sandwiched between the <italic>Renilla</italic> green fluorescent protein (RGFP) and the <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase variant Rluc8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kamal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Charest et al., 2005</xref>). When β-arrestin2 conformation changes, the distance between Rluc8 and RGFP increases or decreases leading to a BRET signal decrease or increase. Treating cells coexpressing 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor and WT RLuc8-β-arrestin2-RGFP with 5-HT increased the BRET signal. No BRET increase was detected upon agonist exposure in cells coexpressing the receptor and T<sup>383</sup>A RLuc8-β-arrestin2-RGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Mutation of Thr<sup>383</sup> into aspartate in RLuc8-β-arrestin2-RGFP also resulted in an increase in BRET signal to a level similar to the one measured in cells expressing the wild type probe and exposed to 5-HT, and 5-HT treatment did not further enhance this elevated BRET signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, substitution of Thr<sup>383</sup> by alanine or aspartate did not affect the increase in RLuc8-β-arrestin2-RGFP BRET signal induced by 5-HT treatment in cells expressing 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that β-arrestin2 conformational change elicited by 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor stimulation, but not 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor stimulation, depends on Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>β-arrestin2 phosphorylation at Thr<sup>383</sup> is essential for Erk1/2 translocation to the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor/β-arrestin2 complex</title><p>As previously hypothesized, it can be envisioned that the unfolded C-terminal region of β-arrestin2 occupies the docking site of Erk1/2 located in the vicinity of MEK catalytic site in the receptor/β-arrestin2 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Consequently, Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation status might affect Erk1/2 recruitment. In fact, our model predicts that Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation should induce a movement of the β-arrestin2 C-terminal region away from the complex leaving space for further recruitment of Erk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To explore this possibility, we compared the ability of wild type and Thr<sup>383</sup>Ala and Thr<sup>383</sup>Asp β-arrestin2 to recruit Erk1/2 upon 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor stimulation by co-immunoprecipitation. Treating 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor-expressing cells with 5-HT increased the amount of Erk1/2 co-immunoprecipitated with β-arrestin2, an effect abolished by mutating Thr<sup>383</sup> into Ala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).

Further supporting a role of Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation by MEK, treatment of cells with U0126 prevented recruitment of Erk1,2 by β-arrestin2 induced by 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Figure 4—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>). 5-HT did not promote Erk1/2 recruitment by β-arrestin2 in cells coexpressing 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor and either wild type or mutated forms of β-arrestin2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

We also explored the influence on their phosphorylation status of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> and 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors, two model GPCRs that engage the Erk1/2 pathway through β-arrestin-dependent and independent mechanisms, respectively. We identified one phosphorylated site on β-arrestin1 and six on β-arrestin2, including three previously identified residues (Ser<sup>178</sup>, Ser<sup>361</sup> and Thr<sup>383</sup>) and three new sites (Ser<sup>194</sup>, Ser<sup>267/268</sup> and Ser<sup>281</sup>). Two of the β-arrestin2 phosphorylated sites identified (Ser<sup>194</sup>, Ser<sup>267/268</sup>) are conserved in β-arrestin1, but we did not detect the corresponding phosphorylated peptides in β-arrestin1. Although MS/MS does not allow exhaustive identification of peptides present in complex samples, it is unlikely that our analyses, which covered about of 85% of the sequence of both arrestins, missed these phosphorylated residues on β-arrestin1 or any other robustly phosphorylated residues on both arrestins. Therefore, our results corroborate previous findings which identified much more phosphorylated residues on β-arrestin2 than on β-arrestin1 and suggest that β-arrestin2 is phosphorylated at higher stoichiometry, compared with β-arrestin1. Our analyses did not detect, even in 5-HT-treated cells, another site conserved between both β-arrestins (Ser<sup>276</sup>) that was previously reported as being phosphorylated by recombinant active Erk1 in an in vitro phosphorylation assay followed by MS/MS analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paradis et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that in cells expressing 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> or 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor, the level of Erk1/2 activity and/or the molecular environment of this serine residue do not allow its phosphorylation at high stoichiometry.</p><p>Amongst β-arrestin2 phosphorylated residues identified in the present study, only the phosphorylation of Thr<sup>383</sup> was modulated upon agonist stimulation of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor and, to a much lesser extent, 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor. In silico search of kinase-specific phosphorylation sites in β-arrestin2 sequence identified Thr<sup>383</sup> as a strong consensus for phosphorylation by CK2, consistent with previous findings which showed that Thr<sup>383</sup> is phosphorylated by CK2 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2002</xref>), and by MEK. Our results indicate that MEK rather than CK2 is involved in Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation elicited by 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor stimulation in living HEK-293 cells, consistent with our docking model of the receptor/β-arrestin2/MEK complex, which predicts that the unfolded C-terminal part of β-arrestin comprising Thr<sup>383</sup> is located in the vicinity of MEK active site.</p><p>In an effort to characterize the functional impact of Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation, we found that its replacement by alanine or aspartate to inhibit or mimic its phosphorylation, did not modify β-arrestin2 translocation to the receptor nor agonist-induced receptor internalization. This result corroborates previous observations indicating that the sole substitution of Thr<sup>383</sup> to aspartate or alanine does not affect isoproterenol-induced β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin et al., 2002</xref>). In fact, only the double substitution of Ser<sup>361</sup> and Thr<sup>383</sup> to aspartate inhibited agonist-induced receptor internalization, an effect reflecting the reduced ability of this double β-arrestin mutant to bind to clathrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin et al., 2002</xref>). It is likely that the phosphorylation stoichiometry of Ser<sup>361</sup> and Thr<sup>383</sup> in our experimental conditions, including cells exposed to 5-HT, does not allow such a regulation. Moreover, previous studies showed that β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor stimulation decreases rather than enhances the phosphorylation of these residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2002</xref>). Accordingly, these studies and our results suggest that β-arrestin2 phosphorylation at Thr<sup>383</sup> might only have a minor influence on GPCR trafficking. In contrast, expressing Thr<sup>276</sup>Ala or Ser<sup>14</sup>Ala β-arrestin2 mutants in β-arrestin1/2 knockout cells fails to restore agonist-induced CXCR4 receptor sequestration while expressing a β-arrestin2 mutant harboring an aspartate at these positions is sufficient to decrease cell surface localization in the absence of agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paradis et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that Thr<sup>276</sup> and/or Ser<sup>14</sup> phosphorylation rather than Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation might be critical for agonist-induced intracellular sequestration of some GPCRs.</p><p>Our results establish a causal link between Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation and β-arrestin2 conformational rearrangements, assessed by double brilliance BRET assay, elicited upon 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor stimulation. They corroborate previous observations suggesting that conformational changes of β-arrestin do not directly result from its binding to phosphorylated GPCRs, but from downstream events, such as subsequent recruitment of β-arrestin interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Charest et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xiao et al., 2007</xref>). Nonetheless, Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation dependency of β-arrestin2 conformational changes seems to also depend on the nature of the GPCR it associates with, as the increase in intramolecular BRET signal measured upon 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor stimulation was not affected by substituting Thr<sup>383</sup> by alanine or by aspartate.</p><p>The present study also identified Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation as an essential molecular step allowing Erk1/2 translocation to the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>/β-arrestin2/MEK complex and subsequent activation of Erk1/2 signaling upon 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor stimulation. Based on the current experimental results and our previously validated docking model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourquard et al., 2015</xref>), we propose a molecular mechanism which might explain the role of Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation in recruitment and activation of Erk at the activated β-arrestin. In the crystal structures of both β-arrestin1 (PDB 1G4R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Han et al., 2001</xref>) and β-arrestin2 (PDB 3P2D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhan et al., 2011</xref>), the segment of the C-terminal tail comprising residues 385–393 folds as a β-strand, which associates with the first N-terminal β-strand. The crystal structure of β-arrestin1 in complex with a C-terminal peptide of the V2 receptor (PDB 4JQI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shukla et al., 2013</xref>), also shows that the C-terminal peptide of the receptor occupies the same location as the 385–393 segment of the inactive β-arrestin. Consequently, a drastic conformational change of the 385–393 β-arrestin segment is necessary for the correct association of β-arrestin with the receptor. Furthermore, our previously reported docking model shows that the C-terminal region of the receptor is sandwiched between β-arrestin and Erk, and thus has to associate with β-arrestin before its association with Erk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourquard et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, although Thr<sup>383</sup> is not present in the different structures of β-arrestins, the position of Asp<sup>385</sup> shows that Thr<sup>383</sup> is located in the vicinity of β-arrestin-bound MEK’s active site, where it can be phosphorylated. In our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation by MEK takes place within the ligand-dependent receptor/β-arrestin/Raf/MEK complex. We propose that this phosphorylation triggers the conformational change of the 350–393 region, allowing the interaction of β-arrestin with the receptor C-terminal domain, the subsequent binding of Erk to the complex and its activation by MEK.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23777.027</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the sequence of events proposed for β-arrestin-dependent Erk1/2 activation by GPCRs.</title><p>β-arrestin, Raf and MEK are recruited to agonist-stimulated receptor, resulting in MEK activation. Active MEK phosphorylates β-arrestin2 at Thr<sup>383</sup>. This induces a movement of the β-arrestin2 350–393 segment away from the first β-strand of β-arrestin, leaving space for its interaction with the C-terminal domain of the receptor. Erk then binds to the complex and is activated by MEK. The dash circles represent activated enzymes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23777.027">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23777.027</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-23777-fig6-v2"/></fig></p><p>This mechanism, initially established for the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor, a GPCR which elicits Erk1/2 signaling mainly through a β-arrestin-dependent mechanism, appears to be conserved among GPCRs that induce Erk1/2 activation through the classic dual mechanism involving both G proteins and β-arrestins, such as β-adrenergic, CXCR4 and FSH receptors. Actually, the sustained Erk1/2 phosphorylation induced by agonist stimulation of these receptors was strongly reduced in cells expressing the Thr<sup>383</sup>Ala β-arrestin2 mutant. In contrast, substitution of Thr<sup>383</sup> by aspartate increased the basal level of Erk1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting that phosphorylated β-arrestin2 can recruit and subsequently activate Erk1/2 in absence of receptor stimulation. As expected, 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor-operated Erk1/2 phosphorylation, which is β-arrestin-independent, was not affected by substituting Thr<sup>383</sup> by alanine. This result is consistent with the low Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation level measured in cells expressing 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors, compared with cells expressing 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>, and suggests that Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation might be a key molecular event governing β-arrestin dependency of Erk1/2 pathway engagement by GPCRs.</p><p>In conclusion, our study identifies MEK-elicited β-arrestin2 phosphorylation at Thr<sup>383</sup> as a key molecular event underlying β-arrestin-dependent Erk1/2 activation by GPCRs. Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation has recently been involved in β-arrestin2 association with transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) at the plasma membrane, which is critical for its role in regulating receptor desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Por et al., 2013</xref>). This underscores the potentially high influence of Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation upon various β-arrestin2 functions related or not to GPCRs, while the phosphorylation of other residues (Ser<sup>14</sup> and Thr<sup>276</sup>) might govern steady state level of GPCR cell-surface expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paradis et al., 2015</xref>). This also indicates that β-arrestin2 can integrate upstream signals not only <italic>via</italic> its conformational changes upon association with receptors but also through a complex phosphorylation pattern that dictates downstream signaling events and the associated physiological functions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>Human Embryonic Kidney-293 (HEK-293) N type cells (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0045">CVCL_0045</ext-link>) were from the American Type Culture Collection ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manassas">anassas</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia">VI, </ext-link>ATCC, CRL-1573).

Membranes were immunoblotted with primary antibodies (anti phospho-Thr<sup>202</sup>/Tyr<sup>204</sup>-Erk1/2, 1:1000; anti Erk1/2, 1:1000; anti-Flag, 1:1000; Anti-GFP, 1:1000; anti-Myc, 1:1000; anti-phospho-Thr<sup>383</sup>-β-arrestin2, 1:5000; anti-β-arrestin2, 1:1000; anti-pan arrestin, 1/1000) and then with either anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000, GE Healthcare). Immunoreactivity was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence method (ECL plus detection reagent, Perkin Elmer, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waltham,_Massachusetts">Waltham, MA</ext-link>). Immunoreactive bands were quantified by densitometry using the ImageJ software. In protein phosphorylation analyses, the amount of each phosphoprotein was normalized to the corresponding total protein signal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>ELISA</title><p>Quantification of cell surface expression of Myc-tagged 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> and 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors was performed by ELISA under permeabilized (Triton X-100 0.05%) <italic>vs.</italic> non-permeabilized conditions, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chanrion et al., 2008</xref>). Dilutions for primary antibodies were 1:2000 (Anti-Myc) and 1:500 (anti-integrin β1). Dilutions for secondary antibodies were 1:5000 (donkey anti-goat conjugated to HRP) and 1:8000 (goat anti-mouse conjugated to HRP). Immunoreactive signal was detected with a M200 Infinite plate reader (Tecan), using the SuperSignal ELISA Femto chromogenic substrate (Thermo Scientific). Control experiments were performed using cells transfected with empty vectors and values were normalized with respect to the total amount of protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>BRET experiments</title><p>HEK-293 cells were transiently co-transfected with either pEYFP-N1-Myc-5-HT<sub>2C</sub> or pEYFP-N1-Myc-5-HT<sub>4</sub> plasmids and either pcDNA3-Rluc-βARR2 or pcDNA3-Rluc-βARR2<sup>T383A</sup> or pcDNA3-Rluc-βARR2<sup>T383D</sup> plasmids for β-arrestin2 recruitment to receptors. For double brilliance β-arrestin2 assays, they were co-transfected with either pRK5-Myc-5-HT<sub>2C</sub> or pRK5-Myc-5-HT<sub>4</sub> and either pCMV-Rluc8-βARR2-RGFP or pCMV-Rluc8-βARR2<sup>T383A</sup>-RGFP or pCMV-Rluc8-βARR2<sup>T383D</sup>-RGFP. Cells were grown in 96-well micro-plates (6 Í 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well) for 48 hr and starved of serum for 6 hr. Cells were washed once with PBS and Coelenterazine H (Sigma-Aldrich) was added at a final concentration of 5 μM for 10 min. Cells were then challenged with 5-HT for 30 min. BRET readings were performed using a Mithras LB940 multimode microplate reader (Berthold Technologies, Germany) allowing sequential integration of luminescence with three filter settings: Rluc filter, 485 ± 10 nm; YFP filter, 530 ± 12.5 nm; RGFP filter, 515 ± 10 nm. Emission signals at 530 nm or 515 nm were divided by emission signals at 485 nm. The difference between this emission ratio obtained with donor and acceptor co-expressed or fused and that obtained with the donor protein expressed alone was defined as the BRET ratio. Results are expressed in milliBRET units corresponding to the BRET ratio multiplied by 1,000.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Docking</title><p>Modeling of the receptor/ß-arrestin/Erk module was made using the PRIOR method, and the PDB structures and methodology indicated in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourquard et al., 2015</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tony Hunter (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions, we regret to inform you that we cannot accept your manuscript for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. We are therefore returning the manuscript to you at this time. Substantial revision will be required to address the criticisms raised during the review. If you are able to fully address these criticisms after the completion of new experimentation, we would happy to consider a new manuscript for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study reports the mechanism by which serotonin 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors activate the ERK pathway via the β-arrestin2 scaffold protein. The authors propose that MEK promotes the phosphorylation of β-arrestin2 at Thr<sup>383</sup> and that this is necessary for recruitment of ERK to the receptor complex and its subsequent activation. The findings are potentially very interesting and reveal a novel signaling mechanism for the activation of ERK MAPK downstream of GPCRs. However, further experiments are required to confirm the proposed model and it is a concern that all the experiments rely on the ectopic expression of β-arrestin2 and GPCRs in cells.</p><p>Major Points:</p><p>1) There is no direct evidence presented that MEK phosphorylates Thr<sup>383</sup> on β-arrestin2. Does purified MEK phosphorylate β-arrestin2 in vitro? How does MEK phosphorylation of β-arrestin2 compare with that of known MEK substrates?</p><p>2) All the experiments, including the MS analysis, are performed on overexpressed YFP-β-arrestin2. It is important to demonstrate that 5-HT induces Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation of endogenous β-arrestin2 to regulate ERK signaling.</p><p>3) The proposed model is that MEK phosphorylation of β-arrestin2 promotes ERK recruitment. To support this, it should be shown that MEK inhibition prevents ERK recruitment to β-arrestin2.</p><p>4) CK2 has previously been reported to phosphorylate Thr<sup>383</sup> on β-arrestin2. The authors suggest in the Discussion that CK2 may be responsible for the basal levels of Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation. They should demonstrate that inhibition of CK2 does not affect 5-HT-induced Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation.</p><p>5) It is unclear how Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation causes recruitment of ERK nor do the data presented inform us about the activation mechanism, since increased ERK retention could equally well result in a block in ERK activation.</p><p>6) The relative expression of proteins (e.g. receptor and scaffold) in the transfection assays is unclear, and needs to be included.</p><p>7) The authors could have provided a more coherent description of the proposed model. The BRET data suggests that the N and C-termini of β-arrestin2 come into closer proximity upon 5-HT treatment and that this is promoted by Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This is consistent with previously reported conformational changes in β-arrestin2 following GPCR activation. However, the model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, and discussed in the fifth paragraph of the Discussion, describes the C-terminal tail moving away from the receptor/β-arrestin2 complex to create space for ERK recruitment.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Phosphorylation of β-arrestin2 at Thr<sup>383</sup> by MEK underlies β-arrestin dependent activation of Erk1/2 by GPCRs&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Does purified MEK phosphorylate β-arrestin2</italic> in vitro<italic>? How does MEK phosphorylation of β-arrestin2 compare with that of known MEK substrates?</italic> </p><p>Using an in vitro kinase assay followed by Western blotting performed with a newly generated polyclonal antibody against phosphorylated Thr<sup>383</sup> (see Point 2), we show that purified MEK phosphorylates β-arrestin2 purified from HEK-293 cells on Thr<sup>383</sup> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and “Results”, subsection “Role of MEK in β-arrestin2 phosphorylation at Thr<sup>383</sup> elicited by 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor stimulation”, last paragraph). As expected, no increase in Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation was seen in presence of the MEK inhibitor U0126.</p><p><italic>2) All the experiments, including the MS analysis, are performed on overexpressed YFP-β-arrestin2. It is important to demonstrate that 5-HT induces Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation of endogenous β-arrestin2 to regulate ERK signaling.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that it is an important issue. Unfortunately, we did not detect by MS/MS any phosphorylated peptide of endogenously expressed arrestins, even after their immunoprecipitation from large cell lysate amounts, likely due to their low expression level in HEK-293 cells and the low immunoprecipitation yield (less than 10%) using commercially available anti-β-arrestin2 antibodies. We thus generated and validated a polyclonal antibody against phosphorylated Thr<sup>383</sup> (see on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> the data showing the specificity of the antibody for β-arrestin2 phosphorylated at Thr<sup>383</sup>) and showed that 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor stimulation, induces a substantial increase in endogenous β-arrestin2 on Thr<sup>383</sup>, while activation of the 5- HT<sub>4</sub> receptor (known to activate Erk1/2 via a β-arrestin-independent mechanism) does not affect its phosphorylation state, corroborating the results of MS/MS analysis of ectopic β- arrestin2 phosphorylation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and “Results”, subsection “5-HT<sub>2C</sub> and 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor stimulation induce distinct patterns of β-arrestin phosphorylation”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) The proposed model is that MEK phosphorylation of β-arrestin2 promotes ERK recruitment. To support this, it should be shown that MEK inhibition prevents ERK recruitment to β-arrestin2.</italic> </p><p>Consistent with the proposed model, we show that treating 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor expressing cells with the MEK inhibitor U0126 abolishes Erk recruitment to β-arrestin2 (assessed by co- immunoprecipitation). This result is illustrated on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and commented on in the subsection “β-arrestin2 phosphorylation at Thr<sup>383</sup> is essential for Erk1/2 translocation to the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor/β-arrestin2 complex”).</p><p><italic>4) CK2 has previously been reported to phosphorylate Thr<sup>383</sup> on β-arrestin2. The authors suggest in the Discussion that CK2 may be responsible for the basal levels of Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation. They should demonstrate that inhibition of CK2 does not affect 5-HT-induced Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation.</italic> </p><p>We show that Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation elicited upon 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor stimulation is not affected by treating cells with the selective cell-permeable CK2 pharmacological inhibitor tetrabromocinnamic acid (TBCA, See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, and “Results”, subsection “Role of MEK in β-arrestin2 phosphorylation at Thr<sup>383</sup> elicited by 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor stimulation”, first paragraph). Note that previously published studies only reported the phosphorylation of this residue by purified CK2 in vitro. Our results suggest that CK2 plays a minor role (if any) in Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation in HEK-293 cells and that MEK might be the main kinase responsible for this phosphorylation in living cells. We have thus modified the Discussion accordingly (second paragraph).</p><p><italic>5) It is unclear how Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation causes recruitment of ERK nor do the data presented inform us about the activation mechanism, since increased ERK retention could equally well result in a block in ERK activation.</italic> </p><p>Numerous studies have demonstrated that recruitment of Erk, together with Raf and MEK, to activated GPCR/β-arrestin complex results in Erk activation. In this paper, we propose a mechanistic model whereby β-arrestin2 phosphorylation of Thr<sup>383</sup> by MEK, within the receptor/β-arrestin2/Raf/MEK complex, is responsible for a large conformational change of β-arrestin2 region comprising residues 350-393. This model is based on (i) the fact that this region in inactive β-arrestin2 interacts with the N-terminal region and has to be displaced for the interaction of this N-terminal region of β-arrestin with the receptor C-tail, (ii) our experimentally validated docking model which shows that in the receptor/β-arrestin/Raf/MEK/Erk complex, the receptor C-tail is sandwiched between β-arrestin and Erk and, consequently, that the conformational change has to take place before interaction with Erk and (iii) our experiments indicating that Erk is not recruited to the complex in absence of this phosphorylation. This is of course only a model. Though different hypotheses could be formulated, this model led us to make the hypothesis and then to validate that MEK is responsible for Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation, and it accounts for all the existing knowledge. We have largely modified the Discussion (fifth paragraph) to better distinguish the elements that are demonstrated and those which remain hypothetical.</p><p><italic>6) The relative expression of proteins (e.g. receptor and scaffold) in the transfection assays is unclear, and needs to be included.</italic> </p><p>We now provide in “Materials and methods” (subsection “Cell cultures and transfections”) the expression levels of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> and 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors (0.29 and 0.90 pmol/mg proteins, assessed by non-saturating binding experiments using [<sup>3</sup>H]-mesulergine and [<sup>3</sup>H]-GR113808, respectively) and an estimation (thanks to Western blot experiments) of cellular levels of β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 in transfected cells (~1,600 pmol/mg protein and ~300 pmol/mg protein, respectively), based on previously published levels of the endogenous proteins in HEK-293 cells (Ahn et al. J Biol Chem, 279:7807-7811, 2004).</p><p><italic>7) The authors could have provided a more coherent description of the proposed model. The BRET data suggests that the N and C-termini of β-arrestin2 come into closer proximity upon 5-HT treatment and that this is promoted by Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This is consistent with previously reported conformational changes in β-arreston2 following GPCR activation. However, the model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, and discussed in the fifth paragraph of the Discussion, describes the C-terminal tail moving away from the receptor/β-arrestin2 complex to create space for ERK recruitment.</italic> </p><p>The only conclusion that can be raised from our intramolecular BRET experiments is a conformational change of β-arrestin2 upon 5-HT treatment that depends on Thr<sup>383</sup> phosphorylation. Such experiments do not provide information regarding the exact nature of the conformational change. Our mechanistic hypotheses only concern the region of the β-arrestin2 C-tail comprising residues 350-393, and do not suggest conformational changes affecting the C-terminal extremity. This was indeed unclear in the previously presented model. We have now clarified this point by representing the 393-419 region of β-arrestin2, for which we do not make any hypothesis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>).</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been substantially improved, but there is one remaining issue that needs to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic> </p><p><italic>Point 1: The new data demonstrating that MEK phosphorylates Thr<sup>383</sup> in β-arrestin2 in vitro are important. However, these data do not address the question in the original decision: &quot;How does MEK phosphorylation of β-arrestin2 compare with that of a known MEK substrate?&quot; A direct comparison of the efficiency of phosphorylation of β-arrestin2 and ERK using an in vitro kinase assay is needed.</italic> </p><p>As you requested, we now provide an in vitro kinase assay, which shows that MEK1 induces phosphorylation of purified β-arrestin2 and its canonical substrate Erk2 with comparable efficacies. This new result is illustrated on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> and described in the last paragraph of the subsection “Role of MEK in β-arrestin2 phosphorylation at Thr<sup>383</sup> elicited by 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor stimulation. The protocol of the radioactive kinase assay used has also been added in the Materials and methods section (subsection “In vitro kinase assays”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
