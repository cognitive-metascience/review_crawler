A key question emerges regarding how this behaviour contributes to tissue phenotype, but it has been a challenge to quantitatively analyse this in living cells over time, as opposed to studying snap-shots of gene expression state. We have used imaging of reporter gene expression to track transcription in living pituitary tissue. We integrated live-cell imaging data with statistical modelling for quantitative real-time estimation of the timing of switching between transcriptional states across a whole tissue. Multiple levels of transcription rate were identified, indicating that gene expression is not a simple binary ‘on-off’ process. Immature tissue displayed shorter durations of high-expressing states than the adult. In adult pituitary tissue, direct cell contacts involving gap junctions allowed local spatial coordination of prolactin gene expression. Our findings identify how heterogeneous transcriptional dynamics of single cells may contribute to overall tissue behaviour.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08494.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08494.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08494.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Although humans have thousands of genes, only a fraction of these are expressed in any given cell. Each cell type expresses only the genes that are relevant to its particular job or that are necessary for general cell maintenance. Even these genes are not expressed all the time: most cells express genes in bursts, and the cells that make up a tissue produce these bursts at different times. This makes it easier for the tissue to respond to new conditions.</p><p>The pituitary gland, found at the base of the brain, is often studied to investigate changes in gene expression. The pituitary gland is found in all animals that have a backbone, and it makes and releases many different hormones. For example, one type of pituitary cell expresses the gene that encodes a hormone called prolactin. This hormone has a range of roles, including stimulating milk production and regulating fertility in mammals. The coordinated production of prolactin by pituitary cells is important for reproduction, but it is not clear how (or whether) individual prolactin-producing cells in the gland communicate to coordinate bursting patterns of expression of the prolactin gene.</p><p>Featherstone et al. marked the prolactin-encoding gene in the pituitary cells of rats with a gene that encodes a fluorescent protein; this enabled the gene’s activity to be observed in thin slices of living tissue using a microscope. Mathematical models were then used to analyse the recorded expression patterns.</p><p>The results showed that in a single cell, the bursts of expression of the prolactin gene are randomly timed. This means that although the expression activity of an individual cell is unpredictable, the overall activity of a group of cells can be precisely determined. The model also showed that cells coordinate when they express the prolactin gene to a greater extent with their near neighbours than with cells that are further away in the tissue. Featherstone et al. found that this coordination depends on structures (called gap junctions) that connect the cells and allow signalling between them, and this tissue organisation is established during early development.</p><p>The mechanisms underlying the timing of the bursts remain to be discovered. The timing for the prolactin gene seems to be dominated by a minimum delay that must occur before the next burst can be reactivated. Future challenges also include determining whether coordinated gene expression occurs in other tissues and whether this coordination is disrupted in disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08494.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08494.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Transcription Dynamics</kwd><kwd>Spatial Organisation</kwd><kwd>Stochastic Modelling</kwd><kwd>Live-Cell Microscopy</kwd><kwd>Pituitary</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Programme grant: WT091688</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>Julian RE</given-names></name><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Michael RH</given-names></name><name><surname>Rand</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000266</institution-id><institution>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD Studentship grant: ASTAA1112.KXH</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hey</surname><given-names>Kirsty</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/K015885/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spiller</surname><given-names>David G</given-names></name><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Michael RH</given-names></name><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>Julian RE</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/K003097/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rand</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Michael RH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Quantitative statistical modelling reveals local coordination of stochastic gene transcription dynamics in pituitary tissue, which is relevant for integrated tissue responses to physiological stimuli.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gene expression in single living cells is often pulsatile and heterogeneous between cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sanchez and Golding, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coulon et al., 2013</xref>). In a complex three-dimensional (3D) tissue, dynamic and heterogeneous single cell behaviour gives rise to the overall tissue-level gene expression state and determines the ability of the tissue to respond appropriately to acute and chronic stimuli. Transcriptional bursting, defined by periods of RNA synthesis followed by usually longer silent periods, occurs at many genes with characteristic gene-specific timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Suter et al., 2011</xref>). These dynamics have been proposed to be influenced by intrinsic factors that appear stochastic and extrinsic factors that reflect the state of the cell. Thus far, the key to identifying these processes has been single cell analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raj and van Oudenaarden, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Spiller et al., 2010</xref>). In situ hybridisation techniques have revealed non-equivalent activity at gene alleles within individual cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wijgerde et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raj et al., 2006</xref>), but only provide snap-shot measurements of activity. The analysis of gene expression in single living cells using real-time direct RNA imaging systems confirms these pulsatile kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chubb et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Larson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martin et al., 2013</xref>). However, direct RNA analysis is technically challenging and relatively low throughput, even over short time periods. An alternative is the use of reporter gene analysis. Whilst being indirect, this can be combined with mathematical modelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Suter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harper et al., 2011</xref>) to give a quantitative description of the dynamics of single cell gene expression.</p><p>The pituitary gland is an excellent model system in which to address how dynamic changes in gene activity are regulated in vivo. The gland is composed of multiple cell lineages that are regulated by external signalling inputs from the hypothalamus and circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Featherstone et al., 2012</xref>), as well as through complex paracrine signalling within the gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denef, 2008</xref>). The spatial positioning of cells is organised with cell networks facilitating the propagation of signals across the gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Le Tissier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mollard et al., 2012</xref>). The distinct cell types of the pituitary secrete specific hormones in an organised manner in response to developmental and environmental cues, which has proved to be a useful model system for investigating pituitary-tissue-specific and regulated gene transcription dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Featherstone et al., 2012</xref>). Prolactin (PRL) is an important pituitary-derived hormone with multiple functions that is secreted from pituitary lactotrophic cells and controlled in a complex way in response to both acute and long-term signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Featherstone et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Jonathan et al., 2008</xref>). The human PRL (hPRL) gene displays bursting activity in cell lines and primary cells, with variable periods of active and inactive transcriptional states, including a refractory period in the inactive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harper et al., 2011</xref>). For hPRL, the dynamics observed in dispersed cells are compatible with a binary mathematical model in which there is an 'off' and an 'on' state together with a preparatory or 'primed' state. The transcription machinery transitions between these states as off – primed – on – off, with the time in each state exponentially distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Suter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harper et al., 2011</xref>). We call this the telegraph process with priming.</p><p>Quantitative imaging of hPRL reporter gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Spiller et al., 2010</xref>) has been used to describe PRL gene activity in different physiological states of the pituitary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Featherstone et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harper et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we employ a new mathematical and statistical model to estimate not only the timing but also different levels of transcriptional activity. This provides a quantitative framework by which to explore temporal and spatial PRL gene expression in single cells within the anterior pituitary gland. We show that shorter durations of activity occur at high transcription rates in immature pituitary glands compared to the adult pituitary; however, we were unable to detect differences in the distribution of transcription rates in different pituitary states. These results suggest that dynamics of gene activity may have a common mechanistic basis in tissues and single cells at all stages of development, which are directly regulated by the developmental state of the tissue. Moreover, these dynamics demonstrate that transcription does not occur as a simple binary 'on-off' process with a single transcription rate in the 'on' state.</p><p>In this study we also investigated how the spatial organisation of lactotroph cells within the pituitary affect the transcription dynamics of the hPRL gene. Transcription activity was coordinated between closely localised cells within the adult gland, but in developing pituitaries this transcriptional coordination was not evident, potentially due to an immature network of cellular communication. Perturbation of cell communication in the adult gland through trypsin-mediated digestion of extracellular proteins or pharmacological inhibition of intercellular gap junctions reduced transcriptional coordination between cells. These studies provide insight into how transcription dynamics throughout development and adult life relate to the state and structure of a complex and physiologically important tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Patterns of prolactin gene transcription activity in adult pituitary tissue</title><p>To quantify PRL gene transcription dynamics within living pituitary tissue, we used transgenic rats that contain a destabilised EGFP (d2EGFP) reporter gene expressed under the control of the hPRL gene locus (hPRL-d2EGFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Semprini et al., 2009</xref>). Imaging analyses were initially performed on adult male pituitary slices (300 µm coronal sections) (as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) for up to 48 hr in basal culture medium, with fluorescence measured from all actively transcribing cells within a field of approximately 100 cells. Tissue slices were subsequently stimulated with forskolin (5 µM), inducing at least a twofold increase in signal, showing that tissue slices remain viable in culture for long periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Cells showed differing profiles of fluorescence activity during the imaging period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Generally cells increased hPRL-d2EGFP reporter gene expression, with the mean fluorescence activity reaching maximal levels at approximately 24 hr, potentially due to the removal of the pituitary from the inhibitory effects of hypothalamic dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harper et al., 2010</xref>). Autocorrelation analyses did not identify a regular homogeneous period, and fluorescence activity showed a clear deviation from a white noise process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Further quantitative analysis using a stochastic switch model (described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hey et al., 2015</xref>]) uncovered a clear statistical structure indicating a pulsatile transcriptional behaviour compatible with a pulsed telegraph process. The mathematical analysis of this is addressed in the modelling studies described below. Overall, we found that PRL transcription is dynamic within individual cells, with heterogeneous activity across the cell population.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08494.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Patterns of prolactin gene transcription activity in pituitary tissue.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the reporter construct and experimental approach used.

The original transcription rate of the reporter gene is determined by considering the contribution of mRNA translation rates and mRNA and protein degradation rates to the observed fluorescent protein activity. Binary modelling of PRL transcription dynamics using this approach identified important parameters of gene activity, including a refractory period in the 'off' state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harper et al., 2011</xref>). We have extended this approach through the development of a stochastic switch model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hey et al., 2015</xref>), which enables the inference of different levels of transcription rate as well as the timing of switches between different levels of activity. The model uses a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Green, 1995</xref>) algorithm to produce a probability distribution over all possible transcriptional profiles for each cell. Post-processing of this distribution enables the extraction of a number of candidate transcriptional profiles, each with an associated probability of occurrence (as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Consequently, the transcriptional analysis for each cell is a weighted analysis of all possible transcriptional profiles taking into account the probability of occurrence of each profile (further details of the processing of the data and algorithm output are given in 'Materials and methods'). The fit of the model was tested through calculation of recursive residuals as a way of comparing the prediction from the model and the observed data (for more information see Appendix G of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hey et al., 2015</xref>]).

We characterised the organisation of lactotroph cells in pituitary tissue and found it to be indistinguishable from a random distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This does not preclude the presence of direct communication, or of an organised interaction network, between the cells (as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hodson et al., 2012</xref>]). We assessed the level of correlation between the fluorescence profiles of individual cells. The increase in PRL gene transcription observed in adult pituitary tissue enabled us to investigate whether cells would coordinate their activity in response to a release from the dopaminergic inhibition that would have occurred in vivo. Similar activity would be expected in vivo when changes in dopaminergic tone facilitate PRL expression and secretion, such as during circadian regulation and lactation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-Jonathan and Hnasko, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Romano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Le Tissier et al., 2015</xref>).

The level of correlation over short distances was also significantly greater than the correlation profile obtained when fluorescence profiles were randomised between the cells, but the positioning information was maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

We specifically determined the presence of gap junctions and adherens junctions between lactotroph cells, as these have been implicated in the organisation and function of cell networks in the adult pituitary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morand et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chauvet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kikuchi et al., 2006</xref>).

Inspection of these data suggested that periods of active transcription tend to be of longer duration in adult compared to immature tissue.

Direct RNA counting techniques (MS2, or RNA-FISH) and the imaging of indirect fluorescence and luminescence reporter gene expression has shown that mammalian gene expression is often pulsatile (or 'bursty') with different genes showing varying characteristics of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sanchez and Golding, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coulon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Suter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Spiller et al., 2010</xref>). These studies, performed in single cell systems, raise the question as to how apparently uncoordinated and heterogeneous dynamics enable integrated tissue-level responses to physiological stimuli. We have assessed PRL transcription dynamics within pituitary tissue, utilising newly derived mathematical models to define transcription activity. Cells displayed a continuous distribution of transcription rates with heterogeneous patterns of activity across the cell population. Embryonic pituitary glands displayed shorter durations of high transcription rates compared to adult pituitary tissue, which could reflect epigenetic changes during tissue development. We also characterised the spatial organisation of PRL gene expression within lactotroph cells of the pituitary gland and found evidence for the local coordination of transcription dynamics that is potentially mediated by intercellular signalling providing insights into how transcriptional timing is organised in tissue systems.</p><p>Over the past decade, efforts have been made to mathematically model transcription activity to provide a better mechanistic understanding of gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sanchez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Larson et al., 2009</xref>). Poissonian distributions of mRNA production, where mRNAs are produced in random, uncorrelated events, have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zenklusen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">So et al., 2011</xref>). However, the prevailing model for mammalian transcription dynamics is the Random Telegraph Model, which describes 'bursty' gene expression, where the gene exists in two states, either 'on' or 'off', with transcripts produced at a defined rate in the 'on' period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Larson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peccoud and Ycart, 1995</xref>). Using binary modelling, we and others have shown that there is a refractory period in the 'off' state, but not in the 'on' state, indicating that there are significant differences between the kinetics of gene activation and inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Suter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harper et al., 2011</xref>). Binary modelling of transcription dynamics is likely to represent an oversimplification of the true transcription process. Therefore, we developed a stochastic switch model, which allowed us to estimate transcription rates at differing levels and defined the timing of switches between different rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hey et al., 2015</xref>). This model enabled us to characterise transcription activity in cells maintained in tissue, where individual transcriptional states were sustained for long periods and complete cycles of activity were not often detected. Using the stochastic switch model, we found a continuous distribution of transcription rates, that is differential 'on' states, across the cell population, with heterogeneous timing in transcriptional switches between cells. This heterogeneity in transcriptional activity is likely to result from intrinsic factors previously shown to influence PRL transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harper et al., 2011</xref>), together with extrinsic factors, which include the specialisation of lactotroph cells into distinct subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christian et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>To understand the role of stochastic transcriptional processes in tissue biology, it is important to determine how the properties of transcription dynamics are modulated to facilitate changes in gene expression under different physiological states. Modelling of transcriptional activity using a random telegraph process has suggested that levels of gene expression can be controlled through digital responses where the burst frequency or duration is altered, but not the transcription rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Larson et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, digital responses in transcription activity have been detected in single cell systems where the probability that cells are recruited to an expressing population changes under different conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chubb et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walters et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kar et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, different kinetic transcriptional responses including changes to transcription rate and durations of 'on' activity have been found for the connective tissue growth factor (<italic>ctgf</italic>) gene in response to different stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Molina et al., 2013</xref>), and for housekeeping genes in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Muramoto et al., 2012</xref>). Overall, the total level of transcription in a given pulse will depend not only on the length of the pulse but also on the rate of transcription during the pulse. Different rates of transcription will depend on levels of RNA polymerase II loading, which may be controlled by different chromatin and promoter states. We observed a continuous distribution of transcription rates within cell populations, indicating that different levels of activity are attainable. However, at the population level similar distributions of activity were detected in all developmental states analysed. Thus, differences in transcription rate contribute to heterogeneous activity at the population level and may be important in maintaining tissue function. In different developmental states, we found changes in the duration of high transcription rates between embryonic and more mature pituitary glands, indicative of a more pulsatile activity in immature tissues. Thus, changes to the duration of activity appear more prominent in facilitating changes in the level of gene expression than changes to transcription rate.</p><p>Transcriptional stochasticity within cellular populations may be advantageous in maintaining population fitness to changing environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thattai, 2004</xref>), or facilitate cell fate choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wernet et al., 2006</xref>). However, the role of stochastic gene expression in tissue systems where integrated responses to physiological demand are required is less clear. It has been proposed that heterogeneous responses may facilitate robust tissue-level responses and potentially avoid inappropriate amplification of signals through feedback mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paszek et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, mechanisms to reduce expression level heterogeneity have been described in processes such as patterning and specification in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Little et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Raj et al., 2010</xref>). A recent study used single-molecule RNA-FISH at single points in time to define bursting transcriptional behaviour in fixed liver tissue and identified polyploidy as a mechanism to reduce intrinsic variability between cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bahar Halpern et al., 2015</xref>). The pituitary gland is an excellent model system in which to investigate cellular population responses to physiological signals. The gland is composed of multiple cell types that are spatially organised within the pituitary, several of which have been suggested to form interdigitated cellular networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Le Tissier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mollard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hodson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fauquier et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonnefont et al., 2005</xref>). Lactotroph cells coordinate their calcium signalling in basal physiological states and more substantially during increased demand such as lactation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hodson et al., 2012</xref>). In this study, we have provided a quantitative analysis of lactotroph cell connectivity and shown that PRL transcription is coordinated between lactotroph cells over short distances (25<bold>–</bold>35 µm) and propagated through a network structure. Transcriptional coordination was actively facilitated by intercellular signalling, and we have shown that this could be via juxtacrine signalling including gap junctions. Intercellular signalling has been shown to be important for coordinating other oscillatory systems such as the circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2007</xref>), the somite segmentation clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Horikawa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Masamizu et al., 2006</xref>), and electrical coupling of and insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smolen et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>The global picture that arises is that transcription is highly stochastic but has some coordination of bursting at distances up to approximately 35 µm in adult pituitary tissue, but not at greater distances. In contrast there was no coordination at any intercellular distance in earlier developmental states. The limited short distance coordination between lactotroph cells in the adult tissue is not sufficiently strong to lose the key characteristic of cell-to-cell heterogeneity. However, it can be hypothesised that the global system of short range cell-to-cell communication may stabilise longer term changes in the expression level of the tissue, such as those associated with the oestrus cycle or lactation. Thus far the gland as a whole prolactin transcription is essentially random in that for the vast majority of cell pairs, the temporal pattern of their transcription is uncoordinated. Therefore, the law of large numbers guarantees stable long-term results in terms of the global response.</p><p>Our work addresses how an endocrine tissue, such as the pituitary gland, generates a controlled output from a diverse set of intermingled cell types. The acute, medium, and long-term outputs of endocrine cells must be regulated across different time scales and to diverse environmental signals, while achieving accurate control of hormone expression. A key question has been whether cells behave similarly to each other or whether they operate in a heterogeneous autonomous fashion. Previous data have suggested the latter in isolated cells and cell lines. Our data now indicate that developing adult tissue structure exerts a coordinating effect on cell behaviour (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Our observation that cells display multi-state transcriptional behaviour ('off', 'primed' and 'on' at various levels; outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), as opposed to simple binary 'on'/'off' behaviour, is suggestive of mechanisms that tune the overall output from the gland through the generation of graded responses. Changes in the duration of particular transcription states, as we observed with shorter 'on' periods in immature pituitary glands, also help to refine the overall output from the gland. A simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>) shows how decreasing the duration of the 'primed' period allows a population of cells to switch to a new stable state of mRNA production. Such modification of activity may facilitate the differentiation of the tissue response without a risk of overshooting behaviour. This offers a new mechanism to explain how tissues integrate different signals with varying durations into appropriate responses. Examples of dynamic control of the pituitary gland include the acute suppression or activation by hypothalamic regulators, circadian response, and long-term behavioural changes through development, puberty, pregnancy, and ageing.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08494.022</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Multi-state transcription dynamics achieve robust tissue level responses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Organised cell networks and gap junction cell-cell signalling in adult pituitary glands (lower panels), but not in immature pituitary glands (upper panels), leads to local correlation of transcription between cells. Across a large population of cells transcription dynamics are essentially random and uncoordinated. Multi-state transcription dynamics ('off', 'primed' and 'on' at various levels) contribute to transcriptional heterogeneity between cells as the time spent in each state is exponentially distributed.

We demonstrate that there is local transcriptional coordination between prolactin-expressing cells in adult, but not in developing pituitary tissue. We have described quantitative analyses of transcription kinetics in different developmental states of the pituitary gland. In all states, we showed that transcription occurs at different levels of activity separated by statistically definable switches. We also detected changes in transcription dynamics between different stages of pituitary development. In the adult tissue, the cells show longer lived active states, associated with an altered environment in which there is greater cell-to-cell connectivity. We have identified potential mechanisms by which the combined dynamics of single cells within a tissue may achieve both acute and long-term functional adaptation of the expression of secreted regulatory proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Animal studies were performed under UK Home Office License and subject to local ethical committee review.

Regions of interest were drawn around cells and mean intensity data collected using CellTracker software. Cell areas analysed were consistent with the size of a typical eukaryotic cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Matlab R2014a software (MathWorks, UK) including Bioinformatics and Statistical toolboxes, or the R programming language (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org">www.r-project.org</ext-link>) were used for mathematical analyses.

The spatial distribution of cells was tested using a 2D Poission process and Ripley’s K function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ripley, 1976</xref>). Correlation analyses of transcription patterns from fluorescence data were performed in two ways: either using the Euclidean distance between cells or by a network analysis. Correlation based on the Euclidean distance was performed in two parts. In the first part, cell pairs were partitioned into bins according to the distance between the cells starting at 5 µm with 5 µm intervals. Correlation analysis was performed 99 times for each bin, with n cell pairs sampled with replacement, and with the 5 and 95 percentiles reported. In the second part, n time-series are randomly permuted while the spatial information is unaltered following which correlation coefficients are calculated as described above. A paired t-test was used to identify significant differences between space-time correlations from randomised and non-randomised data. Network correlation analysis was performed similarly to Euclidean distance correlation analyses except that cell pairs were divided into two bins, connected and unconnected, which was defined in a network approach as follows. Cells were assumed to be circular with the same diameter (D). If the distance between two cells was smaller than D, they are considered to be connected. Furthermore cell connectivity is transitive so that if cells a and b are connected and so are cells b and c, then cells a and c are considered to be connected being part of a cell cluster, even if separated by a distance greater than D. Analysis is performed with a varying D.</p><p>The inference of transcription rates from fluorescence data using the stochastic switch model was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hey et al., 2015</xref>), using the following stochastic reaction network:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle><mml:mspace width="4.3pc"/><mml:mo>∅</mml:mo><mml:mover><mml:mo>→</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">β</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mover><mml:mi>mRNA</mml:mi><mml:mspace linebreak="newline"/><mml:mspace width="-2pc"/><mml:mi>mRNA</mml:mi><mml:mover><mml:mo>→</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">δ</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mover><mml:mo>∅</mml:mo><mml:mspace linebreak="newline"/><mml:mspace width="-2pc"/><mml:mi>mRNA</mml:mi><mml:mover><mml:mo>→</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">α</mml:mi></mml:mover><mml:mi>mRNA</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>Protein</mml:mi><mml:mspace linebreak="newline"/><mml:mspace width="2.4pc"/><mml:mi>Protein</mml:mi><mml:mover><mml:mo>→</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">δ</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mover><mml:mo>∅</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mo>*</mml:mo><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where δ<sub>m</sub> and δ<sub>p</sub> denote the degradation rates of reporter mRNA and reporter protein respectively, α denotes the rate of translation and β(t) denotes the time varying rate of transcription.

Slices were cultured on filter stages in 35-mm dishes in either FBS supplemented recording medium (DMEM + 4.5 g/l glucose, 10% (v/v) FBS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM ultraglutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM luciferin) or rat serum supplemented recording medium (DMEM and F12, 50% (v/v) serum from sacrificed animal, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM ultraglutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM luciferin) in a closed system at 37°C, to show that differences in transcriptional activity seen between adult and immature tissues was not due to the medium used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Bioluminescence emissions were recorded by photon multiplier assemblies (Hamamatsu Photonics, UK) with counts collected over a 1-min period. The mean and standard deviation were calculated from data collected over hourly periods. Two independent adult male rat pituitaries were analysed with each condition performed in triplicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Pituitary tissue slices were prepared and either untreated or treated with trypsin for 2 hr at 37°C, as described in 'Preparation and culture of pituitary tissue'. Slices were washed three times in medium (DMEM + 4.5 g/l glucose, 10% (v/v) FBS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin and 2 mM ultraglutamine) and then cultured on filter stages as described previously at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for either 0, 24, or 48 hr. Slices were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH8, 150 mM NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS) with Complete Mini EDTA-free Protease Inhibitors (Roche, UK). Three independent cultures of trypsin-treated and untreated tissue were analysed by western blot. Lysates prepared from cell lines or whole tissue samples were generated by lysis in RIPA buffer with Complete Mini EDTA-free Protease Inhibitors (Roche, UK) following washing with cold HBSS. All samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10%) before transfer to nitrocellulose membrane. Primary antibodies (rabbit anti- α-tubulin (Proteintech, UK), mouse anti-E-Cadherin (BD Biosciences, UK), mouse anti-β-catenin (BD Biosciences, UK), rabbit anti-N-Cadherin (Calbiochem, UK), mouse anti-connexin43 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) were applied overnight at 4°C in blocking buffer (Tris buffered saline, 5% (w/v) dried milk, 0.1% (v/v) Tween20), and species-specific horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare, UK) were applied for 1 hr at room temperature. Staining was detected with Clarity Western ECL Substrate (Biorad) using Biomax XAR film (Kodak, UK). Protein levels were standardised to α-tubulin expression following quantification of protein expression by determining the relative band size using ImageJ software.

Specifically, the expression of prolactin in rat pituitary slices, both in the adult and during development. Pursuing questions of stochasticity and of cell-cell communication in the complex context of a multicellular tissue has the potential for significant insights, and some of the data presented by the authors is quite interesting, but I found the work deficient in terms of the quantitative and theoretical analysis (which the authors describe as &quot;sophisticated&quot;, paragraph four, Introduction). The standard for such analysis is quite high, even for studies in mammalian tissues, as demonstrated e.g. by the recent work from Halpern et al. in mouse liver (Molecular Cell 2015; cited by the authors).</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>1) The authors analyze their temporal fluorescence data using a theoretical stochastic model, to extract the parameters of gene activity. However, the validity of the model is not challenged by testing that it can successfully reproduce the experimental data. Nowhere do we see a plot with direct comparison between an experimental observable and its predicted value from the model. Thus what we have is a &quot;forward only&quot; process where experimental data is fed into an algorithm, to produce estimated parameters, without the critical feedback from model to experiments. This dramatically diminishes the value of the theoretical analysis.</p><p>2) On a related note, it is unclear what was learned from the model that was not already in the experimental data. In particular, the temporal and spatial correlations in expression, and how those change during development, are evident from the straightforward analysis of the data, and it was not obvious that the model sheds any additional light on these findings.</p><p>3) Besides the theoretical model, the quantitative analysis of data was itself quite flawed in a number of instances. Examples:</p><p>i) &quot;fluorescence activity showed a clear deviation from a white noise process indicating a pulsatile transcriptional behavior&quot;. Why would the expectation be of &quot;white noise&quot;? And why would deviation from white noise indicate pulses? This is very unclear.</p><p>ii) The cell-cell correlations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>-ii show an increase at large distances. This is probably an artifact, since it can be seen in the randomized control as well, but the presence of this trend is suspicious-could it indicate a flaw in the correlation calculation, e.g. in normalizing for the number of cell pairs?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this study by Featherstone and coworkers, the authors use single-cell imaging to look at prolactin expression in rat pituitary tissue. Expression is measured via a GFP reporter driven by the prolactin promoter in the context of a transgenic BAC. From these fluorescence time traces, the authors reconstruct transcriptional dynamics through a statistical inference model. Single-cell imaging of prolactin promoter activity in cells in culture and the inference model have been published previously by some of the authors. The novelty in this work lies in performing these measurements in a pituitary tissue slice. Although this approach has some caveats (inference of transcription dynamics from protein time-series, transgenic regulation, tissue slices, etc.), my opinion is that it is overall a reasonably faithful approximation of the actual endogenous regulation of this promoter in a tissue context. In that sense, it is a major technical advance. I am unaware of any other studies that look at stochastic gene regulation with this resolution in tissue. The major conclusions they reach are that the prolactin promoter is pulsatile in tissue, the pulsatility changes during development, and that cells show local coordination by means of adherens and gap junctions.</p><p>Overall, the data is of very high quality, and the analysis seems sound. What is missing, in my opinion, is biological insight into the functioning of this promoter in the context of the gland. However, I believe the authors have this understanding and may have even tried to convey it, but this referee didn't quite grasp the implications. It is possible that a revised manuscript with some restructuring and slightly re-directed analysis would make this message more appropriate for the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) My main criticism is on the nature of the developmental progression, gene output, and spatial coordination. The authors present a series of observations about all three, but I suggest that it would be more biologically insightful to integrate these observations to describe the overall output of prolactin from the tissue. Does overall output increase during developmental stages? If so, does this output result from more cells (i.e. greater density) or changes in the pulsing? If cells are pulsing in synchrony, would the overall output also display pulsatile production from the gland? It is tempting to conclude form the authors' data that cells have some sort of fixed prolactin regulatory circuit, but as the gland matures, more cells result in higher levels of output, and this output becomes dynamically synchronized through cell-cell communication. Is this correct? Or am I misunderstanding the data? Here, the quantitative modeling would be immensely valuable, perhaps allowing one to extrapolate from the tissue slices to the function in vivo.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Spatially Coordinated Dynamic Gene Transcription in Living Pituitary Tissue&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jim Kadonaga as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you can see the reviewers are still unsure of your presentation of the significance of the results and their treatment in the manuscript. In their discussion they have stated that the work does not advance enough from previous published work. <italic>eLife</italic> requires that the manuscript reports on significantly new observations. Whether this manuscript is accepted will depend on how you can bring out the broader significance of your observations to their satisfaction.</p><p>Summary and essential revisions:</p><p>In this revision by Featherstone et al., the authors have made some textual and organizational changes to the manuscript to better convey the biological meaning. However, I still find the manuscript lacking in its appeal to a broad audience or even a narrower gene expression readership. It just doesn't go quite far enough in my opinion in generating new insight into the developing pituitary gland. Although I am strongly attracted to the approach the authors have developed, it seems to be an extension of their previous work in this area, published in a series of papers which observe the pulsatility, the change during development, and the refractory period (Harper, JCS, 2010; Featherstone, JCS, 2011; Harper, PLoS Bio, 2011). Here, they have refined their model of the underlying dynamics using a statistical inference method. They conclude that transcription dynamics do not obey a simple telegraph process but do not go beyond this phenomenology, nor do they dissect the functional consequences.</p><p>The real advance in this paper is the observed spatial coupling between individual cells and the finding that this spatial coupling changes over development. This coupling, which occurs over a length scale of ~ 30 μM, is perturbed by limited trypsin digestion. This finding is indeed an interesting one, but does it rise to the level of a self-sufficient story? And could it not be delivered in a more compelling way? In summary, I find the work to be technically accomplished, but my overall impression is that they have not spelled out clearly the significant advance in our biological understanding.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08494.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The Reviewers find the work of interest, in particular that the spatial relationship of cells within a tissue may lead to a common basis for expression.

We believe that these changes have significantly improved the manuscript, and hope that it will now be acceptable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Our detailed responses are listed below.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>1) The authors analyze their temporal fluorescence data using a theoretical stochastic model, to extract the parameters of gene activity. However, the validity of the model is not challenged by testing that it can successfully reproduce the experimental data. Nowhere do we see a plot with direct comparison between an experimental observable and its predicted value from the model. Thus what we have is a &quot;forward only&quot; process where experimental data is fed into an algorithm, to produce estimated parameters, without the critical feedback from model to experiments. This dramatically diminishes the value of the theoretical analysis.</italic></p><p>The reviewer cites the paper of Halpern et al. as an exemplar for this type of quantitative analysis. We agree that this paper represents the current cutting edge of the field and cite it in our manuscript. Halpern et al. employ sophisticated smFISH, which means that transcription dynamics are calculated from a single frozen snapshot of activity. In contrast, our approach tracks transcription dynamics in single cells in real time over 40h periods. The approach we have used is a significant development of work first published in two pioneering 2011 papers that used quantitative single cell time-course analysis (Suter et al. in Science, and our previous PLoS Biology paper by Harper et al.). The key novelty of the current work is the analysis of transcriptional bursting kinetics in relation to spatial proximity of cells within intact living tissue. This uses major advances in the statistical analysis of multi-state transcription, based on development and application of the theoretical tools described in our Biostatistics paper (Hey et al. 2015).</p><p>The reviewer may not have appreciated that the development of our statistical analysis fundamentally relied on iterative testing of the model against synthetic and real data. Our approach is to date the only way of comparing the modelling to the true underlying biological process (assuming that the inferred switches really are switches in transcription). We confirmed that the model reasonably fits the experimental data, iteratively tested through recursive residuals. These residuals were calculated on both the P1.5 and Adult tissue that were presented in the Biostatistics paper and we are including them for your consideration. These residuals are a way of comparing the prediction from the model (based on the estimates) and the observed data. Detailed information about the use of such residuals is contained in Appendix G of the Biostatistics paper (see supplementary material available at Biostatistics online) and no departure from the model assumptions was detected, indicating that the SSM under both the LNA and BDA fits the data well.</p><p>We have added the following sentence to the manuscript referring to these points: “The fit of the model was tested through calculation of recursive residuals as a way of comparing the prediction from the model and the observed data (for information see Appendix G of (20)). These showed no departure from the model assumptions, indicating that the SSM fitted the data well.”</p><p><italic>2) On a related note, it is unclear what was learned from the model that was not already in the experimental data. In particular, the temporal and spatial correlations in expression, and how those change during development, are evident from the straightforward analysis of the data, and it was not obvious that the model sheds any additional light on these findings.</italic></p><p>This is a critical point. The experimental data referred to by the reviewer is raw fluorescent protein expression data. The fluorescence signal depends on multiple processes including transcription, translation, and protein and mRNA degradation. In order to probe the correlation between cells, it is critical to be able to accurately measure, and statistically assess, multi-state switches in transcription rate in isolation from other processes. Back-calculation of transcription rate, as we have undertaken, allows us to estimate the correlation between cells in terms of the transcriptional process by assessing correlation in the switch times and switch directions. The modelling approach also revealed the presence of shorter “on” durations in immature pituitary tissue and that similar distributions of transcription rate were present in all stages of pituitary development. These insights are important for understanding how changes in individual cell responses lead to changes to the overall output from a tissue system. The importance of modelling transcriptional dynamics and the insights gained from such analyses, including the modelling approach undertaken in our study were discussed in paragraph two, Discussion. In terms of informing conclusions regarding the overall biological behaviour we have added some further text to the Discussion in paragraph six and now include a new simulation model and hypothesis regarding the nature of overall transcriptional output from an endocrine tissue (outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) Besides the theoretical model, the quantitative analysis of data was itself quite flawed in a number of instances. Examples:</italic></p><p> <italic>i) &quot;fluorescence activity showed a clear deviation from a white noise process indicating a pulsatile transcriptional behavior&quot;. Why would the expectation be of &quot;white noise&quot;? And why would deviation from white noise indicate pulses? This is very unclear.</italic></p><p> <italic>ii) The cell-cell correlations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>-ii show an increase at large distances. This is probably an artifact, since it can be seen in the randomized control as well, but the presence of this trend is suspicious-could it indicate a flaw in the correlation calculation, e.g. in normalizing for the number of cell pairs?</italic></p><p>Example i). The reviewer is correct to criticise the sentence “Autocorrelation analyses did not identify a regular homogeneous period, but fluorescence activity showed a clear deviation from a white noise process indicating a pulsatile transcriptional behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) with a definite quantifiable statistical structure. “We agree that this was misleading since it seems to suggest that since the process was not a white noise process it must therefore represent pulsatile transcriptional behaviour. What we should have said was:</p><p>“Autocorrelation analyses did not identify a regular homogeneous period, and fluorescence activity showed a clear deviation from a white noise process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Further, analysis using a Stochastic Switch Model (SSM) uncovered a definite quantifiable statistical structure indicating a pulsatile transcriptional behaviour compatible with the pulsed telegraph process as described above.”</p><p>This sentence has been modified accordingly in the manuscript in subheading “Patterns of Prolactin Gene Transcription Activity in Adult Pituitary Tissue”.</p><p>Example ii) The referee picks up an important point that we have tested further. The cell-cell correlations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> that the referee refers to are inside the 90% confidence interval of the randomised control and therefore are not significant. This is further emphasised by the data in part i) of the figure from which it is clear that the number of pairs in the bins above 70 are very small. We have addressed this by re-plotting the data using bins chosen so that they all have the same number of cell pairs in them. This clearly shows the significant decrease in correlation for distances less than about 40μm and we see that the last two bins fall firmly in the 90% confidence interval of the randomised control. This new information is now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>1) My main criticism is on the nature of the developmental progression, gene output, and spatial coordination. The authors present a series of observations about all three, but I suggest that it would be more biologically insightful to integrate these observations to describe the overall output of prolactin from the tissue. Does overall output increase during developmental stages? If so, does this output result from more cells (i.e. greater density) or changes in the pulsing? If cells are pulsing in synchrony, would the overall output also display pulsatile production from the gland? It is tempting to conclude form the authors' data that cells have some sort of fixed prolactin regulatory circuit, but as the gland matures, more cells result in higher levels of output, and this output becomes dynamically synchronized through cell-cell communication. Is this correct? Or am I misunderstanding the data? Here, the quantitative modeling would be immensely valuable, perhaps allowing one to extrapolate from the tissue slices to the function in vivo.</italic></p><p>We agree that we should propose the biological significance and context of the work more clearly. We have tried to address this point by drawing together the various strands in new paragraphs in the Discussion section, paragraph six. We hope these significantly improve the paper and make clearer the in vivo relevance of the multi-state transcription model that we are proposing. We also include a schematic diagram together with new data from a simulation model to help respond to this point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>In this revision by Featherstone et al., the authors have made some textual and organizational changes to the manuscript to better convey the biological meaning. However, I still find the manuscript lacking in its appeal to a broad audience or even a narrower gene expression readership. It just doesn't go quite far enough in my opinion in generating new insight into the developing pituitary gland. Although I am strongly attracted to the approach the authors have developed, it seems to be an extension of their previous work in this area, published in a series of papers which observe the pulsatility, the change during development, and the refractory period (Harper, JCS, 2010; Featherstone, JCS, 2011; Harper, PLoS Bio, 2011). Here, they have refined their model of the underlying dynamics using a statistical inference method. They conclude that transcription dynamics do not obey a simple telegraph process but do not go beyond this phenomenology, nor do they dissect the functional consequences.</italic></p><p><italic>The real advance in this paper is the observed spatial coupling between individual cells and the finding that this spatial coupling changes over development. This coupling, which occurs over a length scale of ~ 30 μM, is perturbed by limited trypsin digestion. This finding is indeed an interesting one, but does it rise to the level of a self-sufficient story? And could it not be delivered in a more compelling way? In summary, find the work to be technically accomplished, but my overall impression is that they have not spelled out clearly the significant advance in our biological understanding.</italic></p><p>One reviewer questioned the significance of our study for a broad biological audience. We believe that this paper not only presents important advances in both theoretical and experimental approach, but is also the first study with sufficient resolution and throughput to assess the effects of tissue environment on spatial coordination of gene expression. Overall, the paper represents a complete integrated and quantitative analysis of the control of transcription dynamics, both temporal and spatial, across development in a key mammalian tissue. No previous study has achieved this.</p><p>The main changes we have made are as follows:</p><p>We have re-written the Abstract to make the main messages of the paper clearer.</p><p>We have simplified and streamlined the Introduction in order to present the main background questions more clearly. In response to a referee’s minor comments we have also removed subjective comments about significance or importance.</p><p>We have not altered the figures beyond minor adjustments to labelling, but we have tried to clarify the description of the results shown in the figures in order to make the key messages more accessible to a broad readership. Changes in the Results section particularly concern the treatment of the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, where we have tried to clarify the presentation in the main text. We have also revised the figure legends slightly (especially <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), and adjusted the figure labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), for greater clarity.</p><p>Changes in the Discussion were made in the last two paragraphs, to emphasise the key new findings, which we have tried to summarise more succinctly. These findings are:</p><p>1) Multi-state modelling of transcription dynamics indicates that transcription pulses are not simply binary in nature, and we characterise switching behaviour in intact tissue.</p><p>2) Both the duration of pulses and the coordination of transcriptional dynamics differ between immature and adult pituitary tissue.</p><p>3) Tissue structure affects cellular behaviour, and exerts local coordination of transcription dynamics. Our work with not only trypsin, but also gap junction blockers, indicates that gap junction signalling is involved in this behaviour.</p></body></sub-article></article>
