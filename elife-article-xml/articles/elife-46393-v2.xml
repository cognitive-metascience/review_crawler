with Ras remain obscure. Here, using single particle tracking with photoactivated localization microscopy (spt-PALM) and detailed trajectory analysis, we show that distinct membrane domains dictate KRas<sup>G12D</sup> (an active KRas mutant) diffusion and trafficking in U2OS cells. KRas<sup>G12D</sup> exhibits an immobile state in ~70 nm domains, each embedded in a larger domain (~200 nm) that confers intermediate mobility, while the rest of the membrane supports fast diffusion. Moreover, KRas<sup>G12D</sup> is continuously removed from the membrane via the immobile state and replenished to the fast state, reminiscent of Ras internalization and recycling. Importantly, both the diffusion and trafficking properties of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> remain invariant over a broad range of protein expression levels. Our results reveal how membrane organization dictates membrane diffusion and trafficking of Ras and offer new insight into the spatial regulation of Ras signaling.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The Ras family of proteins play an important role in relaying signals from the outside to the inside of the cell. Ras proteins are attached by a fatty tail to the inner surface of the cell membrane. When activated they transmit a burst of signal that controls critical behaviors like growth, survival and movement. It has been suggested that to prevent these signals from being accidently activated, Ras molecules must group together at specialized sites within the membrane before passing on their message. However, visualizing how Ras molecules cluster together at these domains has thus far been challenging. As a result, little is known about where these sites are located and how Ras molecules come to a stop at these domains.</p><p>Now, Lee et al. have combined two microscopy techniques called âsingle-particle trackingâ and âphotoactivated localization microscopy' to track how individual molecules of activated Ras move in human cells grown in the lab. This revealed that Ras molecules quickly diffuse along the inside of the membrane until they arrive at certain locations that cause them to halt. However, computer models consisting of just the âfastâ and âimmobileâ state could not correctly re-capture the way Ras molecules moved along the membrane. Lee et al. found that for these models to mimic the movement of Ras, a third âintermediateâ state of Ras mobility needed to be included.</p><p>To investigate this further, Lee et al. created a fluorescent map that overlaid all the individual paths taken by each Ras molecule. The map showed regions in the membrane where the Ras molecules had stopped and possibly clustered together. Each of these âimmobilization domainsâ were then surrounded by an âintermediate domainâ where Ras molecules had begun to slow down their movement. Although the intermediate domains did not last long, they seemed to guide Ras molecules into the immobilization domains where they could cluster together with other molecules. From there, the cell constantly removed Ras molecules from these membrane domains and returned them back to their âfastâ diffusing state.</p><p>Mutations in Ras proteins occur in around a third of all cancers, so a better understanding of their dynamics could help with future drug discovery. The methods used here could also be used to investigate the movement of other signaling molecules.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Ras</kwd><kwd>membrane nanodomain</kwd><kwd>single-particle tracking</kwd><kwd>diffusion</kwd><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>non-equilibrium steady state</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54 CA209988</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Young Hwan</given-names></name><name><surname>Gray</surname><given-names>Joe W</given-names></name><name><surname>Nan</surname><given-names>Xiaolin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB1715823</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zuckerman</surname><given-names>Daniel M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nan</surname><given-names>Xiaolin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000937</institution-id><institution>M.J.

Among others, the Ras small GTPases are prototypical examples of signaling molecules whose biological activities are directly regulated by the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou and Hancock, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abankwa et al., 2010</xref>). While biochemical aspects of how Ras interacts with downstream effectors such as Raf have been well studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Simanshu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cox and Der, 2010</xref>), the mechanisms through which the biological membrane defines the signaling activity and specificity of Ras are still poorly understood. Recent studies by us and others suggest that Ras signaling may involve the formation of multimers (dimers and/or clusters) in a membrane-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">GÃ¼ldenhaupt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Spencer-Smith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ambrogio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prior et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Inouye et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Plowman et al., 2005</xref>), and that partitioning of Ras into nanoscopic membrane domains and interactions with scaffold proteins or structures likely constitute critical steps to Ras multimer formation and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belanis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shalom-Feuerstein et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). While previous high-resolution imaging experiments using immuno-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prior et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Plowman et al., 2005</xref>) or quantitative superresolution microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2015</xref>) were instrumental to revealing the existence of Ras multimers, the resulting images were mostly static and provided limited information about the spatiotemporal dynamics of Ras â membrane domain interactions.</p><p>Live-cell single-particle tracking (SPT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schmidt et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kusumi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saxton and Jacobson, 1997</xref>) complements static imaging by providing information about molecular motions, and it has been used to study Ras dynamics on the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lommerse et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murakoshi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lommerse et al., 2004</xref>). The underlying rationale is that interactions of Ras with different membrane domains and signaling partners would manifest as varied diffusion behavior. Indeed, using SPT, Murakoshi et al. observed transient events of Ras immobilization on the membrane, which became more frequent upon epidermal growth factor stimulation, potentially reflecting the formation of signaling complexes or interactions with raft domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murakoshi et al., 2004</xref>). Lommerse and colleagues also used SPT to probe Ras diffusion and similarly observed transient and context-dependent confinement of Ras in membrane regions not more than 200 nm in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lommerse et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>These prior studies offered important initial insight into the potential connections between Ras diffusion, function, and membrane organization, but the technical constraints of traditional SPT limited the imaging throughput and depth of analysis in these studies. Typically, only a few tens of trajectories could be obtained from each experiment, which precluded detailed and quantitative characterization of the heterogeneous and stochastic nature of molecular diffusion. In consequence, while the studies consistently reported two diffusion states â a âfreeâ diffusion state and another âimmobileâ state, it remains to be seen whether a two-state model adequately recapitulates Ras membrane dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lommerse et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murakoshi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lommerse et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, the nature of the membrane domains occupied by each of these states and how Ras molecules transition between the states in connection with multimer formation and signaling remain unclear.</p><p>Recent years have seen significant advances in both experimental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Manley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">English, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cutler et al., 2013</xref>) and data analysis strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Persson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hansen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jaqaman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chenouard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Monnier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ito et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">LindÃ©n and Elf, 2018</xref>) of SPT, some of which have dramatically improved the information throughput. Among others, spt-PALM combines SPT with photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) to enable single molecule tracking under dense labeling conditions through stochastic photoswitching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Manley et al., 2008</xref>). With spt-PALM, it is routine to acquire thousands of diffusion trajectories from a single cell. A growing list of software tools has also been developed to facilitate spt-PALM data analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Persson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hansen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jaqaman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ito et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Newby et al., 2018</xref>). For example, variational Bayes SPT (vbSPT) allows construction of a detailed diffusion model from spt-PALM data with parameters such as the number of states, the diffusion coefficient and the occupancy of each state, as well as the state transition rates even when the individual trajectories are short (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Persson et al., 2013</xref>). Additional methods have also been introduced to quantitate various aspects of diffusion dynamics from SPT trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chenouard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ito et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manzo and Garcia-Parajo, 2015</xref>). These advances help overcome the limitations of conventional SPT and make it possible to analyze Ras membrane dynamics in much greater depth.</p><p>Here, we report our efforts on combining spt-PALM with detailed trajectory analysis to reveal previously unknown aspects of Ras diffusion on the cell membrane. With carefully controlled expression levels and photoactivation rate, spt-PALM trajectories of PAmCherry1-tagged KRas<sup>G12D</sup> (KRas with an activating mutation and thus primarily GTP-bound) consistently reported three diffusion states, including a fast diffusion state, an immobile state, and a previously unidentified diffusion state with intermediate mobility. Leveraging the large number of trajectories, we were able to spatially map the diffusion states to distinctive membrane domains, estimate the size and lifetime of each domain, and define the spatial relationship between the domains. Moreover, in analyzing how KRas<sup>G12D</sup> transitions from one diffusion state to another, we discovered that KRas<sup>G12D</sup> diffusion follows a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) model with net mass flow from the fast state to the immobile state, potentially coupled to the endocytic trafficking and membrane recycling of KRas<sup>G12D</sup>. Based on these results, we propose a new model to describe the membrane dynamics of KRas<sup>G12D</sup>, where nested membrane nanodomains dictate the diffusion and trafficking, with implications in Ras multimer formation and signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>KRas<sup>G12D</sup> diffuses on the membrane in three distinct states</title><p>To investigate the lateral diffusion properties of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> under controlled expression levels, we established isogenic U2OS cells stably expressing PAmCherry1-KRas<sup>G12D</sup> under doxycycline (Dox) regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nan et al., 2015</xref>). The expression level of PAmCherry1-KRas<sup>G12D</sup> could be tuned from a level below that of the endogenous KRas atÂ &lt;1 ng/mL Dox to highly over-expressed at 5â10 ng/mL Dox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Initially data were collected from cells expressing KRas<sup>G12D</sup> at a moderate level by inducing at 2 ng/mL Dox. The photoactivatable fluorescent protein PAmCherry1 has been widely used for quantitative PALM and spt-PALM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Subach et al., 2009</xref>). Owing to the good single-molecule brightness of activated PAmCherry1, we were able to track individual PAmCherry1-KRas<sup>G12D</sup> molecules at frame rates up toÂ ~83 Hz (i.e.,~12 ms/frame) with a low excitation dose (~400 W/cm<sup>2</sup> at 561 nm). The low spontaneous photoactivation rate of PAmCherry1 also permits clean single-molecule imaging even at high expression levels, yielding as many as hundreds of thousands of trajectories per cell via spt-PALM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

Despite the faster frame rate, data acquired at 12 ms/frame had a lower signal-to-noise ratio, causing a more frequent loss of molecules during tracking to yield significantly shorter trajectories (~50 ms average duration) than dataÂ acquired at 35 ms/frame (~175 ms average duration).

To this end, we used two methods to analyze the Ras diffusion trajectories. The first approach fits cumulative distribution function (CDF) for Brownian motion to the squared displacements of Ras trajectories to extract diffusion coefficients and the respective occupancies of the diffusion states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">SchÃ¼tz et al., 1997</xref>). The second method, vbSPT, treats particle diffusion and the associated state transitions with a Hidden Markov Model and performs model selection through variational inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Persson et al., 2013</xref>). Of note, vbSPT is well suited for analyzing large numbers of short trajectories such as those obtained via spt-PALM.</p><p>We found that particle densities higher than 0.03 Âµm<sup>â2</sup> per frame under our experimental conditions (12 ms/frame with the fastest diffusion rate atÂ ~1 Âµm<sup>2</sup>/s) led to occasional misconnected trajectories, and that even a small fraction of such misconnected trajectories could lead to skewed model outputs with vbSPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, the threshold for maximum particle displacement between adjacent frames also had an impact on trajectory misconnection, although to a lesser extent as tested with simulated trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). Thus, for diffusion model construction, we chose to use a high frame rate (12 ms/frame) and a low particle density (&lt;0.03 Âµm<sup>â2</sup>) to eliminate misconnected trajectories while maintaining a sufficient number of trajectories.</p><p>Using trajectories acquired and analyzed with the above precautions, both CDF fitting and vbSPT yielded similar three-state models for KRas<sup>G12D</sup> diffusion on the membrane of live U2OS cells. Specifically, CDF fitting to a three-state model had significantly lower residual error compared to a single- or a two-state model and further increasing the model size did not decrease the error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating that a three-state model is sufficient to describe the data. For vbSPT, a score equal to zero indicates the best model, a condition that was met with a three-state model but not with larger or smaller size models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To rule out the possibility of imprecise single-molecule localizations causing vbSPT to misinterpret two-state spt-PALM data as three states, we performed vbSPT analysis on simulated trajectories based on a two-state model with varying localizations errors (0, 20, 40, 80, 100 nm) added. Even at the highest localization errors (100 nm), vbSPT correctly retrieved a two-state model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>) from the simulated data, suggesting that the three-state model derived from experimental spt-PALM data is unlikely a result of localization errors in SPT.</p><p>The diffusion coefficient and the occupancy for each of the diffusion states were in good agreement between the two analysis methods and within each method when applied to different cells under the same conditions, as evidenced by the small errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Datasets with high particle densities can return models with different sizes, sometimes also with aberrant model parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2BâD</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5AâB</xref>); even so, the histogram of all vbSPT-derived diffusion coefficients still showed three distinct clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3C</xref>) corresponding to the three states listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>. Thus, we concluded that the membrane diffusion of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> under our experimental conditions is best described by a three-state model, demonstrating the existence of an intermediate state not detected in previous studies. Between the two methods, vbSPT was used for most subsequent analyses in the remainder of this work because it infers the transition probabilities and state identities for every time step whereas CDF does not.</p><p>The diffusion coefficient of the slowest state in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> is comparable to that expected from single-molecule localization error (~40 nm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1âfigure supplement 6</xref>), which implied that the actual diffusion of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> in this state may be even slower than it appeared. To test this hypothesis, we acquired spt-PALM data at a slower frame rate (35 ms/frame) to improve the localization accuracy of slowly moving molecules since more photons could now be collected for each PAmCherry1 molecule in a single frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1âfigure supplement 6</xref>). Indeed, these datasets reported a significantly smaller diffusion coefficient (0.02 Âµm<sup>2</sup>/s) for the slowest state than that obtained earlier (0.08 Âµm<sup>2</sup>/s) using data taken at 12 ms/frame. This result suggests that the slowest diffusion state of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> is essentially an immobile state, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lommerse et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murakoshi et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>KRas<sup>G12D</sup> diffusion states correspond to distinct membrane domains</title><p>The diffusion model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> summarizes the results from the spt-PALM trajectory analyses using vbSPT. Each circle represents one of the diffusion states with arrows indicating the transition probabilities between pairs of states. A notable feature of this model is that there appears to be a defined state transition path: KRas<sup>G12D</sup> molecules always transition between the fast (F) and the immobile (I) states by going through the intermediate (N) state, and direct transitions between the fast and the immobile states almost never occur. In order to confirm this transition path, we compared the distribution of step sizes relative to the immobile state steps, since different step sizes reflect different diffusion coefficients. Consistent with the state transition path observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, the histogram of step sizes immediately adjacent to the immobile steps corresponded to the intermediate diffusion state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, blue) while the distribution of the remaining steps had a broader peak implying a mixture of both fast and intermediate diffusion steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, where the black color indicates a mixture of states). As expected, the step sizes assigned to the immobile states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, red) are even smaller compared to that of the other two states. The clear separation of these three step size distributions confirms the above-mentioned transition path through the intermediate state. The distinctions in step sizes among the three states were even more obvious on data taken at 35 ms/frame, which had better single-molecule localization precision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, the intermediate state is not merely a state with intermediate mobility but effectively an obligatory link between the immobile and the fast states of KRas<sup>G12D</sup>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>KRas<sup>G12D</sup> diffusion states are associated with distinct membrane domains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The three-state model for KRas<sup>G12D</sup> diffusion with F, N, and I, representing the fast, the intermediate, and the immobile states, respectively.

In the first scenario, fast diffusing KRas<sup>G12D</sup> may transition into the intermediate then the immobile state through spontaneous conformational changes unrelated to slow or static membrane structures. Alternatively, the immobile states could be caused by KRas<sup>G12D</sup> transiently binding to stationary molecules or structures (termed âimmobilization sitesâ or âimmobilization domainsâ) residing in membrane regions (referred to as âintermediate domainsâ) that confer intermediate mobility to KRas<sup>G12D</sup>. Consequently, these intermediate domains would act as transition zones between membrane regions where KRas<sup>G12D</sup> exhibits fast diffusion and the sites of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> immobilization, yielding the observed state transition path. In either case, the intermediate and the immobile states of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> would be temporally and spatially correlated. It is only in the latter case, however, that we would observe multiple visits to the same intermediate or immobilization domains by different KRas<sup>G12D</sup> molecules, provided that both domains have lifetimes longer than our temporal resolution. Of note, evenÂ inÂ the second scenario,Â KRas<sup>G12D</sup> targeting to the intermediate or the immobilization domains may be accompanied by changes in conformation.</p><p>To distinguish between the two scenarios, we performed auto- and cross-correlation analysis on the locations of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> exhibiting a certain diffusion state (referred to hereafter as state coordinates). We first visually examined the spatial distributions of the states by slicing each raw image stack into one-minute time substacks and plotting the state coordinates on the same map, with each color representing one of the states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Each diffusion trajectory typically contributes only a few points to the plots as limited by its short duration, and the points from multiple trajectories accumulate over time (up to 1 min in this case) to âpaintâ a map of the membrane regions associated with each diffusion state. Despite yielding relatively short trajectories, the rapid turn-over of PAmCherry1 allowed more efficient sampling (âpaintingâ) of the membrane domains by KRas<sup>G12D</sup> in the field of view. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, the intermediate state locations and the immobile state locations not only co-clustered, but also each appeared to self-cluster. Specifically, regions corresponding to the intermediate states (blue) often connect to give rise to nanoscopic domains a few hundred nm in size, and the vast majority of the immobilization sites (red) are surrounded by the intermediate domains. By contrast, regions corresponding to the fast state occupy the majority of the membrane area. While both the intermediate and the immobilization domains appeared to be dynamic, a time-lapse domain map (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>) showed that at least some of these domains could last a few minutes (to be further addressed below in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, spatial mapping of the KRas<sup>G12D</sup> state coordinates provided visual evidence for the physical presence of nested, nanoscopic domains conferring the distinct KRas<sup>G12D</sup> diffusion states.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Temporal properties of the KRas<sup>G12D</sup>-associated immobile and intermediate domains.</title><p>(<bold>AâC</bold>) Pair correlation analysis of the state coordinates at different time intervals (1, 5, 10, and 20 min).Â The amplitude (maximal <italic>g(r)</italic> value) of the pair correlation function at each time interval was plotted in the main panel with the raw pair correlation plots shown in the inset.

To avoid false clustering due to the same molecule staying in the same state across multiple frames, we used the averaged state coordinate for each continuous trajectory segment that stayed in the same state for more than two consecutive time points (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods). Results from both datasets taken at 35 ms/frame (main panels) and those at 12 ms/frame (inset) are shown for comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2DâE</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with the visual observation earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), coordinates of the immobile and the intermediate states each showed significant clustering in the <italic>g(r)</italic> plots averaged across each 1 min raw image stacks, whereas <italic>g(r)</italic> of the fast state was barely above random across the full range of <italic>r</italic> analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). All <italic>g(r)</italic> negative controls were generated with a 2D Markovian simulation of diffusing particles with no associated domains (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods), and the simulated trajectories were processed through the same analysis pipeline as the experimental data. As expected, the averaged state coordinates of the simulated negative control had values close to one and showed no peak in the <italic>g(r)</italic> plots. Furthermore, <italic>g(r)</italic> based on spatial cross-correlation analysis clearly indicated co-clustering between the immobile and the intermediate state positions but not with the fast diffusion state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Transient nanodomains mediate the intermediate and the immobile states of KRas<sup>G12D</sup></title><p>We also estimated the lower-bound size of the domains associated with the immobile and the intermediate states of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> by calculating the maximum distance a molecule traveled while in a domain (i.e., longest distance between two points within consecutive steps taken while in the same state). Shown in the main panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> are the histograms of the estimated domain sizes determined from data taken at 35 ms/frame, based on which we determined that the mean diameters of the intermediate and the immobile membrane domains were approximatelyÂ ~200 nm andÂ ~70 nm, respectively. This is consistent with the notion that most immobilization domains are likely surrounded by intermediate domains. The distinction between the two domains became much less significant with data taken at 12 ms/frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, inset), which we attributed to the shorter trajectory durations (~50 ms at 12 ms/frame compared toÂ ~175 ms at 35 ms/frame; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), which in turn was due to the lower photon yield per frame from single PAmCherry1 molecules at this fast frame rate. In essence, the molecules failed to sample a large enough area within the short duration of the trajectories to report the domain size accurately. In addition, the distribution of the minimum intermediate domain size appeared to have at least two peaks atÂ ~120 nm andÂ ~230 nm, implying that there may potentially be multiple types of intermediate domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p>To understand the temporal behavior of the immobilization and the intermediate domains associated with KRas<sup>G12D</sup>, we extended <italic>g(r)</italic> calculations as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> from one minute to longer time intervals. The rationale was that, as the time interval for calculating <italic>g(r)</italic> increases beyond the lifetime of a domain, the chance of observing KRas<sup>G12D</sup> molecules visiting the same domain (i.e., exhibiting the same diffusion state in close proximity) should decrease, resulting in lower <italic>g(r)</italic> amplitudes. Indeed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâC</xref>, for dataset acquired at 12 ms frame interval, the peak amplitudes of <italic>g(r)</italic> for both the immobile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and the intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) states decreased significantly afterÂ ~5 min with further decay at increasing time intervals, indicative of finite lifetimes for both nanodomains, likely on the order of minutes on average (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref> for results with data taken at 35 ms/frame). For the limited temporal resolution of this analysis, we likely only detected relatively stable domains with lifetimes longer than 1 min, and the presence of more transient intermediate or immobilization domains should not be ruled out.</p><p>To gain insight into how KRas<sup>G12D</sup> interacts with the different membrane domains, we also analyzed the frame-to-frame deflection angle for the molecules within each domain. The deflection angle measures the relationship between the current and the preceding step: a complete random walk would yield a flat distribution of deflection angles, whereas a preference for acute angles indicates more âreturningâ steps. The measurement will likely be affected by localization error: for individual angles, larger localization error (relative to the step sizes) would add significant noise to the measured angles; for ensemble measurement of a large number of angles, however, the localization error would affect all angles in an unbiased manner. Thus, despite the finite localization precision at our frame rates, we expect that the measured step angles to reflect the interactions between KRas<sup>G12D</sup> and the membrane domains. Indeed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, KRas<sup>G12D</sup> molecules trapped in either the immobilization or the intermediate domains (the red and the blue lines) were more likely to exhibit acute deflection angles, potentially due to backward movements at the domain boundaries. Between the two domains, the enrichment of acute angles was more significant for the immobile state because the associated domains were smaller, such that KRas<sup>G12D</sup> molecules had a higher chance of hitting the domain boundaries. In comparison, KRas<sup>G12D</sup> molecules in the fast state exhibit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, the green line) equal probabilities of moving in all directions, consistent with Brownian motion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>KRas<sup>G12D</sup> is constitutively depleted from the immobile state and replenished to the fast state</title><p>The small variance in the estimated model parameters from data taken on different cells, be it from the same or different samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), led us to hypothesize that KRas<sup>G12D</sup> membrane diffusion is in a steady state.

In the new, âequilibratedâ system configuration, KRas<sup>G12D</sup> spends as much asÂ ~50% of its time in the immobile state, significantly more than the observed steady state occupancy ofÂ ~11%. The fast state is the opposite: the population residing in this state is significantly reduced fromÂ ~58% toÂ ~25%. By contrast, the intermediate state changes only slightly (~31% vsÂ ~24% for the experimental observationsÂ and the simulations, respectively).

Therefore, we concluded that the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> represents a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS).</p><p>To further characterize the NESS, we calculated the mass flow for each of the three KRas<sup>G12D</sup> diffusion states as the change in state occupancy per time interval.

For the KRas<sup>G12D</sup> NESS system to be sustained over time as we observed experimentally, KRas<sup>G12D</sup> would need to be replenished into the fast diffusion state and removed from the immobile state. Indeed, KRas<sup>G12D</sup> has previously been shown to undergo a constant exchange between the plasma membrane and the cytosol, and internalized KRas<sup>G12D</sup> is collected at recycling endosomes and transported back to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmick et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schmick et al., 2015</xref>). Our analyses suggest that the loss of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> from the membrane could be through the immobile state, and the replenishment through the fast state. At present, it is unclear whether the intermediate state has no exchange with the cytosol or has active exchange with equal gain and loss. Accordingly, the membrane trafficking of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> should follow the model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, where the arrows indicate the net mass flow between the connected states as well as between the states (F or I) and the environment (such as the cytosol).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>KRas<sup>G12D</sup> diffusion model is invariant over a range of expression levels</title><p>Next, we sought to investigate whether experimental conditions such as expression level would alter the diffusion properties of KRas<sup>G12D</sup>. An important observation on Ras nanocluster (multimer) formation is that the fraction of clustered molecules remains constant over a broad range of expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Plowman et al., 2005</xref>). This unusual property has led to two hypothetical mechanisms of membrane nanocluster formation: one based on protein self-nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Plowman et al., 2005</xref>) and another involving actomyosin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gowrishankar et al., 2012</xref>). These active mechanisms are in contrast to passive localization of Ras to existing membrane nanodomains (e.g. via diffusion), which was thought to result in concentration-dependent multimer formation and therefore be inconsistent with the constant fraction of clustered Ras. To date, it remains controversial as to which mechanism mediates Ras multimer formation, including the basic question of whether membrane nanodomains are involved. We reasoned that, if KRas<sup>G12D</sup> multimers form in membrane nanodomains â for example the intermediate and/or the immobilization domains in this case â then the observed fraction(s) of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> in either or both the intermediate and the immobile states should also be independent of expression level, as for the fraction of Ras molecules in multimers (clusters).</p><p>To address this question, we induced PAmCherry1-KRas<sup>G12D</sup> at a range of expression levels using different Dox concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Using spt-PALM and detailed trajectory analysis, we were able to uncover rich details of how KRas<sup>G12D</sup> localizes and interacts with the membrane. Our results suggest that KRas<sup>G12D</sup> diffusion on the membrane is best recapitulated with a model that comprises three states â a fast state, an immobile state, and a previously unknown intermediate state. Leveraging the large number of diffusion trajectories, we were able to map the locations where KRas<sup>G12D</sup> exhibits specific diffusion states. These maps revealed membrane nanodomains corresponding to the intermediate and the immobile states of KRas<sup>G12D</sup>. The intermediate nanodomains encompass the immobilization sites in a nested configuration, such that KRas<sup>G12D</sup> almost always transitions between the fast and the immobile states through the intermediate state. We also found that KRas<sup>G12D</sup> membrane diffusion is in a non-equilibrium steady state, with KRas<sup>G12D</sup> constitutively removed from the membrane through the immobile sites and replenished as fast diffusing molecules, potentially coupled to KRas<sup>G12D</sup> trafficking via endocytosis and recycling. Importantly, partitioning of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> into the three states remains invariant over a wide range of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> expression levels, demonstrating that KRas<sup>G12D</sup> diffusion and trafficking through the three mobility states and associated nanodomains is in a maintained, homeostatic condition. Together, these data start to paint a clear picture of the spatiotemporal dynamics of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> on the membrane, providing the basis for understanding the mechanisms of Ras multimer formation and signaling.</p><p>Based on these findings, we propose a new model for Ras membrane diffusion and trafficking as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. In this model, Ras experiences at least three types of membrane environments: a âregularâ membrane region in which Ras freely diffuses with large step sizes, a âtransition zoneâ or intermediate domain with increased viscous drag and reduced step size, and within the latter an âimmobilizationâ site where Ras interacts with relatively static structures or molecules. Both the transition zones and the immobilization sites have finite lifetimes, some up to minutes, during which freely diffusing KRas<sup>G12D</sup> molecules could enter the transition zone, slow down, then either return to the fast state or become trapped at the immobilization sites. During entrapment, a fraction of the trapped KRas<sup>G12D</sup> molecules leaves the plasma membrane to enter the cycle of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> trafficking. This is in agreement with the current understanding that the removal of KRasÂ from the membrane through endocytosis is concentration dependent and thatÂ the localization of KRasÂ to the plasma membrane is an energy driven, PDEÎ´ and Arl2-mediated enrichment processÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmick et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schmick et al., 2015</xref>). Our work adds important details to this trafficking model in that the removal of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> from the plasma membrane likely occurs during the entrapment phase and its recycling primarily takes place in membrane regions conferring fast mobility. Additionally, the transient entrapment of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> could also provide an effective mechanism to locally concentrate Ras molecules to facilitate multimer formation, which arguably is a critical step for signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nussinov et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the various membrane nanodomains directly influence the mobility, trafficking, and potentially multimer formation and signaling of KRas<sup>G12D</sup>, although details of the trafficking and multimer formation processes are yet to be defined.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for membrane nanodomains regulating KRas<sup>G12D</sup> mobility and trafficking.</title><p>For KRas<sup>G12D</sup>, the cell membrane comprises of at least three different compartments conferring each of the three diffusion states , namely the fast (and free), the intermediate, and the immobile diffusion states, depicted as green, blue, and red regions, respectively. The membrane compartments associated with the immobile and the intermediate states of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> are nanoscopic membrane structures. KRas<sup>G12D</sup> is continuously removed from the immobile state, some of which may be mediated via endocytosis. Internalized KRas<sup>G12D</sup> molecules are eventually transported back to the membrane as fast diffusing species through incompletely understood recycling processes. KRas<sup>G12D</sup> immobilization domains could locally enrich KRas<sup>G12D</sup> molecules to facilitate KRas<sup>G12D</sup> multimer formation and potentially signaling.

While heterogeneous diffusion properties of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> and other Ras isoforms have been reported, the prior studies lacked the throughput or spatiotemporal resolutions to determine whether two states, namely a fast diffusion state and an immobile state, are adequate to recapitulate KRas<sup>G12D</sup> diffusion on the membrane. With the diffusion model defined, we were able to subsequently demonstrate that the intermediate and immobile states of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> are each associated with a distinct membrane domain. The measured sizes of the immobilization and the intermediate domains of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> wereÂ ~70 nm andÂ ~200 nm, respectively, consistent with previous beliefs that nanoscopic membrane domains regulate Ras organization on the membrane. We note that, although a three-state model best fits our data, the model could still be an over-simplification. Among other possibilities, both endocytic and non-endocytic mechanisms may contribute to the immobilization of Ras but cannot be distinguished based on diffusion properties since Ras is immobile in both cases. In fact, there are also indications of more than one type of intermediate domains judging from the estimated domain size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>An important feature of the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> is that the membrane nanodomains associated with the immobile state of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> are surrounded by those associated with the intermediate state, creating a nested configuration between the two nanodomains. A plausible scenario is that the structures that trap KRas<sup>G12D</sup> preferentially form in the membrane regions enriched in certain proteins or lipids and/or more densely packed. In this scenario, KRas<sup>G12D</sup> would have to travel through the intermediate zone to access the immobilization structures, explaining the state transition pathway in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. This scenario is also consistent with the observation that the intermediate domains are on average larger in size than the immobilization domains, and that the two nanodomains have similar lifetimes (to the extent of our temporal resolution). In support of this hypothetic scenario, a growing body of literature demonstrates the importance of phosphatidylserine in KRas clustering and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ariotti et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to the KRas tail encoding for phosphatidylserine specificity, a significant fraction of phosphatidylserine display slow motion on the membrane as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kay et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Aside from the steady state partitioning of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> in the different membrane domains, our data also offered important insight into the membrane dynamics of KRas<sup>G12D</sup>. We measured a constant flow of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> from the fast state to the immobile state. Without exchanging KRas<sup>G12D</sup> with the cytosol, this directional flow would have caused net loss of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> from the fast state and accumulation in the immobile state as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4BâC</xref>, yet the experimentally observed state configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) remained stable over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We therefore reasoned that KRas<sup>G12D</sup> needs to be constantly removed from the immobile state (âsinkâ) and replenished via the fast state (âsourceâ), potentially coupled to membrane trafficking such as endocytosis and recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmick et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schmick et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rocks et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2009</xref>), since previous studies have shown that endocytosis is a primary mechanism for KRas<sup>G12D</sup> removal from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmick et al., 2014</xref>). In support of this, the lifetime of the immobilization domains was estimated to be on the order of 2â5 min on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâB</xref>), which is typical of many endocytic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mayor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaksonen et al., 2005</xref>). The exact mechanism of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> internalization, however, remains incompletely understood at present.</p><p>It is noteworthy that the spatial partitioning of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> and more generally the diffusion model were invariant over a broad range of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> expression levels, which coincides with previous observations where the clustered fraction of KRas or HRas was independent of the protein expression level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Plowman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tian et al., 2007</xref>). This corroborates the idea that membrane partitioning of Ras and perhaps many other membrane resident molecules are in an actively maintained, homeostatic condition. This intriguing property of certain membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Plowman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sharma et al., 2004</xref>) has drawn much attention and led to at least two mechanistic models of multimer formation, one based on self-nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Plowman et al., 2005</xref>) and the other driven by actomyosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gowrishankar et al., 2012</xref>). Both mechanisms assumed the different states of the protein on the plasma membrane to be in equilibrium. Our results argue that the mass exchange between the plasma membrane and the cytosol breaks the equilibrium and has to be taken into account in order to accurately model the partitioning behavior of membrane proteins. A clear, mechanistic understanding of this property is important to understand how Ras functions on the membrane, since the Ras multimers have been strongly implicated in signaling. Further experimental and computational work along this line is currently underway.</p><p>A fundamental albeit implicit result from the present study is the importance of experimental parameters in accurately determining the diffusion model, a critical step for in-depth analysis of protein dynamics on the membrane. While there are many different software packages for analyzing spt-PALM trajectories, the importance of controlling the particle density during image acquisition has not previously been recognized to our knowledge. Imaging at a per frame particle density of 0.05â0.1 per Âµm<sup>2</sup>, which is typical for single-molecule localization microscopy, yielded varying estimated model parameters in our early attempts to track KRas<sup>G12D</sup> with spt-PALM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplements 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">5</xref>). Using simulations, we found the source of variability to be a small fraction of misconnected trajectories mostly caused by fast moving molecules. In order to minimize the trajectory misconnection, we kept the density of activated PAmCherry1 in each frame to below 0.03 per Âµm<sup>2</sup> at an acquisition rate of 12 ms/frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). With this precaution, we were able to yield a highly consistent diffusion model from trajectories acquired in different cells and under different conditions. This was critical to defining a previously unresolved state with intermediate mobility (DÂ ~Â 0.3 Âµm<sup>2</sup>/s) and to all subsequent analyses. We recommend the same precautions to be taken for studies of other membrane molecules.</p><p>In summary, our work sheds new light on how complex nanodomains organize on the membrane to dictate Ras diffusion and trafficking. The insights gained here offer useful guidance to future experiments that aim at determining the molecular and structural identities of the Ras-associated membrane nanodomains and defining the mechanisms of Ras multimer formation and signaling. The results demonstrate the utility of high-throughput SPT and trajectory analysis in uncovering rich details of the spatiotemporal dynamics of Ras on the membrane, which should be readily applicable to studies of other membrane molecules or processes in cellular compartments.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">U2OS</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0042">CVCL_0042</ext-link> <break/>ATCC Cat#: <break/>HTB_96</td><td valign="top">Parent cell line for generating U2OS-tetR</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">U2OS-tetR</td><td valign="top">This paper.</td><td valign="top">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_XZ88">CVCL_XZ88</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Single U2OS clone stably expressing the tet repressor (tetR).</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">U2OS-tetR <break/>PA-mCherry1-KRas G12D</td><td valign="top">This paper.</td><td valign="top">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_XZ89">CVCL_XZ89</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Single U2OS cell clone stably expressing PAmCherry1-KRas<sup>G12D</sup>under Doxycycline regulation</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-RAS <break/>(mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_941040">AB_941040</ext-link> <break/>Abcam Cat#: ab55391</td><td valign="top">Mouse monoclonal antibody</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-beta-Tubulin <break/>(mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Thermo <break/>Fisher</td><td valign="top">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_86547">AB_86547</ext-link> <break/>ThermoFisher Cat#: 32â2600</td><td valign="top">Mouse monoclonal antibody</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">vbSPT</td><td valign="top">Perssonet al. <break/></td><td valign="top">RRID:Â <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_017554">SCR_017554</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Algorithm for extracting diffusion parameters from SPT data</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Î¼Manager</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_000415">SCR_000415</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Micro-manager open source microscopy platform</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>KRas<sup>G12D</sup> was genetically fused to PAmCherry1, a red fluorescent protein, to ensure high labeling specificity and efficiency.

In addition, the threshold for maximum displacement between adjacent frames also had an impact on trajectory misconnection, although to a lesser extent for the values tested using simulated trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). Thus, for diffusion model construction, we chose to use a high frame rate (12 ms/frame) and a low particle density (&lt;0.03 Âµm<sup>â2</sup>) to eliminate misconnected trajectory segments while maintaining a sufficient number of trajectories. However, it is beneficial to obtain more trajectories to accurately infer the model parameters with vbSPTÂ (RRID:Â <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_017554">SCR_017554</ext-link>), especially for the transition probabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Persson et al., 2013</xref>). As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>, the diffusion coefficients and the occupancies typically converged with only a few thousand trajectories, but the transition probabilities required significantly more trajectories to converge. Thus, we usually acquired spt-PALM data at higher particle densities once the model size has been defined; for these datasets, we could safely enforce a three-state model during vbSPT data analysis, since the diffusion model should not depend on the rates of frame acquisition rate and photoactivation. This strategy allowed more flexibility in spt-PALM data acquisition and robustness in the subsequent analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Trajectory connection for single particle tracking</title><p>We constructed single-molecule diffusion trajectories of PAmCherry1-KRas<sup>G12D</sup> by connecting the centroid positions of the same particles in successive frames. Particles in adjacent frames were deemed to be the same particle if their centroids were within a certain threshold distance. To define the threshold distance, we first constructed the trajectories using a large (~2,000 nm) distance, from which a step size histogram could be obtained (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). The step size histogram from PAmCherry1-KRas<sup>G12D</sup> typically consists of two segments; signal and noise. The first segment comprises the signal with the first peak aroundÂ ~70 nm and extending toÂ ~500 nm, and all step sizes beyondÂ ~500 nm was attributed to noise originating from misconnected trajectories generated by the unrealistically large threshold distance. Based on this histogram, we reconstructed the diffusion trajectories using 500 nm as the threshold distance for 12 ms frame acquisition, and 800 nm for 35 ms frame rate movies (using the same method). A new step size histogram was then obtained, which was essentially identical to the first segment of the original step size histogram, confirming that the new threshold distance eliminated most of the misconnected trajectories. The step size histograms of trajectories obtained under the same conditions were also highly consistent, allowing us to set the same threshold value for each condition. Trajectories were terminated if multiple particles were found within the threshold distance in the next frame. Further, all movies acquired at 12 ms frame rate had the additional constraint of having fewer than 0.03 particles/Âµm<sup>2</sup> for every frame to lower the chance of misconnecting two different particles in adjacent frames. Thus, all resulting trajectories were constructed without ambiguity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>2D Markov simulation</title><p>We relied on 2D simulations that mimic experimental observations for both experiment optimization and as controls for some of the analysis.

to determine the diffusion characteristics of an active mutant of Kras on live cell membranes. They report three diffusion states and identified a previously unidentified intermediate mobile state. They provide evidence for distinct membrane domains corresponding to different diffusion states and show that the transition from the fast state to immobile state has to go through the intermediate state. They further suggest that KRas is depleted from the membrane via the immobile state and replenished to the fast state via endocytosis and recycling. This work provides several new insights into the membrane behaviors of KRas. The experimental approaches are thorough and rigorous.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;High-throughput single-particle tracking reveals nested membrane nanodomains that dictate Ras diffusion and trafficking&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) KRas has two different isoforms (KRas4A and KRas4B) and various mutant forms. Considering that different KRas versions may have different diffusion characteristics, please include the specific information of the KRas construct used in this study and provide the rationale on focusing on the G12D mutant. Moreover, since the analysis is restricted to KRas<sup>G12D</sup>, this should be acknowledged in the title and Abstract.</p><p>2) The interpretation of the 3 states identified by the vbSPT analysis that underpin the model proposed in Figure 7 is unclear. Intuitively one would expect that a molecule that goes from a fast diffusion state to immobilization may transit through an intermediate diffusion state and the question arises to what extent the method and SPT imaging parameters influence the identification of the third intermediate state. The transition rates and the spatial correlation between the intermediate diffusion state and the slow/immobile state could also arise from analyzing trajectories without the necessary simultaneous high spatial and temporal resolution so that molecules transition from free to immobile appear to be in a third intermediate state due to the limited resolution. Can the authors exclude this possibility and ensure that the statement that the third state is 'an obligatory link' is not an overinterpretation?</p><p>3) What are the domains sizes when the data were taken with 12 ms/frame rates (subsection âKRas diffusion states correspond to distinct membrane domainsâ, third paragraph)? Are the data of the step angles (Figure 3D) consistent with domain sizes of &lt;70 nm for immobile diffusion given the localization precision of the experiment?</p><p>4) The authors speculate that the transition between the intermediate into the immobile state could be caused by conformational changes or transient binding events (or both). However, both of these processes are much faster than the transition observed with spt-PALM. Further, there are alternative explanations for two spatially correlated diffusion states such as intermediate diffusion in membrane domains and protein-protein interactions within in these domains (immobile diffusion), interaction with cortical actin versus interaction with effector proteins etc.</p><p>5) Figure 5. The authors conclude KRas is in a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS). Could KRas at the plasma membrane be in an steady state equilibrium when one takes non-membrane bound KRAS into account that is not being detected? How is a NESS model consistent with the active mechanisms of multimer formation that is discussed later in the manuscript (subsection âKRas diffusion model is invariant over a range of expression levelsâ, first paragraph)?</p><p>6) The authors provide no evidence that the 'immobile domain' (i.e. the domains in which KRas is immobile, as distinct from the domains being immobile) are membrane invaginations as depicted in Figure 7.</p><p>7) To demonstrate that KRas is depleted from the membrane via the immobile state and replenished to fast state via endocytosis and recycling, experiments should be repeated with inhibition of the endocytic pathway.</p><p>8) The use of the dox-regulated expression system is good because this prevents over-expression problems. The data to support this is presented in Figure 1A. However, the endogenous and recombinant Ras proteins are presented in different strips â it is therefore not obvious how these should be compared. At a minimum, the figure legend text should state that the exposure times for the endogenous and recombinant Ras images were the same.</p><p>9) Are the transition rates influences by the (average) trajectory length i.e. the probability that a molecule undergoes transition? What is the average trajectory length?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46393.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) KRas has two different isoforms (KRas4A and KRas4B) and various mutant forms.

First, the G12D mutant is constitutively active, making it convenient to study potential connections between Ras diffusion and signaling via perturbations (e.g. dynamin inhibition) without having to stimulate the cells with serum or growth factors first. Second, from our unpublished preliminary results, KRas WT and G12D appear to be highly similar â if not identical â in both spatial organization and diffusion dynamics, thus results on KRas<sup>G12D</sup> are actually representative of KRas properties in general. For considerations on the length and focus of this manuscript, we chose to not discuss KRas signaling or the comparison between KRas WT and G12D at this point; work in these directions is currently underway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The interpretation of the 3 states identified by the vbSPT analysis that underpin the model proposed in Figure 7 is unclear.

Can the authors exclude this possibility and ensure that the statement that the third state is 'an obligatory link' is not an overinterpretation?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing up this very important question, and our answer is yes â we are confident that the intermediate state is a true state and an obligatory link between the fast and the immobile states instead of an artefact of unresolved state mixing based on the evidence below,</p><p>- Spt-PALM data acquired at 35 ms/frame and those at 12 ms/frame gave rise to the same, 3-state diffusion model with consistent occupancy for all three states (Figure 2A and Figure 6âfigure supplement 1). This suggests that the intermediate state is unlikely a result of insufficient time resolution that led to unresolved transitions between the fast and the immobile states, because we would have otherwise observed significantly higher occupancy for the intermediate state at 35 ms/frame. In fact, from the model presented in Figure 2A, it is clear that the transition probabilities between each pair of states were low (&lt; 0.1 in each case), suggesting that state transitions were rare events compared with image acquisition, therefore the states could be clearly resolved at both 12 ms and 35 ms time resolutions.</p><p>- To also exclude the possibility that insufficient spatial resolution (or localization precision in this case) caused an artefactual âintermediateâ state, we have performed additional computer simulations to define the impact of localization error on vbSPT model output.</p><p>The details of the simulations could be found in the new Figure 1âfigure supplement 4. Results from these simulations show that, even at localization errors as high as 100 nm, vbSPT will not yield a three-state model if the underlying diffusion follows two states (see Figure 1âfigure supplement 4A). Of note, the single-molecule localization errors in our experiments were typically around 25 nm (at 35 ms/frame) to 40 nm (at 12 ms/frame). Thus, we do not think that the intermediate state was a result of insufficient spatial resolution (precision) either.</p><p>- We are also confident about the three-state model because of the consistency across the data acquired from different cells and even under different Dox concentrations, when spt-PALM data were acquired under optimal image acquisition conditions (Figure 1). As we also discussed in the manuscript, even when spt-PALM data were acquired under non-optimal conditions (e.g. particle density too high), at which point vbSPT model output would exhibit significant variability, the resulting diffusion coefficients for all the states still clustered around three values: ~0.05 Âµm<sup>2</sup>/s, ~0.25 Âµm<sup>2</sup>/s, and ~0.80 Âµm<sup>2</sup>/s. These results further suggest that KRas<sup>G12D</sup> indeed exhibits three diffusion states.</p><p>- Last but not least, the three-state model was confirmed independently by Dr. Thomas Turbyville and colleagues at the NCI <italic>RAS Initiative</italic>, where they have used a different tagging strategy (the Halo-tag) that afforded single-molecule tracking at 5 ms/frame. This personal communication after we completed the manuscript and did not play a role in how we defined our diffusion model, it offers additional evidence for our conclusions.</p><p>In retrospect, we did not arrive at this consistent three-state model without substantial efforts. The major obstacle, as alluded above and also pointed out by the reviewer, was that the imaging and data processing parameters did have an impact on the consistency of the model output. That was why we focused on the importance of carefully controlling the data acquisition conditions in the first subsection in Results (with 6 figure supplements to Figure 1), with the hope to inform fellow scientists of the steps necessary to accurately define the diffusion model using spt-PALM and vbSPT.</p><p>As the reviewer also alluded to, the fact that the various datasets all led to a three-state model with define state transition path should not be just a coincidence. It may represent organizationally and biophysically plausible scenario for membrane proteins to transition from a fast (F) state to an immobile (I) state by going through an intermediate (N) state, which could otherwise be an abrupt change in mobility. While we do not have data for a large number of membrane proteins to certify the generality of this statement, our preliminary data indicate that the same applies to both KRAS WT. A recent study on b2-adrenergic receptor (Schwenzer et al., bioRxiv; http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/406488; posted on September 3, 2019) also revealed a similar scenario where the receptor transitions between the F state and the I state via an N state (see Figure 3 therein). Thus, the same three-state configuration may be more generally applicable to many other targets.</p><p>We have updated our manuscript based on the discussions above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) What are the domains sizes when the data were taken with 12 ms/frame rates (subsection âKRas diffusion states correspond to distinct membrane domainsâ, third paragraph)? Are the data of the step angles (Figure 3D) consistent with domain sizes of &lt;70 nm for immobile diffusion given the localization precision of the experiment?</p></disp-quote><p>The average domain sizes for the intermediate and the immobile states were measured to be ~80 nm and ~100 nm when the images were acquired at 12 ms/frame (Figure 2F, inset), and hence our statement ââ¦ The distinction between the two domains became much <italic>less</italic> significant with data taken at 12 ms/frame. â¦â. Apologies for missing the word â<italic>less</italic>â in our original text, which has now been corrected. Prompted by this question, we have also revised the following sentence ââ¦ which we attribute to the low localization precision of PAmCherry1 molecules at this fast frame rate â¦â to ââ¦which we attributed to the shorter trajectory durations (~50 ms at 12 ms/frame compared to ~175 ms at 35 ms/frame; see Figure 1âfigure supplement 1), which in turn was due to the lower photon yield per frame from single PAmCherry1 molecules at this fast frame rateâ.</p><p>The way that we estimated the domain size associated with a specific diffusion state of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> was to measure the maximum distance between two localizations of KRas<sup>G12D</sup> while in the state. Thus, the measured domain size depends on three factors: the actual domain size, the spatial precision, and lastly the efficiency of domain sampling. While moving within a membrane domain, PAmCherry1-KRas<sup>G12D</sup> molecules report their locations to âpaintâ the outline of the domain; the longer these molecules can be tracked, the better sampling of the domain is, and the more accurate the estimated domain size is. Thus, for domain size measurements, data taken at 35 ms/frame will be more reliable because of the better spatial precision and the longer duration of the trajectories (~175 ms on average at 35 ms/frame vs. ~50 ms on average at 12 ms/frame). In comparison, domain sizes measured from data taken at ~12 ms/frame will have smaller contributions from the actual motions of the molecules and instead be dominated by localization precision (~40 nm localization error, or 40*sqrt(2) ~ 56 nm error for point-to-point measurements) for both the immobilization and the intermediate domains. This resulted in a much smaller difference between the estimated sizes for the two domains from data taken at 12 ms/frame; it is also part of the reason why we combined information from both frame rates depending on the type of analysis.</p><p>The precision of step angle measurements (Figure 3D) will be affected by the localization error, particularly when the steps are short (relative to the localization error). That said, the localization error will add uncertainty to all measured step angles in an unbiased manner. Thus, the overall distribution of the step angle (not individual angles) would be similar to the true distribution, especially when the sample size is large as in our case (e.g. &gt;50k for each domain with pooled data). This explains why we were able to observe clear differences in the step angle distributions for the fast, the intermediate, and the immobile states of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>.</p><p>Based on this analysis, we think that the step angle distributions reflect the nature of the interactions between KRas<sup>G12D</sup> and the respective membrane domains. In particular, the small size (&lt;70 nm) of the immobilization domain is consistent with the observed enrichment of acute angles (Figure 3D). This is because the preference for acute angles is primarily associated with the domain boundary (if the molecules prefer to stay within the current domain instead of crossing over to another; itâd be the opposite if the molecules prefer to escape). By contrast, for steps inside the domain, there would be no preference for any particular angles. Thus, the smaller the domain, the higher probability the molecules will hit the boundary during diffusion, and the stronger the preference for acute angles (again, if the molecules prefer to stay within the current domain). This should also explain why the enrichment of acute angles for the intermediate domain is not as significant as the immobilization domain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors speculate that the transition between the intermediate into the immobile state could be caused by conformational changes or transient binding events (or both). However, both of these processes are much faster than the transition observed with spt-PALM. Further, there are alternative explanations for two spatially correlated diffusion states such as intermediate diffusion in membrane domains and protein-protein interactions within in these domains (immobile diffusion), interaction with cortical actin versus interaction with effector proteins etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies for the confusion. We did not mean to exclude other mechanisms that could give rise to the various diffusion states of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>. Our work focused on the role of membrane organization â that is, the nanodomains â in governing the diffusion and trafficking of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>. The mechanisms through which the nanodomains confer different mobilities for KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> are currently unknown. As pointed out by the reviewers, conformational changes, transient binding (including that to proteins, lipids, or other types of molecules), and molecular packing, could all impact KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> diffusion. Thus, KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> diffusion state transitions can be viewed as domain crossing events potentially accompanied by conformational changes, transient binding events (including that with cortical actin), or other events.</p><p>We would also like to use this opportunity to clarify that, although conformational changes and transient binding events are expected to be much faster than our frame rate (12 ms/frame or slower), distinct states can be captured and resolved as long as the molecules stay in each state sufficiently long. For example KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> stayed in each state for a few 100 ms on average (judging from the state transition rates in Figure 2A), thus the individual states can be captured at 12-35 ms/frame with little ambiguity. We continue to work on improving the spatial and temporal resolution of spt-PALM experiments, such that even more details during state transitions can be captured, to help address questions including whether there are multiple types of immobilization and/or intermediate domains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 5. The authors conclude KRas is in a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS). Could KRas at the plasma membrane be in an steady state equilibrium when one takes non-membrane bound KRAS into account that is not being detected?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we think that membrane-bound and cytoplasmic KRAS should be in an equilibrium steady state as a whole (unless there is significant loss of KRAS from this system via processes such as exocytosis).</p><p>While the sub-system of membrane-bound KRAS is in a non-equilibrium steady state, the whole system comprising both membrane-bound (detected by TIRF) and cytoplasmic (not detected by TIRF) KRAS should constitute an equilibrium steady state. Here, the cytoplasmic compartment serves to receive KRAS removed from the cell membrane (likely via the immobile state) and replenish KRAS to the cell membrane (at membrane locations that support fast diffusion), establishing a âcycleâ of KRAS trafficking through which an equilibrium can be maintained. In fact, the continuous exchange of Ras proteins between the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm has been observed on HRAS and NRAS (Rocks et al., 2005) and more recently on KRAS (Schmick et al., 2014; 2015). Our data and model are consistent with the previous reports on RAS trafficking.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How is a NESS model consistent with the active mechanisms of multimer formation that is discussed later in the manuscript (subsection âKRas diffusion model is invariant over a range of expression levelsâ, first paragraph)?</p></disp-quote><p>At present we do not have sufficient data to conclude on the relationship between the NESS model and the mechanisms of KRAS multimer formation. How RAS forms multimers still remains unclear and was only touched upon in our work. What our data revealed was that nanodomain localization and multimer formation are likely correlated processes, because the fraction of KRAS in multimers (from previous reports) and that in nanodomains (from our data) are both constant over a broad range of KRAS expression levels. In addition, the fact that membrane-bound KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> is in a NESS begs for re-examination of previous models for RAS multimer formation, since previous active or passive models assumed an equilibrium steady state for membrane-bound RAS. This may change current views in the field that disfavor the passive mechanisms (which would have resulted in an expression level-dependent fraction of clustered RAS in an equilibrium system), but a more systematic investigation would be necessary to better define how RAS forms multimers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors provide no evidence that the 'immobile domain' (i.e. the domains in which KRas is immobile, as distinct from the domains being immobile) are membrane invaginations as depicted in Figure 7.</p></disp-quote><p>There were indeed no data provided to prove that the KRas<sup>G12D</sup> immobilization domains are membrane invaginations in Figure 7. For the scope of this work, we meant to depict some potential scenarios where KRAS could be internalized. In addition to the membrane invaginations, we also drew some immobilization domains as âflatâ membrane regions in the original Figure 7. These scenarios were included because previous literature reports suggested that although endocytosis is primarily responsible for KRAS internalization, non-endocytic mechanisms should not be ruled out (Schmick et al., 2014; 2015). The same papers described how recycling vesicles return KRAS to the plasma membrane. We did not mean to dive into this subject here other than citing literature.</p><p>To clarify the purpose of having Figure 7, we have modified the schematic to reflect the facts a) that both endocytic and non-endocytic compartments (both potentially linked to the KRAS immobilization domains) could be involved; and b) that the exact mechanisms through which KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> is removed from the immobilization is currently unknown (hence the question marks). We have also softened the language in relevant sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) To demonstrate that KRas is depleted from the membrane via the immobile state and replenished to fast state via endocytosis and recycling, experiments should be repeated with inhibition of the endocytic pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>Analyzing KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> diffusion in the presence of endocytosis inhibitors is a great suggestion. We actually performed such experiments but chose not to include the data in this manuscript because we would like to focus on the nested nanodomains and the NESS model. For the importance of this issue, we would like to discuss some of our preliminary results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). These results also suggest that identifying the sites of KRAS immobilization, internalization, and recycling would require a larger body of work (which is currently underway). For the current work, we have modified the text to clearly state âKRAS<sup>G12D</sup> immobilization sites are linked to endocytosisâ as a hypothesis based on literature evidence instead of a conclusion at present.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Effect of dynamin inhibition (with Dyngo 4a) on KRas<sup>G12D</sup> diffusion.</title><p>Shown in the plots were diffusion constants for all detected states by vbSPT.

After dynamin treatment, KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> accumulates on the membrane (data not shown) and interestingly, the majority of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> molecules become immobile. Dynamin is involved in many types of endocytic vesicles. Thus, the trapping of KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> in the immobile state could suggest that a) stopping KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> internalization cuts off recycling but not accumulation of KRAS to the immobile state; and b) that pre-endocytic membrane structures may be sufficient to trap KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>.</p><p>Using correlative superresolution microscopy, we also obtained preliminary evidence that KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> may interact with multiple types of potentially âstaticâ membrane structures, some of which membrane vesicles adherent to the cortical actin, potentially serving as KRAS immobilization sites (https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927619006834). We expect this complete body of work will be shared with the community in the near future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The use of the dox-regulated expression system is good because this prevents over-expression problems. The data to support this is presented in Figure 1A. However, the endogenous and recombinant Ras proteins are presented in different strips â it is therefore not obvious how these should be compared. At a minimum, the figure legend text should state that the exposure times for the endogenous and recombinant Ras images were the same.</p></disp-quote><p>The strips in the original western blot (as in the original Figure 1A) did have the same exposure, which led to the estimation that exogenous KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> and endogenous KRAS levels were comparable at 2 ng/mL Dox. Prompted by this question, we have re-examined the western blot results and decided not to make this statement based on existing results.</p><p>Specifically, in reviewing the original data, we realized that there was a technical glitch that made all the bands appear as doublets (including the RAS bands), which should not have been the case based on our past experience and literature. We thus have re-run the western blot to correct for the issue. For the new western blot, we had to use a different RAS antibody (Abcam ab55391) because the original antibody had recently been discontinued (sc-521; product link https://www.scbt.com/p/k-ras-2b-antibody-c-19?requestFrom=search). The relative abundance between the endogenous KRAS and PAmCherry1-KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> appeared to be different from what we observed using sc-521. The origin of this difference is unclear to us at present, but it could be due to differences in specificity (Waters et al., Sci. Signal., v10, 2017; http://doi.org/10.1126/scisignal.aao3332). In light of this, we have changed the text to reflect the fact the western blots were only semi-quantitative in quantifying the relative abundance of the endogenous vs. exogenous KRAS, particularly when the isoform specificity of the antibodies is not as well defined.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Are the transition rates influences by the (average) trajectory length i.e. the probability that a molecule undergoes transition? What is the average trajectory length?</p></disp-quote><p>When using vbSPT to analyze spt-PALM data, the average trajectory length does have an impact on the extracted model parameters. In general, the longer the average trajectory, the more accurate the model parameters are (Persson et al., 2013). Thus, it is better to use datasets with longer average trajectory length. That said, the effect seems modest and only becomes significant at trajectory lengths of &gt;100 (data points), which is impractical in most spt-PALM experiments using fluorescent proteins.</p><p>For example, for PAmCherry1-KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> spt-PALM, the average trajectory lengths were ~4 frames and ~5 frames for data acquired at 12 ms/frame and 35 ms/frame, respectively (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1) under our imaging conditions. These values were typical of spt-PALM experiments using fluorescent proteins (see the Persson et al. reference above). The vbSPT algorithm was actually developed to specifically address this challenge (among others); it is able to resolve events at a time scale as long as 10x the average trajectory length, thanks to the stochastic nature of the events, the large number of trajectories, and the presence of a reasonable number of long trajectories. Therefore, longer SPT trajectories could indeed reveal additional events not captured by our current experimental configuration.</p><p>To investigate how the average trajectory length would impact the transition rates, we have taken a group of datasets (12 ms/frame; minimum 10,000 trajectories) and deleted all trajectories shorter than 5 frames. Of these, 6 datasets remained to still contain a sufficient number of trajectories (4,000 â 7,500 trajectories each) for vbSPT to run successfully. These correspond to about ~1/4 of the original number of trajectories in each case. Analyzing the filtered datasets yielded a similar diffusion model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>), demonstrating a net mass flow within the system in the same direction and with similar amplitudes. Also similar are the lack of transitions between the F state and the I state as well as the roughly balanced in-and-out flows of the N state.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Diffusion model (left) and net mass flow analysis (right) using filtered spt-PALM data after removing trajectories shorter than 5 frames.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46393-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>However, we need to point out that, while 4,000-7,500 trajectories are typically sufficient for vbSPT to converge on the model size and the diffusion constants, they are usually NOT sufficient for vbSPT to converge on the transition rates. Thus, despite the similarities between the resulting model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>) and that shown in Figure 2A, there are some differences in the transition rates. With the limited information at hand, it is difficult to assess which approach is better for ensuring accurate transition rate computation â using long trajectories, or a larger number but somewhat shorter trajectories. Since it is usually difficult to increase the trajectory length, the common approach is to try use a larger number of shorter trajectories as we did in this work. That said, we are experimenting with other tagging strategies (e.g. SNAP and Halo tags) so organic fluorophores can be used to allow for acquisition of longer trajectories.</p></body></sub-article></article>
