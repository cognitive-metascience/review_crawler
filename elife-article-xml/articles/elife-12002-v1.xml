However, the molecular mechanisms by which mTOR regulates nociception remain unclear. Here we show that deletion of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), a major mTOR downstream effector, which represses eIF4E activity and cap-dependent translation, leads to mechanical, but not thermal pain hypersensitivity. Mice lacking 4E-BP1 exhibit enhanced spinal cord expression of neuroligin 1, a cell-adhesion postsynaptic protein regulating excitatory synapse function, and show increased excitatory synaptic input into spinal neurons, and a lowered threshold for induction of synaptic potentiation. Pharmacological inhibition of eIF4E or genetic reduction of neuroligin 1 levels normalizes the increased excitatory synaptic activity and reverses mechanical hypersensitivity. Thus, translational control by 4E-BP1 downstream of mTOR effects the expression of neuroligin 1 and excitatory synaptic transmission in the spinal cord, and thereby contributes to enhanced mechanical nociception.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12002.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12002.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12002.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Despite the unpleasant feeling it causes, pain is necessary for survival as it helps individuals to avoid objects, environments and situations that cause damage to their body. However, millions of people experience long-lasting “chronic” pain, or are hypersensitive to pain. There are few treatments available for these conditions, but these treatments do not work well for the majority of patients, and can have serious side effects. To develop new treatments, researchers must first better understand how chronic pain develops.</p><p>Pain is transmitted to the brain in the form of electrical signals “fired” along nerve fibers. Different nerves transmit information about different types of pain: for example, pain caused by a sharp object pressed against the skin activates a different set of neurons to those activated when touching something dangerously hot. Studies in mice have suggested that a protein called mTOR that is found inside neurons is important for them to fire pain signals. However, it is not clear exactly how mTOR contributes to pain signaling, although it is known to affect the activities of several other proteins in neurons.</p><p>One protein that mTOR affects the activity of is called 4E-BP1. Now, Khoutorsky, Bonin, Sorge et al. show that mice that lack 4E-BP1 behave in ways that suggest they are hypersensitive to poking or pinching sensations. However, the mice did not show hypersensitivity when they touched a hot surface. Further investigation revealed that the neurons in the spinal cord of mice that lack 4E-BP1 produce abnormally high amounts of a molecule called neuroligin 1, which makes the neurons more likely to fire and thus signal pain.</p><p>Khoutorsky, Bonin, Sorge et al. found that treating mice that lack 4E-BP1 with a compound that reduces neuroligin 1 production causes their neurons to fire more normally. This also reduces the animals’ apparent signs of hypersensitivity to pressure on their skin. It will be important in future studies to identify additional targets of 4E-BP1 in the spinal cord that could contribute to increased mechanical sensation, and also to study the role of 4E-BP1 in peripheral nerves.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12002.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12002.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>mRNA translation</kwd><kwd>eIF4F complex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Operating grant to N.

Regulation of gene expression at the level of translation enables the cell to rapidly change its proteome by modulating the rate of mRNA translation without altering mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</xref>). Upregulation of mRNA translation via activation of the mechanical/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) by noxious stimuli has been proposed to sensitize primary nociceptors and spinal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bogen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferrari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jimenez-Diaz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Melemedjian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Obara and Hunt, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Price and Geranton, 2009</xref>). mTOR is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase that controls cell homeostasis through key molecular processes including translation, lipid biogenesis, autophagy, and cytoskeleton organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shimobayashi and Hall, 2014</xref>). mTOR is the catalytic subunit of two structurally and functionally distinct multiprotein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lipton and Sahin, 2014</xref>). mTORC1 is defined by the protein raptor and is sensitive to rapamycin, while mTORC2 is defined by the protein rictor and is rapamycin insensitive. mTORC1 is a key regulator of translation, whereas mTORC2 controls the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jacinto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sarbassov et al., 2004</xref>). The mTORC1 pathway is activated in primary nociceptors and superficial dorsal horn neurons in rodent models of inflammatory pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Norsted Gregory et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xu et al., 2011</xref>), bone cancer-induced pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shih et al., 2012</xref>), neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), and in response to repeated morphine administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). The functional role of mTORC1 activation has been studied using the mTORC1 specific inhibitor, rapamycin, and its derivatives (rapalogues). Systemic or intrathecal (i.t.) administration of rapalogues does not affect acute responses to mechanical and thermal stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geranton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2014</xref>), but it reduces nocifensive behaviors, and normalizes mechanical hypersensitivity in rodent models of inflammatory pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asante et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Price and Geranton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Price et al., 2007</xref>), bone cancer-induced pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shih et al., 2012</xref>), and neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asante et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cui et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that noxious stimuli-induced activation of mTORC1 plays an important role in the development of pain hypersensitivity. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating the effect of mTORC1 on nociception are not known.</p><p>All nuclear transcribed eukaryotic mRNAs harbor, at their 5’ end, the structure m7GpppN (where N is any nucleotide) termed ‘cap’, which facilitates ribosome recruitment to the mRNA. Recruitment of the ribosome to the mRNA is primarily regulated at the initiation step. A critical step of this process is the assembly of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex, which consists of eIF4E, the cap binding protein subunit, eIF4G, a large scaffold protein, and eIF4A, an RNA helicase that unwinds the mRNA 5’ UTR (untranslated region) secondary structure. Because eIF4E generally exhibits the lowest expression level of all eukaryotic initiation factors, the cap-recognition step is rate-limiting for translation and a major target for regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</xref>). mTORC1 is a key regulator of translation initiation via phosphorylation of its downstream targets, eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) and p70S6 kinases (S6Ks). In their hypo-phosphorylated form, 4E-BPs compete with eIF4G for binding to eIF4E to repress eIF4F complex assembly, and thereby translation initiation. Following phosphorylation by mTORC1, 4E-BPs dissociate from eIF4E, allowing for eIF4F complex formation and activation of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gingras et al., 1996</xref>). Three 4E-BP isoforms (1, 2, and 3) have similar functions, differing in their tissue distribution. 4E-BP3 expression is limited to few tissues, and is excluded from the nervous system. In the forebrain, 4E-BP2 is the major isoform, and 4E-BP2 knockout mice exhibit enhanced excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gkogkas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ran et al., 2013</xref>), alterations in synaptic plasticity, memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banko et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banko et al., 2005</xref>), and social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gkogkas et al., 2013</xref>). In the suprachiasmatic nucleus, 4E-BP1 controls circadian clock functions via regulation of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (<italic>Vip</italic>) mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2013</xref>). In the pain pathway, 4E-BP1 is expressed in neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and in peripheral nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jimenez-Diaz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Melemedjian et al., 2011</xref>), whereas in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) it was detected only in satellite glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Decreasing S6Ks activity by either pharmacological inhibitors or S6K1/2 null mutation unexpectedly led to mechanical allodynia via activation of ERK, a well-known pain sensitizing molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Melemedjian et al., 2013</xref>). Activation of ERK is caused by disinhibition of the S6K1/IRS-1/ERK negative feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carracedo et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we investigated the role of the other major mTORC1 downstream effectors, 4E-BPs, in nociception using <italic>Eif4ebp1 and 2</italic> knockout (<italic>Eif4epb</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) mice. Removal of 4E-BP1 and 2 relieves eIF4E suppression and provides an opportunity to study cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of mTORC1, via 4E-BPs, on nociception. Previous work showed that intraplantar administration of two well-known sensitizers of nociceptors, IL-6 and NGF, upregulates eIF4F complex formation and cap-dependent translation in primary afferent neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Melemedjian et al., 2010</xref>). Peripheral inhibition of eIF4F with a specific inhibitor, 4EGI-1, completely blocked IL-6- and NGF-induced mechanical allodynia, supporting the idea that enhanced eIF4F complex formation and cap-dependent translation contribute to sensitization of primary afferents. However, the roles of eIF4F and 4E-BPs in the regulation of spinal circuits are unknown. Here we show that <italic>Eif4ebp1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, but not <italic>Eif4ebp2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibit mechanical (but not thermal) hypersensitivity, which can be rescued by intrathecal administration of 4EGI-1. Mechanical hypersensitivity is also elicited by downregulation of 4E-BP1 in the spinal cord dorsal horn. In <italic>Eif4ebp1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, the excitatory synaptic input into spinal neurons is enhanced and the threshold for potentiation of electrically-evoked field post-synaptic potentials (fPSPs) in the superficial dorsal horn is lowered. The enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission is mediated via increased synthesis of neuroligin 1, which promotes the excitatory synapse function. Reduction of neuroligin 1 levels in <italic>Eif4ebp1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice normalizes excitatory synaptic transmission, and partially reverses mechanical allodynia.

IL-6 and NGF-mediated enhancement of eIF4F complex formation play an important role in mediating mechanical nociceptive plasticity in primary afferent neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Melemedjian et al., 2010</xref>). However, the roles of eIF4F and 4E-BPs in regulation of spinal circuits remain unknown. Here, we show that de-repression of translation by removal of 4E-BP1 leads to enhanced eIF4F complex formation in the spinal cord, and to mechanical hypersensitivity and increased response to noxious chemical/inflammatory stimuli. This effect was observed in both <italic>Eif4ebp1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice and in mice with selective downregulation of 4E-BP1 in the spinal cord dorsal horn. Normalization of eIF4F complex levels in <italic>Eif4ebp1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice by intrathecal administration of 4EGI-1 reversed the exaggerated mechanical sensation, thus demonstrating that the enhanced eIF4F complex is the underlying cause for mechanical hypersensitivity in <italic>Eif4ebp1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice.</p><p>eIF4F controls translation of a specific subset of mRNAs. Consistent with this and with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gkogkas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tahmasebi et al., 2014</xref>), we found that general translation is not altered in <italic>Eif4ebp1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating that upregulated translation of certain mRNAs contributes to the nociceptive phenotypes of these mice. Previous studies have documented that mRNAs in the family of neuroligin proteins are being translationally activated by eIF4F in the nervous system, such as in mice overexpressing eIF4E or lacking 4E-BP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gkogkas et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore reasoned that the enhanced mechanical nociception in <italic>Eif4ebp1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice could be mediated via enhanced translation of <italic>Nlgn</italic> mRNAs. Indeed, we found that the expression of neuroligins was increased in the spinal cord of <italic>Eif4ebp1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice without concomitant changes in mRNA levels, indicating enhanced translation. The role of neuroligins in the spinal cord is not well studied. A recent study showed that knock-down of neuroligin 2, which promotes inhibitory synaptic transmission, in the spinal cord of naïve rats increases mechanical sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dolique et al., 2013</xref>). The role of neuroligin 1, which promotes excitatory synaptic transmission, in pain processing has not been investigated. Consistent with the higher levels of neuroligin 1, 2 and 3 in mice lacking 4E-BP1, we found that excitatory and inhibitory spinal synaptic transmission are increased in these animals. Chronic pain is associated with an increase in the excitatory synaptic drive to dorsal horn neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sandkuhler, 2009</xref>). Therefore, in the current study we focused on neuroligin 1 and its role in promoting excitatory synaptic transmission in <italic>Eif4ebp1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice.</p><p>Interestingly, the enhancement of mEPSC amplitude and neuroligin 1 spinal expression in <italic>Eif4ebp1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice was rescued by intrathecal 4EGI-1. In agreement with these results, we also found that mechanical sensation is reduced in <italic>Nlgn1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, indicating that neuroligin 1 has a pronociceptive function. Strikingly, normalization of neuroligin 1 levels rescued the increased mEPSC amplitudes in <italic>Eif4ebp1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, and partially reversed the mechanical hypersensitivity in these mice. These data strongly indicate that augmented spinal expression of neuroligin 1 in <italic>Eif4ebp1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice contributes to mechanical hypersensitivity via neuroligin 1-induced upregulation of excitatory synaptic transmission in the spinal cord. The finding that normalization of neuroligin 1 levels only partially reverses mechanical hypersensitivity in <italic>Eif4ebp1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice indicates that additional mechanisms, peripheral or central, downstream of 4E-BP1/eIF4e contribute to the pain phenotype.</p><p>We observed that the increased inhibition in <italic>Eif4ebp1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice is solely mediated via enhanced glycinergic, but not GABAergic synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Similarly to GABA<sub>A</sub>, glycine receptors mediate fast synaptic inhibition in the spinal cord, where they regulate nociceptive and tactile sensory processing. Little is known about how synaptic strength of glycinergic synapses is regulated in vivo. Surprisingly, we found that the inhibitory synaptic transmission was not affected by intrathecal administration of 4EGI-1, possibly because of reduced sensitivity to 4EGI-1 or because inhibitory synaptic transmission is regulated by 4EGI-1 insensitive processes downstream of 4E-BP1. The differential regulation of glycinergic synaptic transmission by mTOR/4E-BP1 pathway in the spinal cord is intriguing, and further studies will be necessary to better understand the precise molecular mechanism of this regulation. However, the increased inhibition in <italic>Eif4ebp1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice was not reversed by normalization of neuroligin 1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), and is thus unlikely to play major role in the reduced nociceptive thresholds of <italic>Eif4ebp1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, which were reversed by normalization of neuroligin 1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,G</xref>).</p><p>The threshold for enhancement of electrically-evoked field potentials is lowered in <italic>Eif4ebp1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. This finding is consistent with studies in the hippocampus showing that 4E-BP2 ablation engenders the conversion of early-phase long-term potentiation (LTP) into late-phase LTP in the Schaffer collateral pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banko et al., 2005</xref>). Lowered threshold for LTP induction is thought to be a mechanism contributing to increased responsiveness of spinal circuits under conditions of pathological pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ji et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sandkuhler, 2009</xref>). An mTORC1-mediated increase in eIF4F complex formation, which leads to the enhancement of synaptic transmission and lowering of the threshold for the induction of synaptic potentiation, is likely to contribute to abnormal pain processing in models of chronic pain. Though our study demonstrates an important role of enhanced expression of neuroligin 1 in the nociceptive phenotype of <italic>Eif4ebp1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, it is conceivable that translational upregulation of other mRNAs contributes to the regulation of nociception downstream of mTORC1 and ribosome-profiling studies are required to identify these transcripts.</p><p>Our data demonstrate that the mTOR/4E-BP/eIF4E pathway controls mechanical, but not thermal sensitivity. A recent study showed that somatostatin-positive cells, which are enriched in lamina II of the dorsal horn where they comprise 53% of all glutamatergic excitatory neurons, are required for sensation of mechanical but not thermal pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duan et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, we found that lamina II neurons receive stronger excitatory input in <italic>Eif4ebp1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), raising the intriguing possibility that the effect of 4E-BP1 depletion on mechanical, but not thermal sensation, could be mediated via increased excitatory drive to somatostatin-positive neurons. Conditional deletion of 4E-BP1 in somatostatin positive cells will be required to address this idea.</p><p>mTORC1 controls protein synthesis as well as lipid and ribosome biogenesis, autophagy and mitochondria function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costa-Mattioli and Monteggia, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shimobayashi and Hall, 2014</xref>). Studies with rapalogues have shown that mTORC1 is strongly implicated in the development of hypersensitivity states in a variety of pain models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Obara and Hunt, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Price and Geranton, 2009</xref>). However, whether the effects of mTORC1 on nociception are mediated via translation control mechanisms or via protein synthesis-independent functions of mTORC1 have remained largely unknown. Our study clearly shows that translational regulators (4E-BP1 and eIF4F), acting downstream of mTOR, control nociception via their effect on mechanical sensation and synaptic responses.</p><p>In summary, our results shed important light on the mechanisms by which activation of the mTOR/4E-BP/eIF4E pathway enhances mechanical pain sensation. We show that 4E-BP1 is a major functional isoform in the pain pathway, where it represses translation of neuroligins in the spinal cord. Removal of 4E-BP1 increases neuroligin 1 expression, which in turn promotes excitatory synaptic transmission in the spinal cord and leads to mechanical hypersensitivity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p><italic>Eif4ebp1, Eif4ebp2 and Eif4ebp1/2</italic> null mutant mice were backcrossed for more than 10 generations into a C57BL/6J background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Le Bacquer et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Nlgn1</italic> knockout mice were kindly provided by Craig M.

The mice were allowed to recover for 1 week before the experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>m7GDP pull-down</title><p>Lumbar spinal cord was homogenized in lysis buffer containing 40 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM GDP, 10 mM pyrophosphate, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate,</p><p>and 50 mM NaF.

Mice lacking 4E-BP1 show increased excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input into spinal neurons, and a lowered threshold for induction of synaptic potentiation. They also show enhanced translation of neuroligin 1, a cell-adhesion postsynaptic protein. Pharmacological inhibition of eIF4E activity or genetic reduction of neuroligin 1 levels normalizes the increased excitatory synaptic input and reverses mechanical hypersensitivity. They show that translational control by 4E-BP1 downstream of mTOR regulates the expression of neuroligin 1 and excitatory synaptic transmission in the spinal cord and contributes to enhanced mechanical nociception. The manuscript is well written and the results are presented clearly.</p><p>1) Throughout the manuscript the authors use viral infection to raise or lower various levels of protein translation in the dorsal horn but it is generally acknowledged (see for example Simonetti, M. M. et al., 2013, Neuron, 77(1), 43-57) that virus will not enter the dorsal horn when injected intrathecally and must be injected directly into the spinal cord. In fact Levine (see Bogen, O. O. et al., 2012, The Journal of Neuroscience 32(6), 2018-2026 and others) have often used this route to infect DRGs. This is important because it is unclear from the manuscript if most of their manipulations are actually on the dorsal root or DRG particularly that local translation seems to have been demonstrated in primary afferent fibers (Price, T. J. et al., 2007, Journal of Neuroscience, 27(51), 13958-13967) and particularly in A-nociceptors (Jiménez-Díaz, L. et al., 2008, PLoS ONE, 3(4), e1961. As I understand it, the reduced function of A-nociceptors is in fact the explanation Geranton, S. M. et al. (2009, Journal of Neuroscience, 29(47), 15017-15027)) offer for the reduction of mechanical sensitivity following i.t. rapamycin. Could this explain many of the results here? 4EBP has been shown to be present in peripheral nerves (Melemedjian, O. K. et al., 2011, Molecular Pain, 7(1), 70. doi:10.1186/1744-8069-7-70; Jiménez-Díaz, L. et al., 2008, PLoS ONE, 3(4), e1961) even though a single report did not show a great deal of protein in DRG neurons. Also rapamycin was shown by various groups only to reduce mechanical hypersensitivity (but see Norsted Gregory, E. et al., 2010, Neuroscience, 169(3), 1392-1402). The authors need additional immunohistochemical and/or functional experiments to determine where the virus is functioning.</p><p>2) The mouse is a global knockout and it is therefore desirable to know whether there is any reorganization within the dorsal horn. For example, C-fiber termination, lamina markers and descending pathways such as 5HT and also glial markers should be mapped. If formalin was being tested then c-fos activation or pERK activation should also have been compared between genotypes would be a welcome addition.</p><p>3) The ephysiology suggests there is an increase in excitability and inhibition within the dorsal horn. The authors should examine the contributions of both A and C fibers by differential stimulation and conduction velocity measurements (see Torsney, C., and MacDermott, A. B., 2006, Journal of Neuroscience, 26(6), 1833-1843) and on identified neurons either in lamina I or II. This would indicate whether the mechanical sensitivity is driven by both C and/ or Ad fibers.</p><p>4) The authors show that the eIF4E inhibitor 4EGI-1 can reverse the mechanical pain hypersensitivity, but they did not determine whether it normalized the increase in mEPSC amplitude in the 4E-BP1 knockout mice. The authors should determine whether 4EGI-1 can normalize the mEPSC amplitude in the 4E-BP1 knockout mice. Similarly, the authors should determine whether 4EGI-1 normalizes the increase in the levels of the neuroligins. Related to this, the authors suggest that increased neuroligin2 levels in the 4E-BP1 are likely responsible for the increase in mIPSC amplitude and frequency. Although I don't think it is necessary to directly determine whether this is the case (although it would strengthen the model), the authors should determine whether 4EGI-1 normalizes the increase in mIPSC amplitude and frequency in the 4E-BP1 knockout mice.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>Khoutorsky et al show that deletion of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), an mTOR effector leads to mechanical, but not thermal pain hypersensitivity.

We agree that intraparenchymal spinal cord dorsal horn injection is a better approach to selectively reduce the expression levels of 4E-BP1 in the spinal cord, and therefore we followed the reviewer’s advice and injected viral particles intraparenchymally into the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E-G</xref>). To improve the efficiency of 4E-BP1 knockdown the injections were performed at six locations along the lumbar segment of the spinal cord (see experimental procedures). We showed that the virus-driven eGFP expression is restricted to the dorsal horn and exhibits mostly neuronal distribution as it co-localizes with a neuronal marker NeuN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>). We demonstrated that the levels of 4E-BP1 were reduced in the superficial spinal cord but not in DRGs. Using this approach we substantiate our findings obtained in <italic>Eif4ebp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice to show that downregulation of 4E-BP1 specifically in the spinal cord induces mechanical hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>The reviewer commented that “<italic>the reduced function of A-nociceptors is in fact the explanation Geranton, S. M. et al. (2009, Journal of Neuroscience, 29(47), 15017-15027)) offer for the reduction of mechanical sensitivity following i.t. rapamycin</italic>.” And “<italic>Also rapamycin was shown by various groups only to reduce mechanical hypersensitivity (but see Norsted Gregory, E. et al., 2010, Neuroscience, 169(3), 1392-1402)</italic>.”</p><p>A direct comparison between the effects of rapamycin and modulation of eIF4F activity (by 4EGI-1 or 4E-BP1 downregulation) is not warranted because of the following reasons:</p><p>1) mTORC1 has two main downstream effectors, S6Ks and 4E-BPs. Rapamycin inhibits mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of S6Ks more dramatically than that of 4E-BPs (Choo and Blenis, 2009). Therefore the effects of rapamycin on cellular functions are mediated to a greater extent via inhibition of S6Ks as compared to 4E-BPs. By selective targeting of 4E-BP1, our study provides unique insights into the mechanisms by which mTOR regulates nociception via 4E-BPs.</p><p>2) mTORC1 controls protein synthesis as well as lipid and ribosome biogenesis, autophagy and mitochondria function (Costa-Mattioli and Monteggia, 2013; Shimobayashi and Hall, 2014). These translation independent functions of mTORC1 have been recently implicated in many physiological and pathological processes in neurons (Malik et al., 2013; Tang et al., 2014). Because rapamycin affects both mRNA translation and other processes downstream of mTORC1, it is difficult to conclude whether the effects of rapamycin on nociception are mediated via mRNA translation or other mechanisms. Thus, it is imperative to investigate specific roles of 4E-BPs and eIF4F complex in modulation of mechanical hypersensitivity. A previous study showed that intraplantar injection of IL-6 and NGF upregulates eIF4F complex formation and cap-dependent translation in primary afferent neurons, and induces mechanical allodynia, which is completely blocked by co-injection of 4EGI-1 (Melemedjian et al., 2010). These results demonstrate that eIF4F complex formation is critical for IL-6 and NGF-mediated sensitization of sensory neurons. However, the roles of eIF4F and its main regulator 4E-BP1 in sensitization of spinal circuits remained unknown.</p><p>Reviewer 1 writes “<italic>As I understand it, the reduced function of A-nociceptors is in fact the explanation Geranton, S. M. et al. (2009, Journal of Neuroscience, 29(47), 15017-15027)) offer for the reduction of mechanical sensitivity following i.t. rapamycin</italic>.”</p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important issue and we apologize that we were not clear in the first submission. The paper from Stephen Hunt’s group demonstrates that rapamycin increases the thermal and electrical threshold of activation of A-fibers. However, it also shows that “The number of P-S6 protein expressing cells increases in the superficial dorsal horn after capsaicin administration, especially in lamina I, and rapamycin can attenuate this effect”, concluding that “intrathecal rapamycin has effects at both sites, resulting in a profound reduction in neuropathic pain sensitivity.”</p><p>We do not exclude the possibility that primary sensory neurons contribute to the pain phenotypes of <italic>Eif4ebp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, however in the current study we specifically focus on spinal mechanisms by which 4E-BP1 enhances mechanical sensation. In our work we selectively downregulate 4E-BP1 in the spinal cord dorsal horn and manipulate the expression level of neuroligin 1, which controls synaptic transmission. To assess synaptic functions we measure mEPSC/mIPSC amplitude and frequency, and activity-dependent synaptic potentiation. We find that while normalization of neuroligin 1 levels in <italic>Eif4ebp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice corrects increased excitatory synaptic inputs to spinal neurons, it only partially reverses the enhanced mechanical sensation. These results are consistent with the existence of other 4E-BP1-dependent mechanisms. In the revised version we explain better that the current study characterizes the mechanisms by which 4E-BP1 regulates nociception in the spinal cord (paragraph three, subsection “4E-BP1 ablation induces mechanical hypersensitivity” and Discussion). Additionally, we extend the description of the literature on the role of mTOR and eIF4E in sensitization of primary sensory neurons (paragraph three, Introduction and Discussion). <italic>2) The mouse is a global knockout and it is therefore desirable to know whether there is any reorganization within the dorsal horn.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for this important comment. We have now included in the revised version a characterization of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord of <italic>Eif4ebp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice using neuronal marker NeuN, peptidergic and non-peptidergic C fiber markers (SP and CGRP for peptidergic, and IB4 for non-peptidergic), glial marker (GFAP) and 5-HT receptor immunostaining (HTR3A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>). We found no gross macroscopic alterations in the organization of the dorsal horn of <italic>Eif4ebp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice.</p><p><italic>If formalin was being tested then c-fos activation or pERK activation should also have been compared between genotypes would be a welcome addition.</italic> </p><p>We now show that intraplantar formalin injection induces greater c-Fos expression (at the 2-hour time point) in the dorsal horn of <italic>Eif4ebp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> as compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) The ephysiology suggests there is an increase in excitability and inhibition within the dorsal horn. The authors should examine the contributions of both A and C fibers by differential stimulation and conduction velocity measurements (see Torsney, C., and MacDermott, A. B., 2006, Journal of Neuroscience, 26(6), 1833-1843) and on identified neurons either in lamina I or II.</italic> </p><p>We think that the increased synaptic transmission in lamina II neurons of <italic>Eif4ebp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> is a result of enhanced excitability of spinal circuits and not of primary afferents. This is supported by the fact that spontaneous synaptic transmission, which is independent of presynaptic neuron evoked activity, is enhanced in <italic>Eif4ebp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and can be rescued by neuroligin 1 downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Moreover, the enhanced inhibition must necessarily also arise from intraspinal circuits since sensory afferents are not inhibitory. While we feel that investigating whether the mechanical sensitivity of <italic>Eif4ebp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice is driven by C and/ or Aδ fibers should be addressed in future studies, we made significant efforts to measure the contribution of C and A fibers, as suggested by the reviewer. It is noteworthy that the Torsney and MacDermott paper, which the reviewer refers to, uses different approaches than used here. They used a rat preparation, which allows for the preservation of much longer sensory afferents for enhanced temporal separation between A- and C-fiber input than is generally possible with mice, resulting in reduced response noise. The Torsney and MacDermott study is also restricted to NK1+ neurons, which is a much more homogeneous neuron population than that studied here, and which is largely absent from lamina II, where we focused our efforts. A detailed study of all defined cell populations in the dorsal horn is a long term commitment. We performed a lengthy investigation of afferent-evoked responses in lamina II neurons to permit extrapolation from our reported electrophysiological results. We consistently observed an overly large degree of variability in these data that did not permit conclusive interpretation. Although this is not entirely unexpected given the heterogeneity between lamina II neurons and their likely synaptic input, we feel that the inherent difficulties of this approach further support our focus on spinal mechanisms of 4E-BP1 inhibition: the contrast of the heterogeneity of evoked responses in lamina II neurons with the consistent effect of 4E-BP1 modulation on miniature synaptic activity in lamina II neurons reinforces our position (which is supported by numerous, consistent lines of evidence in this manuscript) that changes in pain behaviour produced by 4E-BP1 inhibition are likely related to an increase in excitability of spinal cord sensory processing pathways.<italic>4) The authors should determine whether 4EGI-1 normalizes the increase in mIPSC amplitude and frequency in the 4E-BP1 knockout mice.</italic> </p><p>In the revised submission we included a series of experiments directly addressing this request.</p><p>We show that the regimen of 4EGI-1 administration (10 μg, i.t. daily for 3 days) that we used to rescue the mechanical hypersensitivity of <italic>Eif4ebp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice normalizes the increased mEPSC amplitude in lamina II <italic>Eif4ebp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D-E</xref>). 4EGI-1 treatment also normalizes the enhanced expression of neuroligin 1 in the spinal cord. However, unexpectedly, we find that the enhanced inhibitory synaptic transmission in <italic>Eif4ebp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neurons is not rescued by 4EGI-1. In the Discussion section we propose several explanations for the lack of effect of 4EGI-1 on inhibitory synaptic transmission.</p><p>Reviewer #1:<italic>[…] I am not clear why inflammation or capsaicin induced thermal and mechanical sensitivity were not tested, or indeed a neuropathic or surgical pain model.</italic> </p><p>We have tested both chronic inflammation-induced pain (in CFA model), and neuropathic pain (in CCI model) in <italic>Eif4ebp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 2</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12002.012</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12002.012">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12002.012</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-12002-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>Our data show no differences in thermal hyperalgesia in CFA model.
