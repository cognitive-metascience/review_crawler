CHCs also have other roles in insect behavior. For example, these molecules act as chemical cues when insects search for mates (i.e. pheromones), and they can even contribute to camouflage.</p><p>Insects are amongst the most diverse groups of animals on Earth, and different species have different blends of CHC molecules in their epicuticles. Fruit flies are a useful model to understand the genetics of CHC production, including CHCs that act as sex pheromones. Previous research has analyzed the CHCs made by both sexes in several fruit fly strains. However this work was unable to uncover which genes influence how much of a given CHC an individual fly will make.</p><p>Dembeck et al. have now looked into CHC production in a collection of 205 different fly strains, all of which have already had their total genetic material sequenced and studied. Comparing these known sequences and looking for associations between genetic differences and particular CHCs uncovered 24 genes that may be involved in CHC manufacture. Only six of the genes had been identified previously. Dembeck et al. found that interfering with the activity of any of the 24 genes had a knock-on effect on many other CHCs present in the flies’ epicuticle.</p><p>These 24 genes could to be pieced together in a network that is needed to make and recycle CHCs. The complexity and flexibility of this network can explain in part how insects have been able to build epicuticles for almost every environment. These data set the stage for future work directed towards understanding the evolutionary significance of variation in CHC composition in many fruit fly populations.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09861.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09861.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>genome wide associaiton study</kwd><kwd>Drosophila genetic reference Panel</kwd><kwd>cuticular lipids</kwd><kwd>African Drosophila</kwd><kwd>multivariate analysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM59469</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anholt</surname><given-names>Robert R H</given-names></name><name><surname>Mackay</surname><given-names>Trudy F C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Blanton J Whitmore Endowment</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schal</surname><given-names>Coby</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM45146</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anholt</surname><given-names>Robert R H</given-names></name><name><surname>Mackay</surname><given-names>Trudy F C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genome wide association analyses in a wild-derived <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> population uncover extensive variation in cuticular hydrocarbon composition, which may present a target for natural selection and adaptive evolution.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Insects comprise the most species-rich class in the animal kingdom. They evolved about 480 million years ago and their fecundity and rapid evolutionary adaptations have made them successful in populating almost every ecological niche on our planet. The evolution of mechanisms for desiccation resistance was critical for insects to colonize dry land. To prevent desiccation insects evolved the ability to produce and accumulate species-specific blends of fatty acid-derived apolar lipids on the epicuticle; the most prominent of these are cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jallon et al., 1997</xref>). CHCs are produced continuously by specialized cells called oenocytes, and are transported through the hemolymph and then to the cuticular surface through specialized pore canals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Romer, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schal et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blomquist and Bagnères, 2010</xref>). The primary role of CHCs is desiccation resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gibbs, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2002</xref>), but they have been co-opted to serve as chemical signals and cues mediating intra- and inter-specific social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Venard and Jallon, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jallon, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ferveur, 2005</xref>). These interactions include species and nest-mate recognition, assessment of reproductive status, and mate choice, and CHCs play a prominent role in camouflage and mimicry that mediate inter-specific parasitic relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stanley-Samuelson and Nelson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blomquist and Bagnères, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Adaptive evolution acts through selection on phenotypic variation within a population. Thus, understanding the genetic basis for individual variation in CHC composition will shed light on evolutionary mechanisms of assortative mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Noor et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ishii et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rundle et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gleason et al., 2005</xref>) and evolution of social organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Howard and Blomquist, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Richard <italic>and Hunt, 2013</italic></xref>).</p><p>The extensive genetic resources available for <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> make it a valuable model for studying the genetic basis of CHC production and natural variation in CHC composition. Mature <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> have sexually dimorphic CHCs ranging from chain lengths of 21 to 31 carbons (C21–C31) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antony and Jallon, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jallon and David, 1987</xref>). Males produce predominantly shorter-chain CHCs (&lt; C26) and they use two of the CHCs, 7-C23:1 and 7-C25:1, as sex pheromones. Females produce predominantly longer-chain dienes, among which 7,11-C27:2 and 7,11-C29:2 act as the primary female sex pheromone components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antony and Jallon, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cobb and Jallon, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arienti et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>CHCs are produced from the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway, which begins with an acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) then catalyzes the synthesis of malonyl-CoA, and the multifunctional protein fatty acid synthase (FASN) successively incorporates malonyl-CoA units onto the acetyl-CoA, elongating the chain by two carbons each time and forming long chain fatty acids (LCFA). RNAi-knockdown of <italic>ACC</italic> in the oenocytes completely eliminates CHCs in both male and female <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wicker-Thomas et al., 2015</xref>). Products of insect FASN, including <italic>Drosophila</italic> FASN, can be 14, 16 or 18 carbon fatty acids. A thioesterase that is part of the multienzyme FASN removes the elongated chain as a free fatty acid, and fatty acid elongation and desaturation use the CoA derivative and take place in the microsomal fraction (endoplasmic reticulum). Members of a family of tissue-specific elongases (ELOVL) catalyze the incorporation of malonyl-CoA units to form very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA). After condensation of the malonyl-CoA with the fatty acyl-CoA the next three steps in each elongation cycle include reduction of a carbonyl to an alcohol (by a 3-keto-acyl-CoA-reductase; KAR), dehydration (by a 3-hydroxy-acyl-CoA-dehydratase; HADC), and reduction of the carbon-carbon double bond by a trans-enoyl-CoA-reductase (TER). The VLCA as the CoA derivative is readuced to an aldehyde by a fatty acyl-CoA reductase (FAR). The one-carbon chain-shortening conversion of aldehydes to hydrocarbons is catalyzed by a cytochrome P450 enzyme, Cyp4G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qiu et al., 2012</xref>). Desaturation reactions to introduce double bonds, leading to unsaturated fatty acids, appear to occur on the 16 or 18 carbon fatty acyl-CoAs.</p><p>A comprehensive analysis of CHCs in both sexes segregating in a panel of recombinant inbred lines derived from a natural population identified 25 quantitative trait loci (QTL) in females and 15 in males contributing to variation in CHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Foley et al., 2007</xref>), but this study did not have the power to resolve QTLs to individual genes. QTL mapping analyses have also identified genomic regions called <italic>small monoene quantities (smoq</italic>) and <italic>seven pentacosene (sept</italic>), respectively, associated with variation in the proportions of 7-C23:1 and 7-C25:1 in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ferveur and Jallon, 1996</xref>). In a mutagenesis study, another genomic region, <italic>nerd,</italic> drastically reduced 7-C23:1 production in males and altered courtship behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferveur and Jallon, 1993</xref>). However, none of these male loci have been resolved to specific genes. Several additional genes affecting CHC biosynthesis have been described in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>: an acetyl-CoA carboxylase (<italic>ACC</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wicker-Thomas et al., 2015</xref>); two fatty acid synthases, <italic>FASN2 (CG3524</italic>) which is involved in the synthesis of precursors of 2-methylalkanes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung et al. 2014</xref>), and <italic>FASN1 (CG3523</italic>) which is expressed in the fat body but nonetheless contributes to the CHC pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wicker-Thomas et al., 2015</xref>); an elongase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59"><italic>EloF</italic>, Wicker-Thomas et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chertemps et al., 2007</xref>); <italic>KAR</italic> (<italic>CG1444</italic>), <italic>TER</italic> (<italic>CG10849</italic>) and <italic>HADC</italic> (<italic>CG6746</italic>) whose knockdown eliminates or reduces CHC synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wicker-Thomas et al., 2015</xref>); a cytochrome P450 (<italic>Cyp4G1</italic> [<italic>CG3972</italic>], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qiu et al., 2012</xref>); and three desaturases, <italic>Desat1, Desat2</italic> and <italic>DesatF</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Labeur et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marcillac et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chertemps et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fang et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Here, we used the sequenced, inbred lines of the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mackay et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huang et al., 2014</xref>) to perform genome wide association (GWA) analyses for nearly all detectable CHCs in both sexes in a scenario where all common genetic variants are genotyped and local linkage disequilibrium (LD) is sufficiently low to identify candidate genes and causal polymorphisms. We found considerable heritable genetic variation in a majority of male and female CHCs, distilled the axes of genetic variation into several principal components (PCs), and performed GWA analyses on each PC. We identified 24 candidate genes plausibly associated with CHC biosynthesis and for all of them disruption of their expression altered CHC profiles in males, females, or both sexes. Surprisingly, we also found that the DGRP lines are segregating for the ancestral and deletion alleles in <italic>Desat2,</italic> previously associated with CHC profiles thought to be unique for African flies. Finally, our results provide a new perspective and highlight the complexity of the biosynthetic and catabolic pathways that regulate the dynamics of CHC composition and provide the stage for adaptive evolution. In agreement with other recent studies of complex traits, our results demonstrate that the genetic architecture underlying potentially adaptive traits can consist of many, even hundreds, of polymorphic loci with small effects affecting different aspects of the phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CHCs in the DGRP</title><p>In this article, linear alkanes are referred to by the abbreviation <italic>n</italic>-Cx, where ‘‘x’’ is the total carbon number.

While it is possible that the elongated fatty acyl-CoA is reduced from acyl-CoA to aldehyde to alcohol and then reoxidized to aldehyde before oxidative decarbonylation, to date there is no evidence for this. <italic>CG13091</italic> and <italic>CG10097</italic> encode fatty acyl-CoA reductases, which are both expressed at high levels in males and at low levels in females. FARs reduce fatty acyl-CoA to an alcohol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Howard and Blomquist 2005</xref>). Inhibition of the production of these FARs promoted the production of longer chain CHCs. Males in which <italic>CG13091</italic> expression was targeted with RNAi had higher relative amounts of longer-chain CHCs in general and reduced shorter-chain monoenes and methyl-branched CHCs. In particular, 7-C25:1 and 7-C27:1 and 2-MeC26, and 2-MeC28 increased substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). The increase in 7-C25:1 is of particular interest, as this compound acts as a male sex pheromone that mediates female mate choice. Females showed a similar trend but to a lesser extent; they also had some increased longer-chain dienes and, like the males, increased 7-C27:1, 7,11-C27:2 &amp; 2-MeC26, and 2-Me-C28 &amp; 7,11-C29:2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>).

The increase in CHCs in males with compromised <italic>Cyp49a1</italic> function was accompanied by a decrease in many female CHCs. Reduced expression of <italic>Cyp4s3</italic> resulted in increased CHC abundance in both sexes. The link between these CYPs and CHC production and maintenance is unclear. However, we speculate that oxidation reactions mediated by these CYPs may regulate CHC degradation and turnover. The specific functions of most insect CYPs are still unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2009</xref>). Given the role of CYP4G1 in CHC production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qiu et al., 2012</xref>), we believe it is possible for these CYPs to have similar functions that are perhaps specific to particular subsets of CHCs.</p><p>The complex interrelationships that give rise to variation in sexually dimorphic CHC profiles is further illustrated by RNAi interference of <italic>Irc, Pxd</italic>, and <italic>Pxn,</italic> which all have corresponding alleles associated with variation in CHC composition in the DGRP and encode peroxidases.

Using the DGRP, we report one of the most comprehensive characterizations of natural variation in insect CHCs to date. We provide unambiguous evidence for extensive heritable individual variation in the relative abundances of CHC components. MMC analysis shows that CHC components are not independent, but can be organized as correlated modules, which likely reflect common biosynthetic origins. Variation in the CHC profiles can be captured with a limited number of PCs, which were used as composite phenotypic values for GWA analyses. This resulted in the identification of candidate genes associated with variation in CHC composition in males and females, including several genes which could be plausibly associated with CHC biosynthesis. Despite a lenient significance threshold for reporting associations, targeted gene disruption of each of these 24 candidate genes indeed affected CHC composition, often in a sexually dimorphic manner. Our results highlight the complex interactions among genes that directly affect the composition and accumulation of CHCs and regulatory elements that affect CHC indirectly through general lipid metabolism and nutrition (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wicker-Thomas et al., 2015</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Identification of novel CHC components</title><p>We found substantial heritable natural variation in CHC composition for males and females of the inbred, sequenced DGRP lines.

While most of these new compounds represented a very small fraction of the total CHCs, two (peak 51 = 8,12-C28:2 and peak 53 = 6,10-C28:2, 9-C28:1 and 3-Me-C27) were female-specific and could potentially play a role in sexual communication.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A segregating African CHC phenotype in a Cosmopolitan population</title><p>The African CHC phenotype has an abundance of 5,9-C27:2 and lower levels of 7,11-C27:2, and is present only in populations from Sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coyne et al., 1999</xref>).

On average, females of DGRP lines that were heterozygous or homozygous for the functional allele, regardless of inversion status, had intermediate amounts of the sex pheromone CHC peaks relative to the African lines or DGRP lines with the deletion. However, one DGRP line, DGRP_367, had more 5,9-C27:2 than either African line. Two DGRP lines (DGRP_105, ins/ins, INV/ INV and DGRP_551, ins/del, ST/ ST) had the functional <italic>Desat2</italic> allele, yet exhibited the Cosmopolitan phenotype. These results are in contrast to previous reports of complete association of the ancestral allele with the African female CHC phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dallerac et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Takahashi et al., 2001</xref>). Further analyses showed that other <italic>Desat2</italic> polymorphisms in DGRP_105 likely result in a non-functional protein. However, the other Cosmopolitan-like line, DGRP_551, is puzzling because it is heterozygous for the functional allele, but homozygous for the standard karyotype. It is possible that this line is segregating for the <italic>In(3R)K</italic> inversion at low frequency and individuals with the ST/INV karyotype were not detected, but the lack of correspondence between the functional allele and CHC status remains unexplained since <italic>Desat2</italic> itself does not harbor a potentially damaging mutation in this line. Perhaps a polymorphism in an unknown gene in DGRP_551 interacts with the <italic>Desat2</italic> functional allele to suppress its effects. Finally, there were four DGRP lines that exhibited the African phenotype and were homozygous for the ancestral allele, but they were ST/ST in karyotype. One possible explanation for this 'mismatching' of phenotype and genotype with the karyotype is that the <italic>Desat2</italic> 16-bp deletion occurred prior to the inversion event. This would mean that the inversion may be segregating for the <italic>Desat2</italic> 16-bp allele.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>GWA analysis and functional assessment of candidate genes reveals a complex enzymatic network for CHC biosynthesis and turnover</title><p>We used principal component analysis to reduce dimensionality of the data, which was motivated by the high co-linearity among the CHCs.

However, we did find many novel candidate genes, and functional tests showed that disruption of expression of all tested candidate genes had significant effects on the amount of CHC on the cuticular surface. While the mechanistic relationships between any of these genes are unknown, some share commonalities in their phenotypes when their expression is disrupted with RNAi. However, the majority of genes which encode gene products with similar molecular functions result in different shifts in CHC profiles when disrupted.

This could reflect different expression levels of metabolic enzymes associated with CHC production. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that differential effectiveness of RNAi in males and females may contribute to apparent sexual dimorphism.

Further studies are needed to clarify the effects on CHC production of these genes and their interactions, and to test specific mechanisms and enzymatic activities through which they exert these effects. Furthermore, it is important to note that the RNAi and mutant experiments test for effects at the level of genes and are only proxies for the effects of segregating natural variants in these genes.</p><p>We recognize that the 24 candidate genes on which we focused represent only a subset of all candidate genes associated with variation in CHC composition.

For each analysis we included only CHC peaks that had an estimated <italic>H</italic><sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.25. We retained PCs explaining greater than 1% of the variation for subsequent GWA analysis. PCA was conducted in JMP Pro10 (2013 SAS Institute Inc.).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Genome-wide association (GWA) analyses</title><p>We conducted a GWA analysis for each CHC PC, separately for males and females. The DGRP lines are segregating for Wolbachia infection status and for the following common inversions: <italic>In(2L)t, In(2R)NS, In(3R)P, In(3R)K</italic>, and <italic>In(3R)Mo</italic>. We performed GWA studies in two stages. In the first stage, we adjusted the line means for the effects of Wolbachia infection and major inversions. We then used the adjusted line means to fit a linear mixed model in the form of <italic>Y</italic> = <bold>X</bold><italic>b</italic> + <bold>Z</bold><italic>u</italic> + <italic>ε</italic>, where <italic>Y</italic> is the adjusted phenotypic value, <bold>X</bold> is the design matrix for the fixed SNP effect <italic>b</italic>, <bold>Z</bold> is the incidence matrix for the random polygenic effect <italic>u</italic>, and <italic>ε</italic> is the residual. The vector of polygenic effects <italic>u</italic> has a covariance matrix in the form of <bold>A</bold><italic>σ</italic><sup>2</sup>, where <italic>σ</italic><sup>2</sup> is the polygenic variance component. We fitted this linear mixed model using the FastLMM program (version 1.09) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lippert et al., 2011</xref>). We performed these single marker analyses for the 1,883,938 (females) and 1,912,894 (males) biallelic variants (SNPs and indels) with minor allele frequencies ≥ 0.05 whose Phred scale quality scores were at least 500 and genotypes whose sequencing depths were at least one and genotype quality scores at least 20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huang et al., 2014</xref>). All segregating sites within lines were treated as missing data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>RNAi and mutant candidate gene validation experiments</title><p>We selected candidate genes with available mutations and RNAi knockdown constructs to test for effects on CHC production based on FlyBase annotations. We obtained lines with RNAi knockdown constructs from the Vienna <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNAi Center (VDRC) and crossed them to the oenocyte-specific <italic>GAL4</italic> driver, <italic>PromE(800)-GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dietzl et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Billeter et al., 2009</xref>). We tested knockdown constructs and their co-isogenic controls (F1 individuals from crosses of the empty vector strain to <italic>PromE(800)-GAL4</italic>) for 23 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 8</xref>). Since no RNAi knockdown line was available from VDRC for <italic>CG10097</italic> identified in the male GWA analysis, we obtained and tested for this gene a <italic>PiggyBac</italic> insertion mutant from the Harvard Exelixis Collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thibault et al., 2004</xref>) along with the <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> control line. From each cross and mutant line, we collected and aged both male and female virgins and analyzed the CHCs in the same manner as described for the DGRP flies. The analysis of CHCs using GC was also the same. However, for these lines, instead of calculating the proportion that each peak contributed to the total chromatogram, we used the internal standard to calculate the amount of each CHC present in the sample (ng/fly) with the assumption that body sizes between the control and RNAi knockdown or mutant were not significantly different. These measures provide a more quantitative measure of CHCs and capture differences that proportion data may not resolve. PC analyses and <italic>t</italic>-tests pairing the test lines with the controls were conducted on these data. We also calculated the mean total amount of CHCs (ng/fly); we used the more conservative Cochran and Cox test, which assumes unequal group variances to assess statistically significant effects on CHC composition. We also present these data as µg/fly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s24">24</xref>. <italic>t-</italic>tests were conducted in SAS v. 9.4 (2013 SAS Institute Inc.).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Rick Santangelo for technical support.

This sentence is illustrative of several times in the manuscript where the authors make sweeping statements of biochemistry for which there is no basis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript by Dembeck et al. is the latest in a series of fine papers from the Mackay lab using the sequenced inbred lines from the DGRP to understand the genetic architecture of phenotypic trait variation, in this case, the variation in cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC) in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. This manuscript reports three main findings: 1) the discovery of 16 previously unidentified CHCs in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, 2) that reported <italic>Desat2</italic> alleles do not match reported female CHC phenotypes; and 3) the identification of previously unidentified candidate genes in the biosynthesis of CHCs (using genome-wide association analysis to identify candidates and their functional validation by either RNAi knockdown or transposon insertion).</p><p>The main strengths of this manuscript are its systematic approach to gene identification and functional validation. Previously, much work in the area of CHC biosynthesis has relied on biochemical approaches and the field has largely not taken advantage of potential genetic approaches as demonstrated here. The results here provide concrete functional evidence of the roles of numerous genes in CHC biosynthesis. This paper is the product of a tremendous amount of work that will provide good leads for future biological studies. The main weakness of the manuscript is that it does not provide new mechanistic insights into any compelling biological question.</p><p>Detailed comments are as follows:</p><p>In the first section of the paper, Dembeck et al. claim to have detected 16 previously unidentified CHCs from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, including dienes with double bonds in the even-numbered configurations as well as methyl-branched CHCs which are not 2-methyl-branched. The authors stated that they were able to identify these compounds because they use a thin high res column (DB-5) and a relatively long temperature program. I am concerned about the use of this column for the separation of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> CHCs as this column cannot separate two major compounds in female <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Peak 46 contains both 2Me-C26 and 7,11-C27:2. This is a concern for the second part of the paper (the <italic>Desat2</italic> allele and female CHC phenotyping) because 2Me-C26 is a major compound. If they cannot separate these two compounds, then it would be impossible to quantify accurately the amount of 7,11-C27:2 in the fly. Another recent paper (Dweck et al., 2015, PNAS) also used a different method to identify CHC in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. While they identified some methyl-branched CHCs which are not 2-methyl-branched, they did not identify the dienes with the even double bonds presented in this study. The authors stated that these compounds are identified based on comparison to the reference library and to already published <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> CHCs and the position of the double bond was not confirmed for any of the CHCs. While most of these compounds exist in low quantities, I suggest the authors proceed with caution on claiming that they have identified new (and unusual) compounds that many other groups using different methods over the years have not been able to identify.</p><p>In the second part of the manuscript, Dembeck et al. report that the African CHC phenotype (predominantly 5,9-C27:2) is segregating in the DGRP. This section reports the mismatch between what is called the &quot;16-bp deletion / ancestral alleles&quot; of <italic>Desat2</italic> and female CHC phenotype. Two DGRP lines, DGRP_105 and DGRP_551 have the African allele (&quot;functional <italic>Desat2</italic>&quot;) but the cosmopolitan phenotype. This analysis is based on protein sequence alone and does not take into account the possibility that unique polymorphisms in the <italic>Desat2</italic> regulatory region of these lines changed the expression of <italic>Desat2</italic>. Therefore, without properly quantifying whether <italic>Desat2</italic> is expressed or not in these lines, the authors should be careful in determining which alleles are functional based on protein sequence analysis alone (and a 16-bp deletion in the promoter that was not properly characterized previously).</p><p>In the third section which forms the bulk of the paper, the authors identify numerous genes potentially involved in CHC synthesis in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. The same authors have used similar methods to identify novel pigmentation genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Dembeck et al., 2015, PLoS Genetics). In this section, using GWA, the authors identified genetic variants in hundreds of genes which could potentially affect CHC composition. The authors selected 24 candidate genes for functional studies. They used an oenocyte specific driver (although this driver also expresses GAL4 in some other tissues) to knockdown candidate genes in the oenocytes, where CHCs are synthesized. This is a very comprehensive section that entails a tremendous amount of work in both genomic analysis and functional characterization. The authors found that oenocyte-driven RNAi knockdown of 23 candidate genes individually showed quantitative changes in CHC profiles. These results provide very strong evidence that these candidate genes are involved in CHC biosynthesis, but there are two caveats to consider.</p><p>First, some of these genes might not be expressed in adult oenocytes. A brief look on the FlyAtlas website showed that the transcripts of some of these genes are not present or expressed at very low levels in the &quot;adult carcass&quot; where the oenocytes are located. Therefore, it is not known whether the phenotypes that the authors observed are off target effects of RNAi or altered physiology of the whole fly due to the oenocyte driver that they use, which may be driving GAL4 in other parts of the fly.</p><p>Second, while some of the effects of the candidate genes can be explained by the biological/molecular functions of the gene (i.e. fatty acid reductase influencing chain length), others are not (i.e. P450s affecting CHC abundance, although Qiu et al. 2012 PNAS identified the exact mechanism for another P450, <italic>Cyp4g1</italic> in CHC synthesis). How would a P450 (<italic>Cyp9f2</italic>) be involved in elongation of CHCs? As far as is known, that is not one of the reactions that a P450 could catalyze.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09861.051</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>We felt that the manuscript was very interesting but that some key factors need amendment to reflect insect biochemistry and editorial changes to increase the potential audience of this nice genetic analysis.

We added the following text to the Discussion regarding the motivation of using PCs and caveats of losing the ability to detect genes that control variation of individual CHCs: “We used principal component analysis to reduce dimensionality of the data, which was motivated by the high co-linearity among the CHCs. However, PCA may cause genetic variation for a certain CHC to be distributed among multiple PCs and therefore dilute its association with QTLs.”</p><p>Regarding the specific concerns raised by the reviewer:</p><p>A) PC1 and PC2 are orthogonal (uncorrelated) by definition. The appearance of certain linear relationships with subsets of lines may be a result of projecting multi(&gt;2)-dimensional data onto the 2-D plane created by PC1 and PC2. Such patterns may or may not be biologically meaningful. However, we are not aware of a good approach that would use such patterns to synthesize a biosynthetic pathway. On the other hand, albeit incomplete and lacking hierarchical information, our approaches using individual PCs did arrive at key genes involved in the CHC biosynthetic pathways.</p><p>B) We agree with the reviewer that analysis using PCs may miss genes controlling the biosynthesis of CHCs. However, given the severe co-linearity of the data, we think the gain by reducing dimensionality is greater than the loss. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we acknowledge this limitation in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>This manuscript represents a great deal of very good work and can be made into an excellent publication.

So, when the diene is absent the alkane can be readily separated and vice versa. However, when the diene is a major component (e.g., 7,11-C27:2 in females, where it serves as a sex pheromone component), the alkane represents a tiny shoulder preceding the diene and they cannot be reliably separated. See our <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: Peak 57 in males is 2Me-C26 and it elutes just slightly ahead of peak 57 in females, which is mainly 7,11-C27:2. Therefore, this peak can be highly variable depending whether it is in males or females. In order to treat this variable peak consistently in all chromatograms, we considered these 2 compounds together as a single peak for integration, with the recognition that it represents almost exclusively the diene in females and the alkane in males. The paper referenced by the reviewer (Dweck et al. 2015 PNAS) in fact did not separate 2Me-C26 and 7,11-C27:2 (their peaks #74 and 75 in Table Supplement 1 and Figure Supplement 1). While the table shows them separated by 3 Kovats units, the figure shows them co-eluting in females because of the large amount of #75. Only when males are examined can #74 be separated because males lack #75 (7,11-C27:2). The same is true for shorter chain compounds. In fact, Dweck et al. (2015 PNAS) confirm our findings that the 2-methyl-branched compounds are found in males (their peaks #59, 68) and either not found at all in females or in very small amounts. So, our Peak 46 contains both 2Me-C26 and 7,11-C27:2 (as in Dweck et al. 2015 PNAS peaks 74 and 75), but the alkane represents a tiny fraction of the diene that serves as sex pheromone. Dweck et al. (2015 PNAS) used a HP5 column (30 m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 µm) and ran &gt;45 min chromatograms and could not separate these compounds in females. We ran an identical GC phase (DB-5) but in a column (20 m, 0.18 mm, 0.18 µm) that allowed high resolution in much shorter run times of 32 min to optimize the analysis of thousands (hundreds?) of chromatograms. Others (e.g., Frentiu et al. 2010 Evolution) also show no evidence of separating these compounds in females.</p><p>The reviewer is rightly concerned that in the second part of the paper (the <italic>Desat2</italic> allele and female CHC phenotyping) “because 2Me-C26 is a major compound”. As stated above, in normal females 2Me-C26 represents a tiny fraction of 7,11-C27:2. In the African phenotype and in females with an intact <italic>Desat2</italic> gene we found high 5,9-C27:2 and 5,9-C29:2 and low amounts of 7,11-dienes. The reviewer is correct that 2Me-C26 now represents a larger fraction of this combined peak. See our <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, where the leading shoulder, representing 2Me-C26 (retention time 26.25 min), becomes more apparent as peak size decreases (7,11-C27:2 decreases) and 5,9-C27:2 and 5,9-C29:2 increase. Nevertheless, we contend that the potential confounding influence of 2Me-C26 is minimal because our main objective in this section was to quantify and separate the Cosmopolitan and African phenotypes, and this is readily apparent by the relationship of 7,11-C27:2 and 5,9-C27:2.</p><p>Chemical identification of methyl-branched hydrocarbons where the methyl group is near to the chain terminus was based on the relatively high abundance of indicating fragments near the molecular ion. These are produced in the EI ion source by α-cleavage at the methyl branch on the side of the near chain terminus. Hydrogen rearrangement also leads to low-weight radical ion fragments with an even weight corresponding to fragmentation on the other side of the methyl branch. Mass spectra and characteristic ions are shown in the figures in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10-data">Supplementary file 10</xref>, see A and B for 3-methyl- and 5-methylpentacosane, from a male and a female in this study, respectively. Methyl branch position on carbon 3 was also confirmed by the retention index of these hydrocarbons: they all have a retention index increment of 68–73 on the 5% phenyl-methylpolysiloxane column (peaks 17, 41, and 53 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> in the manuscript) due to the methyl branch at that particular position (Schulz, Lipids 2001, 36:637-647).</p><p>Though the position of double bond in monoalkenes was not confirmed with microderivatization reactions the retention indices were matched to that of already published monoalkenes in <italic>D. melanogaster.</italic> Even positions were tentatively assigned when there was a gas-chromatographic peak with a molecular ion and fragmentation pattern of a monoalkene between two peaks of monoalkenes with double bonds at consecutive odd positions, i.e. 6- was assigned in between 7- and 5- (peak 30 between 29 and 31 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>As for alkadienes with the double bonds in even positions just a few carbons apart, we followed the same principle as described in Howard et al. (Journal of Chemical Ecology 2003, 29:961-976), namely that these compounds (as the ones with the double bond in odd positions) have characteristic fragments resulting from the fragmentation of the molecular ion where the double bonds are and from α-cleavage at the outer side of the double bonds. An example on Figure C demonstrates the above with 6,10-hexacosadiene from one of the females analyzed in this study.</p><p>We have included a new <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10-data">Supplementary file 10</xref> to summarize these points.</p><p><italic>In the second part of the manuscript, Dembeck et al. report that the African CHC phenotype (predominantly 5,9-C27:2) is segregating in the DGRP. This section reports the mismatch between what is called the &quot;16-bp deletion / ancestral alleles&quot; of</italic> Desat2 <italic>and female CHC phenotype. Two DGRP lines, DGRP_105 and DGRP_551 have the African allele (&quot;functional</italic> Desat2<italic>&quot;) but the cosmopolitan phenotype. This analysis is based on protein sequence alone and does not take into account the possibility that unique polymorphisms in the</italic> Desat2 <italic>regulatory region of these lines changed the expression of</italic> Desat2<italic>. Therefore, without properly quantifying whether</italic> Desat2 <italic>is expressed or not in these lines, the authors should be careful in determining which alleles are functional based on protein sequence analysis alone (and a 16-bp deletion in the promoter that was not properly characterized previously).</italic> </p><p>For the analysis of DGRP lines DGRP_105 and DGRP_551, we studied the DNA sequence data. While DGRP_551 does not have any obvious mutations that could disrupt <italic>Desat2</italic> expression, we found that DGRP_105 has many unique polymorphisms. We recently completed a gene expression analysis of 185 DGRP lines using Affymetrix tiling arrays – the manuscript reporting these results is in press at the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA (Huang et al., 2015). This study was done on whole young adult flies. We checked the expression of <italic>Desat2</italic> from this study and found that it is highly genetically variable in females (Line FDR = 1.39 E-34, <italic>H</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.766) but not in males (Line FDR = 1.83E-01, not significant). We present these results below, classifying the DGRP lines as homozygous for the derived deletion (Del/Del), the ancestral insertion (Ins/Ins) and heterozygous (Ins/Del). The expression level of DGRP_105 is shown by the red data point. It is clear that the <italic>Desat2</italic> expression of this line overlaps that of the Del/Del genotypes, completely consistent with our CHC analysis and DNA sequence analysis showing that variants in the <italic>Desat2</italic> gene in this line likely result in a non-functional protein. The genotype of this line indeed matches the Cosmopolitan CHC phenotype despite the ancestral ‘functional’ insertion. Unfortunately, DGRP_551 was not among the 181 DGRP lines included in the recent gene expression analysis. We feel that further characterization of the nature of the functional variation at <italic>Desat2</italic> in these lines warrants many additional experiments and is outside the scope of the current manuscript.</p><p><italic>In the third section which forms the bulk of the paper, the authors identify numerous genes potentially involved in CHC synthesis in</italic> D. melanogaster<italic>. The same authors have used similar methods to identify novel pigmentation genes in</italic> Drosophila <italic>(Dembeck et al., 2015, PLoS Genetics). In this section, using GWA, the authors identified genetic variants in hundreds of genes which could potentially affect CHC composition. The authors selected 24 candidate genes for functional studies. They used an oenocyte specific driver (although this driver also expresses GAL4 in some other tissues) to knockdown candidate genes in the oenocytes, where CHCs are synthesized. This is a very comprehensive section that entails a tremendous amount of work in both genomic analysis and functional characterization. The authors found that oenocyte-driven RNAi knockdown of 23 candidate genes individually showed quantitative changes in CHC profiles. These results provide very strong evidence that these candidate genes are involved in CHC biosynthesis, but there are two caveats to consider.</italic> </p><p><italic>First, some of these genes might not be expressed in adult oenocytes. A brief look on the FlyAtlas website showed that the transcripts of some of these genes are not present or expressed at very low levels in the &quot;adult carcass&quot; where the oenocytes are located. Therefore, it is not known whether the phenotypes that the authors observed are off target effects of RNAi or altered physiology of the whole fly due to the oenocyte driver that they use, which may be driving GAL4 in other parts of the fly.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is correct: formally, one can never disprove the potential for off-target effects of RNAi or <italic>GAL4</italic> driver. Only one off-target effect is reported for the RNAi constructs we tested (<italic>Irc</italic> has a reported off-target effect on <italic>CG6170</italic>). We added the following text to the Discussion to acknowledge this caveat: “In addition, we note that phenotypic changes associated with knocking down expression of a target gene with RNAi may not be causal, but a consequence of off-target effects of RNAi or the GAL4 driver. Further studies are needed to clarify the effects on CHC production of these genes and their interactions, and to test specific mechanisms and enzymatic activities through which they exert these effects.”</p><p><italic>Second, while some of the effects of the candidate genes can be explained by the biological/molecular functions of the gene (i.e. fatty acid reductase influencing chain length), others are not (i.e. P450s affecting CHC abundance, although Qiu et al. 2012 PNAS identified the exact mechanism for another P450,</italic> Cyp4g1 <italic>in CHC synthesis). How would a P450 (</italic>Cyp9f2<italic>) be involved in elongation of CHCs? As far as is known, that is not one of the reactions that a P450 could catalyze.</italic> </p><p>We removed the sentence suggesting that <italic>Cyp9f2</italic> may be involved in the elongation of precursors of longer chain n-alkanes and monoenes in females. We later state that: “The link between these CYPs and CHC production and maintenance is unclear. However, we speculate that oxidation reactions mediated by these CYPs may regulate CHC degradation and turnover.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
