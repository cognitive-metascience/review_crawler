group’s fighting capacity. Yet how group members effectively coordinate their contributions during intergroup conflict remains poorly understood. Here we examine the role of oxytocin for (the coordination of) contributions to group attack or defense in a multi-round, real-time feedback economic contest. In a double-blind placebo-controlled study with N=480 males in an Intergroup Attacker-Defender contest game, we found that oxytocin reduced contributions to attack and over time increased attacker’s within-group coordination of contributions. However, rather than becoming peaceful, attackers given oxytocin better tracked their rival’s historical defense and coordinated their contributions into well-timed and hence more profitable attacks. Our results reveal coordination of contributions as a critical component of successful attacks and subscribe to the possibility that oxytocin enables individuals to contribute to in-group efficiency and prosperity even when doing so implies outsiders are excluded or harmed.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

We tend to form social bonds with others who share the same characteristics as ourselves, whether that is nationality, ethnicity, or supporting the same football team. Individuals that belong to the same group as us comprise our ‘in-group’. All other individuals make up our ‘out-groups’. Competition and conflict with out-groups – from benign sporting rivalry to warfare – has a key role in shaping human cultures and societies.</p><p>Such conflict often requires individuals to act in ways that harm their own self-interests. It also requires them to coordinate their actions with other members of their in-group. How does our biology drive this behavior? When small groups prepare for conflict with other groups, they often perform social bonding routines and rituals. These trigger the brain to release a hormone called oxytocin into the bloodstream. Known as the ‘love hormone’, oxytocin helps promote pair bonding as well as social bonding with in-group members. Studies in both humans and monkeys show that boosting oxytocin levels artificially via a nasal spray makes individuals more trusting and cooperative.</p><p>But Zhang et al. now show that the ‘love hormone’ also helps individuals launch more coordinated ‘attacks’ on out-groups. In a study involving a multi-round economic contest game between groups of ‘attackers’ and ‘defenders’, oxytocin did not make attackers less aggressive. Instead it enabled them to better coordinate their attacks. Each contest game involved three attackers individually contributing money to a group pool to outbid the other group and win more money, and three defenders making similar contributions to their own group pool to defend it against the rivals’ attacks and protect themselves from losing all their money. Attackers who used an oxytocin nasal spray were better at tracking their rivals' defensive strategies than attackers whose nasal spray contained a placebo. Under the influence of oxytocin, the attackers timed their strikes to occur when their rivals were vulnerable. Over time, the oxytocin users became better at coordinating their behavior with other members of their in-group. This resulted in more earnings.</p><p>Success – and even survival – in intergroup conflicts depends on how willing individuals are to make contributions that incur a personal cost. They also depend on how well individuals coordinate their contributions. Social strategies, such as leading by example, and neurobiological mechanisms such as oxytocin can both help achieve the coordination needed to exploit out-group rivals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>intergroup conflict</kwd><kwd>oxytocin</kwd><kwd>group coordination</kwd><kwd>out-group attack</kwd><kwd>collective contribution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31722026</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Yina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31771204</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Yina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31661143039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Yina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91632118</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Yina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018EYT04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Yina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017XTCX04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Yina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Spinoza Award from the Netherlands Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NWO SPI-57-242</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Dreu</surname><given-names>Carsten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009592</institution-id><institution>Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z151100003915122</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Yina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Humans intranasally administered the neuropeptide oxytocin waste less and earn more spoils during intergroup conflict because oxytocin enables group members to better coordinate strategic attacking of out-groups.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Conflict between groups of people can profoundly change their demographic, economic and cultural outlook. Across human history, intergroup conflict functioned as a critical change agent and selection pressure that may have shaped the biological preparedness for in-group oriented cooperation and self-sacrifice on the one hand, and out-group hostility and aggression on the other hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bar-Tal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyd and Richerson, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi and Bowles, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Dreu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Macfarlan et al., 2014</xref>). Out-group hostility and aggression serves to subordinate and exploit rivaling out-groups (henceforth out-group attack), and/or to defend the in-group against such hostility from neighboring groups (henceforth in-group defense) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Dreu et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Halevy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rusch, 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rusch, 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lopez, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wrangham, 2018</xref>). Recent work has showed that individuals are more strongly motivated to contribute to defend one’s own group than to attack out-groups and, importantly, that out-group attacks frequently fail because individual contributions to out-group attacks are poorly coordinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Dreu et al., 2016a</xref>). Indeed, attacking rivals who are expected to have strong defenses more likely results in failure and waste, than attacking groups expected to be weak and defenseless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Dreu et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grossman and Kim, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goeree et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, to succeed in intergroup competition and conflict, group members not only need to contribute to their group’s competitive strength, but they also need to coordinate within their group the intensity and timing of attacks.</p><p>How group members coordinate behavior into effective joint actions during intergroup competition and conflict remains poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Dreu et al., 2016a</xref>) and we lack insight into the underlying neurobiological mechanism. Here, we target the neuro-hormone oxytocin as a neurobiological mechanism underlying within-group coordination of out-group attack in dynamic intergroup contests. Studies in ethnography and anthropology have shown that small groups preparing for intergroup conflict build cohesion and commitment through social bonding routines and rituals. Groups selectively invite friends to join a raid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Glowacki et al., 2016</xref>), bond like family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Macfarlan et al., 2014</xref>), and engage in cultural rituals that simulate self-sacrifice, cooperation and coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xygalatas et al., 2013</xref>). Neuroendocrine studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burkett et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carter, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ma et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Samuni et al., 2017</xref>) have linked these and related practices to the release of oxytocin, a nine-amino acid neuropeptide. In turn, intranasal administration of oxytocin has been shown to modulate neural responses in brain regions involved in threat detection and reward processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ma et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paloyelis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, in both non-human and human primates, elevated levels of oxytocin via intranasal administration have been linked to a range of cognitive and behavioral effects including within-group conformity, trust, affiliation, and cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arueti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aydogan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Dreu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Madden and Clutton-Brock, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rilling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Samuni et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stallen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Whereas these work together point to oxytocin as a possible neurobiological mechanism underlying group coordination, three issues remain unclear. First, we lack empirical evidence for the possibility that oxytocin promotes group-level coordination of collective action in general, and during intergroup competition and conflict in particular. Second, we poorly understand how group members coordinate collective action during intergroup competition and conflict, and whether oxytocin can directly influence coordination and/or the strategy group members use to coordinate. Third, we do not know whether oxytocin differentially modulates tacit coordination within groups when collective contributions are focused on attacking one’s rival, versus defending the in-group against possible attacks by one’s rival.</p><p>To address these issues, we examined the role of oxytocin in 80 interactive, multi-round contests between three-person attacker and three-person defender groups. Group members on each side made individual contributions to their group pool (aimed at attacking the other side, or at defending against such possible attacks). We provided individuals with real-time feedback on group investments and success after each contest round, which allowed group members to learn and adapt to their rival’s past investments, and use the history of play as a focal point to coordinate their future attacks and defenses. Indeed, when lacking explicit coordination mechanisms such as a leader or decision-making protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Dreu et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gavrilets and Fortunato, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hermalin, 1998</xref>), groups use social norms and focal points to tacitly coordinate collective action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Halevy and Chou, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schelling, 1960</xref>). In multi-round intergroup contests, the rival’s history of play can serve as a focal point for groups to coordinate their contributions to attack and/or defend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Dreu et al., 2016b</xref>). Thus, when attacking out-groups, group members may coordinate their contributions on their rival’s historical level of defense, and attack when historical defense is low and the target appears vulnerable; and not attack when historical defense is high and the target appears strong and difficult to beat.</p><p>We expected effects of oxytocin to be stronger during out-group attack than during in-group defense. In-group defense is first and foremost an adaptation to the attackers’ (past) aggression and is typically well-coordinated—individuals fight towards the same goal of self-preservation and group survival. Although there is some evidence that oxytocin may increase protective aggression (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Dreu and Kret, 2016</xref>), administering oxytocin may contribute little to the relatively high baseline levels of contribution and coordination during in-group defense. In contrast, out-group attacks are typically less strong, more variable, and less well-coordinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Dreu et al., 2016a</xref>), leaving more room for oxytocin administration to influence behavior. We anticipated two possibilities for the effect of oxytocin. On the one hand, oxytocin has been linked to prosociality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Madden and Clutton-Brock, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rilling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2019</xref>), empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hurlemann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartz et al., 2010</xref>) and consolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burkett et al., 2016</xref>). This line of research would lead us to anticipate that oxytocin may enable individuals in attacker groups to coordinate on a peaceful no-attack strategy that is independent of the rivals’ history of defense. On the other hand, oxytocin has been shown to enhance in-group conformity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aydogan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stallen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Dreu and Kret, 2016</xref>), increase behavioral coordination and neural synchronization within pairs of individuals performing a joint task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arueti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mu et al., 2016</xref>), enhance facial mimicry, motor imitation, and neural responses linked to action-intention mirroring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Korb et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Coster et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kret and De Dreu, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levy et al., 2016</xref>), and improve memory and learning from feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Striepens et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guastella et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ma et al., 2016a</xref>). These functionalities alone and in combination may facilitate coordination on social norms and shared focal points that emerge during group interaction, suggesting that oxytocin may facilitate the use of rival’s history, enable individuals in attacker groups to coordinate better on the level and timing of their attacks, and to efficiently appropriate resources from their out-group. Evidence for this possibility would be consistent with earlier findings that oxytocin shifts the focus from self-interest to in-group interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Dreu and Kret, 2016</xref>), limits trust and cooperation to in-group members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Dreu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ten Velden et al., 2017</xref>), and promotes aggression toward threatening rivals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Madden and Clutton-Brock, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Samuni et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Striepens et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ne'eman et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We examined these possibilities using a dynamic, fully incentivized Intergroup Attacker-Defender Contest game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Dreu et al., 2016a</xref>). The IADC is an all-pay contest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbink et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dechenaux et al., 2015</xref>) involving six individuals randomly assigned to a three-person attacker and a three-person defender group. In the IADC game, 3 attackers made individual contributions to the group pool to subordinate the other group and increase gains through victory (but always keep the remaining resources), and 3 defenders contributed to their group pool to defend rival’s attack and protect against loss and defeat (defenders ‘survive’ from left with 0 only if defense succeeds). We created 80 IADC sessions (with <italic>N</italic> = 480 healthy males); in 40 (40) sessions, participants received intranasal oxytocin (matching placebo) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Each IADC session involved two blocks of 15 investment rounds with real-time feedback in between rounds. For each investment round (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), each individual received an initial endowment of 20 MUs (Monetary Units). Each individual decided the amount (<italic>I<sub>i</sub></italic>, 0 ≤ <italic>I<sub>i</sub></italic> ≤ 20) to the group’s pool <italic>G</italic> (0 ≤ G ≤ 60, G<italic><sub>Attacker</sub></italic> = <italic>I<sub>Attacker-1 </sub>+ I<sub>Attacker-2 </sub>+ I<sub>Attacker-3</sub></italic>, G<italic><sub>Defender</sub></italic> = <italic>I<sub>Defender-1 </sub>+ I<sub>Defender-2 </sub>+ I<sub>Defender-3</sub></italic>). Contributions were wasted, but when G<italic><sub>Attacker</sub></italic> ≤ G<italic><sub>Defender</sub></italic>, attackers failed and defenders survived and all six individuals kept their remaining endowment (leftovers, 20 – <italic>I<sub>i</sub></italic>). However, when <italic>G<sub>Attacker</sub></italic> &gt; <italic>G<sub>Defender</sub></italic>, defenders failed and left with 0. The attacker group won and took away defender group’s remaining MU (spoils from winning, 60 – <italic>G<sub>Defender</sub></italic>), which were divided equally among three attacker group members (each attacker member received: (60 – <italic>G<sub>Defender</sub></italic>)/3) and added to their remaining endowments (20 – <italic>I<sub>Attacker-</sub></italic><sub>i</sub>).

As noted, oxytocin may enable groups to coordinate on a peaceful ‘no-attack strategy’, in which case we should find (1) lower victories in attacker groups given oxytocin rather than placebo, (2) the oxytocin effect on the number of non-contributing attackers should not differ when attacks succeed or fail, and (3) no effect of oxytocin on tracking the rival’s defense history. This was not the case. First, the number of victories was similar in attacker groups given oxytocin (M ± SE: 24.8 ± 1.8%) and placebo (M ± SE: 26.6 ± 1.6%), (<italic>F</italic>(1, 78)=0.572, p=0.452; η<sup>2</sup> = 0.007). Thus, rather than making groups coordinate on a peaceful no-attack strategy, oxytocin may enable groups to coordinate on attacking at the right moment with the right force. Indeed, analyses of the spoils and leftovers showed that groups given oxytocin rather than placebo had higher leftovers when attacks failed (<italic>t</italic>(78) = 2.609, p=0.011, Cohen’s d = 0.581, 95% <italic>Confidence Interval</italic> (CI), 0.232 to 1.76, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and somewhat higher spoils when attacks were successful (<italic>t</italic>(74) = 1.819, p=0.073, Cohen’s d = 0.419, 95% CI, −0.086 to 1.888, marginal significance, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). To illustrate the increased efficiency of attack under oxytocin, attackers’ contribution and payment under the four conditions (i.e. Simultaneous/Sequential x Oxytocin/Placebo) were plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> using a bootstrapping technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davison and Hinkley, 1977</xref>).

The mean contribution and payment of the bootstrapped sample was then calculated and saved as a new data point. For each condition, this procedure was repeated for 1000 times to represent the population information. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, oxytocin decreased contributions to attack (a shift toward less contribution) but increased payment (a shift toward more payment). The distribution of attacker groups under oxytocin and placebo in a space defined by the two vectors (contribution and payment) indicates a clear separation of oxytocin and placebo treatments (especially when decisions were made simultaneously, that is black dots vs. grey dots).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40698.008</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Oxytocin modulates within-group coordination.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Giving individuals oxytocin rather than placebo enables better coordination (lower within-group variance) in attacker groups, especially in early rounds.

It showed that attacker groups given oxytocin tracked their rival’s past defense and attacked especially when defenders appeared more rather than less vulnerable (i.e. attack regressed <italic>negatively</italic> on rival’s historical defense). Specifically, when decisions were made simultaneously, attack regressed more strongly on α when groups received oxytocin (M ± SE: -0.30 ± 0.05) rather than placebo (M ± SE: -0.042 ± 0.098; t(78) = -2.334; p = 0.022, Cohen’s d = -0.522, 95% CI, -0.482 to -0.038), and under oxytocin but not placebo, the regression on α was also stronger in simultaneous rather than sequential decision-making (Treatment <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf12"><mml:mo>×</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> Procedure interaction, <italic>F</italic>(1, 78) = 8.312, <italic>p</italic> = 0.005, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.097, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>Combined, results suggest that groups given oxytocin created more spoils from winning and had higher leftovers when attacks failed because they better coordinated attack at the right time and with the proper force.

They also need to coordinate collective action so that they attack when their rival is expected to be weak, and avoid wasting resources on attacking tough defenders. Here we found, using a dynamic intergroup contest between attackers and defenders, that those groups who tracked their defender’s history of play and coordinated their attacks of weak rather than strong defenders wasted less resources on failed attacks and enjoyed greater spoils when winning. In addition, we uncovered that oxytocin serves as a neurobiological mechanism underlying such well-timed and coordinated attacks. Specifically, we found that oxytocin enabled individuals within attacker groups to converge their individual contributions on each other more, to collectively refrain from attacking apparently strong defenders, and effectively attacking weak defenders. These findings emerged when groups lack an explicit coordination device; providing attacker groups with a sequential decision-making protocol as an explicit coordination device substituted oxytocin-induced tacit coordination.</p><p>Our finding that oxytocin enables within-group coordination of contributions to out-group attacks resonates with two heretofore disconnected sets of findings—that small groups of warriors engage in social bonding and cultural rites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Glowacki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Macfarlan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schelling, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wilson and Wilson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xygalatas et al., 2013</xref>), and that social bonding and synchronized action can trigger the release of oxytocin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burkett et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carter, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Samuni et al., 2017</xref>). Combined with the current results, it suggests that oxytocin might be a potential neurobiological mechanism through which social bonding and performing coordinated rituals can help groups to better coordinate their attacks. Our findings furthermore suggest that such oxytocin-mediated within-group coordination can be substituted by institutional arrangements, such as a sequential decision-making protocol. We speculate that related institutional arrangements, like appointing a leader or having open communication channels can similarly obviate the need for bonding rituals and/or oxytocin to make out-group attack well-coordinated and successful.</p><p>Neither oxytocin nor the sequential decision-protocol contributed to within-group coordination in defender groups. One possibility is that in-group defense is tacitly well-coordinated because of the stronger alignment of individual interests within defender groups. After all, when defender groups survive an enemy attack, those who did not contribute to in-group defense come out relatively wealthy. But when in-group defense fails, all group members lose regardless of whether they contributed or not. As a result of this stronger common fate in defender groups, individuals contribute spontaneously and tacitly coordinate well on avoiding collective defeat. Exogenous enhancers, whether at the neurobiological or institutional level, appear not necessary.</p><p>Previous studies provided evidence for the role of oxytocin in intergroup interaction: It can increase the positive view and benign approach of the in-group and has been linked to subtle forms of intergroup discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Dreu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Dreu and Kret, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stallen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ten Velden et al., 2017</xref>). Without exception, this early evidence was limited to individual-level decision-making, and did not clearly distinguish the distinct motives for contributing to in-group efficiency and out-group hostility. It remained unknown whether and how oxytocin differentially affects attack and defense behavior during intergroup conflict. Using a dynamic attack-defense contest we revealed selective effects of oxytocin on group attacking. As such, the present study provides a new perspective on oxytocin in intergroup conflict by highlighting its functionality for strategic attack (rather than defense). In doing so, we also obtained first-time evidence that in-group coordination for collective action can be tracked to evolutionary preserved neurobiological factors.</p><p>Our study has two potential limitations. First, it involved only Chinese males as study participants. Whereas we cannot exclude specific cultural effects, findings for the comparison between out-group attack and in-group defense and between sequential and simultaneous decision-making protocols resonate with findings obtained in Western culture, with both male and female participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Dreu et al., 2016a</xref>). This generates confidence in the generality of the behavioral effects for attack/defense and decision protocols. Furthermore, recent work on the role of oxytocin in in-group cooperation suggests similar effects for both male and female participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ten Velden et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, and given the absence of strong counter-evidence, we cautiously conclude that current findings may generalize across cultural contexts and apply to male as well as female participants. Second, it is unclear how exogenous administration of oxytocin operates at the neurophysiological level. Whereas some have questioned whether intranasal administration of oxytocin can have a direct impact on brain and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leng and Ludwig, 2016</xref>), recent studies in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Neumann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tanaka et al., 2018</xref>), rhesus macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Modi et al., 2014</xref>) and in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paloyelis et al., 2016</xref>) collectively suggest that intranasal oxytocin elevates brain-level presence of oxytocin, and impacts behavioral decisions through neural networks involved in threat detection and reward processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carter, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hurlemann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ma et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rilling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stallen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, there is some evidence that higher levels of oxytocin in saliva, blood, or urine relate to in-group affiliation and cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Madden and Clutton-Brock, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Samuni et al., 2017</xref>) and intergroup discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levy et al., 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, new research is needed to uncover the neurophysiological pathways through which intranasal oxytocin impact human cognition and behavior, and how findings on intranasal oxytocin relate to endogenous oxytocin measured from saliva, urine, or blood samples.</p><p>Intergroup competition and conflict shape the economic and cultural outlook of groups and societies, and interferes with individual life-trajectories. Success and survival in times of intergroup competition and conflict depend on the extent to which individuals make personally costly contributions and, as shown here, on their ability to coordinate their contributions when attacking out-groups, or defending against threatening out-groups. Both institutional arrangements, such as leading-by-example, and neurobiological mechanisms, such as oxytocin, facilitate behavioral coordination and the effective exploitation of out-group rivals. Indeed, as shown here, providing group members with oxytocin or an explicit coordination device enables them to waste less on failed attacks, and to earn more from their victories.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>We recruited 486 healthy males, mostly science and engineering students, as paid volunteers.

For each IADC session, six strangers were invited to the lab at the same time and randomly assigned to six individual cubicles within the same room. Upon arrival, participants first completed questionnaires that measured current mood, empathic capacity, prosocial personality, impulsiveness, subjective socio-economic status, and cooperative personality. Participants then self-administered oxytocin or placebo. After 35 min, participants were given instructions for the IADC game and completed two practice rounds. When they also passed a comprehension check, they played 15 simultaneous rounds and 15 sequential rounds of IADC investments (order of simultaneous and sequential blocks was counterbalanced across sessions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). All the experimental instructions used neutral language (e.g. contribution was labeled investment; defense and attack were avoided, and groups were labeled as group A or B). Finally, participants filled out a post-survey for mood measurement and manipulation check. The attacker and defender groups under oxytocin or placebo did not differ in demographic information, mood change, and prosocial-related traits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1, Table 1A and B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Oxytocin administration</title><p>The procedure of oxytocin and placebo administration was similar to previous work that showed oxytocin effects on decision-making behaviors or in-group favoritism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Dreu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rilling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). A single intranasal dose of 24 IU oxytocin or placebo (containing the active ingredients except for the neuropeptide) was self-administered by nasal spray about 35 min before the experimental task under experimenter supervision. A 24 IU dosage is the most commonly used dosage in oxytocin literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2017</xref>) and recently shown as having more pronounced effects (compared with 12 or 48 IU dose of oxytocin) on behavioral and neural responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spengler et al., 2017</xref>). The spray was administered to participants three times, and each administration consisted of one inhalation of 4 IU into each nostril. Six participants in the same IADC session were assigned to the same treatment (oxytocin or placebo), so as to avoid potential influence of oxytocin to placebo between individuals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data were aggregated to the group level, with Role (Attacker vs. Defender), Procedure (Simultaneous vs. Sequential) and Round as within-group variables, and Treatment (Oxytocin vs. Placebo) as a between-group factor.

The within-group variance is calculated for each decision round, thus reveals the group coordination of contribution at each round, with lower variance indicating stronger coordination. In addition, to complement and validate these analyses, we analyzed (viii) decision time for investment decisions (log 10-transformed decision time), and (ix) within-group coordination as reflected in the Intra-class correlation coefficient.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Game-theoretic analysis</title><p>The IADC is an all-pay contest with a single mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbink et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dechenaux et al., 2015</xref>).

To further reveal how oxytocin influenced the non-contributing decisions, we examined participants’ decision time by calculating the response time separately for the round that participants decided to or not to contribute. This analysis was conducted only on the attacker group because (1) there were very few rounds (9%) in which defenders decided not to contribute; (2) oxytocin selectively influenced the number of non-contributors in attacker groups. Since the distribution of decision times is heavily right skewed, linear regression is not appropriate. Similar to our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ma et al., 2015</xref>), we first log 10-transformed decision times in all the analyses that involved decision times.

The regression weight α was Fisher’s z transformed for statistical analysis. Similar to a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Dreu et al., 2016b</xref>), we also included another parameter: defense change of the last and before-last rounds, calculated as (D<sub>j-1</sub> - D<sub>j-2</sub>), regression weight referred as β.

Rather than imposing questionable distributional assumptions, bootstrapping generates an empirical approximation of the sampling distribution of a statistic by repeated random resampling from the available data, and uses this distribution to calculate p-values and construct confidence intervals (5000 resamples were taken for these analyses). Moreover, this procedure supplies superior CIs that are bias-corrected and accelerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Preacher et al., 2007</xref>).

It is creative and innovative with regards to the paradigm, analyses, and interpretations. In addition to innovation, additional strengths include a large sample size for adequate power, and breadth of analyses performed. I did notice that some of the most important statistical tests for the conclusions were not significant, but rather statistically trending (Results section) which in my opinion should be noted/discussed as such. I am curious how the subjects were paid. Was their final payment associated with their performance in the task? What is the interpretation of OT increasing the number of non-contributors during attack? The data supporting the notion that OT does not increase contributions to attack in general, but rather coordinates attacking at the right moment with the right force is quite compelling, especially being more pronounced in the simultaneous rather than sequential procedure. To make that point explicitly in terms of oxytocin increasing payment (leftovers and spoils) more during the simultaneous procedure, it would be nice to see the analyses pertaining to that broken down by procedure (i.e. simultaneous and sequential separately). Without debating semantics, which is not my intention, I am also struck by the interpretation that OT is a biological mechanism to converge or &quot;coordinate&quot; contributions between individuals in the attack group (when not sequential). It seems to me that the concept of coordination or convergence is secondary to perhaps a primary role of oxytocin to increase one's own (at an individual level) social intuition and acuity in the assessment of how strong or challenging a defense may be and when and how it would be effective to attack as a result (along the lines of social adaptation). In the simultaneous context, it would be evolutionarily important for each individual to act at maximum efficiency because there is no leader or others to rely on as there is in the sequential procedure. So by OT increasing each individuals' social acuity and using that information to act most adaptively or effectively, as a group they will appear coordinated (acting similarly) in their beneficial action and together will achieve success. In this case, OT would not be facilitating the social coordination per se, but rather individual social acuity and reaction assessment that is necessary to achieve success as a group in the simultaneous context. Also, I am not convinced that this study demonstrated that social bonding and performing synchronization rituals helps coordinate attacks (as put forth in paragraph two of the Discussion) because as I understand it, in this study group members did not interact or socially bond before coordinating their attacks. Overall, I was extremely impressed with the caliber of this thought-provoking manuscript and believe that is positively contributes to the field and scientific community.</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>Many of the figures legends are lacking definitions of the symbols used to denote significance (i.e. what significance level). Also the key is missing in Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><p>Discussion, third paragraph final sentence: should it be *not* needed?</p><p>Discussion paragraph four: &quot;remains&quot; should be *remained* past tense because it does not remain with the current study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This paper demonstrated that in an inter-group conflict game, exogenous oxytocin (OT) treatment increased attacker's within-group synchronization of contributions (reduced within-group variance). These behavioral changes would be because of selecting more effective strategy (attacking at a proper time when the defender was weak). This within-group coordination in attacking can increase spoils from winning. The aim of this study was based on their previous studies and was clear, and the methods were well-conducted. The number of the participants were well-enough to draw the conclusions. However, I have some concerns/questions on this form of the manuscript.</p><p>1) In Figure 1A, the authors mentioned that contribution amount was low in the subjects in the OT Condition. However, the authors already reported that OT promotes internal group defense (as a review De Dreu and Kret 2016 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25908497). Therefore, it is necessary to present the data comparing Contribution amounts among four levels (Treatment × Role). If there was inconsistency between their previous study and present results regarding to the effects of OT on contribution in defense group, the authors need to discuss this.</p><p>2) In Figure 1B, the data were inconsistent with De Dreu et al., 2016, in that there is no difference in the frequency of Non-contributors between Simultaneous and Sequential. The authors need to explain the inconsistency.</p><p>3) In the same figure, in the Attack group of the Simultaneous and OT condition, did the frequency of Non-contributors increase in rounds in which attacks fail, and did the frequency of Non-contributors decrease when the attack succeeded? The information on the frequency of non-contributors when dividing by attacking success / failure is necessary.</p><p>4) If OT changes the attack efficiency, it is thought that information on how the defense parameter α has a negative regression coefficient to influence the success rate of attack is necessary.</p><p>5) In Discussion, the authors discussed one possibility that in-group defense was tacitly well-coordinated because of the stronger alignment of individual interests within defender groups. If this is true, would the results change by modulating the ratio of losing/gaining MU as the results of attach/defense? How did the authors decide the ratio of cost/benefit of the MU after the challenge?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic> </p><p>In this study, the authors examined the effects of oxytocin administration on a large sample of Chinese men (n = 480) engaged in a three-person monitory game divided to &quot;attackers&quot; and &quot;defenders&quot; where the goal was to evaluate donation to the group monetary pool in relation to the donation of own group and opponent group.</p><p>It was found that oxytocin reduced donation to the group pool in the &quot;attacker&quot; group and increased the &quot;coordination&quot; between the participants' donation, defined as the inter-subject correlation between the parents' contribution. It also increased the &quot;attackers&quot; ability to track the opponents' contribution in sequential trials.</p><p>The large sample size is an asset of the study. It is, to my knowledge, the largest oxytocin administration study conducted so far. The game is complex and so are the statistical analyses.</p><p>The major issue with the study, in my opinion, is whether it measures what it claims to show. It is unclear whether the economical game the authors developed can provide any simulation to real-life battle, &quot;warrior games&quot; or &quot;coordinated action&quot; (the theoretical frame they set for the study), whether inter-subject correlations between monetary contributions of individuals and reduced variance indeed show &quot;group synchrony&quot; in the face of external danger, whether survival has anything to do with the neurobiological processes that underpin this game, and whether there are alternative explanations to the findings that are more plausible and parsimonious (and more consistent with findings from studies on oxytocin administration and economical games).</p><p>In terms of &quot;coordinated action&quot; or &quot;behavioral synchrony&quot; among groups, the increased group cohesion in the face of danger, and the rites and rituals group perform before going to battle, these are indeed very powerful mechanisms and are found across human cultures and non-human primates. What is unclear is how coordinated action patterns relate to contributing more or less to the general pool in a sequential economic game. There are ways to measure action coordination in groups, in terms of real action patterns, mimicry, imitation, facial expressions, coordinated movement etc, and the increase in coordination results from various factors in the group, for instance, the presence of a charismatic leader (Gordon, I. Berson, Y. Oxytocin modulates charismatic influence in groups. J Exp Psychol Gen. 2018 Jan;147(1):132-138. doi: 10.1037/xge0000375). It is unclear at all why the authors measure &quot;behavioral synchrony&quot; as the reduced variance among the contributions of members and it is not possible, in my opinion, to simply link this reduced variable to the literature on behavioral synchrony, action coordination, and war rituals without some kind of validation that this reduced variance in the differences of contribution over trials is indeed related to more behavioral coordination. Without such indication, it is not possible to propose that oxytocin, which is indeed a mechanism to enhance coordination of behavior (movements, vocalizations, mimicry) in humans and non-human primates, to the present findings.</p><p>An additional difficulty is the claim that literature on survival is relevant to this game in any way and that playing this game simulates mechanisms of survival. Here, I was unclear about the difference between &quot;attackers&quot; and &quot;defenders&quot; on a biological level. It appears that one group was told that they &quot;attack&quot; something and another that they &quot;defend&quot; something but attack and defend where not part of the ongoing game, even not at the level of a simple board game where there is a simulation of &quot;defending a castle&quot;, but that the real game, for the two groups, was identical was about how to outsmart the other group in terms of donating more or less. The distance between this and proposing that the two groups differ on biological mechanisms is substantial, and must be demonstrated prior to conducting this study. It is more parsimonious (and plausible) to conclude that the mechanisms underpinning this game related more to human competition and are supported by humans' large prefrontal abilities, working memory, and far-sighted planning, and are unrelated to &quot;movement coordination&quot; in the face of a threat to survival. Such mechanisms are likely to be identical for the attackers and defenders (unless otherwise proven) and probably have much less to do with more primitive mechanisms described in the animal literature. For instance, the primate study the authors cite (Summani) showed greater vocal coordination and greater urinary oxytocin in primates during live conflict and is too great a leap to hypothesize from this to reduced variance of donation among players in a safe room. This study also did not differentiate between the behavioral repertoire (and oxytocin production) of attack (where motion and vocal synchrony correlated with oxytocin) and those related to &quot;border patrol&quot;, which suggests that in the animal kingdom, both attack and defense are part of the survival and may not be biologically distinct.</p><p>The inter-subject correlation – the authors' index for behavioral synchrony – was measured only in the &quot;attacker&quot; group (rationale not clear) but this group also markedly reduced its contribution over time under oxytocin. It is possible that the increase in correlation among group members resulted from that decrease and that the zero donation correlated among the participants (even if we accept the suggestion that this is a proxy for synchrony, it is a synchrony of &quot;no action&quot; rather than of action).</p><p>A more parsimonious explanation for the findings – and one that must be ruled out before offering a mechanistic explanation based on rituals and action coordination – would be that oxytocin increased the participants' memory for the sequence of events (there is evidence for oxytocin effects on memory) or that it reduced their level of stress and increased calmness and lethargy (there evidence in both humans and animals) and they reduced their contributions. Even within the literature on oxytocin and economic games (which should provide the conceptual frame for this study) the findings need to be reconciled with those showing that individuals donate more under oxytocin. Is this a cultural phenomenon specific to the Chinese culture?</p><p>Another important issue is the between-subject design, which is not the golden standard in oxytocin administration research. Particularly in relation to economic games, a recent study showed different brain activation patterns in a within- and between-subject design in an OT administration study using the prisoner's dilemma (Chen X, Gautam P, Haroon E, Rilling JK Within vs. between-subject effects of intranasal oxytocin on the neural response to cooperative and non-cooperative social interactions. Psychoneuroendocrinology. 2017 78:22-30. doi: 10.1016/j.psyneuen. 2017.01.006). At least, the authors should describe how randomization was conducted and show extensive comparisons among groups not only in demographics but also in relevant physiological variables (for instance, BMI).</p><p>In sum, the authors have collected an impressive sample and the study is complex and well-analyzed. The conceptual frame should fit the study design and alternative explanation must be carefully considered before contribution of the findings can be considered. As frames, the conclusions of the study are not supported by the data and design and may be misleading.</p><p>Additional data files and statistical comments:</p><p>No need for more data. The study does not measure behavioral synchrony under conflict and there is a great gap between measuring the degree of sameness in how much individuals contributed (or didn’t contribute) and the survival evolutionary frame, war rituals, and action coordination the authors invoke to support the findings. In the current frame and design, the conclusions are misleading.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40698.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers agreed on the value of the data generated in this study.

We agree with the reviewer and take care of our language to avoid the link to movement or motor action. For example, we omitted the term behavioral synchronization and deleted the ‘war dance’ metaphor. We did keep, however, the terms ‘attack/attacker’ and ‘defense/defender’ in the revision for two reasons. First, we use these terms to keep consistency with the literature as these terms were used in the original economic game (De Dreu et al., 2016; in press). Second, we used the terms ‘attack/attacker’ and ‘defense/defender’ to indicate that the two parties in the current economic game are in different positions (an asymmetric structure of attacker and defender), with one side aiming to increase gains through victory (but always keep the remaining resources), and the other side aiming to protect against loss and defeat (i.e., they keep their remaining resources only when defense succeed; otherwise they are left with 0).</p><p>In the revision, we explicitly stated that the terms ‘attack/attacker’ and ‘defense/defender’ were used in the context of economic games to avoid the link to movement or motor action.

We used the correlation coefficient (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC) and variance to indicate different aspects of the group-level coordination (contribution similarity of members of the same group), with the correlation coefficient reflecting group decision similarity across all rounds and variance reflecting the differences between each group member and the group mean on a round-by-round basis.</p><p>– Regarding the use of variance and ICC:</p><p>The ICC (LeBreton and Senter, 2008) operates on a data structured as groups, rather than data structured as paired observations. ICC describes the amount of statistical interdependence within a group (group cohesion), reflects how strongly individuals’ contributions in all rounds in the same group resemble each other, i.e., how similar group members are in their contributions to the group pool across rounds. Higher ICC values in essence mean group members are more similar to each other in the contributions made to their group pool. On the other hand, the within-group variance is calculated for each decision round, thus reveals the group coordination of contribution for each round, with lower variance indicating stronger coordination. Thus we can examine the effects of Role, Procedure and Treatment on group variance, as well as to reveal how these effects on group coordination change across rounds.</p><p>For both indices, we observed a similar pattern that oxytocin increased within-group coordination in attackers especially when decisions were made simultaneously. Thus, we reported the effect on within-group variance in the main text, and reported the similar effect on ICC in the SI as a further support.</p><p>– Regarding the choice of variance instead of SD:</p><p>The standard deviation can be calculated out of variance, as the square root of the variance.

There were two potential interpretations for the effect of oxytocin on increasing non-contributors during attack. On the one hand, oxytocin has been linked to prosociality, empathy and consolation (Rilling et al., 2012; Yan et al., 2018; Hurlemann et al., 2010; Bartz et al., 2010; Burkett et al., 2016). This line of research would suggest that oxytocin enhances attackers’ prosocial behavior, including a desire for “peaceful” no-attack (i.e., not contributing). Alternatively, oxytocin has been shown to enhance in-group favoritism and conformity (Aydogan et al., 2017; Stallen et al., 2012; De Dreu and Kret, 2016), to increase behavioral coordination and neural synchronization (Arueti et al., 2013; Mu et al., 2016), and to improve memory and learning from feedback (Striepens et al., 2012; Adam et al., 2008; Ma et al., 2016). This line of research would suggest that oxytocin enables attackers to coordinate better on the level and timing of their attacks, and to efficiently appropriate resources from out-group rivals. Here non-contributions reflect a decision to “not attack now,” for example because the defenders appear strong and tough to win from.</p><p>As we discuss in the manuscript, if oxytocin enable groups to coordinate on a peaceful “no-attack strategy”, we would expect 1) lower victories in attacker groups given oxytocin than placebo, 2) the oxytocin effect on the number of non-contributing attackers should not differ when attacks succeed or fail, and 3) no effect of oxytocin on tracking rival’s defense history. Results from our further analyses on the success rate (oxytocin did not decrease success rate), non-contributor in successful or failed attacks (oxytocin increased non-contributing attacker only in failed but not in successful attacks), and tracking parameter (oxytocin increases attacker’s tracking of rival’s history, less attack when rivals defended strongly) lend supports for the second interpretation that oxytocin increases effective attack strategy rather than peaceful no-attack strategy. Consistent with previous studies, oxytocin may increase non-contributing attacker through its function in facilitating group-serving bias (De Dreu and Kret, 2016; De Dreu, et al., 2011), promoting social learning and cognitive flexibility (Ma et al., 2016a; Sala, et al., 2011), and increasing salience of social feedback (Shamay-Tsoory, et al., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The data supporting the notion that OT does not increase contributions to attack in general, but rather coordinates attacking at the right moment with the right force is quite compelling, especially being more pronounced in the simultaneous rather than sequential procedure. To make that point explicitly in terms of oxytocin increasing payment (leftovers and spoils) more during the simultaneous procedure, it would be nice to see the analyses pertaining to that broken down by procedure (i.e. simultaneous and sequential separately).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. First, we would like to clarify that oxytocin enables coordinated attack at the right time with the right force is supported by the result of oxytocin effects on the tracking parameter. Oxytocin increased tracking on rival’s past defense, i.e., attackers given oxytocin attacked especially when defenders appeared more rather than less vulnerable. Then, following the reviewer’s suggestion, we broke down the Treatment x Procedure interaction on tracking parameter α by procedure to show the oxytocin effect on the tracking parameters in simultaneous and sequential decision-making separately. We showed that oxytocin increased attacker’s strategic tracking (i.e., a negative α) on rival’s history when decisions were made simultaneously (oxytocin vs. placebo: -0.30 ± 0.05 vs. -0.042 ± 0.098, t(78) = -2.334; p = 0.022, Cohen’s d = -0.522, 95% CI, -0.482 to -0.038), however, oxytocin decreased strategic tracking when decisions were made sequentially (oxytocin vs. placebo: -0.06 ± 0.05 vs. -0.18 ± 0.04, t(78) = 2.031; p = 0.046, Cohen’s d = 0.454, 95% CI, 0.003 to 0.249). This may reflect the fact that in sequential decision-making, people rely more on each other’s investments to coordinate, than on their rival group’s past behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Without debating semantics, which is not my intention, I am also struck by the interpretation that OT is a biological mechanism to converge or &quot;coordinate&quot; contributions between individuals in the attack group (when not sequential). It seems to me that the concept of coordination or convergence is secondary to perhaps a primary role of oxytocin to increase one's own (at an individual level) social intuition and acuity in the assessment of how strong or challenging a defense may be and when and how it would be effective to attack as a result (along the lines of social adaptation). In the simultaneous context, it would be evolutionarily important for each individual to act at maximum efficiency because there is no leader or others to rely on as there is in the sequential procedure. So by OT increasing each individuals' social acuity and using that information to act most adaptively or effectively, as a group they will appear coordinated (acting similarly) in their beneficial action and together will achieve success. In this case, OT would not be facilitating the social coordination per se, but rather individual social acuity and reaction assessment that is necessary to achieve success as a group in the simultaneous context.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this observation, and we agree that it is difficult to disentangle whether 1) oxytocin directly increases coordinated attacks or 2) oxytocin primarily increased individual-level performance, which results in seemingly coordinated group behavior. One key argument is that in our economic contest, *individual attackers* are always best off by not investing whatsoever, yet that *attacker groups* are better off attacking (with the right force at the right time). The reviewer’s observation that oxytocin increases social acuity and intuition, combined with our result that oxytocin increases efficient group-level attack, suggests that the oxytocin-enhanced social acuity/intuition is “used” to align individual behavior with those of others within one’s group, thus producing (unintentionally perhaps) enhanced coordination and more efficient collective action. In our revision we toned down any strong statements about the precise mechanisms underlying our observation that oxytocin leads attacker groups to be more efficient.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, I am not convinced that this study demonstrated that social bonding and performing synchronization rituals helps coordinate attacks (as put forth in paragraph two of the Discussion) because as I understand it, in this study group members did not interact or socially bond before coordinating their attacks. Overall, I was extremely impressed with the caliber of this thought-provoking manuscript and believe that is positively contributes to the field and scientific community.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this helpful suggestion. We now toned down allusions to the relationship between coordinated attacks and social bonding, and revised the Discussion accordingly (paragraph two). We maintained references to work showing that attacker groups often engage in social bonding practices, and that social bonding and synchronized action can trigger the release of oxytocin. From these isolated lines of work, we derive the hypothesis that oxytocin may facilitate coordinated attacks. But, per the reviewer’s correct observation, we refrain from suggesting that social bonding increases coordinated attack through enhanced levels of oxytocin. This indeed is too speculative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>Many of the figures legends are lacking definitions of the symbols used to denote significance (i.e. what significance level).

These behavioral changes would be because of selecting more effective strategy (attacking at a proper time when the defender was weak). This within-group coordination in attacking can increase spoils from winning. The aim of this study was based on their previous studies and was clear, and the methods were well-conducted. The number of the participants were well-enough to draw the conclusions. However, I have some concerns/questions on this form of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the positive evaluation and helpful suggestions from the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) In Figure 1A, the authors mentioned that contribution amount was low in the subjects in the OT Condition. However, the authors already reported that OT promotes internal group defense (as a review De Dreu and Kret 2016 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25908497). Therefore, it is necessary to present the data comparing Contribution amounts among four levels (Treatment × Role). If there was inconsistency between their previous study and present results regarding to the effects of OT on contribution in defense group, the authors need to discuss this.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that earlier work (reviewed in De Dreu and Kret, 2016) showed that administering oxytocin increases defensive hostility towards threatening outsiders. We find no evidence for this in the current economic contest, which mimic earlier findings that in the attacker-defender game oxytocin influences investments in attack but not in defense (De Dreu et al., 2015). To appreciate this difference in research findings it is important to note that (a) the finding that oxytocin can enhance defense hostility is obtained in individual, one-shot games where participants do not have a shared history or future, and (b) in re-iterated attacker-defender contests as studied here, defense is tough and heavily anchored on the attacker’s history of play, thus leaving little “room” for increased defense under oxytocin (compared to placebo). Thus, our null-finding for defense may be due to a ceiling effect and/or an overshadowing by attacker history. We have revised the Introduction to clarify the possible differences in setting between earlier studies finding such an oxytocin-enhanced defensiveness, and the current set of results.</p><p>– Regarding comparing Contributions among four levels (Treatment × Role):</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this enquiry; yet believe that our manuscript did provide the necessary break-downs to appreciate the significant comparisons. To be sure, we performed our ANOVA on 2 (Treatment: Oxytocin vs. Placebo) × 2 (Role: Attack vs. Defense) × 2 (Procedure: Simultaneous vs. Sequential) × 15 (Rounds), which thus fully breaks down possible comparisons. We reported significant effects of main/interaction and provided the means and statistics (Results paragraph three).</p><p>To accommodate the reviewer, we also analyzed the contributions in a 2 Treatment (Oxytocin vs. Placebo) x2 Role (Defense vs. Attack) ANOVA (thus collapsing across rounds and decision-procedure). This analysis essentially replicates the findings reported in the Main Text: Defenders invested more than attackers (F (1,78) = 287.912, p &lt; 0.001, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.787), and individuals contributed somewhat less when given oxytocin than placebo (F(1, 78) = 3.719, p = 0.057, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.046; marginal significance). The Role x Treatment interaction was not significant (F&lt;1). For attacker groups, oxytocin decreased contributions (F (1, 78) = 4.367, p = 0.040; η<sup>2</sup> = 0.053) compared to placebo. No significant treatment effect was found for defender groups (F (1, 78) = 2.006, p = 0.168, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.025). We believe that this 2 x 2 analysis is, however, redundant with the full model shown in the Main Text. Accordingly, we have not incorporated it in the revision at present but are happy to reconsider.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 1B, the data were inconsistent with De Dreu et al., 2016, in that there is no difference in the frequency of Non-contributors between Simultaneous and Sequential. The authors need to explain the inconsistency.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Indeed, inconsistent with previous study (De Dreu et al., 2016) showing higher numbers of non-contributors in the simultaneous than sequential block, we did not observe a significant effect of Procedure on non-contributors in the current study. One possibility is that the previous study (De Dreu et al., 2016) used fewer rounds (5 rounds) than the current study (15 rounds). Another possibility is chance (as the patterns of the other indices, including success rate, within-group variance, and contribution, were consistent with previous findings in De Dreu et al., 2016). This possibility is not unlikely, as we did replicate the De Dreu and colleagues’ findings of decision-protocol on non-contributors in an early independent pilot study with Chinese participants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the same figure, in the Attack group of the Simultaneous and OT condition, did the frequency of Non-contributors increase in rounds in which attacks fail, and did the frequency of Non-contributors decrease when the attack succeeded? The information on the frequency of non-contributors when dividing by attacking success / failure is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We’re very grateful to the reviewer for this thoughtful suggestion. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we conducted further analyses and included the results in the revised manuscript (Results paragraph seven).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) If OT changes the attack efficiency, it is thought that information on how the defense parameter α has a negative regression coefficient to influence the success rate of attack is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this helps to better understand attack efficiency. We thus conducted correlation analyses between the tracking parameter α and success rate, and found that α was not correlated with success rate (r = 0.124; p = 0.276). This suggests that the oxytocin-increased attack efficiency was reflected more in terms of increasing group earnings rather than attack success. This is due to that, in the current game, winning is not necessarily associated with more earnings for attackers (r = 0.065; p = 0.565), as when the defenders contributed a lot to defend (e.g., G<sub>Defender ≥</sub> 30), attackers would gain less even if they win (attack succeeds but earned leftover + spoil &lt; 20 MU) than deciding to not contribute (attack failed but earned 20 MU).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Discussion, the authors discussed one possibility that in-group defense was tacitly well-coordinated because of the stronger alignment of individual interests within defender groups. If this is true, would the results change by modulating the ratio of losing/gaining MU as the results of attach/defense? How did the authors decide the ratio of cost/benefit of the MU after the challenge?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. The point that “in-group defense is tacitly well-coordinated because of the stronger alignment of individual interests within defender groups” is based on the rule of attacker and defender in the current game, as detailed in Table 1. Thus, individuals in the defender group share a stronger common fate in that when in-group defense fails, all group members gain 0 regardless of whether they contributed or not. We agree that different cost/benefit ratios and different losing/gaining ratios can alter investment behavior substantially, both for game-theoretic reasons and because of differential psychological mechanisms coming into play. It may be, though here we have to speculate, that changing the “all-or-nothing” pay-off structure for defenders to a “survive well or less well” structure may provide more room for oxytocin to influence contributions to defense. It would be interesting to examine such possibilities in future research.</p><p>Reviewer #4:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this study, the authors examined the effects of oxytocin administration on a large sample of Chinese men (n = 480) engaged in a three-person monitory game divided to &quot;attackers&quot; and &quot;defenders&quot; where the goal was to evaluate donation to the group monetary pool in relation to the donation of own group and opponent group.</p><p>It was found that oxytocin reduced donation to the group pool in the &quot;attacker&quot; group and increased the &quot;coordination&quot; between the participants' donation, defined as the inter-subject correlation between the parents' contribution. It also increased the &quot;attackers&quot; ability to track the opponents' contribution in sequential trials.</p><p>The large sample size is an asset of the study. It is, to my knowledge, the largest oxytocin administration study conducted so far. The game is complex and so are the statistical analyses.</p><p>The major issue with the study, in my opinion, is whether it measures what it claims to show. It is unclear whether the economical game the authors developed can provide any simulation to real-life battle, &quot;warrior games&quot; or &quot;coordinated action&quot; (the theoretical frame they set for the study), whether inter-subject correlations between monetary contributions of individuals and reduced variance indeed show &quot;group synchrony&quot; in the face of external danger, whether survival has anything to do with the neurobiological processes that underpin this game, and whether there are alternative explanations to the findings that are more plausible and parsimonious (and more consistent with findings from studies on oxytocin administration and economical games).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s careful reading and apt comments regarding the framing of our work. We have taken it to heart and substantially revised the text to avoid off-hand allusions to the battle-field and to keep our revision stays closer to the data; we thank the reviewer for pointing us towards a less florid and more succinct reporting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In terms of &quot;coordinated action&quot; or &quot;behavioral synchrony&quot; among groups, the increased group cohesion in the face of danger, and the rites and rituals group perform before going to battle, these are indeed very powerful mechanisms and are found across human cultures and non-human primates. What is unclear is how coordinated action patterns relate to contributing more or less to the general pool in a sequential economic game. There are ways to measure action coordination in groups, in terms of real action patterns, mimicry, imitation, facial expressions, coordinated movement etc, and the increase in coordination results from various factors in the group, for instance, the presence of a charismatic leader (Gordon, I. Berson, Y. Oxytocin modulates charismatic influence in groups. J Exp Psychol Gen. 2018 Jan;147(1):132-138. doi: 10.1037/xge0000375). It is unclear at all why the authors measure &quot;behavioral synchrony&quot; as the reduced variance among the contributions of members and it is not possible, in my opinion, to simply link this reduced variable to the literature on behavioral synchrony, action coordination, and war rituals without some kind of validation that this reduced variance in the differences of contribution over trials is indeed related to more behavioral coordination. Without such indication, it is not possible to propose that oxytocin, which is indeed a mechanism to enhance coordination of behavior (movements, vocalizations, mimicry) in humans and non-human primates, to the present findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that coordination and synchronization occurs at various levels (neural, behavioral) and we have rewritten our manuscript to be more clear what we meant when referring to coordination – behavioral alignment of contributions to the group pool. Our definition and operationalization stays close to the work in experimental economics and games, and we hope this is now clarified. In addition, we now refrain from using the term synchrony (and also no longer reference war dances and oxytocin-induced neural synchronization studies).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An additional difficulty is the claim that literature on survival is relevant to this game in any way and that playing this game simulates mechanisms of survival. Here, I was unclear about the difference between &quot;attackers&quot; and &quot;defenders&quot; on a biological level. It appears that one group was told that they &quot;attack&quot; something and another that they &quot;defend&quot; something but attack and defend where not part of the ongoing game, even not at the level of a simple board game where there is a simulation of &quot;defending a castle&quot;, but that the real game, for the two groups, was identical was about how to outsmart the other group in terms of donating more or less. The distance between this and proposing that the two groups differ on biological mechanisms is substantial, and must be demonstrated prior to conducting this study. It is more parsimonious (and plausible) to conclude that the mechanisms underpinning this game related more to human competition and are supported by humans' large prefrontal abilities, working memory, and far-sighted planning, and are unrelated to &quot;movement coordination&quot; in the face of a threat to survival. Such mechanisms are likely to be identical for the attackers and defenders (unless otherwise proven) and probably have much less to do with more primitive mechanisms described in the animal literature. For instance, the primate study the authors cite (Summani) showed greater vocal coordination and greater urinary oxytocin in primates during live conflict and is too great a leap to hypothesize from this to reduced variance of donation among players in a safe room. This study also did not differentiate between the behavioral repertoire (and oxytocin production) of attack (where motion and vocal synchrony correlated with oxytocin) and those related to &quot;border patrol&quot;, which suggests that in the animal kingdom, both attack and defense are part of the survival and may not be biologically distinct.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted, we have toned down substantially our reference to these literatures, and we agree that economic contests in which one can end-up victorious over others (and win money), or being defeated by others (and lose one’s money) are hyper-stylized models of attacker-defender conflicts found in real life. Yet at the same time, our work subscribes to a strong line of work, grounded in game-theory and experimental economics, that proceeds on the basis of the assumption that such stylized models of competition and conflict can reveal understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of strategic choices in conflict situations, including the possible neurohormonal substrates of attack and defense.</p><p>We wish to note further that participants were never told to ‘attack’ or ‘defend’. All the experimental instructions used neutral language (e.g., contribution was labeled investment; defense and attack were avoided, and groups were labeled to as group A or B). In contrast, the role of ‘attack’ and ‘defender’ is based on the contest functions in the IADC game (as now detailed in Table 1 in the revision). Individuals in the defender group share a stronger common fate in that when in-group defense fails, all group members gain 0 regardless of whether they contributed or not. Only if defense succeeds, individuals in the defender group ‘survive’ from left with 0. In contrast, attackers can always keep their remaining endowment (leftover) and spoils are additionally added into their earnings if attacks succeed. The working assumption is that these different contest success functions for attacker and defender groups elicit distinctly different social, psychological and, therefore, neurobiological operations that may be informative about “real life” intergroup competition and conflict outside the laboratory. For example, attackers are driven by the motivation to maximize gain and defenders are motivated to avoid loss, thus attack and defense would recruit distinct neurobiological systems (Nelson and Trainor, 2007; Yamagishi and Mifune, 2016). Earlier related work, and the current project, aims to uncover these possibilities. We have revised the manuscript to ensure that unwarranted generalizations are avoided.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The inter-subject correlation – the authors' index for behavioral synchrony – was measured only in the &quot;attacker&quot; group (rationale not clear) but this group also markedly reduced its contribution over time under oxytocin. It is possible that the increase in correlation among group members resulted from that decrease and that the zero donation correlated among the participants (even if we accept the suggestion that this is a proxy for synchrony, it is a synchrony of &quot;no action&quot; rather than of action).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. First, we would like to clarify that the ICC was measured for both attacker and defender groups, not only for attacker group (please see Figure 5—figure supplement 1 in the revision). Second, to examine the interesting possibility that the increased ICC was driven by the number of non-contributing attackers, we calculated the correlation between ICC/within-group variance and the number of non-contributing attackers. If the increases in group coordination were driven by the number of non-contributors, we would see significant correlations between ICC/within-group variance and the number of non-contributing attackers. However, neither the ICC nor the within-group variance was correlated with the number of non-contributors (within-group variance: r =-0.073; p=0.517; ICC: r =-0.146, p=0.197). Thus the increased within-group coordination is not simply driven by the increased number of non-contributors. This null-finding is consistent with our observation that coordination does correlate with attack efficiency (i.e., greater spoils when victorious; more left-overs when attacks failed).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A more parsimonious explanation for the findings – and one that must be ruled out before offering a mechanistic explanation based on rituals and action coordination – would be that oxytocin increased the participants' memory for the sequence of events (there is evidence for oxytocin effects on memory) or that it reduced their level of stress and increased calmness and lethargy (there evidence in both humans and animals) and they reduced their contributions.</p></disp-quote><p>We’re grateful to the reviewer for pointing out other possible explanations of the oxytocin effect (such as the effect of oxytocin on memory or mood). If the observed oxytocin effects on the IADC game were driven by its effect on memory or mood, we would expect similar effects of oxytocin on attacker and defender groups, and similar oxytocin effects for simultaneous and sequential blocks. However, the effects of oxytocin on increased coordination, non-contributor and strategic tracking were modulated by Role and/or Procedure. Specifically, if the oxytocin-increased strategic tracking mainly reflected the effect of oxytocin on improving participants’ working memory of one’s own or in-group members’ or rival’s contributions, we would expect a generic effect of oxytocin on the tracking parameter. However, we showed a significant modulation of Procedure on the oxytocin effect on tracking (as oxytocin only increased attacker’s tracking when decisions were made simultaneously rather than sequentially). In addition, no effect of oxytocin was observed in defender groups’ tracking on rival’s history.</p><p>Regarding the potential explanation of oxytocin effects on reducing stress or increasing calmness, we conducted analysis on the mood changes (please see <italic>SI</italic>). Participants completed the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) upon arrival and after the experiment to quantify their mood changes. PANAS measured both positive and negative mood that related to stress and calmness, such as nervous, distressed, alert, afraid, upset, excited, jittery, active. There was no significant mood change overall and no significant interaction effects with Role or Treatment. We also conducted the paired t-test (before- vs. after-experiment mood) for each group to examine mood change for each group. None of the group showed significant change in positive mood or negative mood (ps &gt; 0.05,Supplementary file 1, Supplementary Tables 1C). Moreover, ANOVAs with Treatment and Role as between-subjects factors on the positive and negative mood changes, as well as overall mood changes, also did not show significant main effects of Treatment and Role, or Treatment x Role interaction (ps &gt; 0.05).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Even within the literature on oxytocin and economic games (which should provide the conceptual frame for this study) the findings need to be reconciled with those showing that individuals donate more under oxytocin. Is this a cultural phenomenon specific to the Chinese culture?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question, and accordingly discussed the effects of oxytocin in the current study and in the oxytocin literature.</p><p>The variable nature of oxytocin effects on prosociality has been increasingly recognized in the oxytocin literature. Oxytocin does not simply and always promote prosociality, it has been implicated in many social behaviors, from promoting trust, generosity and cooperation (Aydogan et al., 2017; Arueti et al., 2013; Yan et al., 2018) to aggravating envy, mistrust and aggressive behavior (Ne'eman et al., 2016; Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2009; Radke et al., 2012). The seemingly contradictory oxytocin effects may be moderated by individual and contextual differences, with group context as one prominent candidate (De Dreu et al., 2010; 2011; Ma et al., 2015; De Dreu and Kret, 2016).</p><p>The current findings of oxytocin-increased group coordination, non-contributing attacker and tracking on rival’s history were consistent with the oxytocin literature that showed the effect of oxytocin on facilitating group-serving bias (De Dreu and Kret, 2016; De Dreu, et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2015), on increasing behavioral coordination and neural synchronization (Arueti et al., 2013; Mu et al., 2016), on promoting social learning and cognitive flexibility (Ma et al., 2016a; Sala, et al., 2011), and increasing salience of social feedback (Shamay-Tsoory, et al., 2016). In the revision we note and reference these literatures. While we believe we provide a nuanced review, we would be happy to further include references to studies the reviewer believes are critical to cite too.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another important issue is the between-subject design, which is not the golden standard in oxytocin administration research. Particularly in relation to economic games, a recent study showed different brain activation patterns in a within- and between-subject design in an OT administration study using the prisoner's dilemma (Chen X, Gautam P, Haroon E, Rilling JK Within vs. between-subject effects of intranasal oxytocin on the neural response to cooperative and non-cooperative social interactions. Psychoneuroendocrinology. 2017 78:22-30. doi: 10.1016/j.psyneuen. 2017.01.006). At least, the authors should describe how randomization was conducted and show extensive comparisons among groups not only in demographics but also in relevant physiological variables (for instance, BMI).</p></disp-quote><p>We beg to disagree with the reviewer that between-subjects designs are deviating from the golden standard in oxytocin studies, and believe biases in randomization cannot account for our results. First, we now described the randomization procedure more fully (subsection “Procedure”), emphasizing that participants were measured not only on demographics, but also on current mood and psychological variables. We showed that individuals in the four groups (Attacker/Defender x Oxytocin/Placebo) did not differ in demographic information, mood change, and prosocial-related traits (Supplementary file 1. Supplementary Tables 1A, 1B). Second, several meta-analysis studies have summarized the behavioral (Van IJzendoorn, Bakermans-Kranenburg, 2012; Shahrestani, et al., 2013) and neural (Wang, et al., 2017) effects of oxytocin. For example, in the meta-analysis of oxytocin behavioral effects (van IJzendoorn and Bakermans-Kranenburg, 2012, Table 1), among the 31 studies examining the effects of intranasal oxytocin on face recognition, trust to in-group, and trust to out-group members, 10 studies adopted within-subjects design whereas the majority (i.e., 21 studies) employed between-subjects designs for oxytocin and placebo administration. Shahrestani and colleague summarized 7 studies examining effects of intranasal oxytocin on emotion and face recognition, all of which employed between-subjects design (Shahrestani, et al., 2013). Similarly, we summarized the neural effects of intranasal oxytocin in our recent meta-analysis of oxytocin-fMRI studies published before March 2017 (Wang et al., 2017). There were 50 fMRI studies intranasally administering oxytocin in healthy individuals, of which 29 employed between-subject design (21 studies employed within-subject design, Table S1 in Wang et al., 2017). We believe that between-subject designs is often used and producing reliable and replicable results for the oxytocin/placebo contrast, as we found here too.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In sum, the authors have collected an impressive sample and the study is complex and well-analyzed. The conceptual frame should fit the study design and alternative explanation must be carefully considered before contribution of the findings can be considered.

The study does not measure behavioral synchrony under conflict and there is a great gap between measuring the degree of sameness in how much individuals contributed (or didn’t contribute) and the survival evolutionary frame, war rituals, and action coordination the authors invoke to support the findings. In the current frame and design, the conclusions are misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope that our revisions clarify what we did, and what we can conclude from our results.
