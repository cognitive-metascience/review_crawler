through allostery, and it is increasingly clear that chemically distinct agonists can produce different receptor-based effects. It has been proposed that agonists selectively promote receptors to recruit one cellular interacting partner over another, introducing allosteric ‘bias’ into the signaling system. However, the underlying hypothesis - that different agonists drive GPCRs to engage different cytoplasmic proteins in living cells - remains untested due to the complexity of readouts through which receptor-proximal interactions are typically inferred. We describe a cell-based assay to overcome this challenge, based on GPCR-interacting biosensors that are disconnected from endogenous transduction mechanisms. Focusing on opioid receptors, we directly demonstrate differences between biosensor recruitment produced by chemically distinct opioid ligands in living cells. We then show that selective recruitment applies to GRK2, a biologically relevant GPCR regulator, through discrete interactions of GRK2 with receptors or with G protein beta-gamma subunits which are differentially promoted by agonists.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>About a third of all drugs work by targeting a group of proteins known as G-protein coupled receptors, or GPCRs for short. These receptors are found on the surface of cells and transmit messages across the cell’s outer barrier. When a signaling molecule, like a hormone, is released in the body, it binds to a GPCR and changes the receptor’s shape. The change in structure affects how the GPCR interacts and binds to other proteins on the inside of the cell, triggering a series of reactions that alter the cell’s activity.</p><p>Scientists have previously seen that a GPCR can trigger different responses depending on which signaling molecule is binding on the surface of the cell. However, the mechanism for this is unknown. One hypothesis is that different signaling molecules change the GPCR’s preference for binding to different proteins on the inside of the cell. The challenge has been to observe this happening without interfering with the process.</p><p>Stoeber et al. have now tested this idea by attaching fluorescent tags to proteins that bind to activated GPCRs directly and without binding other signaling proteins. This meant these proteins could be tracked under a microscope as they made their way to bind to the GPCRs. Stoeber et al. focused on one particular GPCR, known as the opioid receptor, and tested the binding of two different opioid signaling molecules, etorphine and Dynorphin A.</p><p>The experiments revealed that the different opioids did affect which of the engineered proteins would preferentially bind to the opioid receptor. This was followed by a similar experiment, where the engineered proteins were replaced with another protein called GRK2, which binds to the opioid receptor under normal conditions in the cell. This showed that GRK2 binds much more strongly to the opioid receptor when Dynorphin A is added compared to adding etorphine.</p><p>These findings show that GPCRs can not only communicate that a signaling molecule is binding but can respond differently to convey what molecule it is more specifically. This could be important in developing drugs, particularly to specifically trigger the desired response and reduce side effects. Stoeber et al. suggest that an important next step for research is to understand how the GPCRs preferentially bind to different proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>GPCR</kwd><kwd>opioid</kwd><kwd>biosensor</kwd><kwd>receptor kinase</kwd><kwd>agonist bias</kwd><kwd>TIRF</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA010711</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Von Zastrow</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA012864</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Von Zastrow</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OD023048</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manglik</surname><given-names>Aashish</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM130142</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lambert</surname><given-names>Nevin A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P300PA_164712</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stoeber</surname><given-names>Miriam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PCEFP3_181282</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stoeber</surname><given-names>Miriam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005148</institution-id><institution>Sears</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manglik</surname><given-names>Aashish</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21DA045884</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Majumdar</surname><given-names>Susruta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Chemically distinct opioid ligands promote selective protein recruitment by opioid receptors in intact cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise nature’s largest family of signaling receptors and an important class of therapeutic drug targets. GPCRs signal by allostery, and were considered for many years to operate as binary switches that bind to cognate transducer and regulator proteins in a single agonist-induced activated state. Over the past decade an expanded view has taken hold, supported by accumulating in vitro evidence that GPCRs are conformationally flexible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lohse and Hofmann, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mahoney and Sunahara, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nygaard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weis and Kobilka, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wingler et al., 2019</xref>) and a confluence of cell biological and in vivo evidence supporting the existence of functionally selective agonist effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Urban et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Williams et al., 2013</xref>). According to this still-evolving view, agonists have the potential to promote GPCRs to selectively recruit one transducer or regulator protein over another, introducing bias into the signaling cascade at a receptor-proximal level that is either propagated downstream or eliminated during intermediate transduction steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tsvetanova et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Opioid receptors provide a representative example. Interest in selective agonist effects at these GPCRs dates back to the initial demonstration that opioid receptors can be activated by diverse peptide and non-peptide agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kosterlitz and Hughes, 1977</xref>). Early experimental evidence for such selectivity among ligands emerged from the observation of an agonist-induced state of opioid receptors in neuroblastoma cells that discriminates between opioid peptides and opiate alkaloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Von Zastrow et al., 1993</xref>). This was followed by the demonstration of agonist-selective control of opioid receptor endocytosis, leading to the identification of functional selectivity among agonists defined by differences in relative ability to drive receptor engagement of G protein relative to beta-arrestin-dependent cellular pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keith et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Keith et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Whistler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Whistler and von Zastrow, 1998</xref>). This concept further evolved to the present view of biased receptor recruitment of G proteins relative to beta-arrestins, with receptor-proximal selectivity calculated by fitting quantitative measures of downstream pathway or protein response to operational models of receptor-effector coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schmid et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Two key gaps persist in our present understanding. First, selective protein recruitment by GPCRs in intact cells remains largely calculated rather than directly observed. Accordingly, the understanding of receptor-proximal agonist bias is inherently limited by assumptions of the model used to calculate it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kenakin, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klein Herenbrink et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, and despite intense efforts motivated by interest in the therapeutic impact of biased agonist effects at opioid receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schmid et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Whistler et al., 1999</xref>), significant challenges remain in reliably assessing selectivity of receptor-proximal protein recruitment based on downstream cell-based readouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conibear and Kelly, 2019</xref>). Second, challenges can arise even using cell-based assays that are direct. For example, multiple methods have been developed to detect GPCR interaction with beta-arrestins in intact cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). However, this binding involves multiple biochemical steps and, in particular, it typically requires the receptor to undergo prior agonist-induced phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eichel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gurevich et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thomsen et al., 2016</xref>). This has been clearly established for opioid receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Whistler and von Zastrow, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>), for which full interaction with beta-arrestin requires the receptor to be phosphorylated at multiple sites in the cytoplasmic tail through a defined sequence of agonist-dependent reactions which are catalyzed by distinct GPCR kinase (GRK) isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chiu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Just et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miess et al., 2018</xref>). Accordingly, beta-arrestin recruitment measured in such assays clearly reflects a process that is considerably more complex than allosteric selection by the receptor.</p><p>Here we describe an alternative approach to address these knowledge gaps. We delineate a cell-based method to simply assess selective protein recruitment by opioid receptors at the receptor-proximal level, taking advantage of two engineered protein folds established to bind agonist-activated GPCRs in intact cells without requiring or engaging other known cellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stoeber et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wan et al., 2018</xref>). Using these engineered proteins comparatively as orthogonal receptor-interaction biosensors, we directly demonstrate selectivity in receptor-proximal protein recruitment elicited by various opioid agonists in living cells. We then show how the principle of receptor-proximal protein selection applies in a more complex manner to GRK2, a biologically relevant regulator.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Comparative detection of direct protein recruitment by opioid receptors in living cells</title><p>Two agonist-activated opioid receptor complexes have been described in structural detail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), one bound to a nucleotide-free G protein heterotrimer and another to an active state-stabilizing nanobody (Nb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koehl et al., 2018</xref>). The receptor conformation resolved in each complex is similar but not identical, with Nb and G protein interactions involving distinct molecular contacts on cytoplasmic domains of the receptor. Nbs are inherently orthogonal to intracellular biochemistry but heterotrimeric G proteins engage multiple cellular proteins in addition to activated receptors. Thus we focused on mini-G (mG) proteins, engineered versions of the Ras-like domain of G protein alpha subunits which bind directly to activated GPCRs but are not known to engage other cellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nehmé et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wan et al., 2018</xref>).

For a Nb probe we selected Nb33, previously used to detect activated mu (MOR) and delta (DOR) opioid receptors in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stoeber et al., 2018</xref>). Nb33 shares receptor contact residues with Nb39, a close analog that has been resolved at high resolution in complex with activated MOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2015</xref>) and in a similar complex with activated kappa opioid receptor (KOR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Che et al., 2018</xref>). Because cytoplasmic residues contacted by the Nb in these structures are largely distinct from those engaged by the G protein alpha-5 helix, we reasoned that the Nb-derived sensor has the potential to provide different allosteric information.</p><p>Fluorescent protein fusions of mGsi or Nb33 localized diffusely when expressed in the cytoplasm of HEK293 cells, and recruitment by receptors was monitored using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIR-FM) in cells co-expressing Flag-tagged KOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Importantly, HEK293 cells do not express endogenous opioid receptors or other opioid ligand binding sites, thereby providing a null genetic background on which to directly examine protein probe recruitment mediated specifically by the co-expressed receptor. We observed rapid and robust recruitment of mGsi by KOR upon application of the kappa-selective peptide agonist Dynorphin A (DynA, Dynorphin 1–17). Recruitment of mGsi was reversible because application of the high-affinity competitive KOR antagonist 5’GNTI resulted in rapid redistribution of the biosensor back to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, mGs was not detectably recruited in response to KOR activation by DynA using the same assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), verifying assay specificity and that mGsi recruitment is driven primarily by the Gi-derived distal C-terminus. Further, we verified that agonist-induced recruitment of mGsi occurred separately from a change in surface expression of KOR, which was monitored in parallel using anti-Flag antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Nb33 was also rapidly recruited in response to KOR activation by DynA using the same experimental protocol, and this recruitment was also reversible upon antagonist application and occurred without a detectable change in surface receptor expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Accordingly, both mGsi and Nb33 can be used as biosensors of ligand-dependent recruitment by KOR in living cells using the TIR-FM assay, and both sensors produce a reversible recruitment signal that is sufficiently robust and fast (t<sub>1/2</sub>&lt; 30 s) to enable reliable detection of protein recruitment without possible complications of later receptor trafficking.</p><p>We next tested two non-peptide KOR full agonists, U69593 (U69) and U50488 (U50). We generated concentration-response curves by increasing agonist concentration in a stepwise manner and then adding DynA in excess (10 μM) at the end of each series as an internal reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). Both Nb33 and mGsi were robustly recruited in a concentration-dependent manner in response to DynA and both of the non-peptide full agonist drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–K</xref>), consistent with the previously established pharmacology of these compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DiMattio et al., 2015</xref>), but we also noted that the concentration-response relationship for mGsi recruitment was consistently left-shifted relative to Nb33. These results demonstrate that both Nb33 and mGsi are robustly recruited by KOR after activation by peptide and non-peptide full agonists in living cells, but with a potency shift indicating that the interactions are not identical.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Agonist-selective recruitment of engineered protein probes</title><p>We then applied the same approach to investigate the effect of the alkaloid agonist etorphine (ET) on mGsi and Nb33 recruitment by KOR. ET is an opiate alkaloid drug that is structurally distinct from opioid peptides as well as from U50 and U69. ET efficaciously promotes G protein activation and signaling but has long been recognized to drive KOR internalization and phosphorylation poorly, supporting its classification as a G protein-biased agonist by operational criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DiMattio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jordan et al., 2000</xref>). ET behaved as a potent but partial agonist in the mGsi recruitment assay, producing a maximum biosensor recruitment response reaching 67% of that produced by DynA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and D</xref>). Remarkably, ET produced little or no recruitment of Nb33 despite a robust response to DynA verified in each assay and in the same cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and E</xref>). This lack of Nb33 recruitment was evident even at very high concentrations of ET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>), in contrast to mGsi that was potently recruited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>). Further verifying this difference, selective recruitment of mGsi relative to Nb33 was observed when the biosensors were tagged with distinct fluorophores, co-expressed, and imaged in parallel in the same cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Again, mGsi was potently recruited in response to ET but Nb33 was not, despite DynA producing strong recruitment of both probes and in the same cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

An alternative possibility is that agonists produce differential probe recruitment as a secondary consequence of agonist-selective post-translational modifications of the receptor. In particular, because agonist-induced internalization of KOR requires multi-site phosphorylation on its cytoplasmic tail, and ET is known to stimulate this phosphorylation less strongly than DynA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), we considered the possibility that differential biosensor recruitment occurs secondarily to differential phosphorylation. To test this, we measured biosensor recruitment by a mutant KOR lacking all relevant phosphorylation sites in the cytoplasmic tail (KOR-TPD for ‘total phosphorylation defective’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). The pronounced difference in mGsi relative to Nb33 recruitment was still observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I and J</xref>). Independently verifying this, selective probe recruitment by wild type KOR was not detectably perturbed in the presence of Compound101 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>), a chemical inhibitor of GRK2/3 activity known to strongly reduce KOR phosphorylation in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chiu et al., 2017</xref>). Together, these results support the hypothesis that selective recruitment of mG relative to Nb probes occurs as a primary consequence of allosteric protein selection at the receptor, rather than a secondary effect of differential phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Agonist-selective probe recruitment is not restricted to KOR</title><p>We next asked if our experimental strategy can also detect differential protein recruitment by MOR. Nb33 is already known to be recruited by agonist-activated MORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stoeber et al., 2018</xref>), and we verified that this is also the case for mGsi. DAMGO, a peptide full agonist of MOR, produced rapid and robust recruitment of mGsi that was rapidly reversed by the competitive antagonist naloxone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Similar to what was observed for recruitment of the engineered protein probes by KOR, the concentration-response relationship for recruitment of mGsi by DAMGO was left-shifted relative to Nb33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). ET (also an agonist of MOR) promoted recruitment of both probes by MOR, and to the same maximum degree when compared to the peptide full agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This contrasts with partial recruitment of mGsi and no detectable recruitment of Nb33 by KOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), indicating that differential recruitment of the engineered protein probes by opioid receptors is both agonist-dependent and receptor subtype-specific.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Agonist-selective protein probe recruitment by MOR.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 7 min kymograph traced inside a cell expressing Venus-mGsi, mCherry-Nb33, and FLAG-MOR (labeled with anti-FLAG M1-AF647) and treated with increasing concentrations of DAMGO (agonist), followed by addition of Naloxone (antagonist).

Both of these non-peptide drugs are partial agonists with respect to assays of G protein activation or signaling, but each is derived from a different chemical scaffold and differs in degree of bias estimated using a beta-arrestin recruitment assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Manglik et al., 2016</xref>). Using the same experimental protocol, and comparing recruitment promoted by the test ligand relative to the peptide full agonist (DAMGO) reference, both morphine and PZM21 produced partial recruitment of mGsi as well as Nb33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). Whereas morphine and PZM21 were similar in the degree of mGsi recruitment that they produced at saturating concentration, morphine was found to be significantly more efficacious than PZM21 in recruiting Nb33. Together, these results reveal a range of selective protein recruitment effects among chemically diverse MOR partial agonists.</p><p>The experimental strategy used to compare test agonist effects relative to the peptide reference was robust in practice but, in principle, it could underestimate differences relative to the reference peptide if the test agonist dissociates slowly or has an on-rate much faster than the peptide reference. We found evidence for this when evaluating another chemically distinct MOR partial agonist, the semi-synthetic natural product mitragynine pseudoindoxyl (MP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Váradi et al., 2016</xref>). Using the sequential agonist addition protocol, MP appeared to be similarly efficacious to DAMGO in promoting recruitment of mGsi because no further increase was elicited by subsequent addition of DAMGO while, in contrast, MP failed to produce any detectable recruitment of Nb33. However, we noted that DAMGO also failed to promote recruitment of Nb33 in cells that were previously exposed to MP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), despite DAMGO promoting a strong Nb33 recruitment response in cells not previously exposed to MP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Adding a perfusion wash step, in order to remove excess test agonist between applications, avoided this complication. With this modification, MP was verified to indeed promote mGsi recruitment by MOR, but to a significantly reduced maximal degree relative to DAMGO and without promoting detectable recruitment of Nb33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>). These results further expand the range of differential protein recruitment effects documented among chemically diverse MOR agonists.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Differential protein recruitment can be elicited by diverse opioid agonists</title><p>To simplify comparison across agonists and receptors, we defined the maximum recruitment response elicited by each agonist compared to the corresponding peptide full agonist reference (DynA for KOR and DAMGO for MOR) as a relative ‘intrinsic activity’ for each agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We then plotted these relative values for each biosensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Some non-peptide agonists were indistinguishable from the reference peptide by this analysis, recruiting both protein probes to a similar maximal degree (corresponding to an ‘I.A.’ value of 1 for both probes), but others departed from the diagonal. This is not consistent with the traditional concept of partial agonism based on a unitary agonist-induced receptor ‘on’ state, which would predict the recruitment responses elicited by all agonists to fall along the diagonal. Rather, the present results support the view that opioid receptors are more flexibly activated, enabling them to selectively recruit one interaction probe over another in living cells.

Accordingly, we next asked if agonist-selective protein recruitment applies to a physiologically relevant GPCR-interacting protein. We focused on GRK2 because this kinase is known to be important for generating agonist-selective patterns of multi-site phosphorylation in the MOR cytoplasmic tail, which convey biased effects downstream from the receptor by distinguishing engagement of beta-arrestins and regulating receptor entry into the endocytic network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Just et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lau et al., 2011</xref>).

We focused on comparing the effects of ET relative to DynA on KOR because these agonist-receptor pairs appeared to differ most dramatically based on the orthogonal biosensor recruitment assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). DynA promoted rapid, concentration-dependent recruitment of GRK2 to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) while ET, despite being highly potent, produced a degree of GRK2 recruitment clearly lower than that produced by DynA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). This difference was not a secondary effect of receptor phosphorylation because ET also produced less maximal GRK2 recruitment than DynA using the phosphorylation-defective mutant KOR-TPD in place of KOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>).</p><p>Although ET promoted recruitment of full-length GRK2 less strongly than DynA, these agonists produced similarly strong recruitment of a probe corresponding to the isolated C-terminal PH domain from GRK2 that interacts with G beta-gamma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). This suggested that GRK2 binding to G beta-gamma subunits, enabled by G protein activation triggered by either agonist, is responsible for partial recruitment promoted by ET. We independently verified this conclusion by returning to assay of full length tagged GRK2, and testing the effect of blocking Gi activation by pre-exposing cells to pertussis toxin (PTX). In this condition, ET failed to produce any detectable recruitment of GRK2. However, as expected, DynA still produced a significant recruitment response in the same cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), but to a reduced degree relative to the recruitment response elicited by DynA in cells not previously exposed to pertussis toxin.</p><p>The above results indicate that ET and DynA share the ability to promote GRK2 recruitment to the plasma membrane via binding G beta-gamma, and that DynA engages an additional mode of binding that is separate from the G protein and not shared with ET. We hypothesized that this interaction occurs with the activated opioid receptor itself. In order to test this, we devised an assay to resolve GRK2 recruitment to the plasma membrane from GRK2 binding directly to the receptor. To do so, we clustered receptors on the cell surface using an antibody cross-linking protocol, forming clusters that appeared in TIRF images as discrete spots of laterally concentrated KOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>, ‘KOR’ panels). We then used this characteristic appearance to distinguish GRK2 recruitment to KOR-containing clusters from recruitment to the surrounding plasma membrane separately from KOR clusters. As expected, in the absence of agonist GRK2 was primarily distributed in the cytosol and not detectably associated with KOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> left, ‘GRK2’ panel). Within ~1 min after application of DynA, GRK2 specifically accumulated at the KOR-containing clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> right). In contrast, application of ET produced a diffuse increase in GRK2 fluorescence at the plasma membrane but no specific accumulation at KOR-containing clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Quantification of the GRK2 intensity in KOR clusters relative to the surrounding plasma membrane verified significant accumulation of GRK2 with receptors promoted by DynA but not ET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), despite both agonists promoting diffuse membrane recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These results support a model of GRK2 engagement driven by discrete biochemical modes which are differentially regulated by agonists: DynA and ET share the ability to promote GRK2 recruitment to the plasma membrane via receptor-activated G beta-gamma, but DynA is different from ET in its ability to additionally promote GRK2 recruitment by binding directly to KOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Agonist-selective modes of GRK2 recruitment by KOR.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of receptor clustering in the plasma membrane using cross-linking by polyclonal antibody.

The present study describes a direct, reductionist approach to this problem based on the application of engineered proteins that bind activated receptors but are not known to bind other cellular proteins. We show that agonists differ in relative ability to drive recruitment of the engineered probes to opioid receptors in living cells, and then delineate how the principle of agonist-selective recruitment applies to GRK2 as a physiologically relevant regulator.</p><p>Our results indicate that selective recruitment of one cellular protein over another not only occurs in intact cells, but it is widespread and elicited by diverse agonists. All partial agonists examined were found to promote mGsi recruitment more strongly than Nb33 when present at saturating concentration. Further, concentration-response curves for mGsi relative to Nb33 recruitment by opioid receptors were left-shifted even for peptide full agonists. The allosteric nature of GPCR activation is well established, and has been recognized since early studies of receptor coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Lean et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maguire et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Strachan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sunahara and Insel, 2016</xref>). The present results are fully consistent with this concept, and expand it by providing clear biochemical evidence for discrete protein-engaged receptor states that can be selectively produced by diverse agonists in the complex environment of intact, living cells. The engineered interaction probes that we focused on here demonstrate such an additional level of allosteric selection most simply, but our results delineating differential recruitment of GRK2 by receptors suggest that the same principle applies in a more complex manner to biologically relevant GPCR-interacting proteins.</p><p>In its present state of development, our approach is limited by the number of orthogonal probes available for assessing protein recruitment. We focused here on two previously validated GPCR-interacting proteins, selected based on existing biophysical evidence that each recognizes different structural features of the activated receptor. It is possible, and we think likely, that still more specificity exists in receptor-proximal protein recruitment. In future studies it will be interesting to develop or adapt additional structurally diverse protein folds to address this question, and to explore additional agonist diversity using the existing probes. For example, it will be interesting to determine if ligands can be found that promote recruitment of Nb33 preferentially to mGsi.</p><p>An important next step is to delineate the biophysical basis for the observed selectivity of protein recruitment induced by opioid agonists, with differential effects of DynA and ET on Nb33 recruitment to KOR providing a striking example. The present results clearly indicate that the complexes responsible for agonist-selective protein recruitment must be distinct, but leave unresolved the nature of the distinction. One possibility is that distinct allosteric complexes reflect unique conformational ensembles of the receptor. Although currently available structural data for KOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Che et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wu et al., 2012</xref>) preclude direct assessment of such conformational differences, prior structures of MOR in complex with either Nb39 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2015</xref>) (a close analog of Nb33) or heterotrimeric Gi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koehl et al., 2018</xref>) offer some insight. Both Nb39 and Gi alpha stabilize an active MOR conformation in the intracellular domain; however, the precise conformation of the MOR intracellular loop 3 (ICL3) differs between the two structures. Thus, differential recruitment of Nb33 and mGsi may reflect agonist-selective stabilization of distinct active receptor conformations. Alternatively, agonists may promote receptors to adopt similar active conformations, and distinctions in the kinetics of sensor binding, sensor concentration, and/or sensor affinity contribute to differential recruitment. Future studies, combining biophysical and cell biological approaches, will be needed to answer this question. We also note that these classes of mechanism are not mutually exclusive, and think it is likely that both contribute to agonist-selective allosteric effects observed in intact cells.</p><p>It will be particularly interesting to extend the present approach toward examining kinetic aspects of selective protein recruitment by receptors. We found that the orthogonal probes produce a time-invariant recruitment response within ~30 s after agonist application. This enables the approach to be used as an end-point assay scalable to a drug screening platform, and we focused on steady state recruitment values in the present work for simplicity. However, in light of clear and long-standing evidence for kinetic differences in agonist action at GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klein Herenbrink et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Swaminath et al., 2004</xref>), we anticipate that time-dependent analysis of probe recruitment will provide additional insight into selectivity among agonists.</p><p>In sum, and viewed more broadly, the present results reinforce an emerging understanding that GPCRs operate as allosteric machines with the potential to communicate significantly more information about local chemical environment than the mere presence or absence of a cognate agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Costa-Neto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kenakin, 2019</xref>). We propose from the present observations that the mGsi probe reports allosteric effects relevant to G protein engagement by opioid receptors, and that the Nb probe reports additional effects relevant to GRK engagement. Our results further support the hypothesis that agonist bias, now generally defined by operational criteria, can be deconvolved into discrete receptor-proximal molecular selection events. The present study makes initial inroads toward decoding this underlying ‘machine language’ of GPCR signaling, and thus toward precisely delineating how much chemical information content receptors actually convey physiologically.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (human, female)</td><td>HEK293</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CRL-1573;

directly to opioid receptors, both kappa and mu subtypes. The two engineered molecules, Nb33 and mGsi, have been previously well characterized and are used as surrogates for GRK and G-beta-gamma proteins. The results show that different opioid agonists differentially recruit the receptor association of the two sensor molecules independently of downstream signaling. These results are of considerable interest and constitute a major advance in our ability to understand GPCR signalling.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Agonist-selective recruitment of engineered protein probes and of GRK2 by opioid receptors in living cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Volker Dötsch as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: John T Williams (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript is well written and the work well executed, with many controls reported. Only one minor comment was raised during the discussion.</p><p>The only further and useful addition would be a consideration of the proposed structural changes induced by the different agonists in the Discussion section. Since crystal structures are known, some speculation about the differently activated states would add a mechanistic/structural component to the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54208.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript is well written and the work well executed, with many controls reported.

More specifically, available structures of MOR in complex with either nanobody or heterotrimeric Gi show differences in the conformation of intracellular loop 3 (ICL3). Therefore, differential recruitment of Nb and mGsi may reflect agonist-selective stabilization of distinct active receptor conformations, possibly involving distinct ICL3 arrangements.</p><p>Second, we outline the possibility that agonists may promote receptors to adopt similar conformations but that distinct sensor characteristics (kinetics of sensor binding, sensor concentration, and/or sensor affinity) contribute to the differential recruitment.</p><p>We think it is likely that both mechanisms contribute to the agonist-selective allosteric effects that we observe in intact cells and may similarly be used by endogenous GPCR interaction partners.</p></body></sub-article></article>
