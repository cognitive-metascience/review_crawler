RcsF exists in complexes with β-barrel proteins (OMPs) allowing it to adopt a transmembrane orientation with a lipidated N-terminal domain on the cell surface and a periplasmic C-terminal domain. Here we report that mutations that remove BamE or alter a residue in the RcsF trans-lumen domain specifically prevent assembly of the interlocked complexes without inactivating either RcsF or the OMP. Using these mutations we demonstrate that these RcsF/OMP complexes are required for sensing OM outer leaflet stress. Using mutations that alter the positively charged surface-exposed domain, we show that RcsF monitors lateral interactions between lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules. When these interactions are disrupted by cationic antimicrobial peptides, or by the loss of negatively charged phosphate groups on the LPS molecule, this information is transduced to the RcsF C-terminal signaling domain located in the periplasm to activate the stress response.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15276.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15276.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15276.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many disease-causing bacteria have an outer membrane that surrounds and protects the cell, while many hosts of these bacteria produce molecules called antimicrobial peptides that disrupt this outer membrane.

LPS is a glycolipid that consists of three domains: lipid A, the core and the O-antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raetz and Whitfield, 2002</xref>). Several sugars in lipid A and the core are phosphorylated conferring negative charge to the LPS molecule. In the OM, these negatively charged groups are bridged by divalent cations, which help to establish strong lateral interactions between LPS molecules. In addition to stabilizing the OM, these lateral interactions contribute to the unique barrier properties of the OM making it impermeable to hydrophobic compounds, detergents and dyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nikaido, 2003</xref>). The OM also protects Gram-negatives from the host innate immunity factors and antibiotics limiting their effectiveness. In order to disrupt the OM, many organisms produce cationic antibacterial peptides (CAMPs) that bind LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hancock and Diamond, 2000</xref>). As a result of this binding, the OM is permeabilized and this not only facilitates further uptake of the CAMPs but also sensitizes Gram-negatives to antibiotics and host-factors, including lysozyme. For this reason, several CAMPs are “last hope” antibiotics against antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Because of the importance of OM integrity and barrier function for survival, Gram-negative bacteria have developed several envelope stress responses to monitor and combat environmental insults. One such envelope response, Rcs (Regulator of Capsule Synthesis), is activated strongly by OM and PG stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Majdalani and Gottesman, 2005</xref>). Rcs controls the expression of capsule exopolysaccharides that are exported to the cell surface and help to stabilize the OM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gottesman et al., 1985</xref>). In addition, Rcs downregulates flagella expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Francez-Charlot et al., 2003</xref>), shifting bacteria from planktonic to a biofilm growth mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferrières and Clarke, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Latasa et al., 2012</xref>), which is often associated with further increased resistance. Rcs is conserved in <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> and, for many enteric pathogens, it is important for virulence and/or survival in the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Erickson and Detweiler, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hinchliffe et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Rcs is one of the most complex signal transduction pathways in bacteria involving at least seven proteins in four different cellular compartments. RcsF is an OM lipoprotein that acts as a sensory component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Majdalani and Gottesman, 2005</xref>). Unlike most lipoproteins in <italic>E. coli</italic>, RcsF is anchored to the outer leaflet of the OM by its lipid moiety and contains an N-terminal domain that is surface exposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Konovalova et al., 2014</xref>). The short, hydrophilic transmembrane domain of RcsF is threaded through the lumen of β-barrel proteins (OMPs) exposing the C-terminal signaling domain in the periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Konovalova et al., 2014</xref>). The inner membrane (IM) protein RcsC is a hybrid histidine kinase, which autophosphorylates and passes the phosphate through the IM phosphotransferase protein RcsD to a cytoplasmic DNA-binding response regulator RcsB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stout and Gottesman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takeda et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Majdalani and Gottesman, 2007</xref>). RcsB, either alone or in combination with other regulators, such as RcsA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stout et al., 1991</xref>), BglJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Venkatesh et al., 2010</xref>) or GadE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krin et al., 2010</xref>) regulates expression of target genes. In addition, IM protein IgaA negatively regulates the activity of RcsC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Domínguez-Bernal et al., 2004</xref>). Based on genetic analysis as well as some interaction studies it has been proposed that RcsF can interact directly with the periplasmic domain of IgaA to alleviate inhibition of RcsC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Domínguez-Bernal et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Although the signal transduction pathway itself is reasonably well characterized, how RcsF senses the many different envelope defects that induce this system remain poorly understood. The fact that LPS is found exclusively in the outer leaflet of the OM and that RcsF is required to sense LPS structural defects prompted us to search for a surface-exposed domain. Our discovery that RcsF exists in a transmembrane complex with OMPs suggested that this interlocked structure is required for sensing the LPS defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Konovalova et al., 2014</xref>). However, another study, which focused primarily on Rcs activated by PG stress caused by A22 or mecillinam treatment, proposed a model in which the RcsF/OMP complex has no function in RcsF sensing and signaling and only serves an inhibitory role during steady state growth. This model was based on the observation that Rcs induction by A22 depends on newly synthesized RcsF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we show that the RcsF/OMP complex is functional and that LPS defects are sensed directly by the surface-exposed domain of RcsF.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Low levels of polymyxin B cause a specific OM defect</title><p>Several mutations in the LPS biosynthesis pathway that result in the production of LPS molecules with altered structure are known to activate Rcs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parker et al., 1992</xref>). However, the use of chemical inducers avoids phenotypic adaptation and enables kinetic analysis, which can provide important insights. Therefore, we sought a small molecule that could be used to test the function of RcsF/OMP complexes in sensing LPS perturbations.</p><p>Polymyxin B (PMB) is a CAMP with bactericidal activity and its mechanism of action is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Daugelavicius et al., 2000</xref>). When used at the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC, 2–8 µg/ml), PMB binds to LPS and destabilizes the OM outer leaflet resulting in marked increase in OM permeability. When cells are incubated with much higher concentrations of PMB, it can also integrate into the IM causing a lethal disruption of the membrane potential. PMB is a known RcsF-dependent inducer of the Rcs pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farris et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In the following experiments, we used 0.5 µg /ml PMB to treat cells in mid-log phase (OD600 of 0.5, 5*10<sup>8</sup> cells/ml). At this cell density, the MIC of PMB was determined to be 8 µg /ml. Therefore, the concentration of PMB we used to induce the Rcs system is more than 10 fold below the MIC value and growth is not affected under these conditions.</p><p>We confirmed that 0.5 µg/ml PMB causes OM, but not IM, stress in our strain background using two routine assays developed to study the effect of CAMPs on the bacterial envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Loh et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu et al., 1999</xref>). The NPN (1-N-phenylnaphthylamine) uptake assay is used to quantitatively monitor OM permeability caused by CAMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Loh et al., 1984</xref>). NPN is an environmentally sensitive fluorescent dye that fluoresces in the membrane environment but not in solution. Due to its hydrophobic nature, it cannot penetrate Gram-negative OM due to the presence of LPS. However, when CAMPs compromise the OM, NPN enters the cell and integrates into membranes resulting in an increase in fluorescence. When mid-log cells were incubated with 0.5 µg /ml PMB we observed only a small increase in fluorescence, about 1.5 fold, compared to a 6-fold increase when cell were treated with 8 µg /ml PMB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15276.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PMB causes a specific OM defect.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PMB at 0.5 µg/ml causes a slight OM permeability defect based on increased uptake and fluorescence of NPN dye.

DiSC3(5) accumulates in the IM in a proton motive force (PMF)-dependent manner, where it self-quenches the fluorescence. However, when PMF is compromised, diSC3(5) is released from the IM resulting in increased fluorescence. We treated diSC3(5) -labeled cells with 0.5 µg /ml PMB or an MIC (12.5 µg /ml) of Gramicidin, a CAMP known to be PMF uncoupler. Gramicidin A but not PMB caused an increased fluorescence due to diSC3(5) release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Taken together, these assays demonstrate that at low concentrations PMB does not cause IM depolarization and generates only a small increase in OM permeability, consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Daugelavicius et al., 2000</xref>)</p><p>We monitored the induction kinetics of the Rcs system in response to PMB using a chromosomal P<italic>rprA-lacZ</italic> reporter fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Majdalani et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>rprA</italic> encodes a small regulatory RNA that stimulates translation of the mRNA for the stationary phase σ factor RpoS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Majdalani et al., 2002</xref>).

For this experiment, we grew the MC4100 <italic>PrprA-lacZ</italic> strain (from now on WT, the parent for all strains) to midlog phase. We then added PMB and followed the Rcs induction over time by monitoring expression of P<italic>rprA-lacZ</italic> reporter using qRT-PCR and β-galactosidase assays. PMB causes a strong and almost immediate induction of Rcs, as quickly as 2 min on the RNA level and 10 min on the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>In order to test whether PMB induces other envelope stress responses or is specific for Rcs, we followed the activity of two other major envelope stress responses, Sigma E and Cpx by monitoring the expression of well-established markers, <italic>rpoE</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mutalik et al., 2009</xref>) and <italic>cpxP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Danese and Silhavy, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> shows using qRT-PCR that PMB did not induce either of these stress responses, demonstrating that PMB induces only Rcs.</p><p>We also monitored OMP levels during PMB treatment to see whether PMB causes OMP assembly defects. Levels of the three major OMPs did not change upon PMB treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Because we did not observe OMP assembly defects and because the Sigma E response, a sensitive monitor of OMP assembly, was not induced we conclude that low levels of PMB do not inhibit the Bam complex.</p><p>Taken together, we conclude that at these sub-MIC levels, PMB causes a specific OM defect.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The PMB-induced Rcs response is independent of <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis</title><p>Globomycin (Glb) is an inhibitor of LspA, the lipoprotein signal peptidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Inukai et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yamagata et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dev et al., 1985</xref>). Glb prevents maturation of lipoproteins resulting in the accumulation of OM lipoproteins in the outer leaflet of the IM. It is well established that, when RcsF accumulates in the outer leaflet of the IM, due to Lol-avoidance mutations that alter the signal sequence or defects in lipoprotein maturation and/or export, it strongly induces the Rcs response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shiba et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tao et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, we observed strong Rcs induction in response to 5 µM Glb (0.5 MIC). This induction required at least 15 min on the RNA level and 20 min on the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Clearly, the kinetics of Rcs induction are much slower with Glb than with PMB. Glb will prevent assembly of essential lipoproteins involved in both LPS and OMP assembly; however, depletion of these proteins to levels low enough to interfere with these assembly processes requires generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Malinverni et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, Glb does not induce the Sigma E response even after 60 min exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that Glb is a chemical inducer of Rcs that is independent of OM damage.</p><p>There is no reciprocal transport of lipoproteins from the OM to the IM; therefore, only newly synthesized OM lipoproteins accumulate in the IM under Glb treatment. Therefore, the kinetics of the Glb-induced Rcs response can also serve as a temporal marker for induction due to mislocalization of newly synthesized RcsF. The observation that Glb induced Rcs with slower kinetics than with PMB suggested that induction with PMB does not require newly synthesized RcsF. To test this directly, we used the antibiotic Kasugamycin (Ksg), which is an inhibitor of translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Okuyama et al., 1971</xref>). After 15 min pre-treatment with Ksg we added PMB or Glb and followed the expression of P<italic>rprA-lacZ</italic> by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). As expected Ksg completely abolished Rcs induction in response to Glb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, lower panel), however Ksg did not block the Rcs response to PMB, demonstrating that Rcs induction is independent of <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis and does not require newly synthesized RcsF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, upper panel). Since RcsF is transported to the OM immediately after it is translocated from the cytoplasm, this result suggests that RcsF molecules already located in the OM are required to respond to PMB treatment.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15276.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The PMB-induced Rcs response is independent of <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis.</title><p>Cell cultures were pretreated with Ksg to inhibit protein synthesis for 15 min prior to addition of PMB or Glb.

Mutations in <italic>waaC, waaF</italic> and <italic>waaG</italic> result not only in a truncated core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), but also in the loss of core phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yethon et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yethon and Whitfield, 2001</xref>) because the complete inner core with the first glucose is a substrate for WaaP kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yethon et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yethon and Whitfield, 2001</xref>). The <italic>waaP</italic> mutation does not introduce core truncations but results in the loss of a majority of these core phosphates because WaaP activity is a prerequisite for WaaY phosphorylation of Hep(II) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yethon et al., 1998</xref>). Our results demonstrate that <italic>waaP</italic> mutation and therefore decreased phosphorylation of LPS is sufficient to fully induce Rcs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>LPS phosphates are essential for establishing cation-mediated LPS cross-bridges in the OM. LB is a Mg<sup>2+</sup> -limiting medium, and does not contain a sufficient amount of cations to saturate LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Papp-Wallace and Maguire, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nikaido, 2009</xref>). Addition of Mg<sup>2+</sup> is known to stabilize the OM of the deep rough mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chatterjee et al., 1976</xref>), likely through stabilization of the lipid A phosphates. Interestingly, when 10 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> was added to LB, it decreased Rcs induction in <italic>waaP</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>The two-component PhoPQ system responds to low Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Soncini et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kato et al., 2003</xref>). PhoPQ and Rcs are known to have partially overlapping regulons in several enterobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hagiwara et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">García-Calderón et al., 2007</xref>). Unlike in Salmonella, PhoPQ in <italic>E. coli</italic> does not regulate lipid A modifications through the Pmr pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Winfield and Groisman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rubin et al., 2015</xref>).

Rcs was still induced and responded to Mg<sup>2+</sup>-addition in the <italic>waaP phoP</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that Mg<sup>2+</sup> dependent Rcs signaling in <italic>waaP</italic> mutants was independent of PhoPQ and is likely a result of reinforced cross-bridges between lipid A-phosphates.</p><p>The effect of LPS charge and presence of cations on Rcs signaling lead us to suggest that RcsF senses the strength of LPS lateral interactions. Binding of a cationic peptide, such as PMB to LPS would also neutralize the charge and weaken LPS lateral interactions. PMB also contains lipid in addition to a cyclic peptide ring, and the lipid integrates into and can disorganize the membrane bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vaara, 1992</xref>). We therefore tested whether charge-neutralization of LPS by PMB is sufficient to induce Rcs. For this, we analyzed the ability of a lipid-truncated PMB derivative, PMB nonapetide (PMBN) to induce Rcs. PMBN also neutralizes LPS but does not disturb the bilayer and is non-toxic. Like PMB, PMBN also induces Rcs, but higher concentrations are required to offset the lower affinity of binding to LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vaara and Viljanen, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thomas and Surolia, 1999</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that charge-neutralization of LPS by PMB is sufficient to induce Rcs.</p><p>If RcsF/OMP complexes sense LPS defects directly, it seems likely that the surface-exposed domain of RcsF acts as the sensory domain. One of the interesting features of surface-exposed region of RcsF is the abundance of positively charged amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To investigate the role of these positive charges in sensing LPS defects, we substituted the five Arg and Lys residues in the surface-exposed region (16–48) with Ala to generate a charge substitution mutant gene we refer to as <italic>rcsF_A5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We verified that RcsF/OmpA complexes are formed with the same efficiency as in RcsF_WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and that this mutant protein responded normally to Glb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, lower panel). Next, we tested how this mutant protein responded to PMB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, upper panel). Although not completely abolished, the Rcs response to PMB was significantly reduced as compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, upper panel).

We show here that this interlocked, heterodimeric structure functions directly to sense known Rcs inducing signals that cause perturbations in the outer leaflet of the OM caused either by treatment with CAMPs or by mutations that cause LPS structural defects. We show that altered OM permeability or asymmetry are not physiological inducers of RcsF. Instead, RcsF senses the state of LPS lateral interactions and it is activated when these interactions are perturbed either by: i) neutralization of LPS negative charge by CAMPs (such as PMB) as a result of direct binding; ii) decreased LPS phosphorylation as a result of mutations in LPS biosynthesis pathway; iii) by lack of cations to stabilize LPS cross-bridges. Moreover, we show that the positive charge of surface-exposed domain of RcsF is necessary for sensing these LPS defects.</p><p>An alternative model for RcsF signaling has been proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al. (2014)</xref>. This model proposes that in unstressed cells, RcsF is constantly assembled into RcsF/OmpA complexes that have no function in sensing and signal transduction. Signals that induce Rcs do so by inhibiting the function of the Bam complex. This prevents RcsF/OMP assembly and allows newly synthesized RcsF to remain free in the periplasm where it can engage the IM components of the signal transduction system. According to this model, activation of Rcs signaling depends on <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have provided multiple lines of evidence demonstrating that this model cannot explain how RcsF senses changes in the OM outer leaflet. First, as noted above, we show that the surface-exposed domain of RcsF/OmpA functions directly to sense these defects. Second, we provide evidence that PMB does not affect β-barrel assembly nor does it induce the SigmaE stress response, which is a sensitive indicator of Bam complex function and the presence of unfolded OMPs in the periplasm. Finally, we show that PMB induction of the Rcs system happens even in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor.</p><p>Two other categories of mutations or chemical agents are also known Rcs inducers: i) perturbations affecting lipoprotein maturation, such as <italic>pgsA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shiba et al., 2004</xref>), Glb (this study), or trafficking (<italic>lolA</italic> depletion) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tao et al., 2012</xref>); ii) perturbations in PG biogenesis, such as those caused by treatment with mecillinam and other β-lactams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laubacher and Ades, 2008</xref>), lysozyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Callewaert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ranjit and Young, 2013</xref>), A22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 2014</xref>), or genetically by introducing multiple <italic>pbp</italic> knockouts (<italic>pbp4, 5, 7, ampH</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evans et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>It is well established that perturbations in lipoprotein assembly lead to the accumulation of RcsF in the inner membrane allowing interaction with downstream components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shiba et al., 2012</xref>). Using Ksg, we show that this mechanism clearly depends on RcsF <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis and is independent of RcsF/OMP assembly in the OM.</p><p>Activation of RcsF in response to perturbations in PG biogenesis also depends on protein synthesis and is likely independent of RcsF/OMP complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 2014</xref>). However, it is unclear how PG defects induce Rcs. RcsF does not interact with PG, and therefore, activation might not be direct. For example, β-lactams (including mecillinam), A22 and mutations in <italic>pbp</italic> genes induce not only Rcs but also the Cpx response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laubacher and Ades, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delhaye et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evans et al., 2013</xref>) and, at least in the case of the <italic>pbp4, 5, 7, and ampH</italic> mutations, Rcs induction relies fully on Cpx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evans et al., 2013</xref>). Because A22 and mecillinam treatment decrease RcsF/BamA crosslinking, it was proposed that RcsF monitors the activity of the Bam complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 2014</xref>). However, there is no evidence that any of the treatments that affect PG affect the function of the Bam complex. We propose an alternative explanation in which newly synthesized RcsF is engaged in signaling prior its interactions with BamA. Reduction of RcsF/OMP complexes may facilitate this type of signaling by increasing proportion of periplasmic RcsF.</p><p>Our work also provides important insights into the assembly pathway for the remarkable, interlocked RcsF/OMP complexes. The first of these relates to BamE. <italic>bamE</italic> encodes one of the non-essential lipoproteins of the Bam complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sklar et al., 2007</xref>), and the function of BamE is not well-understood. Recent studies have uncovered a role for BamE in modulating BamA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rigel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2013</xref>). However, <italic>bamE</italic> null mutations confer modest phenotypes with only slight defects in OMP assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sklar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rigel et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we show that BamE plays an essential role in assembly of RcsF/OMP complexes. In a strain lacking BamE, RcsF/OmpA complexes are almost undetectable. Nonetheless, RcsF is still recognized by BamA. In fact, increased RcsF /BamA crosslinking is observed in a <italic>bamE</italic> strain. This finding further supports the model that RcsF/BamA crosslinking represents an intermediate in RcsF/OMP assembly pathway and suggests that RcsF binds BamA before it binds the OMP.</p><p>Secondly, we identified a mutation, <italic>rcsF_A55Y</italic> that alters a trans-lumen residue and inhibits assembly of RcsF into OMP complexes. We showed that the A55Y substitution prevents RcsF binding to BamA and this in turn prevents assembly of the RcsF/OMP complex. It is important to note that this mutation does not affect the interactions between RcsF and the downstream signaling components, as the <italic>rscF_A55Y</italic> mutant protein was still able to activate Rcs in response to Glb.</p><p>We do not yet understand how the inducing signal is transduced by the RcsF/OMP complexes from the cell surface to the IM components of the Rcs system. The RcsF/OMP complexes do not disassemble when OM defects are detected. Therefore, we hypothesize that small conformational changes within complex can facilitate interaction between the RcsF carboxy-terminal signaling domain and the downstream components to activate the signaling pathway and we are currently attempting to detect these changes in the RcsF/OMP complexes in response to LPS defects.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strain growth and construction</title><p>All strains used in this study, including previously published strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Majdalani et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Malinverni et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Malojčić et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Silhavy et al., 1984</xref>) are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Timothy Meredith (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Your previous findings showed that RcsF forms a complex in which it is threaded through the lumen of outer membrane proteins such as OmpA. In this paper you report that the RcsF/OMP complexes can induce Rcs system through OM stress response by showing that pre-synthesized RcsF is sufficient to induce Rcs in the absence of de novo protein synthesis, as shown using chemical inhibitors. This challenges the model of Choi et al. for RcsF induction, which evokes a requirement for de novo protein synthesis. Clearly, the model is evolving and your manuscript is an important step towards this. Overall, the conclusions are well supported and provide new insight into complex signaling events. The main concern is whether it has been proven that changes in LPS structure are directly detected by RcsF, or if the sequence of events is LPS mutation leading to &quot;altered OM&quot;, which in turn activates RcsF signaling. A few suggested control experiments should help to strengthen your conclusions that it is indeed the former scenario, as you have proposed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Introduction section, paragraph four: Is the RcsF/IgaA interaction the only known partner for RcsF?</p><p>2) Results section, paragraph two: Why was the lipid truncated polymyxin analog nonapeptide not used?

Therefore, it is hard to estimate the minimal amount of peptide to use without causing secondary effects. However, we do agree that Rcs induction by PMBN would provide additional support our models, in which PMB induces Rcs by disrupting lateral interactions due to the charge neutralization. PMBN has been previously shown to induce Rcs in <italic>Salmonella</italic> (Farris, 2010). We now also show concentration-dependent induction of Rcs by PMBN in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).
