The export of low-molecular-weight catabolic end-products is facilitated by polytopic transmembrane proteins mediating secondary active or passive transport. A number of these lysosomal transporters, however, remain enigmatic. We present a detailed analysis of MFSD1, a hitherto uncharacterized lysosomal family member of the major facilitator superfamily. MFSD1 is not N-glycosylated. It contains a dileucine-based sorting motif needed for its transport to lysosomes. <italic>Mfsd1</italic> knockout mice develop splenomegaly and severe liver disease. Proteomics of isolated lysosomes from <italic>Mfsd1</italic> knockout mice revealed GLMP as a critical accessory subunit for MFSD1. MFSD1 and GLMP physically interact. GLMP is essential for the maintenance of normal levels of MFSD1 in lysosomes and vice versa. <italic>Glmp</italic> knockout mice mimic the phenotype of <italic>Mfsd1</italic> knockout mice. Our data reveal a tightly linked MFSD1/GLMP lysosomal membrane protein transporter complex.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50025.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Lysosomes are specialized, enclosed compartments within cells with harsh chemical conditions where enzymes break down large molecules into smaller component parts.

Their major function is the hydrolytic degradation of macromolecules like proteins, complex lipids, nucleic acids and oligosaccharides after uptake from the extracellular space by pinocytosis and endocytosis or from intracellular sources after fusion with autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Saftig and Klumperman, 2009</xref>). Hydrolytic degradation is mediated by the concerted action of ~60 different, mostly soluble acid hydrolases. The catabolic end-products of these reactions (e.g. amino acids, peptides, monosaccharides, nucleosides) are exported by polytopic transmembrane proteins to the cytosol for anabolic processes. While in the past, the vast majority of soluble proteins of lysosomes were identified due to their deficiencies in lysosomal storage disorders and by proteomics of purified lysosomes or affinity chromatography and most of them have been characterized extensively, much less is known about the low abundant integral membrane proteins of lysosomes.</p><p>The luminal side of the lysosomal membrane is lined with a dense layer of carbohydrates attached to integral membrane proteins, presumed to protect these membrane proteins from the activity of the abundant luminal proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wilke et al., 2012</xref>). While the highly abundant transmembrane proteins like LAMP1 or LAMP2 are known since decades, there is still a major gap of knowledge about polytopic transporter proteins, mediating the transport of metabolites between the lysosomal lumen and the cytosol, but also the import of metabolites from the cytosol to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Remaileh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chapel et al., 2013</xref>). Of note, many of such transporters have been biochemically characterized in the 80s and 90s. However, the genes coding for the great majority of those transporters have not been cloned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gahl, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pisoni and Thoene, 1991</xref>).</p><p>Several proteomics-based studies pointing to identify novel lysosomal membrane proteins have been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bagshaw et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chapel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Della Valle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schröder et al., 2007</xref>). Chapel et. al. particularly aimed to identify lysosomal transporters and one of their top candidates was ‘Major facilitator superfamily domain containing 1’ (MFSD1).</p><p>MFSD1 is a poorly characterized protein. It belongs to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transporters, one of the two largest family of transporter proteins mediating secondary active or passive transport processes over cellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pao et al., 1998</xref>). MFS transporters move a variety of small compounds across biological membranes. In humans, MFS proteins mediate intestinal nutrient absorption, renal and hepatic clearance, but they have also evolved additional functions in the transport of metabolites and signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Quistgaard et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>MFSD1</italic> is co-expressed in the transcription factor EB (TFEB)-mediated gene network regulating lysosomal biogenesis and lysosomal gene expression and was thus identified as a direct TFEB-target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Palmieri et al., 2011</xref>). Overexpression of epitope-tagged MFSD1 indicated co-localization with LAMP-proteins, demonstrating that it is indeed a resident lysosomal protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chapel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Palmieri et al., 2011</xref>). However, there are also reports showing non-lysosomal localization of MFSD1 at the plasma membrane of neurons and the Golgi-apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Perland et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Valoskova et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we provide a detailed biochemical characterization of MFSD1. Endogenous MFSD1 is localized in lysosomes. It contains 12 transmembrane domains and it is ubiquitously expressed in murine tissues. It harbors a dileucine-based sorting motif in its cytosolic N-terminus which is required for its transport to lysosomes. In order to decipher the physiological function of MFSD1, we generated and analyzed <italic>Mfsd1</italic> knockout (KO) mice. MFSD1-deficient mice develop a severe liver disease characterized by extravasation of erythrocytes, sinusoidal damage, loss of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and finally signs of fibrosis. By means of differential proteomics of isolated liver lysosomes from wildtype and <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO mice, we identified GLMP as an essential accessory protein for MFSD1. GLMP is a highly glycosylated lysosomal protein of so far unknown function. Deficiency of <italic>Mfsd1</italic> leads to drastically reduced levels of GLMP and vice versa. MFSD1 and GLMP physically interact and <italic>Glmp</italic>-deficient mice resemble a phenocopy of <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO mice suggesting the MFSD1/GLMP complex to be a stable and functional relevant lysosomal transporter complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MFSD1 is a ubiquitously expressed, non-glycosylated polytopic lysosomal membrane protein containing a dileucine-based sorting motif</title><p>We and others have identified MFSD1 previously in proteomic analyses of isolated liver lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chapel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Markmann et al., 2017</xref>). For validation of its lysosomal localization and the newly generated MFSD1-specific antibodies, we ectopically expressed N- and C-terminally hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged MFSD1 in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Co-immunofluorescence staining with antibodies against HA, LAMP2 and MFSD1 confirmed the co-localization of MFSD1 (either detected with HA- or MFSD1 antibodies) with LAMP2 and the specificity of our MFSD1 antibody. In addition to lysosomal localization, staining of the Golgi-apparatus was observed frequently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). By immunoblot, both HA- and MFSD1-antibodies detected a major band of ~35 kDa for N- or C-terminally tagged MFSD1 in transfected cells, differing from the predicted molecular weight of ~51 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Untagged MFSD1 was exclusively detected with the MFSD1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right panel). Additionally, minor bands of smaller molecular weight were detected for all three constructs, suggesting partial proteolysis. Co-immunofluorescence staining of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) for endogenous MFSD1 with LAMP1 validated the lysosomal localization at the endogenous level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and notably MFSD1 was absent from Golgi-apparatus structures. These data were corroborated by analyzing magnetite-bead isolated lysosomes compared to the postnuclear supernatant from MEFs, showing a pronounced enrichment of endogenous MFSD1 in the lysosome-enriched fraction similar to the striking enrichment of the lysosome-marker LAMP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Other organelles were either depleted in these fractions (ER, detected with an antibody against KDEL), or only slightly enriched (mitochondria, detected with an antibody against VDAC and Golgi, detected with an antibody against GM130). We next investigated the tissue-specific expression of MFSD1 using our antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). MFSD1 was detected ubiquitously in murine organs and highest levels were observed in kidney and spleen. Bioinformatics analysis of the primary sequence of MFSD1 by different online analysis tools predicted variable numbers of transmembrane domains (TMDs). Some tools favored 11 TMD, others predicted 12 TMDs. We, therefore, analyzed if MFSD1 has an even or uneven number of TMDs by selective permeabilization of the PM with digitonin or of the PM and lysosomal membrane with saponin and antibody accessibility of N- or C-terminally HA-tagged MFSD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> (I)-(III)). These experiments clearly revealed that MFSD1 presents with an even number of TMDs and likely a 12 TMD spanning topology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50025.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MFSD1 is an ubiquitously expressed, non-glycosylated lysosomal protein that contains a dileucine-based lysosomal sorting motif.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Co-Immunofluorescence staining of HeLa cells overexpressing N- or C-terminally HA-tagged MFSD1 with antibodies against LAMP2 (red), HA (green) and an antibody against MFSD1 (magenta).

Mutation of the two critical leucine residues to alanine (MFSD1<sup>LL/AA</sup>) and transfection of the mutant cDNA in HeLa cells followed by immunofluorescence staining showed a striking missorting of MFSD1 to the plasma membrane (PM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). For a quantitative readout by fluorescence-activated cell scanning (FACS), we inserted an HA-tag in the first luminal loop between TMD1 and TMD2 (between amino acids 76 and 77) to detect MFSD1 at the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref> (I)). The internal tag did not interfere with intracellular sorting (only minor amounts were mislocalized in the ER) and both constructs were expressed at equal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> (I)-(III)). While only subtle amounts of wildtype-MFSD1 with the internal HA-tag were detectable at the PM after transfection of Hela cells and staining for HA (~2% of the cells), a considerably higher number of MFSD1-positive cells was observed after transfection with MFSD1<sup>LL/AA</sup> (~20% of the cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref> (II-III)). Biotinylation of cell-surface proteins followed by streptavidin pull-down of HA-tagged wildtype or MFSD1<sup>LL/AA</sup> transfected HeLa cells and detection with an HA-antibody showed a similar trend toward higher surface levels of MFSD1<sup>LL/AA</sup> compared to the wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). An additional predicted tyrosine-based motif (YGKI, aa 195–198) is, according to our experimentally determined topology, on the luminal side and therefore not accessible for adaptor-protein mediating sorting to lysosomes. Mutating this residue did not show any differences in the localization of MFSD1 as determined by immunofluorescence (not shown) or surface biotinylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These data show that the dileucine motif in the cytosolic N-terminus is critical for the sorting of MFSD1 to lysosomes.</p><p>We wondered if MFSD1, similar to the great majority of lysosomal membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Saftig and Klumperman, 2009</xref>), is N-glycosylated. MFSD1 contains two putative N-glycosylation sites (N76 and N449). Protein extracts from HeLa cells transfected with HA-tagged MFSD1 were treated with the endoglycosidases Peptide-N-Glycosidase F (PNGaseF) and Endoglycosidase H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). However, none of the two endoglycosidases altered the apparent molecular weight of MFSD1, indicating a lack of N-glycosylation. Additionally, we mutated the critical asparagine residue in the predicted putative N-glycosylation motifs (N76 and N449, respectively) to alanine and analyzed transfected HeLa cell lysates by immunoblot with an antibody against HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Again, no shift in the apparent molecular weight was observed, demonstrating that MFSD1 is, unusual for a lysosomal membrane protein, not N-glycosylated. In summary, MFSD1 is endogenously localized in lysosomes under steady state conditions, is not N-glycosylated, is ubiquitously expressed in murine tissues and its transport to lysosomes is mediated by a dileucine-based sorting motif in the N-terminus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>Mfsd1</italic> knockout mice develop a liver phenotype characterized by liver sinus endothelial cell death and prothrombotic conditions</title><p>In order to determine the physiological functions of MFSD1, we generated <italic>Mfsd1</italic> knockout (KO) mice.

The expression of <italic>Mfsd1</italic> is abrogated in this strain due to an artificial splice acceptor (SA) site and translation of a LacZ fusion transcript. Expression of the fusion transcript was validated by X-Gal staining of brain sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). No residual <italic>Mfsd1</italic>-transcript or -protein was detectable as determined by qPCR, immunoblot, immunohistochemistry in liver lysates or liver sections using our MFSD1 antibody or <italic>Mfsd1</italic>-specific primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C,D</xref>), implicating that the tm1a allele leads to a complete loss of MFSD1 in this mouse strain (from here on referred as <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO mice, <italic>Mfsd1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>). <italic>Mfsd1</italic> homozygous and heterozygous mice were born according to the expected Mendelian frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and no differences in weight gain were observed in a longitudinal study in male or female mice between wildtype and <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO mice until 13 weeks-of-age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). However, both male and female <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO animals had a reduced body weight with 12 months-of-age compared to wildtype animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). While young (&lt;10 weeks-of-age) <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO animals were unremarkable, the liver of <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO animals &gt; 12 weeks-of-age revealed a striking pathology characterized by tuberous appearance with uneven surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The liver weight (normalized to the total bodyweight) was normal, but the spleen showed a significant increase in size of about twofold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Heterozygous animals did not present any abnormalities. Cre-mediated germline deletion of exon 3 in <italic>Mfsd1</italic> yielding the tm1d allele after consecutive breeding of the tm1a mice with constitutively expressing Flp- and Cre-deleter mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>) showed the same macroscopic phenotype, corroborating the finding that tm1a mice are functional knockouts (data not shown). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) values in serum of <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KOs were significantly elevated, but lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and albumin levels were in the normal range, demonstrating established but generally mild damage of the liver parenchyma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). No signs of lysosomal storage or abnormal lysosomes (enlarged lysosomes, aberrant deposition of abnormal luminal storage compounds) were observed at the ultrastructural level in hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>). The specific activity of the three lysosomal enzymes β-hexosaminidase, β-galactosidase and β-glucuronidase was not significantly different between wildtype and <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO mice at 13 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>), further strengthening the finding that lysosomes are not obviously altered. Hematoxylin and eosin and toluidine blue staining of liver sections of <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO animals of 12 weeks-of-age revealed local foci with hepatocyte atrophy or loss. Ordinary sinusoids in such foci were absent due to destroyed sinusoidal endothelium. The normally wide sinusoids, which in <italic>Mfsd1</italic> wildtype mice were lined by a special fenestrated endothelium (liver sinusoid endothelial cells, LSEC), were in <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO mice replaced by ordinary narrow non-fenestrated capillaries. The extravasal space was enlarged and the space of Disse was missing. This space is the extracelluar cleft between the microvillous surface of the hepatocytes and the special fenestrated sinusoid endothelium (LSECs), where the exchange processes between hepatocytes and the acellular phase of the blood take place. Hepatocytes in pathologic foci were in close contact both with the extravasal non-circulating blood and the circulating blood in the capillaries. This was indicated by the observation that erythrocytes were found both in extra- and intravasal spaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>). Sirius Red staining revealed moderate fibrosis particularly pronounced around the focal spots of parenchymal damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). In <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO mice, LSECs were partially absent in spots of focal damage and hepatocytes had direct contact with their microvilli to the blood. Platelets were frequently observed at sites of damaged sinusoids and EM confirmed the increased deposition of collagen and pathologic, non-fenestrated capillaries were observed instead of LSECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining for CD31, a general marker for endothelial cells, revealed a clearly increased staining in the focal spots of liver damage and confirmed the formation of new capillaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Staining for von Willebrand factor (vWF), an acute-phase protein that initiates thrombocyte-adhesion and binds the sub-endothelial matrix, was strikingly increased, implicating a pro-thrombotic status of the liver. The pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic conditions were supported by increased levels of CXCL1, MCP1, CD34, MMP2, and MMP9, all markers of inflammation and endothelial remodeling, as determined by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). Factor VIII, a specific marker for LSECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Do et al., 1999</xref>), was significantly downregulated. The pro-thrombotic status and accumulation of platelets was additionally validated by immunofluorescence staining of liver sections for Integrin α-IIb/CD41, a protein highly expressed in megakaryocytes and platelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). Platelets were observed frequently particularly in areas of sinusoidal remodeling. A quantitative TMT-based proteomics experiment from total liver lysates of wildtype and <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) additionally supported our results of endothelial remodeling, platelet aggregation and pro-fibrotic conditions obtained by qPCR and histology. Gene ontology classification of proteins that showed statistically significant differences (p&lt;0.05) using the ‘Panther’-classification system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Thomas et al., 2003</xref>) revealed a clear enrichment of a number of related pathways like ‘lymphocyte-aggregation’ and ‘leukocyte aggregation’, ‘platelet-aggregation’, ‘blood coagulation’ and ‘wound healing’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We wondered if the LSEC degeneration is due to a LSEC-cell-intrinsic trigger or caused for example as a secondary alteration due to dysfunctional hepatocytes, and therefore conditionally deleted <italic>Mfsd1</italic> in endothelial cells by crossing floxed <italic>Mfsd1</italic> mice (<italic>MFSD1<sup>tm1c</sup></italic>) with Tie2-cre deleter mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>). Tie2-conditional mice (<italic>Mfsd1<sup>flox/flox</sup> Tie2 cre</italic>) lacked expression of MFSD1 in LSECs but not in hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D</xref>), and notably had the same tuberous liver appearance as the full germline <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO, strengthening a pivotal role of MFSD1 in LSECS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3E,F</xref>). It should be noted, however, that Tie2 cre is also expressed in Kupffer cells, and additionally deleted <italic>Mfsd1</italic> in Kupffer cells. In summary, the knockout of <italic>Mfsd1</italic> leads to a focal damage of sinusoids characterized by loss of LSECs and new capillarization. Likely as a consequence, a pro-thrombotic cascade is initiated leading to the accumulation and aggregation of platelets at sites of LSEC loss and sinusoidal damage. Most <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO mice reach a normal life span, and the liver phenotype does not show a major deterioration. However, we observed a significantly higher occurrence of liver tumors in old animals (&gt;1.5 years), likely as a consequence of fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A,B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50025.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>MFSD1 knockout mice develop focal LSEC degeneration followed by platelet aggregation and splenomegaly.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the tm1a targeting vector containing LacZ and Frt-/Cre recombinase sites.

Similar to the <italic>Glmp</italic> transcript levels in <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO mice, <italic>Mfsd1</italic> transcript levels were unchanged in <italic>Glmp</italic> KO mice, again pointing towards posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Interestingly, the liver of <italic>Glmp</italic> KO mice has, like <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO mice, a tuberous appearance with uneven surface and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kong et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore analyzed the liver of <italic>Glmp</italic> KO mice in more detail to directly compare the phenotype with that of <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO mice. Similar to <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO mice, <italic>Glmp</italic> KO mice showed local foci where hepatocytes were lost and LSEC were replaced by ordinary capillary endothelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Similar to <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO mice, the sites of liver injury in <italic>Glmp</italic> KO mice showed increased staining for CD31 and vWF at sites of liver injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Finally, we determined the same set of transcripts as we did for <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO mice. With the exception of Factor VIII, all evaluated transcripts showed the same differential regulation as in <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). It should be noted that <italic>Glmp</italic> KO mice, similar to <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO mice, suffer from splenomegaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kong et al., 2014</xref>).

MFSD1 could be efficiently immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells transfected with HA-tagged GLMP and untagged MFSD1 with the MFSD1-specific antibody and GLMP-HA was co-immunoprecipitated.

As FRET couples we used the red fluorescent protein mKATE2 and the green fluorescent protein eGFP, which were previously shown to yield efficient FRET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fettelschoss et al., 2017</xref>). Both, MFSD1 and GLMP were fused either to eGFP or mKate2 and the constructs were transfected in HeLa cells. Both fusion proteins properly localized to lysosomes as determined by immunofluorescence staining. As negative controls the polytopic lysosomal transporter MFSD8 and the single-transmembrane protein LAMP1 were included in the experimental setup. As positive control for FRET, a fusion protein between eGFP and mKATE2 was transfected. The eGFP-fusion proteins were expressed to similar extent in all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). However, notably only the combination of MFSD1 and GLMP, independent of which tag was used, yielded efficient FRET comparable to the positive control of the eGFP-mKATE2 fusion protein, but not any of the negative controls, indicating close proximity of the two proteins and thereby their physical interaction.</p><p>In order to decipher the interplay between MFSD1 and GLMP mechanistically, we established a cell-based model. MEFs from both KO mouse lines were generated. Analysis of the MEF lines by immunocytochemistry and LysoTracker staining did not reveal any differences in regard to the size of lysosomes (determined by LAMP1 staining), delivery of the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D or their pH, as determined by LysoTracker staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We analyzed GLMP and MFSD1 expression levels in membrane extracts by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). GLMP levels were below the limit of detection in <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO MEFs. MFSD1 on the other hand was strongly reduced in <italic>Glmp</italic> KO MEFs, but not completely absent as observed before in most murine <italic>Glmp</italic> KO tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). qPCR of MEFs revealed an increase of the transcripts of <italic>Mfsd1</italic> in <italic>Glmp</italic> KO MEFs and an increase of the <italic>Glmp</italic> transcript in <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), suggesting a transcriptional upregulation as a compensation for the reduced protein levels. We next analyzed the localization of the remaining MFSD1 in <italic>Glmp</italic> KO MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO MEFs were used as a specificity control for the MFSD1-antibody. While MFSD1 shows extensive co-localization with LAMP1 in lysosomes of wildtype MEFs, MFSD1 staining was absent in <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO MEFs validating the specificity of the staining. The remaining amounts of MFSD1 in <italic>Glmp</italic> KO MEFs notably did not co-localize with LAMP1, but with the Golgi marker GM130. A rescue experiment using transfection of HA-tagged GLMP fully restored the co-localization of MFSD1 with LAMP1 in <italic>Glmp</italic> KO MEFs, while HA-tagged LAMP1, used as a negative control, did not rescue MFSD1, indicating a critical interdependence of GLMP and MFSD1.

Treatment of GLMP wildtype and <italic>Glmp</italic> KO MEFs with Bafilomycin A (an inhibitor of lysosomal acidification), E64D or Leupeptin (both inhibitors of lysosomal proteases) partially restored the levels of MFSD1 as determined by immunoblot, indicating that accelerated lysosomal proteolysis causes the decrease in MFSD1 levels in the absence of GLMP. These data were supported by transfection of HA-tagged MFSD1 in HeLa cells alone, or co-transfection with GLMP or LAMP1 followed by immunoblot for HA and MFSD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Expression of MFSD1-HA alone and co-transfection with LAMP1 leads to the generation of N- and C-terminal proteolytic fragments (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Treatment of cells with different inhibitors for lysosomal proteolysis (Chloroquine, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, Bafilomycin A and E64D) significantly reduced the formation of these fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating that they are generated by lysosomal proteases. Notably, co-transfection of MFSD1-HA with GLMP, but not LAMP1, significantly reduced the formation of these proteolytic fragments, indicating that specifically GLMP is able to protect MFSD1 from proteolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). In line with these experiments, immunoblot analysis of cells transfected with the wildtype MFSD1-HA cDNA, but not the PM-localized MFSD1<sup>LL/AA</sup>–HA mutant showed the proteolytic fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>), indicating that they are not due to misfolding or destabilization of MFSD1 in pre-lysosomal compartments, but occur specifically in lysosomes if GLMP is limiting. In conclusion, MFSD1 and GLMP physically interact, their transport to lysosomes does not essentially depend on each other and the stability MFSD1 against lysosomal proteolysis depends on GLMP. A schematic representation of the two interacting partners is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The understanding of the lysosomal proteome has considerably improved in the past years. However, there is still a major gap of knowledge about the nature of polytopic transporter proteins, mediating the transport of metabolites between the lysosomal lumen and the cytosol. This is surprising, given the lack of knowledge of the lysosomal transporters for most amino acids, peptides, monosaccharides and several other small solutes. Previous proteomic studies identified a large number of novel putative lysosomal transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chapel et al., 2013</xref>), and in this study, we characterized one of those candidate transporters, MFSD1 in detail. We identified GLMP as an essential accessory subunit of MFSD1 and establish an essential role of GLMP and MFSD1 in the homeostasis of the liver and particularly LSECs.</p><p>The major goal of this study was to identify the substrate(s) of MFSD1 by analyzing KO mice, assuming that a substrate accumulates in lysosomes. The phenotype of <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO mice is complex and the liver phenotype did not resemble that observed in mouse models of lysosomal storage diseases. We failed to detect any signs of typical lysosomal storage like aberrant storage material or enlarged lysosomes in the liver or MEFs. By comparing the liver and spleen pathology with other pathological situations, especially involving the liver sinusoids, we found some similarities of the phenotype observed in <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO mice (and <italic>Glmp</italic> KO mice) with ‘sinusoidal obstruction syndrome’ (SOS), a pathology observed in humans and mouse models treated with oxaliplatin (an adjuvant or neoadjuvant for chemotherapy for colorectal carcinoma) or patients taking pyrrolizidine alkaloid-containing herbal remedies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">DeLeve et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fan and Crawford, 2014</xref>). A central pathological event under these conditions is a toxic destruction of hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells, with sloughing and downstream occlusion of terminal hepatic venules. Extravasated platelet aggregation in the space of Disse (as observed in <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO and <italic>Glmp</italic> KO mice) was observed in a rat model for SOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hirata et al., 2017</xref>). Contributing factors are LSEC glutathione- and nitric oxide depletion. Since the LSECs are in extensive exchange with the blood, it is worthwhile speculating that a toxic metabolite present in trace amounts, possibly transported under normal conditions by MFSD1, is circulating in the bloodstream and causing LSEC cell death. However, while it is reasonable to assume that the accumulation of a toxic substrate or dysfunction of lysosomes due to the loss of the transporter function of MFSD1 is the underlying cause for the observed severe phenotype in <italic>Mfsd1</italic> and <italic>Glmp</italic> KO mouse strains, we cannot provide final certainty for this hypothesis. We cannot finally exclude that GLMP might also interact with other (lysosomal membrane) proteins or provides general stability for the lysosomal membrane like LAMP proteins do. MFSD1 might be important for indirectly transporter-related functions like nutrient sensing or even transporter-unrelated processes.</p><p>MFSD1 shows a relatively high homology to members of the proteobacterial intraphagosomal amino acid transporter (Pht) family, transporters found in <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> transporting valine and threonine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sauer et al., 2005</xref>). However, we did not observe any major difference in the serum of <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO mice for any of the analyzed amino acids and failed to show a valine- or threonine transport in a cell-based assay. While these results do not exclude amino acids as substrates, other metabolites are more likely transported by MFSD1. The identification of the substrate(s) will be the key for understanding the observed liver pathology and might reveal important understanding of the SOS-like phenotype.</p><p>Overexpressed human and mouse MFSD1 was previously shown to co-localize with LAMP1 or LAMP2, respectively, indicating that it is a resident lysosomal protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chapel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Palmieri et al., 2011</xref>). However, other reports revealed a non-lysosomal localization of MFSD1 at the PM of neurons and the in Golgi-apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Perland et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Valoskova et al., 2019</xref>). Our experiments, detecting endogenous MFSD1 in mouse cells and tissues with perfect co-localization with lysosomal markers leave no doubt on its localization in lysosomes. We can exclude any antibody-related unspecificity issues due to the inclusion of knockout samples. However, interestingly we also observed Golgi-localized MFSD1 upon overexpression in HeLa cells, but not at the endogenous level in MEF cells. A likely explanation for this discrepancy is that GLMP is a limiting factor under these overexpression conditions.</p><p>MFSD1, together with other MFS transporters, belongs to the atypical SLCs. Most MFS transporters are similar in structure, despite their relatively low sequence identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Reddy et al., 2012</xref>). The assignment to the MFS-clan suggested a 12 transmembrane topology, but here we provide experimental proof for this topology.</p><p>Extensive glycosylation is a typical feature of the great majority of lysosomal proteins including the integral membrane proteins. The abundant presence of N-glycans results in a tight glycocalyx which is thought to protect lysosomal membrane proteins from degradation by luminal lysosomal proteases. According to our data, MFSD1 is not N-glycosylated. MFSD1 is therefore one of the very few known non-glycosylated multi-transmembrane spanning integral lysosomal membrane proteins together with few rare exceptions: The chloride channel/Cl(-)/H(+)-exchanger CLC-7, similarly lacks N-glycosylation. Of interest CLC-7 was shown to act in a complex with a single-transmembrane spanning highly glycosylated type I transmembrane protein OSTM1. OSTM1 stabilizes CLC-7 but is also essential for mediating the trafficking of the CLC-7/OSTM1 complex from the ER to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lange et al., 2006</xref>). Finally, OSTM1 critically regulates Cl(-)/H(+)-exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Leisle et al., 2011</xref>). However, the interaction between MFSD1 and GLMP differs at least in one regard: GLMP and MFSD1 can reach lysosomes independent from each other, as shown by expression of both proteins in the corresponding KO MEFs. If the interaction is also critical for the transporter activity of MFSD1 remains to be determined.</p><p>In regard to the dependence on an accessory subunit, MFSD1 and CLC-7 closely resemble a number of plasma-membrane localized transporter proteins which contain β-subunits. The prototypical examples are the Na,K-ATPase or voltage gated potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geering, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pongs and Schwarz, 2010</xref>). Even though for ion channels and members of the ABC transporter family β-subunits are very common, accessory subunits are not that common for members of the SLC-transporter family. One of those SLCs is the monocarboxylate transporter-1 (MCT1). The correct translocation of MCT-1, a PM-localized transporter for monocarboxylates such as L-lactate and pyruvate, critically depends on the interaction with basigin or embigin, both highly glycosylated type I transmembrane proteins acting as accessory subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Halestrap, 2012</xref>). Interestingly, both bear two or three extracellular immunoglobulin domains, respectively. A secondary structure prediction of the luminal domain of GLMP using the ‘Phyre2’-web portal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kelley et al., 2015</xref>) predicts similarity with the immunoglobulin-fold, and it can be speculated that the interaction of SLC transporters and immunoglobuline-like proteins have developed co-evolutionary.</p><p>Very recently, another lysosomal SLC-transporter was shown to critically depend on an accessory subunit: the nitrogen-containing-bisphosphonate transporter SLC37A3 forms a complex with the type I single-transmembrane spanning protein ATRAID (all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation factor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). Very much like in the situation of MFSD1 and GLMP, the knockout of <italic>ATRAID</italic> leads to highly reduced stability of the transporter SLC37A3, implicating that ATRAID confers protection to SLC37A3. Notably, similar to OSTM1 and GLMP, ATRAID has a highly glycosylated luminal N-terminus and a short cytosolic C-terminus. These examples implicate, that the formation of lysosomal complexes between a transporter and an accessory subunit might be much more common than anticipated. SLC37A3 itself is glycosylated. Although the intracellular sorting of ATRAID in <italic>SLC37A3</italic> KO cells and the sorting of SLC37A3 in <italic>ATRAID</italic> KO cells was not investigated, SLC37A3 is hypoglycosylated upon ectopic expression in <italic>ATRAID</italic> KO cells, implicating at least in part an important role of the ATRAID in intracellular sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Most accessory-/ β-subunits are essential for the stability of their corresponding transporters, but additionally mediate at least in part the intracellular sorting of their corresponding polytopic transmembrane interaction partner. Our data show that the sorting of ectopically expressed GLMP in <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO cells or MFSD1 in <italic>Glmp</italic> KO cells to lysosomes is not critically altered, but that instead the stability against lysosomal proteolysis of MFSD1 is altered in <italic>Glmp</italic> KO cells. While we cannot exclude subtle alterations in the sorting, the protection of MFSD1 against proteolysis seems to be more critical. On the other hand, while this explanation sounds reasonable for MFSD1, the levels of GLMP in <italic>Mfsd1</italic> KO cells are also strikingly reduced, and the stability of GLMP apparently also critically depends on the non-glycosylated MFSD1, a counter-intuitive finding that implicates that not only glycosylation matters, but also the protein-protein interaction is essential to maintain a stable protease-resistant complex. It would be of great interest to determine the interaction in more detail, and which protein domains/loops of GLMP and MFSD1 convey this interaction. Additionally GLMP might be important for promoting a more stable conformation of MFSD1, and it would be interesting to figure out if the two proteins already interact in the ER. Once a natural substrate for MFSD1 is identified, a major question is of course if the interaction with GLMP is also essential for the transport, for example by mediating substrate recognition or increase substrate supply. Unlike channels or enzymes that are relatively static, solute carriers (to which the MFS-family belongs to) must undergo rapid conformational changes during their functions. Therefore, the presence of a stable globular protein domain may affect the conformational dynamics of these solute carriers and directly regulate its transporter activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>An MFSD1-specific polyclonal antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with the peptide ‘EDEDGEDRALLGGRREADC’ corresponding to the N-terminus of mouse MFSD1.

The images were acquired and processed with the Olympus FluoView Software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Immunofluorescence staining of liver sections</title><p>After mouse perfusion and post-fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, the tissues were washed and incubated in 30% (w/v) sucrose in 0.1 M phosphate buffer for 24 hr at 4°C. Indirect immunofluorescence staining was performed on semi-thin free-floating cryosections (35 μm thick) prepared using a Leica SM 2000R sliding microtome (Leica Microsystems) and dry-ice cooling. The sections were blocked, washed and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. After washing steps, the samples were incubated with AlexaFluor dye-conjugated secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 hr at room temperature under constant shaking. Finally, the sections were washed and embedded using mounting medium including DAPI. For visualization of the samples, a FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus Life Science Solutions) with a U Plan S-Apo 60x or 100x oil immersion objective (NA = 1.40) was used.

Liver samples were post-fixed in 2% (w/v) OsO<sub>4</sub>, dehydrated and embedded in Araldite M/dodecenylsuccinic anhydride. Ultrathin sections were cut on an EM UC6 ultramicrotome (Leica), collected on Formvar-coated copper grids (Agar Scientific, G2020C) and stained according to standard protocols. Images were acquired with an EM900 transmission electron microscope (Zeiss).</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). For the experimental cohorts, we used 3 to 16 mice per genotype per experiment (=biological replicates) (as indicated in the figures/figure legends for each experiment). For mouse experiments, age-matched wildtype mice from the same colony were used as controls. In cell-culture-experiments, independent dishes with independent transfections were defined as replicates. All experiments (except the proteomics experiments and determination of amino acids) were performed at least twice with the indicated number of replicates. No outliers were excluded from the data analysis. Sample size was based on our expectations on similar experiments previously performed in our laboratory, as well as in the literature. The number of animals used for each experiment is specified in the figure legends. Tests between two groups were carried out using unpaired, two-tailed student’s t-test. Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Significance was labeled with one asterisk = p &lt; 0.05, two asterisks = p &lt; 0.01, three asterisks = p &lt; 0.001, and four asterisks = p &lt; 0.0001.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Maike Langer, Daniela Wiegmann, Dagmar Niemeier and Marlies Rusch for excellent technical assistance.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom served as a guest Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Peter Lobel (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript provides a thorough analysis of the MFSD1 transporter that yields new insights that represent an advance in understanding lysosome cell biology. Multiple approaches were employed to establish the lysosomal localization, lack of glycosylation and transmembrane topology of MFSD1. The authors furthermore convincingly show that MFSD1 has an important role in liver homoeostasis, phenocopies a GLMP deficiency, and that MFSD1 and GLMP are required for each other's stability. Evidence is also presented that suggests a possible interaction between MFSD1 and GLMP. These new findings will provide a valuable foundation for future studies in this field that will likely address currently unanswered questions that may include the identification of MFSD1 substrates and elucidation of the mechanisms that link MFSD1 deficiency to liver pathology. It was also noted that the lysosomal localization of the MFSD1 protein that was thoroughly established in this study contrasts with a recently published <italic>eLife</italic> paper that focused on functions of this transporter in the Golgi (Valoskova et al., 2019). This argues for the value of communicating the new findings presented by this new manuscript. Although all 3 reviewers expressed enthusiasm for the strengths of this manuscript, there was also consensus that some additional experiments and explanations are required to address some of the central claims of the manuscript. These are summarized below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors claim to have found a direct physical interaction between MFSD1 and GLMP (Figure 5A). However CHAPS, the detergent used for these experiments, is known to maintain large portions of membrane attached to proteins. Thus, the apparent interaction may well be indirect. FRET is also not conclusive evidence of direct binding. Interpretation of the co-IP data should be further strengthened with the use of negative control lysosomal integral membrane proteins. Depending on the outcome of such experiments, the description of this result may need to be rephrased to indicate that the interaction isn't necessarily direct.</p><p>2) The authors should address whether or not the plasma membrane-localized dileucine mutant of MFSD1 still interacts with GLMP. Answers to this question are relevant for addressing two distinct concerns. First, this relates to the possibility that the negative results for the MFSD1 dileucine mutant transport assays could arise due to a problem with GLMP interactions at the plasma membrane. It is possible that even if MFSD1 did transport one of the substrates tested, lack of detectable transport could be due to the absence of GLMP in this system. Second, is GLMP an obligate partner for MFSD1 stabilization irrespective of the cellular compartment MFSD1 finds itself in or solely for protection from the degradative environment within lysosomes?</p><p>3) There is a lack of direct demonstration that GLMP glycosylation directly shields MFSD1 from proteases versus other alternatives such a role for GLMP in promoting a more stable conformation of MFSD1. Furthermore, GLMP stability is also highly dependent on MFSD1 which was shown not to be glycosylated. As a result, there is currently too much emphasis on the model wherein GLMP glycosylation is protective. Although the Discussion briefly acknowledges this issue, this acknowledgement is over-shadowed by emphasis on the idea that the glycosylation of GLMP is directly responsible for the protection of MFSD1. Unless more direct data can be provided in support of this concept, a more balanced presentation is required.</p><p>4) Figure 1D: along with enrichment of MFSD1 and LAMP1 in the lysosomal fractions, absence of enrichment for other organelle markers (Golgi, mitochondria, ER) should also be documented.</p><p>5) Some additional caution is required in the interpretation of the results as the authors do not identify the substrate(s) transported by MFSD1 or whether their excessive accumulation is responsible for the phenotypes observed in the MFSD1 KO animals. Although it is reasonable to predict that loss of MFSD1 transporter function is the cause of the KO phenotypes, it remains possible that loss of some other function of either MFSD1 or GLMP is also a contributing factor.

However CHAPS, the detergent used for these experiments, is known to maintain large portions of membrane attached to proteins. Thus, the apparent interaction may well be indirect. FRET is also not conclusive evidence of direct binding. Interpretation of the co-IP data should be further strengthened with the use of negative control lysosomal integral membrane proteins. Depending on the outcome of such experiments, the description of this result may need to be rephrased to indicate that the interaction isn't necessarily direct.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewers that the choice of detergent for solubilization is critical for the specificity of co-immunoprecipitation experiments and that CHAPS-solubilizations retains also low-affinity interactions and might even retain unspecific interaction of proteins with unappropriated washing conditions. In order to strengthen our conclusion that the interaction between MFSD1 and GLMP is specific, we followed the suggestion of the reviewers and repeated the co-immunoprecipitation experiments with additional negative controls, both a negative control for the immunoprecipitation (LAMP1-HA) but also an additional antigen detected after immunoprecipitation (LIMP2, another lysosomal integral membrane protein).</p><p>We included LAMP1-HA already in our experiments shown in the first version of the manuscript. LAMP1-HA was expressed / precipitated with the HA antibody with lower efficiency compared to GLMP-HA and we, therefore, didn`t initially show it. However, even long exposure of the blot showed no co-immunoprecipitation of MFSD1. We now show these additional lanes in Figure 5A (left panel).</p><p>To additionally support the co-IP data also with an additional control for a possibly unspecifically bound (lysosomal integral membrane) protein (LIMP2), we repeated the co-IPs with GFP-tagged MFSD1 and HA-tagged GLMP. C-terminally GFP-tagged MFSD1 was efficiently precipitated using the GFP antibody, and HA-tagged GLMP was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated, but not HA-tagged LAMP1 included as a negative control. As an additional negative control, we detected the lysosomal membrane protein LIMP2 on the membranes after immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE. Endogenous LIMP2 was efficiently detected in the lysates, but no LIMP2 was detectable in the lanes after precipitation with the GFP antibody, indicating sufficient washing and providing additional evidence for specificity of the chosen conditions for MFSD1 and GLMP co-immunoprecipitation. These data are included as Figure 5—figure supplement 1B.</p><p>In summary, we think our data provide sufficient evidence to state that the conditions chosen for IP, together with FRET experiments show a specific physical interaction between MFSD1 and GLMP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should address whether or not the plasma membrane-localized dileucine mutant of MFSD1 still interacts with GLMP. Answers to this question are relevant for addressing two distinct concerns. First, this relates to the possibility that the negative results for the MFSD1 dileucine mutant transport assays could arise due to a problem with GLMP interactions at the plasma membrane. It is possible that even if MFSD1 did transport one of the substrates tested, lack of detectable transport could be due to the absence of GLMP in this system.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers and tested if MFSD1 and GLMP not only interact in the lysosomal membrane but also if the plasma membrane localized mutants interact by co-immunoprecipitation. For this purpose, we directed both proteins to the plasma membrane by mutating their corresponding sorting signals (dileucine-motif in MFSD1, see Figure 1, tyrosine-based sorting motif in GLMP). We could not use the MFSD1 antibody for the immunoprecipitation, since the mutation of the two critical leucines in the sorting motif of MFSD1 are located within the peptide used for immunization and the mutation renders the MFSD1<sup>LL/AA</sup> protein undetectable by our antibody. We, therefore, used GFP tagged MFSD1 for this experiment. We precipitated MFSD1<sup>LL/AA</sup>-GFP with an antibody against GFP. HA-tagged GLMPY<sup>400A</sup> was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated, though less efficient compared to the precipitation with (wildtype) MFSD1-GFP. LAMP1<sup>Y414A</sup>-HA, a surface localized mutant of LAMP1 used as a negative control, was not precipitated. In summary, these data show that the interaction between MFSD1<sup>LL/AA</sup> and GLMP<sup>Y400A</sup> not only occurs intracellularly but also at the plasma membrane. The data support the validity of these constructs for the transporter-assays. The data are included in Figure 5—figure supplement 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, is GLMP an obligate partner for MFSD1 stabilization irrespective of the cellular compartment MFSD1 finds itself in or solely for protection from the degradative environment within lysosomes?</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed an interesting and intriguing point. We tested this experimentally by using proteolytic fragmentation of MFSD1 as a readout for stabilization, which occurs in lysosomes by acid proteases (Figure 6G, Figure 6—figure supplement 1), already suggesting that GLMP confers protection specifically from lysosomal proteases. We reasoned that if GLMP would be obligate for protection or maybe even proper folding, that such fragments can be used as an indicator for stability. We overexpressed the plasma membrane localized MFSD1<sup>LL/AA</sup>-HA and wildtype MFSD1-HA and directly compared the levels of the C-terminal fragment. In contrast to MFSD1-HA, no C-terminal fragments were observed when MFSD1-HA is targeted to the plasma membrane, indicating that fragmentation only occurs in lysosomes and is not a result of misfolding or general destabilization. These data are now presented in Figure 6—figure supplement 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There is a lack of direct demonstration that GLMP glycosylation directly shields MFSD1 from proteases versus other alternatives such a role for GLMP in promoting a more stable conformation of MFSD1. Furthermore, GLMP stability is also highly dependent on MFSD1 which was shown not to be glycosylated. As a result, there is currently too much emphasis on the model wherein GLMP glycosylation is protective. Although the Discussion briefly acknowledges this issue, this acknowledgement is over-shadowed by emphasis on the idea that the glycosylation of GLMP is directly responsible for the protection of MFSD1. Unless more direct data can be provided in support of this concept, a more balanced presentation is required.</p></disp-quote><p>Our efforts to experimentally strengthen the relevance of glycosylation of GLMP for the stability of the complex between MFSD1 and GLMP were unsuccessful. We created a GLMP cDNA in which the critical asparagine residue of all putative N-glycosylation sites (9 in total) were changed to alanine. We thought to use this construct for rescue experiments, in order to figure out if unglycosylated GLMP can still rescue MFSD1 in GLMP KO MEFs. However, this mutant was fully retained in the ER, likely due to misfolding, and could not be used for such experiments.</p><p>We therefore tried to present the data more balanced and not focusing too much on the glycosylation aspect. However, we think there is good evidence given also the cited literature in the Discussion on other pairs of interaction partners and we think that this is an important aspect that should still be covered at least in the Discussion.</p><p>Specifically, we removed the concluding sentence at the very end of the Discussion, removed the emphasis on N-glycosylation of GLMP and non-glycosylation of MFSD1 throughout the manuscript and added a part in the Discussion that the interaction might be relevant for promoting a stable conformation. The following part of the Discussion covers these aspects:</p><p>“On the other hand, while this explanation sounds reasonable for MFSD1, the levels of GLMP in Mfsd1 KO cells are also strikingly reduced, and the stability of GLMP apparently also critically depends on the non-glycosylated MFSD1, a counter-intuitive finding that implicates that not only glycosylation matters, but also the protein-protein interaction is essential to maintain a stable protease-resistant complex. It would be of great interest to determine the interaction in more detail, and which protein domains / loops of GLMP and MFSD1 convey this interaction. Additionally GLMP might be important for promoting a more stable conformation of MFSD1, and it would be interesting to figure out if the two proteins already interact in the ER. Once a natural substrate for MFSD1 is identified, a major question is of course if the interaction with GLMP is also essential for the transport, e.g. by mediating substrate recognition or increase substrate supply. Unlike channels or enzymes that are relatively static, solute carriers (to which the MFS-family belongs to) must undergo rapid conformational changes during their functions. Therefore, the presence of a stable globular protein domain may affect the conformational dynamics of these solute carriers and directly regulate its transporter activity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 1D: along with enrichment of MFSD1 and LAMP1 in the lysosomal fractions, absence of enrichment for other organelle markers (Golgi, mitochondria, ER) should also be documented.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that additional markers are helpful to better judge about the enrichment of lysosomes in the magnetite-isolated lysosome-enriched fractions. We therefore included immunoblots for the Golgi (GM130), ER (KDEL) and mitochondria (VDAC). These experiments show that there is some contamination of the (lysosome-enriched-) fractions with mitochondria and Golgi vesicles, which is, however, minor compared to the striking enrichment of the lysosomal marker LAMP1 (and MFSD1). We would additionally like to refer to the paper in which the method was described in detail and additional markers were tested. (Thelen et al., 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Some additional caution is required in the interpretation of the results as the authors do not identify the substrate(s) transported by MFSD1 or whether their excessive accumulation is responsible for the phenotypes observed in the MFSD1 KO animals. Although it is reasonable to predict that loss of MFSD1 transporter function is the cause of the KO phenotypes, it remains possible that loss of some other function of either MFSD1 or GLMP is also a contributing factor. These possibilities should be acknowledged and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and added a paragraph in the Discussion:</p><p>“However, while it is reasonable to assume that the accumulation of a toxic substrate or dysfunction of lysosomes due to the loss of the transporter function of MFSD1 is the underlying cause for the observed severe phenotype in Mfsd1 and Glmp KO mouse strains, we cannot provide final certainty for this hypothesis. We cannot finally exclude that GLMP might also interact with other (lysosomal membrane) proteins or provides general stability for the lysosomal membrane like LAMP proteins do. MFSD1 might be important for indirectly transporter-related functions like nutrient sensing or even transporter-unrelated processes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Lysosome function in MFSD1 and GLMP KOs should be analyzed more carefully. Although it is implied, there is no clear demonstration of any lysosome defects. At minimum, a careful analysis of their morphology seems warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important point. In fact we found no evidence for lysosomal storage like enlarged lysosomes or hypertrophy of lysosomal enzymes in the liver or MEFs, as typically observed under conditions of lysosomal storage, a finding that is still puzzling for us. We now included these “negative findings” in supplementary figures:</p><p>- Electron microscopy images of hepatocytes were included (Figure 2—figure supplement 1H) to reveal similar ultrastructure of lysosomes between wildtype and Mfsd1 KO mice;</p><p>- We measured the activity of three lysosomal hydrolases to test for hyperactivity / hypertrophy of the lysosomal system (Figure 2—figure supplement 1I);</p><p>- We stained MEFs for LAMP1, cathepsin D and LysoTracker in order to qualitatively test for acidification of lysosomes, delivery of cathepsin D to lysosomes and lysosomal size in MEFs of Mfsd1 and Glmp KO mice (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A).</p><p>Additionally we, highlighted in the Discussion that we did <italic>not</italic> find any evidence for lysosomal storage.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“Our major goal of this study was to identify the substrate(s) of MFSD1 by analyzing knockout mice, assuming that a substrate accumulates in lysosomes. The phenotype of Mfsd1 KO mice is complex and the liver phenotype did not resemble that observed in mouse models of lysosomal storage diseases. We failed to detect any signs of typical lysosomal storage like aberrant storage material or enlarged lysosomes in the liver or MEFs.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
