Less frequent mutations in Ras are poorly characterized for their oncogenic potential. Yet insight into their mechanism of action may point to novel opportunities to target Ras. Here, we show that several cancer-associated mutations in the switch III region moderately increase Ras activity in all isoforms. Mutants are biochemically inconspicuous, while their clustering into nanoscale signaling complexes on the plasma membrane, termed nanocluster, is augmented. Nanoclustering dictates downstream effector recruitment, MAPK-activity, and tumorigenic cell proliferation. Our results describe an unprecedented mechanism of signaling protein activation in cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08905.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08905.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08905.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancer is a disease that develops when cells within the body acquire genetic mutations that allow them to grow and divide rapidly. Many human cancers have mutations in a gene that encodes a protein called Ras, which promotes cell growth and division by controlling the activities of other proteins.</p><p>Ras congregates at the membrane that surrounds the cell and can assemble into clusters (called nanoclusters) that each contain six to eight Ras proteins. The tight packing of the proteins in these nanoclusters increases the amount of Ras in the membrane locally, which allows Ras to interact with other proteins more efficiently to promote growth and cell division.</p><p>In normal cells, other proteins control when Ras is active. However, in many cancer cells, Ras is active all the time due to mutations that occur in three ‘hotspots’ within its gene. Other mutations in the gene that encodes Ras are also found in cancer cells, but these are less common and it is not clear how they alter the activity of the protein.</p><p>Here, Solman et al. used microscopy and biochemical techniques to study the effects of some of the less common mutations on Ras activity in human cells. The experiments show that several mutations that alter a region of Ras called the ‘switch III region’ moderately increase the activity of Ras. The mutations probably alter the way that Ras sits in the membrane, which in turn changes the way it interacts with other proteins and the membrane so that more Ras nanoclusters form.</p><p>Solman et al.'s findings reveal a new way that Ras can be activated in cancer cells. The next challenge is to develop drugs that block the formation of Ras nanoclusters and to find out if they have the potential to be used to treat cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

dynamically anchored to cellular membranes. Its principal steady-state localization is the plasma membrane, from where most of Ras signaling emerges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hancock., 2003</xref>). Ras hyperactivation is a hallmark of cancer and has long been considered to be pharmacologically intractable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cox et al., 2014</xref>). However, recent progress encourages the pursuit of specific Ras protein inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Spiegel et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Since the seminal publication of Scheffzeck et al., it is well understood that hot-spot mutations in codons 12, 13, and 61 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Scheffzek et al., 1997</xref>), which account for &gt;99% of Ras mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prior et al., 2012</xref>), primarily compromise its GAP-dependent hydrolase activity. These oncogenic lesions render Ras transforming and tumorigenic, as they leave Ras constitutively GTP bound and therefore ready to overdrive in particular the Ras/MAPK pathway, which critically controls cell division and other oncogenic processes. A different mutational spectrum is found in RASopathies, developmental syndromes that are characterized by facio-cutaneous malformations, heart developmental and neurodevelopmental defects, as well as a predisposition to certain cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schubbert et al., 2007</xref>). These syndromes are also characterized by a hyperactivation of the Ras/MAPK-signaling pathway. For example, in Noonan syndrome, <italic>NRAS</italic> or <italic>KRAS</italic> can be mutated at various positions along their coding sequences in the germline. The exact molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to the observed phenotypes are still largely unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prior et al., 2012</xref>). For non hot-spot mutations in Ras that coincide with the known nucleotide binding regions, the G1–G5 boxes, mechanistic explanations for aberrant activities have been demonstrated or proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schubbert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gremer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prior et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cirstea et al., 2013</xref>). Whether and how additional mutations across the remainder of the coding sequence of Ras affect its pathogenic activity is largely unknown.</p><p>Ras activity emerges in the plasma membrane, where 20–50% of Ras proteins are organized into isoform-specific, dynamic proteo-lipid complexes that contain 6–8 Ras proteins, termed nanocluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abankwa et al., 2007</xref>). The tight packing of this signaling protein increases its concentration locally and thus enables more efficient effector recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rotblat et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guzmán et al., 2014b</xref>). It was proposed that nanoclustering is a basic systems-level design principle for the generation of high-fidelity signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tian et al., 2007</xref>). Essentially only three regulators (galectin-1 [Gal-1], galectin-3, and nucleophosmin) of Ras nanoclustering, so called nanocluster scaffolds, are known. The lectin Gal-1 is the best characterized nanocluster scaffold, which increases H-ras-GTP nanoclustering and effector recruitment, effectively by stabilizing immobile H-ras-GTP nanocluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rotblat et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We previously revealed another aspect of Ras membrane organization, showing that a novel switch III in Ras is somehow coupled to the reorientation of H-ras on the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Mutations in the switch III and the structural elements of H-ras that stabilize its reorientation (helix α4 and the C-terminal hypervariable region [hvr]) systematically modulate Ras signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gorfe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abankwa et al., 2008b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2010</xref>). More recently, we addressed the mechanistic basis of this activity modulation for computational modeling-derived mutations on helix α4 and the hvr: these alter engagement of the nanocluster modulator Gal-1 and thus H-ras nanoclustering. As a consequence of this up-concentration, effector recruitment and subsequent downstream signaling are increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guzmán et al., 2014b</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report that cancer-associated mutations in the switch III region of the three major Ras oncoproteins, H-, N-, and K-ras, increase Ras activity by a novel disease mechanism, namely signaling protein nanocluster augmentation. We find that these mutations do not alter basic biochemical functions of Ras in solution. Instead, a strict correlation between increased recruitment of the effector to Ras and augmented nanoclustering of Ras on cellular membranes is found. Upregulated effector engagement is directly reflected in the elevated cellular Ras activity, and significantly impacts on the tumorigenic potential. Our results reveal a new mechanism of mutational signaling pathway hyperactivation in a pathophysiological setting and suggest Ras nanoclusters as direct drug targets.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The switch III region of H-ras couples to G-domain reorientation</title><p>H-ras exists in a nucleotide-dependent conformational equilibrium on the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gorfe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abankwa et al., 2008b</xref>). The two delimiting conformers are stabilized by either helix α4 or the hvr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Conformer reorientation on the membrane was associated with a novel switch III region, which is formed by the β2-β3-loop and helix α5. However, formal proof for their mechanistic connection is still missing.</p><p>We previously found that mutations in the hvr or on helix α4 (left and right tables on top in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) alter the activity of GTP-H-ras, probably by stabilizing preferred conformers (red and blue GTP-H-ras conformers, respectively, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) similar to the nucleotide-dependent ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gorfe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abankwa et al., 2008b</xref>). More recent evidence from these helix α4 and hvr GTP-H-ras mutants suggests that the conformational state couples to nanoscale Ras-signaling hubs in the membrane, termed nanocluster (middle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guzmán et al., 2014b</xref>). Nanoclustering then critically determines the recruitment rate of the effector Raf from the cytoplasm to membrane bound Ras and therefore the initiating event of the MAPK-signaling cascade (bottom in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08905.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Intramolecular switch III-conformer coupling suggests altered nanoclustering in switch III mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of conformer-nanocluster coupling and its effect on H-ras signaling. For GTP-Ras a conformational equilibrium is assumed, which can be shifted by mutations as indicated by matching colors (top tables, show mutations by region in Ras). Mutations in the table increase (red) or decrease/neutralize (blue) H-ras activity. For mutations boxed in bold this was previously shown to proceed by increasing or decreasing H-ras nanoclustering, respectively. As a consequence, the effector recruitment and thus downstream signaling are correspondingly modulated. Note, that a direct effect of the Ras conformation on effector engagement is not excluded. The green scenario represents the normal activity, which is predicted for the combinations of activity increasing and decreasing/neutralizing mutations (green scenario in centre), if switch III couples to H-ras reorientation.

Mutation R128A,R135A decreases H-rasG12V nanoclustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guzmán et al., 2014b</xref>), however, on its own it has only a small decreasing or neutral effect on H-ras activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abankwa et al., 2008b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2010</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>To measure the specific activity of H-ras mutants in mammalian cell lines, we used our well-established effector-recruitment FRET assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abankwa et al., 2008b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guzmán et al., 2014b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We coexpressed mGFP-tagged H-ras mutants and the mRFP-tagged Ras binding domain of C-Raf (in the following in short RBD) in BHK cells and monitored the change of FRET using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>).</p><p>In agreement with our model of switch III coupling to the orientation of Ras on the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Abankwa et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2008b</xref>), activating mutations D47A,E49A in the switch III region were neutralized by inactivating mutations R128A,R135A on helix α4, while the inactivating mutation R161A in switch III was neutralized by activating R169A,K170A in the hvr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These results therefore agree with an allosteric coupling of the switch III region to the reorientation of H-ras on the membrane. Furthermore, they imply that mutations in the switch III could alter Ras nanoclustering, possibly by a conformation-associated mechanism, which we are however not going to focus on in the following, but discuss in detail at the end.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Computational modeling-derived switch III mutations affect H-ras signaling output by increasing nanocluster</title><p>We next explored whether altered nanoclustering also underlies the activity changes that we previously observed for computational modeling-derived switch III mutant H-rasG12V-D47A,E49A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abankwa et al., 2008b</xref>).

We observed a significant increase in nanoclustering of this modeling-derived mutant, suggesting that increased signaling originates from augmented nanoclustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In order to corroborate these data, we used our recently established Gal-1-dose dependent nanoclustering-response assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guzmán et al., 2014b</xref>). This assay measures the dependence of H-ras-mutant nanoclustering on different cellular levels of the nanocluster scaffold Gal-1.

Only nanoclustering of GTP-loaded Ras is relevant for its signaling output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tian et al., 2007</xref>). We therefore clamped all mutations in the GTP-state, by co-introduction of the G12V mutation. This also allowed us to compare results with those of the computational modeling-derived mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1, 2</xref>). We then ensured by a comprehensive set of biochemical experiments that the same mutations in the wild type background did not alter essential activities of Ras, such as GTP-loading, GTP-hydrolysis or effector binding, which classically increase Ras activity.</p><p>Given that the switch III region is most frequently mutated across all Ras isoforms, we focused on patient samples with mutations in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Curiously, this mutation G48R is found together with a second D92N-mutation in H-ras.</p><p>Confocal colocalization analysis confirmed that the localization of both mutants in BHK cells was unaltered as compared to parent H-rasG12V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Assuming that the G48R,D92N mutations were gain of function, we combined these cancer-associated mutations with the inactivating mutation R128A,R135A on helix α4. This new mutant showed normalized H-ras activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), comparable to the modeling-derived orientation-switch III mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This suggested that the cancer-associated mutation is also coupled to the reorientation mechanism of membrane bound H-ras and may thus also impact on its nanoclustering. Indeed, electron microscopic analysis of plasma membrane sheets derived from BHK cells expressing the single or double-mutant revealed a strong and significant increase in nanoclustering of both mutants as compared to the parent H-rasG12V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This was confirmed by nanoclustering-FRET analysis in cells, where consistent with the increased Gal-1 complexation of the G48R-mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), the Gal-1-dose-dependent nanoclustering response was significantly increased for both the G48R and G48R,D92N mutants at all Gal-1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Moreover, the Gal-1-dose-dependent RBD recruitment response of both mutants was increased in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), while RBD-binding in vitro remained indistinguishable from the parent Ras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The correlation of the RBD- and nanoclustering-response pattern again suggested that augmented nanoclustering increased H-ras activity by enhancing effector recruitment.

How could the conformation couple to nanoclustering? To address this question, we will here try to synthesize the most recent work on the structure and conformation of Ras in particular in the lipid environment. We will furthermore relate this to the assembly of switch III-mutated Ras into dimers and oligomers in nanoscale clusters in the membrane and ultimately to effector activation.</p><p>Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that Ras isoforms change their conformation via different intramolecular routes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gorfe et al., 2008</xref>). An important shared feature is that the identical effector lobe of Ras, which contains the switch I, II, and III regions actuates the C-terminal helix α5. This might provide the mechanistic explanation of how the nucleotide exchange-induced structural change is converted into different Ras isoform-specific conformational equilibria on the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Abankwa et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>A milestone work by Mazhab-Jafari et al. has recently provided the first structural data on membrane bound K-ras4B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mazhab-Jafari et al., 2015</xref>). Their data suggest at least two conformational states, with the GTP-state displaying an occluded effector-binding site. Conversely, in the GDP-state the G-domain contacts the membrane via helix α4 and α5 thus exposing the effector interaction site. Also for N-ras low-resolution spectroscopic data support a nucleotide-dependent conformational change on the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kapoor et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2012b</xref>). Importantly, the K-ras conformational reorientation resembles the one that is here assumed for H-ras. Interestingly, an inverse role of helix α4 in stabilizing GDP- and GTP-conformations of H- and K-ras is implied, which matches to experimental data that we have provided earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Abankwa et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore H- and K-ras reorientation may work just in the opposite fashion.</p><p>However, the effect of the conformational change can be several fold. On the one hand, Ras dimer formation and oligomerization into nanocluster might become altered. Evidence for dimers of H-ras and N-ras in the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2014;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18a">Güldenhaupt et al., 2012</xref>) and K-ras even in solution (at micromolar concentrations) has recently been provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muratcioglu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nan et al., 2015</xref>). The structural data of K-ras dimers suggest that K-ras might preferentially dimerize via specific surfaces in both the GTP- and GDP-state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muratcioglu et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the more stable β-dimer, which interfaces basically via the effector lobe of Ras, could prevent effector access. Similarly, coarse grain simulations of the clustering behavior of membrane-bound H-ras in two different conformations (basically corresponding to those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) revealed that depending on the conformational state, preferred interfaces of the Ras proteins could be utilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li and Gorfe, 2013</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, a mutation-induced conformational change may directly affect effector engagement, as has been proposed for H-ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Abankwa et al., 2008a</xref>) and shown for K-ras on nanodiscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mazhab-Jafari et al., 2015</xref>). However, the mechanistic basis of how Ras activation is propagated is further complicated by the fact that we still lack detailed structural insight into for example, the precise activation of effectors, such as Raf. Ras-GTP nanoclusters are immobile, suggesting that a transient signaling machinery is built up, which is also coupled or trapped by the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kusumi et al., 2012</xref>). The (isoform- or mutation-) specific GTP-Ras conformational states on the membrane may differentially engage Raf-isoforms thus allosterically enabling specific Ras-Raf-isoform coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Abankwa et al., 2010</xref>). Here, the Ras-isoform-specific (acidic) membrane environment needs to be considered, as it is significant to retain clustered Raf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Plowman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho et al., 2012</xref>). Nanocluster formation can in addition be facilitated by nanocluster scaffolds, such as Gal-1. Gal-1 is typically dimeric suggesting that in nanoclusters, dimeric Ras–Raf units may exist. Of note, the lipid anchors of Ras alone are sufficient to drive higher order clustering of both Ras and Raf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nan et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Additional support for a role of stoichiometric Ras–Raf complexes in nanocluster is lent by the fact that Raf dimerization inducing compounds can increase Ras nanoclustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, dimeric signaling units may be both the outcome, as well as the driver of multimeric nanocluster formation. This nanoclustering promoting activity of Raf-inhibitors might underlie the paradoxical hyperactivation of Ras signaling in Ras mutant tumors. Intriguingly, these Raf inhibitors act Ras isoform specifically on K- and N-ras-nanoclustering, suggesting that additional factors break the promiscuity of ‘dimer inducers’. Given that membrane anchored (nanoclustered) Raf is constitutively active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nan et al., 2013</xref>), facilitation of this effector clustering process is critical for downstream signaling output.</p><p>In the light of the complexity of the events that lead from Ras activation to conformational changes, oligomerization and effector recruitment, we here refrained from making any conformational predictions for the cancer-associated mutations of N- and K-ras. These would have to be experimentally established by high-resolution methods. We therefore limited ourselves to nanoclustering as an activity predicting observable.</p><p>If Ras dimerization or multimerization into nanocluster is so crucial for signal propagation, why is it not more frequently exploited in cancer? First of all, next to mutations in Ras that we have just described, one would have to take mutations and expression changes in largely unknown nanocluster scaffolds into account. Secondly, based on our data Ras activity is typically up-tuned 2–3 fold by nanoclustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guzmán et al., 2014b</xref>). By contrast, GEF activation switches Ras on in an ‘all-or-nothing’ fashion (and GAPs off in the same manner), changing the enzymatic activity of Ras by 100 or even &gt;50,000-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eccleston et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ford et al., 2006</xref>). This would approximate the relative difference in Ras activity induced by hot-spot mutations and is much higher than activity changes by switch III-nanocluster mutations. Correspondingly, one could expect that this relation be to some extent reflected in the relative abundance (∼1/2300) of switch III mutations in cancer. Currently it is unclear, whether there is a particular relevance for switch III mutations in certain cancer types, as the frequencies are too low for any conclusive statement. Likewise, it is unclear whether these mutations represent remnants of early mutational events in tumors or stem from certain niches of it. Given the large activity difference, it is obvious that switch III mutated clones would easily be outcompeted by Ras hot-spot-mutated clones in a tumor. These features combined with the fact that switch III mutations may be associated with conformational changes in Ras that alter effector engagement, suggest that these mutations belong to the recently proposed class of ‘latent driver’ mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nussinov and Tsai, 2015</xref>). Latent drivers are non-hotspot, lower frequency mutations, which appear like passenger mutations in that they do not cause malignancy. However, it is speculated that in a certain context they could provide a growth advantage.</p><p>In addition to cancer samples with switch III mutations, we also investigated two mutations that are found in RASopathies. It was previously speculated that the Noonan syndrome-associated mutation N-ras-T50I might be linked to the orientation-switch III mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cirstea et al., 2010</xref>). However, our data on this mutation do not support a gain-of-function downstream of GTP-loaded Ras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–F</xref>), neither could we observe any change in EGF-dependent Ras activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Likewise, we did not observe any changes by mutation V152G in K-ras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus RASopathy-associated switch III mutations do not show changes in nanoclustering, but may have unknown alterations (N-rasT50I, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cirstea et al., 2010</xref>]; K-rasV152G, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; K-ras-E153V and K-ras-F156L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gremer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mazhab-Jafari et al., 2015</xref>]).</p><p>Given the evidence for nanoclustering of a number of other signaling proteins, such as GPI-anchored proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goswami et al., 2008</xref>), heterotrimeric G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abankwa and Vogel, 2007</xref>), Rho- and Rab-small GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Köhnke et al., 2012</xref>), as well as Src-family kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Najumudeen et al., 2013</xref>), it is timely to consider this mode of activity regulation as a new fundamental building block in the cellular signaling architecture.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>DNA constructs and molecular cloning</title><p>Plasmids pmGFP-H-rasG12V, pmGFP-H-RasG12V-D47A,E49A, pmGFP-H-rasG12V-R169A,K170A, pmGFP-H-rasG12V-R128A,R135A, pmCFP-K-rasG12V, pmCit-N-rasG12V, pmRFP-C-Raf-RBD, and mRFP-Gal-1 were described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abankwa et al.

In proliferation assays, 500 cells were seeded per well in a 96-well plate and grown for 72 hr. At intervals of 24 hr, 15 µl AlamarBlue (Thermo Fisher Scientific Invitrogen) was added to each well, and after 3 hr of incubation, fluorescence intensity was measured at an excitation of 570 nm and an emission of 590 nm using a Synergy H1 Hybrid Reader (BioTek). The fluorescence values at each timepoint were normalized to the value at 0 hr and plotted. The error bars represent ±SEM. For each experimental condition, data are averages of data points that were acquired in hexaduplicate in each of three biological repeats. In a focus formation assay, 1,500 cells were seeded per well of a 6-well plate. After 7 days of growth, cells were fixed with 4% PFA, stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 10% ethanol for 15 min and washed with PBS to remove excess stain. The average colony area percentage from three independent biological repeats was calculated using the ‘ColonyArea’ ImageJ plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guzmán et al., 2014a</xref>).

After 10–14 days of growth, cells were fixed in methanol/acetone (1:1) and washed with PBS. Colonies were imaged using a Zeiss SteREO Lumar V12 stereomicroscope. Analysis was done using the ImageJ software. First, the background was subtracted using the rolling ball function with a radius of 50 μm, then auto-tresholding was applied to separate the colonies. Area percentage was calculated using the ImageJ built-in function ‘Analyze Particles’ with exclusion of particles smaller than 500 μm<sup>2</sup> that are not considered colonies.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Tony Hunter (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The paper explores the roles of mutations in the newly identified “switch III” region of Ras. Such mutations are found at low frequency in human tumors. They were predicted to potentially affect Ras orientation in the membrane and nanoclustering. The authors find that the mutations studied do significantly affect nanoclustering and effector recruitment in cells, while having little effect on biochemical measures of Ras activity in vitro. The results support the concept that increased nanoclustering may be selected for in cancer.</p><p>The reviewers do not request major new experiments, however, it is clear from the reviews (provided below) that the presentation requires improvement. The reviewers have discussed their individual comments and arrived at the following consensus:</p><p>1) The initial models should be presented more clearly (ideally naming the two conformations (e.g. A and B, or red and blue as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and distinguishing the conformation from the degree of clustering), and the data should be summarized (e.g. in a table documenting conformation, clustering, RBD recruitment and other assays for each mutant) so as to help the reader follow the interpretation. The table should include the Noonan mutations for which you find no evidence for activation.</p><p>2) In light of recent developments, please revise your Discussion to put your observations into structural context.</p><p>3) Please reconsider the title. “Cancer associated mutations in the switch III region of Ras increase tumorigenicity by nanocluster augmentation” sounds inclusive, implying that all cancer-associated mutations in switch III have the same effect. Your results indicate a more nuanced conclusion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Ras family proteins are closely related in basic structure and all are transforming, yet they differ in their utilization of different effectors and their mutation spectra in cancer. Understanding the nuances of Ras activity is undoubtedly important scientifically and medically. This paper focuses on unusual Ras mutations found in rare cancers and RASopathies.</p><p>Abankwa and colleagues previously showed that Ras adopts alternative conformations at the plasma membrane, depending on its GTP state, stabilized by membrane interactions with basic residues in α4 and the hypervariable region (HVR). The alternative conformations have different access to effectors, hence affecting signaling even by GTPase-defective RasG12V. They previously proposed that guanine nucleotides regulate the orientation in the membrane through a conformation switch in β2-3 and α5 (“switch 3”), which is then relayed to α4 and HVR. Here they test that proposal by combining activating (D47A, E49A) and inactivating (R161A) switch 3 mutations with α4 and HVR mutations. Their results agree with their predictions. They also measured nanoclustering using EM and FRET approaches. They found that the activating mutations in switch 3 augment nanoclustering and RafRBD recruitment by RasG12V, and signaling is further stimulated by expressing galectin-1, which they showed before further augments nanoclustering. Increased RBD recruitment was not due to an increase in affinity of the purified Ras, but was only detected when membrane was present. However, it isn't clear how much of the increase in signaling is due to increased nanoclustering and how much is due to additional stabilization of the more accessible conformation.</p><p>The effects of Ras mutations on membrane orientation and effector binding were previously inferred by Abankwa and Hancock using indirect assays and molecular dynamics simulations. These inferences were recently borne out by the KRas4B.GDP and GMPPNP NMR structures that were recently published in PNAS, showing that the effector domain of Ras.GTP is partially occluded when bound to a model membrane (May 26 2015 issue, Mohammad T. Mazhab-Jafari, 6625-6630, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1419895112">doi:10.1073/pnas.1419895112</ext-link>). It isn't clear how these NMR structures compare with the models proposed by Abankwa and colleagues. The Mazhab-Jafari paper also tested the effects of RASopathy (Noonan) mutations 5N and D153V on effector binding, and found that the mutations slightly increased the affinity of membrane-associated Ras for effectors but had no effect on free Ras. They proposed that decreased autoinhibition may account for the increased activity of these mutants. Mazhab-Jafari et al. did not address nanoclustering and did not test the same RASopathy mutations as have now been tested in the paper under review. Nevertheless, the new Mazhab-Jafari paper will lessen the impact of the present paper. New concepts have not been revealed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper explores the role of mutations in the switch III region of all Ras isoforms that may contribute to control of conformation and nanoclustering. The scope is to examine mutations that are predicted by earlier modeling and that exist naturally in tumors using electron microscopy and FRET to assess clustering and effector recruitment. Some analysis of signaling and transformation is also performed. Reading the paper is difficult because there is an ambiguity associated with discussing the conformers and if these are independent of the GTP/GDP state they need a clear definition for each, like A and B, etc. They refer to “conformer” in several places without specifying which conformer they are referring to, or as if there is a non-conformer or conformer state. They general fix the major which in the on position using the G12V mutant and then determine if mutations modulate self-FRET or RBD interactions. To me, these tools allow evaluation of clustering and RBD binding, but don't say much about conformation, which seems like a model to explain the findings, but they can otherwise make no strong conclusions. Another general comment is that they start with a strong emphasis on modeling based predictions, but then analyze several natural mutations with no prediction or reference back to the modeling to evaluate the negative and positive results obtained. In fact, they fail to provide any further comment when natural mutations in these regions have no effects on clustering or RBD binding. While the point is clearly to support the conformational switch III determinant in control of activity through nanoclustering, the analysis of the naturally existing mutations is not really pulled together to support this model.</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>1) The use of hetero-FRET to evaluate clusters with 4-6 molecules per cluster is not very sensitive and the changes in FRET efficiency are small. Homo-FRET based on polarization anisotropy would provide greater sensitivity for analysis of small clusters because the statistics of pairing donors and acceptors will be better.</p><p>2) Neither the hetero-FRET methods provide any direct insight into the proposed conformational changes. Is it not possible to directly evaluate the location of a probe integral to or associate with Ras and a membrane bound accepted (like a fluorescent lipid) to more directly assess the relationship of Ras to the membrane?</p><p>3) In the model driven mutational analysis they test certain combinations of mutations and find that all results are as they expect, but they don't test the entire matrix of combinations to show that combinations that they would not predict to be neutralizing show some dominance of the activating or inactivating mutation. Thus, “these results therefore corroborate that the switch III region is allosterically coupled to the reorientation of H-ras on the membrane” is not a strong conclusion.</p><p>4) The story would have more cohesion if they could make predictions or perhaps just provide some structural insight into the results with the cancer-associated mutations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is an important work from a group that pioneered the discovery of Ras nanoclusters. Here the authors take another step associating mutations in the switch III region with nanocluster augmentation and signaling, thus revealing a novel mechanism for oncogenic mutations. This mechanism is both logical and supported by the large body of experimental data that they obtained. As such, this manuscript merits publication.</p><p>It would have been nice if the authors were able to suggest a structural mechanism illustrating this significance, that is, how the mutations might lead to the consequences that they observe, although I realize that this is (very) difficult.</p><p>Second, as the authors indeed note, Ras nanoclustering for signal propagation (assuming the primary the Raf/MAPK pathway) is not reflected in the current oncogenic Ras mutations in cancer genome databases. Can the authors suggest why?</p><p>One possibility could relate to a newly proposed mechanism of allosteric ‘latent’ mutations (‘Latent drivers’ expand the cancer mutational landscape. Nussinov R, Tsai CJ. Curr Opin Struct Biol. 2015 doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sbi.2015.01.004">10.1016/j.sbi.2015.01.004.</ext-link>). A ‘latent’ mutation description would fit quite well the moderate properties described here.</p><p>Third, I do not understand why in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> mutations are labeled with no changes for V45V, D173D, R164R, and L171L.

We have made several changes to the first part of the Results, modified the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> legend and added the requested table to clarify the raised issues.</p><p>a) We explain that we are mainly talking about conformers in the GTP-state and refer to them as ‘red and blue’ (in the subsection “The switch III region of H-ras couples to G-domain reorientation” and in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). There we also clarify that we do not exclude a direct effect of conformation on effector engagement. We have reorganized <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, splitting the former panel (A) as a supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We have also moved all tables with mutations to the top of the former (B, C), in line with the flow of the text in the manuscript and indicated where the model is based on existing or predicted data. We believe that these changes have now made this figure clearer.</p><p>b) We interpret our data with respect to nanoclustering and not conformation, for reasons that we extensively outline in the Discussion. Essentially, it is too complex to make inferences about the conformation, based on the nanoclustering data.</p><p>c) In addition, we have now prepared a summary table of all Ras mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), which gives an overview of the qualitative results in the various assays that we performed.</p><p><italic>2) In light of recent developments, please revise your Discussion to put your observations into structural context</italic>.</p><p>We have strived to discuss our work in the context of the most recent structural insights on Ras. In the Discussion, we synthesize recent structural, computational and microscopic data on Ras conformation, dimerization, nanoclustering and effector binding. We have included the suggested citations and added several other important citations.</p><p>More specifically, we discuss that conformation could affect Ras dimerization, and both could directly affect effector recruitment. We mention that effector activation in complex with Ras on the membrane is structurally unresolved, a major bottleneck in our understanding of Ras biology. We consider how nanocluster can be stabilized and that apparently effector dimers play a significant role.</p><p>We also discuss that the switch III mutations fit the criteria of ‘latent drivers’, which were proposed in the publication suggested by Reviewer 3 (please see in the Discussion: “If Ras di- or multimerisation […] could provide a growth advantage.”).</p><p>As Reviewer 3 pointed out, it is essentially not possible to predict conformational changes from our nanocluster data (see the Discussion: “In light of the complexity […] activity predicting observable”). Therefore, we speculate only for the H-ras switch III mutants in the new summary table on the conformation, as we have experimental evidence for this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Conscious of the general difficulty of connecting nanoclustering back to conformation, we focused our attention in the manuscript on Ras nanoclustering as the observable, which integrates any conformational or complexation (as additional binding partners may be recruited) change, while showing a tight correlation with functional output of Ras.</p><p><italic>3) Please reconsider the title. “Cancer associated mutations in the switch III region of Ras increase tumorigenicity by nanocluster augmentation” sounds inclusive, implying that all cancer-associated mutations in switch III have the same effect. Your results indicate a more nuanced conclusion</italic>.</p><p>We agree and have accordingly changed the title to: “Specific cancer associated mutations in the switch III region of Ras increase tumorigenicity by nanocluster augmentation”.</p><p>We hope that this change is sufficient to reflect the fact that we have only studied a subset of (naturally occurring) mutations in that region.</p></body></sub-article></article>
