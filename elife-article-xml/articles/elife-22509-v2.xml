EBV expresses viral oncogenes that promote cell growth and inhibit the apoptotic response to uncontrolled proliferation. The EBV oncoprotein LMP1 constitutively activates NFκB and is critical for survival of EBV-immortalized B cells. However, during early infection EBV induces rapid B cell proliferation with low levels of LMP1 and little apoptosis. Therefore, we sought to define the mechanism of survival in the absence of LMP1/NFκB early after infection. We used BH3 profiling to query mitochondrial regulation of apoptosis and defined a transition from uninfected B cells (BCL-2) to early-infected (MCL-1/BCL-2) and immortalized cells (BFL-1). This dynamic change in B cell survival mechanisms is unique to virus-infected cells and relies on regulation of MCL-1 mitochondrial localization and BFL-1 transcription by the viral EBNA3A protein. This study defines a new role for EBNA3A in the suppression of apoptosis with implications for EBV lymphomagenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22509.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22509.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22509.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Over 90% of adults around the world are infected with the Epstein-Barr virus. Like other closely related viruses, such as those that cause chicken pox and cold sores, an infection lasts for the rest of the person’s life, although the virus generally remains in a latent or dormant state. However, under certain conditions the latent viruses can cause cancers to develop; in fact, it is estimated that such infections are responsible for nearly 2% of all cancer deaths worldwide.</p><p>One way that healthy human cells prevent cancer is by triggering their own death in a process called apoptosis. The Epstein-Barr virus can block apoptosis, therefore making the cells more likely to become cancerous. Previous research identified one protein in the Epstein-Barr virus that promotes cancer by preventing infected cells from dying as normal. However, even in the absence of this protein, Epstein-Barr virus-infected cells remain resistant to apoptosis. This suggests that the virus has another way of blocking cell death.</p><p>Price et al. have now used a technique that stresses living cells in a way that reveals which proteins prevent apoptosis to study human cells infected with the Epstein-Barr virus. This revealed that soon after infection, the virus could force the human cell to produce MCL-1, a protein that prevents cell death. Later, the Epstein-Barr virus enlisted a second human protein called BFL-1, which makes the infected cell further resistant to apoptosis.</p><p>Price et al. discovered that a protein in the Epstein-Barr virus called EBNA3A controls the production of the MCL-1 and BFL-1 proteins. In the future, developing therapies that target these proteins may lead to new treatments for cancers caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. Such treatments would be likely to have fewer side effects for patients than traditional chemotherapies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

infectious agents like viruses. Of these, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was the first human tumor virus discovered and is associated with malignancies of both B lymphocyte and epithelial cell origin. Normally, T cells prevent the development of EBV-associated malignancies and the virus persists quiescently in latently-infected memory B cells. As a result, nearly all adults in the world are latently infected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Longnecker et al., 2013</xref>), making EBV a particularly widespread and successful pathogen. However, in the absence of a healthy immune system, such as following organ transplant or HIV infection, EBV can transform B cells leading to markedly increased rates of lymphoma in these populations.</p><p>Primary human B cell infection in vitro by EBV leads to their growth transformation and serves as a model for oncogenesis in EBV-associated lymphomas. This process requires the expression of six viral latent genes: Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen 1 (EBNA1), EBNA2, EBNA-LP, EBNA3A, EBNA3C and Latent Membrane Protein 1 (LMP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Longnecker et al., 2013</xref>). EBNA2, the major viral transcriptional activator and the first to be expressed upon infection, upregulates expression of the other viral EBNA genes as well as host genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zimber-Strobl and Strobl, 2001</xref>). EBNA2 also activates the expression of the viral oncoprotein LMP1, which drives the immortalization of the infected B cell into a lymphoblastoid cell line, or LCL, that proliferates indefinitely in culture. Together, the EBV latent oncoproteins mimic key aspects of normal B cell biology, promote proliferation, and inhibit the host innate tumor suppressor response to uncontrolled proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allday, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Price and Luftig, 2014</xref>).</p><p>It is well-established that the LMP1 oncoprotein is necessary for continued LCL growth and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaye et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zimber-Strobl et al., 1996</xref>). LMP1 mimics a pro-survival TNF receptor that signals constitutively through the NFκB pathway to promote proliferation and suppress apoptosis in transformed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cahir-McFarland et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Okan et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pratt et al., 2012</xref>). In fact, inhibition of the NFκB pathway activated downstream of LMP1 leads to apoptosis in LCLs. However, recent work from our laboratory has demonstrated that, early after infection, B cells rapidly proliferate despite low levels of LMP1 expression and NFκB activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nikitin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Price et al., 2012</xref>). Surprisingly, these early-infected cells also show no overt signs of apoptosis despite strong activation of the cellular DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nikitin et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that in early-infected cells, there is a viral-mediated mechanism independent of LMP1 signaling that promotes survival.</p><p>Several LMP1-independent mechanisms to subvert apoptosis have been described. For example, the viral BCL-2 homologue BHRF1 confers chemoresistance in a mouse model of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kvansakul et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, the viral BHRF1 and BALF1 proteins exert non-redundant roles in protecting initially infected cells from apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altmann and Hammerschmidt, 2005</xref>). In addition, expression of the EBNA3 proteins induces resistance to apoptosis in BL cells and primary B cells by downregulating Bim expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Paschos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Skalska et al., 2013</xref>), thereby making infected cells less ‘primed’ for apoptosis. The EBNA3 family is also known to epigenetically downregulate additional human genes involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allday, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harth-Hertle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hertle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Paschos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Skalska et al., 2013</xref>). It has been shown that the EBNA3 proteins mediate these epigenetic effects, in part, via interacting with additional proteins in such a way that chromatin architecture can be dramatically altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazot et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McClellan et al., 2013</xref>). While thought to be generally repressive in nature, recent work has shown that in some instances EBNA3 proteins can activate gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazot et al., 2015</xref>). In sum, viral proteins confer several survival advantages to infected cells, which often results in EBV-positive lymphomas that are more difficult to treat than their EBV-negative counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kelly et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The intrinsic apoptosis pathway is controlled by complex protein—protein interactions at the surface of mitochondria that regulate the release of cytochrome c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Youle and Strasser, 2008</xref>). These functional interactions can be interrogated with an established approach called ‘BH3 profiling’, which uses peptides derived from BH3-only pro-apoptotic proteins to identify the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members important for preventing apoptosis in a particular cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Del Gaizo Moore and Letai, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deng et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, molecular characterization of the interface between BH3 domains of these proteins has allowed for the creation of a new class of small molecule inhibitors that promote apoptosis directly in sensitive cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billard, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oltersdorf et al., 2005</xref>). These so-called ‘BH3 mimetics’ are highly specific and show great promise in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Letai, 2008</xref>). In this study, we characterized the BH3 profile of uninfected and EBV-infected primary human B cells from early proliferation through long-term outgrowth. We validated these profiles using BH3 mimetics and, importantly, identified a novel virus-specific transition in survival mechanisms between early and late stages of latent infection with implications for therapy of EBV-associated malignancies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BH3 profiling reveals two distinct stages of mitochondrial priming after EBV infection</title><p>Previously, our laboratory has identified an early period after EBV infection of primary human B cells where, despite robust virus-mediated proliferation and activation of the pro-apoptotic DNA damage response, there is little expression of the key viral survival factor LMP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Price et al., 2012</xref>). In order to define the mechanism of survival in the absence of LMP1 and NFκB activity early after infection, as well as through long-term outgrowth, we performed BH3 profiling to query apoptotic priming at the mitochondria of infected cells. Briefly, this technique works by permeabilizing cells, staining with a mitochondrial potential-sensitive dye, and then treating cells with peptides derived from the BH3 domains of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins, including the activator BH3-only protein BIM and the sensitizer BH3-only proteins BAD, PUMA, NOXA, BMF, and HRK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). By measuring mitochondrial depolarization induced by the activator BH3 peptide, BIM, and the pan-apoptotic sensitizer, PUMA, BH3 profiling can measure the overall ‘priming’ of the cells for apoptosis (that is, the cell's distance from the apoptotic threshold). Further, by measuring depolarization induced by the sensitizer BH3 peptides BAD, NOXA, BMF, and HRK, BH3 profiling can also determine the cell’s specific dependence on particular anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins, including BCL-2, BCL-XL, MCL-1, and BFL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Del Gaizo Moore and Letai, 2013</xref>). We BH3 profiled three cell states: (i) uninfected B cells purified from the peripheral blood of normal human donors (B Cell), (ii) FACS-purified proliferating EBV-infected B cells seven days post-infection (Prolif), and (iii) the resulting EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) derived five weeks post-infection from the same donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>).

EBV-infected proliferating B cells (Prolif) lost sensitivity to the Bad peptide but remained sensitive to Puma and Bmf, supporting a survival mechanism reliant on both MCL-1, to block Bad-induced depolarization, and BCL-2/BCL-w, to block Noxa-induced depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

To functionally characterize EBV-regulated survival, we first analyzed BCL-2 family member mRNA expression through B cell outgrowth. We observed that MCL-1 mRNA increased from uninfected B to EBV-infected and proliferating B cells and was further increased in LCLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Over the same infection time course, both BCL-2 and BFL-1 were initially downregulated in early proliferating B cells relative to uninfected B cells, then upregulated during LCL outgrowth.

At 2 days post-infection, a time point at which ABT-737 resistance first emerges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), P3HR1-infected cells express high levels of Wp-driven transcripts, but significantly less Cp-driven transcripts including EBNA2, EBNA3A, and EBNA3C relative to B95-8 infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). As recent work indicates that the viral BCL-2 homologue, BHRF1, is expressed from Wp during primary B cell infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kelly et al., 2009</xref>) and over-expression of BHRF1 can prevent apoptosis induced by ABT-737 in mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kvansakul et al., 2010</xref>), it was important to analyze BHRF1 expression. We found that P3HR1-infected cells expressed similar levels of BHRF1 as B95-8 infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Therefore, BHRF1 was not associated with ABT-737 resistance in early-infected B cells.</p><p>Resistance to ABT-737 could be conferred by EBNA2 or by a downstream target such as the EBNA3 proteins.

While △3C-infected proliferating B cells were resistant to ABT-737 (IC<sub>50</sub> ~3 µM) similar to WT B95-8-infected cells (IC<sub>50</sub> ~4 µM), the △3A-infected proliferating B cells remained highly sensitive to ABT-737 (~200 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

While EBV encodes two putative BCL-2 homologues, these proteins are not required for survival after the first 24 hr following B cell infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altmann and Hammerschmidt, 2005</xref>). Rather, constitutive NFκB signaling from the viral oncoprotein LMP1, a TNFR homologue, is thought to be responsible for apoptotic suppression in latently infected, proliferating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cahir-McFarland et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pratt et al., 2012</xref>). However, the initial burst of B cell proliferation induced by EBV is driven by expression of the viral EBNA transcription factors (EBNA1, 2, 3A, 3B, 3C, and LP) in the absence of appreciable LMP1 or NFκB activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Price et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, this early period of hyper-proliferation activates a growth-suppressive DNA damage response, which would be expected to promote apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nikitin et al., 2010</xref>). We, therefore, sought to identify the mechanism of survival during early infection by using BH3 profiling to query mitochondrial control of apoptosis prior to and through latent EBV infection and outgrowth of primary human B cells into LCLs. While BH3 profiling has been previously performed on virus-infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cojohari et al., 2015</xref>), this study focused on HCMV and was limited to a single EBV-positive Burkitt lymphoma cell line, Akata, which expresses only the viral EBNA1 protein. In our BH3 profiling study, we found that mature human peripheral blood B cells depend solely on BCL-2 for survival while EBV latent infection further suppressed apoptotic priming during outgrowth by initially upregulating MCL-1, followed by BFL-1. Mechanistically, we identified a new and unique role for the viral latent protein EBNA3A in apoptosis resistance during both early and late EBV-induced B cell proliferation.</p><p>The importance of EBNA3A in B cell transformation and survival was previously recognized, but our studies now define the molecular basis for the inhibition of apoptosis. While both EBNA3A and EBNA3C suppress the pro-apoptotic protein Bim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Paschos et al., 2009</xref>), only EBNA3A was required to mitigate resistance to a BCL2 antagonist through outgrowth. EBNA3A regulated the BH3 profile of EBV-infected cells and suppressed apoptosis by promoting MCL-1 mitochondrial localization and increasing BFL-1 mRNA transcription. Transcription of BFL-1 was previously shown to be regulated by the EBV transcription factor EBNA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pegman et al., 2006</xref>) as well as LMP1-induced NFκB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pratt et al., 2012</xref>). Our work now indicates that EBNA3A coordinates a chromatin architecture through an EBV super enhancer that facilitates NFκB-mediated activation of BFL-1 transcription. Therefore, our studies highlight a new cooperative role among EBNA3A, EBNA2, and LMP1 in transcriptional activation important for EBV-immortalized cell survival.</p><p>The importance of MCL-1 in early EBV-infected human B cells coupled with the critical role of MCL-1 in germinal center (GC) formation and memory B cell survival in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vikstrom et al., 2010</xref>) is consistent with the GC model of EBV infection. The GC model posits that EBV infection of naïve B cells promotes B cell maturation mimicking the GC reaction to access the long-lived memory B cell compartment and thus persisting for the lifetime of the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burns et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roughan and Thorley-Lawson, 2009</xref>). Our data support this model in that early infection of B cells by EBV promotes MCL-1 as a critical apoptotic regulator similar that observed for GC B cells in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vikstrom et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, MCL-1 copy number gains and mutations are often found in B cell lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wenzel et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, the mechanism by which EBNA3A enhances MCL-1 function at the mitochondria may provide broad insight into apoptotic regulation during B-cell maturation and lymphomagenesis.</p><p>The early phase of EBV infection where EBNAs are expressed with little or no expression of LMPs is known as latency IIb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Price and Luftig, 2015</xref>). The latency IIb expression pattern has also been observed by immuno-histochemical analysis in EBV-positive HIV-associated lymphomas, post-transplant lymphomas, in acute infectious mononucleosis, and in tumors of humanized mouse models of EBV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Price and Luftig, 2015</xref>). Indeed, a recent study found that an EBV recombinant lacking LMP1 was capable of forming B cell tumors in a humanized mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ma et al., 2015</xref>). The survival of these cells as well as those in other latency IIb expressing tissues likely depends on EBNA3A and MCL-1, while latency III cells expressing LMP proteins and high level NFκB signaling are likely to be less primed and to rely on BFL-1. As BH3 profiling has been a powerful predictive tool for chemotherapeutic responses in leukemias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Montero et al., 2015</xref>), our new findings suggest that such an approach could allow for better treatment decisions for EBV-associated malignancies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells, viruses, and mitogens</title><p>Buffy coats were obtained from normal human donors through the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center (Houston, TX) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by Ficoll Histopaque-1077 gradient (Sigma, H8889).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Michel Nussenzweig (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you focus on concerns raised by the reviews.

The editor and reviewers will consider your response and issue a recommendation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper identifies a mode of action of the EBV EBNA3A gene product in preventing apoptosis early in B cell infection, before the better-known block to apoptosis caused by LMP1 later in infection via NFkB activation. It is further suggested that EBNA3A acts by upregulating MCL-1 and BFL-1, two anti-apoptotic factors.</p><p>There seems to be truly novel information here, about EBV and EBNA3A in particular. Previous work has shown that EBNA3A is a trans-acting gene regulator, most often a negative regulator, but not so much is known about its mode of action or its targets – it has been shown to downregulate Bim and some other genes. Here the proposal is that it upregulates two genes, MCL-1 and BFL-1. This seems novel and interesting. The MCL-1 increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) makes sense but no early increase in BFL-1 was observed. EBNA3A also affects MCL-1 mitochondrial localization.</p><p>Much of the work depends on antiapoptotic drugs whose specificity is assumed. The shifts in IC<sub>50</sub> look impressive. Pairs of antiapoptotic drugs seem to confirm the predictions. (The use of flavopiridol to stall NRA Pol II, and show loss of MCL-1 is OK but surely a host of unstable proteins would also be affected.) The resistance to the drugs seems to be mediated by EBNA2, and then EBNA3A, based on relevant EBV mutants – this seems to be the key experiment. The effects of EBV seem distinctive from those seen with other antiapoptotic mediators.</p><p>In addition to key experiments listed below, some rewriting will be necessary to make the story more accessible and significant.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>It would help nonvirologists if we had a little more background about the system and the assays and drugs.</p><p>The entrée into the work was &quot;BH3 profiling&quot;, a way to survey peptides as probes for apoptotic factors. This method is not well described in the paper – we need more introduction to this method (Introduction, last paragraph). Please explain more about what the results can tell us (i.e. tell us about implications of a given peptide effect on mitochondrial depolarization). We run into incomprehensibility quickly (subsection “MCL-1 and BCL-2 protect EBV-infected proliferating B cells from apoptosis early after infection, while BFL-1 additionally protects LCLs from apoptosis late in infection”, first paragraph and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>Although the authors studied three cell states, which are different from the previous work using BH3 profiling (Olesea Cojohari et al., JVI, 2015), the manuscript has already lost some of its attractiveness and significance due to the limited level of original creativity as well as weakly designed controls and experimental design. Specific comments for the authors' consideration are listed below.</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-D</xref>. Although the selective interactions in BH3 profiles suggest the potential functions of BCl-2 family member on EBV-induced B-cell proliferation, the analysis of mitochondrial depolarization in these experiments clearly shows that EBV infection plays a limited functional role in mitochondrial priming, especially in 10µm Puma or 1µm Bim treated LCLs. Meanwhile, the statistics analysis is also missing in this figure. So, these statements are a bit overreaching and should be toned down to match the data.</p><p>2) Both BCl-2 and BCl-w have similar characteristics in the BH3 profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), but why do the authors only focus on the function of BCl-2 in the following experiments? For instance, the average IC<sub>50</sub> for &quot;Prolif&quot; and &quot;LCL&quot; are completely opposite after treatment with ABT-737 or ABT-199, suggesting unique functions of BCl-xL and BCl-w in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, 2G</xref>). However, only BCl-2 expression was detected in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Furthermore, in contrast to WT LCL, Δ3A LCL was sensitive to both Bad and Bmf peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Why does this indicate BCl-2 dependence, but not BCl-w dependence?</p><p>3) EBV could induce potent resistance to ABT-199, a specific inhibitor of BCL-2, so it would be better to investigate EBV-induced resistance to BCl-2 antagonism with ATB-199, instead of ABT-737. However, of particular note is that the use of the inhibitors can be misleading and cannot be totally substantiated by the results and the conclusion made without further validation.</p><p>4) The expression change of MCL-1 is different from BCl-2/Bfl-1's (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Therefore, it seems that MCL-1 and BCl-2/Bfl-1 protect EBV-infected B-cells from apoptosis early after infection and late in infection, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, the survival mechanism may also rely on BCl-2/BCl-w to block Noxa-induced depolarization in LCLs. The authors also noted there was no available BCl-1 antibody (subsection “MCL-1 and BCL-2 protect EBV-infected proliferating B cells from apoptosis early after infection, while BFL-1 additionally protects LCLs from apoptosis late in infection”, first paragraph), actually, Bfl-1 is also known as BCL2A1 (Bcl2 related protein A1), so there should be tons of commercial antibodies at least for Bfl-1 as well as BCl-2. Therefore, Bfl-1 expression should be detected in these studies and is important to support the conclusions. In addition, the Annexin V positivity of ABT-737-treated LCLs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> are inconsistent, so this conclusion is also difficult to accept and is not convincing.</p><p>5) The Caspase 3/7 activity in ABT-737-treated &quot;Prolif&quot; B-cells increases according to the statistical analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Why do the authors indicate that they do not in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (subsection “Resistance to BCL-2 antagonism is virus specific”)? The Annexin V positivity should increase in &quot;Prolif&quot; B-cells following ABT-737 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). It's better to mark t-test results in the figures, but not in separate files.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. Are the qPCR results of viral mRNA normalized to B95.8 LCL as the authors indicated? Why are &quot;B-cell&quot; always shown in the figures? And what do the authors mean by &quot;B-cell&quot; in this manuscript? This is not clear. Is it transformed B-cell, proliferation B-cell Burkitt's lymphoma B-cells?</p><p>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, Δ3A LCL expresses more BCl-2 and MCl-1 than WT at the mRNA level, which is different from the statement &quot;similar to WT&quot; (subsection “EBNA3A is required for MCL-1 mitochondrial localization and BFL-1 transcription”, first paragraph) based on your 2-way ANOVA analysis.

This method is not well described in the paper – we need more introduction to this method (Introduction, last paragraph). Please explain more about what the results can tell us (i.e. tell us about implications of a given peptide effect on mitochondrial depolarization). We run into incomprehensibility quickly (subsection “MCL-1 and BCL-2 protect EBV-infected proliferating B cells from apoptosis early after infection, while BFL-1 additionally protects LCLs from apoptosis late in infection”, first paragraph and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</italic></p><p>We will revise the manuscript to include a more comprehensible overview of BH3 profiling. In particular, we will address what the BH3 profile can tell us in terms of hypotheses generated regarding the BCL2 family members important for protection from apoptosis in the cell states being tested. We will consult with non-specialists to improve the clarity of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Although the authors studied three cell states, which are different from the previous work using BH3 profiling (Olesea Cojohari et al., JVI, 2015), the manuscript has already lost some of its attractiveness and significance due to the limited level of original creativity as well as weakly designed controls and experimental design.</italic></p><p>The Olesea Cojohari et al., paper does use BH3 profiling, a technique developed by the Letai lab to query intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis regulation. However, with regard to EBV, the only infected cells used are Latency I Akata Burkitt’s lymphoma cells. These cells only express the viral EBNA1 protein and miRNAs, they contain an Ig/c-Myc translocation, p53 mutation, and many other mutations that have facilitated tumor development. In contrast, our work uses primary B cells from normal donors and we infect with EBV and allow the latency program to play out (first two weeks EBNAs only, then LCLs with latency III or EBNAs and LMPs). The major question that we are addressing is how EBV is able to suppress apoptosis in this initial latency phase in the absence of the canonical survival factor, LMP1.</p><p><italic>Specific comments for the authors' consideration are listed below.</italic></p><p><italic>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-D</xref>. Although the selective interactions in BH3 profiles suggest the potential functions of BCl-2 family member on EBV-induced B-cell proliferation, the analysis of mitochondrial depolarization in these experiments clearly shows that EBV infection plays a limited functional role in mitochondrial priming, especially in 10µm Puma or 1µm Bim treated LCLs. Meanwhile, the statistics analysis is also missing in this figure. So, these statements are a bit overreaching and should be toned down to match the data.</italic></p><p>To address the high variance among the biological replicates, we performed paired t-tests on Bad and Bmf peptide treatments, the most predictive of sensitivity to ABT-737. Between B cell and Prolif cells, the decrease in Bad sensitivity has a p value of 0.0298 (p&lt;0.05, *) and is therefore significant. Between Prolifs and LCLs, the decrease in Bmf sensitivity has a p value of 0.0796 (p&lt;0.1, ns), which is not statistically significant. However, the biological effect is still meaningful and more apparent when comparing B cells and LCLs, where the decrease in Bmf sensitivity has a p value of 0.0071 (p&lt;0.01, **) and is highly significant.</p><p>For overall mitochondrial priming, we applied the same approach to low-dose Puma and Bim treatments. While B cells and Prolifs were not significantly different in their sensitivity to Bim 1µM (p=0.2586, ns), Prolifs and LCLs were significantly different (p=0.0098, **). Similarly, when treated with Puma 10µM, there was no significant difference between B cells and Prolifs (p=0.1532, ns) or between Prolifs and LCLs (p=0.7800, ns). However, there was a significant difference between B cells and LCLs (p=0.0211, *), indeed suggesting that EBV infection decreases overall mitochondrial priming.</p><p>These statistical tests will be included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> as well as the statistical reporting table.</p><p><italic>2) Both BCl-2 and BCl-w have similar characteristics in the BH3 profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), but why do the authors only focus on the function of BCl-2 in the following experiments? For instance, the average IC<sub>50</sub> for &quot;Prolif&quot; and &quot;LCL&quot; are completely opposite after treatment with ABT-737 or ABT-199, suggesting unique functions of BCl-xL and BCl-w in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, 2G</xref>). However, only BCl-2 expression was detected in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Furthermore, in contrast to WT LCL, Δ3A LCL was sensitive to both Bad and Bmf peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Why does this indicate BCl-2 dependence, but not BCl-w dependence?</italic></p><p>We agree that with profiling alone it is impossible to tease apart the difference between BCL-2 and BCL-w. This is precisely the reason that we compare the resistance of cells to ABT-737 and ABT-199. To this concern, we disagree that the IC<sub>50</sub> for ABT-737 and ABT-199 are “completely opposite” in Prolif cells and LCLs. While the average IC<sub>50</sub> in Prolif cells is higher than LCL treated cells for ABT-199, the IC<sub>50</sub> in Prolifs to neither ABT-199 nor ABT-737 is significantly different than in LCLs. We will state this explicitly in the figure and text in the resubmission.</p><p>With regards to the BH3 Profiling of the Δ3A LCL in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> being sensitive to both Bad and Bmf peptide treatment, we will address the potential for BCL-w protection by repeating the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> with ABT-199.</p><p><italic>3) EBV could induce potent resistance to ABT-199, a specific inhibitor of BCL-2, so it would be better to investigate EBV-induced resistance to BCl-2 antagonism with ATB-199, instead of ABT-737. However, of particular note is that the use of the inhibitors can be misleading and cannot be totally substantiated by the results and the conclusion made without further validation.</italic></p><p>As mentioned above, we will repeat the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> with ABT-199.</p><p><italic>4) The expression change of MCL-1 is different from BCl-2/Bfl-1's (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Therefore, it seems that MCL-1 and BCl-2/Bfl-1 protect EBV-infected B-cells from apoptosis early after infection and late in infection, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, the survival mechanism may also rely on BCl-2/BCl-w to block Noxa-induced depolarization in LCLs. The authors also noted there was no available BCl-1 antibody (subsection “MCL-1 and BCL-2 protect EBV-infected proliferating B cells from apoptosis early after infection, while BFL-1 additionally protects LCLs from apoptosis late in infection”, first paragraph), actually, Bfl-1 is also known as BCL2A1 (Bcl2 related protein A1), so there should be tons of commercial antibodies at least for Bfl-1 as well as BCl-2. Therefore, Bfl-1 expression should be detected in these studies and is important to support the conclusions. In addition, the Annexin V positivity of ABT-737-treated LCLs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> are inconsistent, so this conclusion is also difficult to accept and is not convincing.</italic></p><p>We have tested numerous commercial antibodies directed towards BFL-1(BCL2A1) with no success. Upon the expert suggestion of our collaborators (Dr. Anthony Letai and Dr. Kris Wood) we have decided that gene expression data would have to be sufficient.</p><p>With regards to the Annexin V data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D</xref>, we show a basal apoptotic rate at ~5% (no treatment) and ~10% with 1 µM ABT-737, which is consistent in both figures. However, the scales were different because in 2E we were primarily highlighting the sensitivity of B cells to ABT-737.</p><p><italic>5) The Caspase 3/7 activity in ABT-737-treated &quot;Prolif&quot; B-cells increases according to the statistical analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Why do the authors indicate that they do not in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (subsection “Resistance to BCL-2 antagonism is virus specific”)? The Annexin V positivity should increase in &quot;Prolif&quot; B-cells following ABT-737 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). It's better to mark t-test results in the figures, but not in separate files.</italic></p><p>While the effect of ABT-737 on Prolif, and LCLs as well, was statistically significant, the actual effect size was very small (~5 basal to ~10% ABT-737 treated for AnnV+ and Caspase activity) relative to that of B cells treated prior to proliferation (~5 to ~80%). This is also reflected in the ~200- 400-fold difference in IC<sub>50</sub> between the early treatment and later treatment or LCL treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>Now we state: “Consistently, mitogen-stimulated proliferating B cells had increased Caspase 3/7 activity and Annexin V positivity following ABT-737 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F-G</xref>) while EBV-infected cells displayed only marginally increased activity above basal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D-E</xref>).”</p><p>We will also note the results of the t-test in the figures as well as legends and the statistical table provided with our submission.</p><p><italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. Are the qPCR results of viral mRNA normalized to B95.8 LCL as the authors indicated? Why are &quot;B-cell&quot; always shown in the figures? And what do the authors mean by &quot;B-cell&quot; in this manuscript? This is not clear. Is it transformed B-cell, proliferation B-cell Burkitt's lymphoma B-cells?</italic></p><p>This experiment was performed using purified, uninfected B cells, infected (with either B95.8 or P3HR1) purified B cells, and normalized to the expression level found in B95.8 LCLs set at 100%. The uninfected B cells were included as a negative/background control, and as such it can be excluded from the manuscript if this makes the data easier to interpret. All of these details will be added to the manuscript.</p><p><italic>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, Δ3A LCL expresses more BCl-2 and MCl-1 than WT at the mRNA level, which is different from the statement &quot;similar to WT&quot; (subsection “EBNA3A is required for MCL-1 mitochondrial localization and BFL-1 transcription”, first paragraph) based on your 2-way ANOVA analysis. The loading control is also missing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, while the samples are not normalized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>. Without this information or control data, it's difficult to evaluate this section of the figure.</italic></p><p>Instead of the two-way ANOVA analysis that we initially reported, we will provide t-tests on individual mRNA levels between WT and Δ3A LCL. Based on these analyses, we found no significant difference in the levels of BCL-2 and MCL-1 mRNA, but a significant difference for BFL-1 p value of 0.0002 (p&lt;0.001, ***). This will be updated in the figure and the manuscript.</p><p>As we are describing the decay of protein following CHX treatment, the control is time 0. We found no difference between the decay rate of MCL-1 in WT and Δ3A LCLs thus indicating that this was not the mechanism by which EBNA3A impacted MCL-1 activity in the cells. If an additional protein half-life is needed, we could add this for GAPDH or Actin as housekeeping controls.</p><p>The samples in 6E are normalized to VDAC and WT levels. This is described in the figure legend.</p><p><italic>8) If decreased Bfl-1 transcription inΔ3A LCL is related with Bfl-1 TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), have the authors determined the transcription activity of Bfl-1 promoter? How about the Bfl-1 protein expression inΔ3A LCL?</italic></p><p>We did not include a BFL-1 promoter reporter construct because the regulation of transcription is through an enhancer over 40 kb away. Prior work has indicated that LMP1 and EBNA2 are sufficient to induced BFL1 promoter activity in report constructs. However, our new findings indicate that EBNA3A is required for transcriptional regulation in LCLs through a long-distance enhancer, consistent with its activities across the genome as found by large-scale ChIP-seq studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
