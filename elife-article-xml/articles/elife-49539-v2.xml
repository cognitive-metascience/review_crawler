load-bearing attachments of the plus ends of spindle microtubules to chromosome structures named kinetochores. How these end-on kinetochore attachments are established following initial lateral contacts with the microtubule lattice is poorly understood. Two microtubule-binding complexes, the Ndc80 and Ska complexes, are important for efficient end-on coupling and may function as a unit in this process, but precise conditions for their interaction are unknown. Here, we report that the Ska-Ndc80 interaction is phosphorylation-dependent and does not require microtubules, applied force, or several previously identified functional determinants including the Ndc80-loop and the Ndc80-tail. Both the Ndc80-tail, which we reveal to be essential for microtubule end-tracking, and Ndc80-bound Ska stabilize microtubule ends in a stalled conformation. Modulation of force-coupling efficiency demonstrates that the duration of stalled microtubule disassembly predicts whether a microtubule is stabilized and rescued by the kinetochore, likely reflecting a structural transition of the microtubule end.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>kinetochore</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>force-coupling</kwd><kwd>Ska</kwd><kwd>Ndc80</kwd><kwd>cell division</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC AdG RECEPIANCE (proposal 669686)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Musacchio</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC1093</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Musacchio</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC SG MODELCELL (proposal 609822)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dogterom</surname><given-names>Marileen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>STF7203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huis in 't Veld</surname><given-names>Pim J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Binding of two macromolecular complexes allows kinetochores to capture force produced by the depolymerising ends of microtubules, allowing chromosomes to be transmitted from a mother cell to its two daughters.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Correct attachment of chromosomes to spindle microtubules during eukaryotic cell division allows daughter cells to inherit the appropriate complement of chromosomes from their mothers and is therefore essential for life. Macromolecular structures named kinetochores generate physical links between chromosomes and microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Musacchio and Desai, 2017</xref>). Kinetochores are built on specialized chromosome loci known as centromeres, and consist of centromere-proximal and centromere-distal layers of interacting proteins, known as the inner and the outer kinetochore. Within the latter, the 10-subunit Knl1-Mis12-Ndc80 (KMN) network functions both as a microtubule-capturing interface and as a control hub for a cell cycle checkpoint (spindle assembly checkpoint, SAC) that halts cells in mitosis until the correct configuration of chromosomes on the mitotic spindle (bi-orientation) has been reached.</p><p>Upon entry into M-phase (mitosis or meiosis) and spindle assembly, chromosomes are often initially transported to the spindle poles, where the microtubule density is highest, and from there to the spindle’s equatorial plane, forming lateral attachments to the microtubule lattice. CENP-E, a kinetochore-localized, microtubule-plus-end-directed motor plays an essential function in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bancroft et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barisic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakraborty et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kapoor et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kitajima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Magidson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shrestha et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tanaka et al., 2005</xref>). In a poorly understood process of ‘end-conversion’, kinetochores engage the microtubule-binding interface of the KMN network and transition from binding to the lattice to binding to the dynamic plus ends of the microtubules, which become embedded into the kinetochore’s outer plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kuhn and Dumont, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McIntosh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wan et al., 2009</xref>). These so-called end-on attachments persist during polymerization and depolymerization of the dynamic ends of microtubules, and couple pulling forces produced by depolymerizing microtubules to chromosome movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyoshi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grishchuk et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Miller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Powers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Volkov et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, kinetochores control the dynamics of the plus ends, likely by balancing the action of MCAK (kinesin-13, a microtubule depolymerase) and Kif18 (kinesin 8, a microtubule stabilizer) and possibly other plus end-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Auckland and McAinsh, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Monda et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The molecular underpinnings of end-on attachment and tracking by kinetochores, and hence of force-coupling, remain unclear. However, two protein complexes, the Ndc80 and Ska complexes, have emerged for a prominent involvement in this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Auckland and McAinsh, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Monda and Cheeseman, 2018</xref>). The Ndc80 complex is part of the KMN network, which is stably bound to kinetochores during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheeseman and Desai, 2008</xref>). The KMN is crucially required for end-on microtubule attachment, and interference with its function leads to severe defects in chromosome alignment and SAC abrogation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheeseman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DeLuca et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">DeLuca et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim and Yu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McCleland et al., 2003</xref>). In both humans and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the four subunits of Ndc80 (NDC80/HEC1, NUF2, SPC25, and SPC24) have high coiled-coil content and form a ~ 60 nm dumbbell structure in which highly elongated NDC80:NUF2 and SPC25:SPC24 sub-complexes meet in a tetramerization domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ciferri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ciferri et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huis in 't Veld et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Valverde et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wei et al., 2005</xref>). At one end of Ndc80, two closely interacting calponin-homology (CH) domains near the N-terminal ends of NDC80 and NUF2 form a globular structure that binds the microtubule. An ~80 residue basic tail preceding the NDC80 CH-domain (Ndc80-tail) has also been implicated in microtubule binding, and phosphorylation by Aurora kinase activity has been proposed to modulate electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged MT lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alushin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheerambathur et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheeseman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheeseman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ciferri et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">DeLuca et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">DeLuca et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">DeLuca et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guimaraes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Long et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Miller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shrestha et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tooley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Umbreit et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wei et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zaytsev et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zaytsev et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Formation of a Ska:Ndc80 complex upon SKA3 phosphorylation by CDK1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of Ndc80 and Ska at the kinetochore-microtubule interface.

Ndc80 interacts with the microtubule lattice by introducing a ‘toe’ of the NDC80 CH-domain into the interface between tubulin monomers and by additionally harnessing the N-terminal tail to increase binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alushin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alushin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ciferri et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">DeLuca and Musacchio, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sundin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tooley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wei et al., 2007</xref>). Ndc80 has reduced binding affinity for features attributed to depolymerizing microtubule ends, such as curling protofilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Powers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Welburn et al., 2009</xref>). On the contrary, intrinsic features of the MT-binding domain of SKA1 allow it to interact preferentially with curved protofilaments that likely mimic a depolymerizing end (such as those obtained with certain microtubule poisons), compared to baseline affinity to the microtubule lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abad et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maciejowski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>). Individual Ndc80 complexes are unable to track microtubule ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lampert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Powers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Volkov et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that Ndc80 lacks intrinsic microtubule end-tracking properties, but it acquires the end-tracking activity in the context of multimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Powers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Volkov et al., 2018</xref>). Ska, on the other hand, can track depolymerizing and polymerizing plus ends as a dimer and possibly even as a monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Helgeson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Monda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, both Ndc80 and Ska, each on their own, can form load-bearing attachments to microtubules when sparsely distributed on the surface of a bead trapped in an optical tweezer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Helgeson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Powers et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Thus, Ndc80 and Ska have, each in their own right, features expected of an end-coupler. Furthermore, these complexes may physically interact and bind microtubules in cooperation. First, Ska critically requires Ndc80 for kinetochore recruitment and its kinetochore levels increase after Ndc80-mediated end-on attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gaitanos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hanisch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Raaijmakers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Welburn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Second, Ska complexes promote the tracking by Ndc80 of depolymerizing microtubule ends in vitro, and appear to increase the survival probability of attachments in vitro, both in the absence and in the presence of load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Helgeson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Powers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, Ska loads on kinetochores that are already bound to microtubules, and its kinetochore localization appears to be negatively regulated by Aurora kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hanisch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Redli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sivakumar and Gorbsky, 2017</xref>). Collectively, these observations have raised the interesting perspective that the interaction of Ska and Ndc80 may be directly regulated by force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheerambathur et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Helgeson et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In the absence of assays exposing direct binding of Ska and Ndc80, previous studies have focused on effects on kinetochore recruitment after mutational perturbation of the two complexes, or on effects caused by combining Ska and Ndc80 on microtubules. For instance, the Ndc80 loop was identified as a crucial enabler of Ska binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). However, observations that Ska may interact on microtubules with Ndc80<sup>bonsai</sup>, an engineered Ndc80 that lacks the loop region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ciferri et al., 2008</xref>), seems inconsistent with this requirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Janczyk et al., 2017</xref>). In another study, the Ndc80 N-terminal tail was shown to regulate the localization of Ska to kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheerambathur et al., 2017</xref>). In a key recent study, the C-terminal disordered region of SKA3 was shown to be sufficient for a direct interaction with an NDC80:NUF2 sub-complex after phosphorylation in vitro by the Cdk1:Cyclin B kinase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). This observation requires further scrutiny, however, because other regions of Ska, such as a ‘bridge’ region (residues 92–132) of SKA1, are required for kinetochore recruitment of Ska (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abad et al., 2014</xref>). How phosphorylation regulates the interaction of Ska with kinetochores, and specifically with Ndc80, thus remains an important and unresolved question, not least because recombinant Ska and Ndc80 seem to interact on microtubules in the absence of phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Helgeson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Janczyk et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>These fragmented and contradictory views may reflect experimental conditions that fall short of capturing crucial properties (e.g. composition, geometry, force-induced conformational changes) of real kinetochore-microtubule attachment sites. Here, we identify, for the first time, conditions for the physical interaction of homogeneous, full-length recombinant Ska and Ndc80 in the absence of microtubules or applied force, and discuss them in light of previous work. The role of Aurora B in Ska recruitment may be more complex than hitherto believed, because its kinase activity does not evidently alter the interaction of the two complexes in vitro. Experimenting with total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and optical tweezers, we harnessed our reconstitution to dissect how the Ndc80:Ska interaction affects microtubule end-tracking and force-coupling. We demonstrate that Ska extends Ndc80-mediated stalls of microtubule depolymerisation, often at higher stall forces, and identify the duration of a force-induced stall as a potentially crucial parameter in determining whether an end-on bound microtubule will restore its growth. In contrast, phosphorylation of the Ndc80-tail by Aurora B kinase specifically weakened end-on Ndc80-microtubule attachments under force by shortening the stalls. Taken together, our results have important implications for understanding the molecular basis of kinetochore-microtubule attachment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ska directly binds Ndc80 upon CDK1:Cyclin B phosphorylation of SKA3<sup>T358/T360</sup></title><p>We co-expressed human SKA1, SKA2, and SKA3 from a single baculovirus in insect cells and purified the resulting Ska complex using consecutive metal-affinity, ion-exchange, and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC).

Among these kinases, CDK1 appears to have a prominent role, because its inhibition suppresses the mitotic phosphorylation of Ska (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, CDK1 phosphorylation of a ~ 310 residue C-terminal extension of SKA3, predicted to be largely intrinsically disordered and unstructured, has been proposed to promote binding to Ndc80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). To verify these results, we phosphorylated Ska in vitro with CDK1:Cyclin B. This resulted in a readily detectable shift of the SKA3 subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). By mass spectrometry, we identified 12 of the 14 CDK consensus sites in the C-terminal part of SKA3<sup>102-412</sup> (SKA3<sup>C</sup>) as being phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a-1b</xref>). These included two threonine sites within a conserved TPTP<sup>358-361</sup> sequence whose phosphorylation was previously shown to be required for kinetochore recruitment of the Ska complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To test if the phosphorylation of Ska impacts its binding to Ndc80, we mixed both purified complexes at low micromolar concentrations and assessed their interaction using SEC. Sortase-mediated replacement of the C-terminal polyhistidine tag on SKA1 with a fluorescent label permitted specific monitoring of Ska. This allowed us to demonstrate that phosphorylated Ska, when mixed with Ndc80, elutes earlier from a SEC column, indicative of complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, light and dark green traces). Ska that had been treated with λ-phosphatase after CDK1:Cyclin B treatment did not form a complex with Ndc80, indicating that this interaction depends on the phosphorylation of Ska by CDK1:Cyclin B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, black traces).</p><p>Alanine substitution of Thr358 and Thr360 in SKA3 prevented the recruitment of Ska to the kinetochore in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Mutations T358A and T360A in SKA3 also prevented efficient formation of the Ska:Ndc80 complex in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Thus, phosphorylation by CDK1:Cyclin B at other SKA3 sites, revealed by the phosphorylation induced shift of SKA3 on SDS-PAGE, was not sufficient to mediate Ska3:Ndc80 complex formation. It has also been shown that two phospho-mimetic mutations, T358D and T360D, are sufficient to promote robust Ska kinetochore localization when twelve additional potential phosphorylation target sites were mutated to alanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). However, neither unphosphorylated nor phosphorylated Ska containing the T358D and T360D mutations bound Ndc80 efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>), indicating that a single negative charge at positions Thr358 and Thr360 cannot functionally replace phosphate groups in our reconstituted system. This contradicts previous results obtained with a SKA3 fragment and a GST-NUF2:NDC80 sub-complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).

(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>To complement these low-resolution micrographs with a proximity map, we determined potential contacts within the Ska:Ndc80 complex using DSBU (disuccinimidyl dibutyric urea) crosslinking followed by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pan et al., 2018</xref>). The three datasets (Ska, Ska:Ndc80, and Ndc80) contain a total of 233 unique intramolecular and 253 unique intermolecular crosslinks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c-1d</xref>). Despite the inability to distinguish the two copies of each subunit in the Ska:Ska dimer, we can draw several conclusions from the proximity maps. First, the extensive contacts of the unstructured SKA3<sup>102-412</sup> with the rest of Ska largely disappear upon phosphorylation by CDK1:Cyclin B and binding to Ndc80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, blue crosslinks). In the Ndc80-bound form, the phosphorylated SKA3<sup>C</sup> contacts the NDC80:NUF2 coiled coil and appears to reach into the portion of this coiled-coil that forms the tetramerization domain (SKA3 residues 247, 254, 394, 399, 408, 410; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, orange and green crosslinks). Second, the SKA1 microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) and SKA3<sup>79</sup> from at least one of the Ska protomers are proximal to the Ndc80 tetramerization domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, green crosslinks). Deletion of the MTBD of SKA1 does not interfere with Ska:Ndc80 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), and these contacts do not reflect an essential interaction between the SKA1<sup>MTBD</sup> and Ndc80. Third, crosslinks between the unstructured Ndc80-tail with various regions of Ndc80 and with SKA3<sup>399, 410</sup> emphasize the flexibility of the entire complex and the accessibility of the Ndc80-tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, black crosslinks). Taken together, this structural analysis combining low-angle rotary shadowing and cross-linking/mass spectrometry demonstrates that the NDC80:NUF2 coiled-coil harbours a direct binding site for SKA3 that is phosphorylated at Thr358 and Thr360, that the Ndc80-loop is dispensable for Ska recruitment in vitro, and that at least one MTBD of SKA1 in a Ska dimer is positioned near the Ndc80 tetramerization domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Aurora B does not disrupt Ska:Ndc80 binding in vitro</title><p>In previous studies, Aurora B kinase activity has been shown to counteract the recruitment of Ska to kinetochores.

While previous studies advocated a requirement of the Ndc80-tail for kinetochore recruitment of Ska in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheerambathur et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Janczyk et al., 2017</xref>), deletion of the unstructured Ndc80-tail does not perturb binding of phosphorylated Ska to Ndc80 in our reconstituted system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This suggests that the Ndc80-tail, like the Ndc80-loop, contributes indirectly to the recruitment of Ska by establishing a proper kinetochore-microtubule interface rather than by providing a docking site.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Aurora B kinase activity does not disrupt Ska:Ndc80 binding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Full-length (fl) and tailless (Δ80) Ndc80 both bind phosphorylated Ska, as analyzed by SEC and SDS-PAGE.

Furthermore, enhanced Ska recruitment to kinetochores upon Aurora B inhibition is also observed when microtubules are depolymerized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Janczyk et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sivakumar and Gorbsky, 2017</xref>), arguing that Aurora B does not control Ska recruitment to kinetochores by modulating its binding affinity for microtubules.</p><p>We therefore asked if Aurora B affects the stability of the Ska:Ndc80 interaction. Exposure of pre-formed Ska:Ndc80 complex to Aurora B did not cause its dissociation. Aurora B activity was confirmed by a shift in the elution volumes of Ndc80 and Ndc80:Ska from a SEC column and by the altered migration of the NDC80 subunit in phostag SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kinoshita et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, black and red traces). Conversely, dephosphorylation of pre-formed Ska:Ndc80 complex by lambda-phosphatase displaced Ska from Ndc80. Thus, deletions of the Ndc80-tail or of the Ndc80-loop, and Aurora B activity, all of which prevent kinetochore recruitment of Ska in vivo, do not affect Ska:Ndc80 binding in vitro. This suggests that Ska recruitment is licensed by particular features of the kinetochore-microtubule interface that signal successful bi-orientation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The Ndc80-tail is required for end-on Ndc80-microtubule attachment</title><p>A single microtubule-binding site in the kinetochore contains multiple closely spaced Ndc80 complexes, with recent estimates converging on 6 to 8 complexes per attachment site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huis in 't Veld et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Suzuki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Weir et al., 2016</xref>).

Phosphorylation of the Ndc80-tail tunes the affinity of Ndc80 for microtubules in vitro and in vivo (see for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Long et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zaytsev et al., 2015</xref>). From a mechanistic perspective, however, if and how phosphorylation of the Ndc80-tail influences force-coupling with dynamic microtubules is poorly understood. To address this, we exposed trivalent Ndc80 modules to Aurora B kinase activity. Efficient phosphorylation of the Ndc80-tail was confirmed by a shift in SEC, mass spectrometry, and phostag SDS-PAGE analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e-1f</xref>). We further assembled T<sub>1</sub>S<sub>3</sub>-[Ndc80]<sub>3</sub> modules containing NDC80<sup>Δ80</sup>, that is lacking the tail altogether. Consistent with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Volkov et al., 2018</xref>), trivalent Ndc80 assemblies bound to the microtubule lattice for minutes and efficiently followed depolymerizing microtubule ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Remarkably, Aurora B phosphorylation or truncation of the NDC80-tail did not influence the residence time of T<sub>1</sub>S<sub>3</sub>-[Ndc80]<sub>3</sub> on the microtubule lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>). Conversely, truncation of the Ndc80-tail, but not its phosphorylation by Aurora B, prevented trivalent Ndc80 from following the shortening ends of microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–F</xref>). Thus, these results identify the Ndc80-tail as being crucial to attach Ndc80 to depolymerizing microtubule ends. We conclude that trivalent Ndc80 modules bind the microtubule lattice stably through their CH-domains, but rely on the tails, regardless of their state of phosphorylation, to remain attached to a shortening microtubule end in the absence of a resisting force.</p><p>Previously, we used optical tweezers to study the ability of reconstituted kinetochore particles immobilized on beads to capture force generated by a depolymerizing microtubule. We found that multivalent Ndc80 modules stall microtubule depolymerization under microtubule-generated forces up to 5–6 pN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Volkov et al., 2018</xref>). These stalling events either induced a rescue of microtubule growth or were followed by an Ndc80-microtubule detachment event and continued microtubule depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Volkov et al., 2018</xref>). Using a similar experimental setup, we compared T<sub>1</sub>S<sub>3</sub>-[Ndc80]<sub>3</sub> modules with unmodified, phosphorylated, or truncated Ndc80-tails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Consistent with the inability to tip-track shortening microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), tailless trivalent Ndc80 modules (NDC80<sup>Δ80</sup>) dissociated rapidly from depolymerizing microtubules and never rescued microtubule shortening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–I</xref>, orange trace). Force-induced stalls by unphosphorylated Ndc80 modules were followed by microtubule regrowth in 21 events, and by detachment in 36 events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–I</xref>, blue trace). In contrast, Ndc80 modules exposing a phosphorylated tail detached from microtubule ends without rescue in 27 of 29 events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>, green trace). Thus, Ndc80 modules phosphorylated by Aurora B detached from shortening microtubule ends under force despite their ability to tip-track depolymerizing microtubules without load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Unphosphorylated Ndc80 modules behaved differently and remained bound to microtubule ends independently of the force applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>, blue symbols). In line with our previous analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Volkov et al., 2018</xref>), there was a correlation between the force at stall and the likelihood of a rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). In addition, in this and subsequent experiments described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the duration of the stall emerged as an apparently critical parameter in determining the likelihood of a rescue after stall. Specifically, we did not observe rescues for stalls that ended within ~1 s, even for high stall forces.

Since trivalent Ndc80 modules are very efficient microtubule tip-trackers by themselves in our assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), we added fluorescently labeled Ska to flow chambers with dynamic microtubules and trivalent Ndc80<sup>Δ80</sup> modules, which are instead very poor end-trackers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). CDK1-phosphorylated Ska associated with lattice-bound and tip-tracking Ndc80<sup>Δ80</sup> modules when Ska was added at concentrations as low as 100 pM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>). At concentrations of 1 and 10 nM, phosphorylated Ska effectively conferred tip-tracking ability to the Ndc80<sup>Δ80</sup> modules whereas dephosphorylated Ska did not. These results demonstrate that upon binding to Ndc80, Ska creates an additional microtubule binding site which enables end-tracking of Ndc80<sup>Δ80</sup>:Ska complexes.</p><p>The addition of Ska at 100 nM conferred end-tracking ability to trivalent Ndc80<sup>Δ80</sup> modules whether Ska was phosphorylated or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>). This was not observed in the presence of Ska lacking the SKA1<sup>MTBD</sup> at 100 nM and the stabilizing effect of Ska did thus strictly require its ability to interact with microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The stabilization of end-on Ndc80-microtubule interactions in the presence of non-phosphorylated Ska indicates that some Ska can bind Ndc80 without the phosphorylation of SKA3 in the context of trivalent Ndc80 modules. Consistent with this explanation, we did observe binding of non-phosphorylated Ska to beads coated with trivalent Ndc80 complexes (but not to beads coated with T<sub>3</sub>S<sub>1</sub> without Ndc80). This binding was weaker than for phosphorylated Ska but dependent on the SKA3<sup>C</sup> region: Ska complexes lacking SKA3<sup>C</sup> failed to bind Ndc80 trimers on the beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We next set out to test if the presence of Ska influences force-coupling and kinetochore-microtubule attachments. For this purpose, we added Ska:Ndc80-coated glass beads to dynamic microtubules and added soluble Ska at a concentration of 10 or 100 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Real-time monitoring of Ska in the DIC-based optical-tweezers setup is not feasible, and we could therefore not distinguish if Ska was present at the Ndc80-microtubule interface during force recordings. We note that Ska associates with the microtubule lattice at these concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and binds to Ndc80-coated glass beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Since we have not been able to observe differences between the addition of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated Ska under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">3</xref>), we pooled observations from both forms and from both concentrations of Ska and set out to investigate the effects of Ska on force-coupling.</p><p>The presence of Ska resulted in remarkably long force-dependent stalls of microtubule depolymerization (a typical example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This required the presence of both the microtubule binding domain of SKA1 and the C-terminal tail of SKA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), indicating that the stabilization of Ndc80-mediated microtubule stalls by Ska requires SKA3-Ndc80 and SKA1-microtubule interactions. Longer stalls in the presence of Ska were observed for all three different Ndc80-tail constructs, albeit at different forces and with different rescue probabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–I</xref>). While stalls for intact unphosphorylated Ndc80 in absence of Ska were limited to 5 s (in 56 of 57 cases, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>), stall durations for the intact Ndc80 in presence of Ska exceeded 5 s in 25 out of 66 cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">3</xref>). We also observed a fraction of Ska:Ndc80 beads that stalled microtubules at forces reaching ~10 pN, exceeding the limit of 6 pN observed in absence of Ska (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).</p><p>In some cases, the presence of 100 nM Ska resulted in force-induced stalls that persisted for tens of seconds and were deliberately ended by increasing the stiffness of the trap and detaching the Ska:Ndc80-coated bead from the microtubule end. After bead detachment, these microtubules failed to undergo rescue or disassembly, as if they obtained a hyper-stable, frozen state during the stall. This condition was apparently independent of Ska:Ndc80 interactions, because it was also observed in presence of Ska lacking the SKA3<sup>C</sup>. These hyper-stable microtubules were only observed when Ska at 100 nM and an unphosphorylated Ndc80-tail were combined (7 out of 57 events; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). This suggests that the presence of Ska at high concentrations stabilizes microtubule ends that are stalled under force by Ndc80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>The presence of Ska resulted in force-induced stalls of microtubule depolymerization that frequently lasted longer than a second (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–I</xref>). Importantly, Ndc80 with phosphorylated or deleted Ndc80-tails was almost never able to stall the ends of depolymerizing microtubules for these lengths in the absence of Ska (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Increased stall durations in the presence of Ska correlated with an increase in the number of microtubules undergoing rescue during force-induced stalls by Ndc80 modules with phosphorylated or deleted NDC80-tails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Molecular determinants of the Ska-Ndc80 interaction and their influence on microtubule tracking and force-coupling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of force-coupling before, during, and after a force-induced stall of microtubule depolymerization that was followed by microtubule re-growth.

The precise molecular requirements for kinetochore recruitment of Ska, however, had not been identified, motivating the present analysis. To shed light on this mechanism, we developed assays that, for the first time, allowed us to identify and dissect a direct interaction of the full-length versions of these complexes. We conclude that 1) CDK1-mediated phosphorylation of SKA3 promotes the formation of a stable Ska:Ndc80 complex; 2) this requires phosphorylation of Thr358 and Thr360 in SKA3; 3) the NDC80:NUF2 coiled-coils, but not the Ndc80-tail or -loop, are necessary for the Ska:Ndc80 interaction.</p><p>We observed that the requirement for SKA3 phosphorylation by CDK1 is, in the presence and absence of microtubules, attenuated in the context of Ndc80 multimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This might explain why phosphomimetic substitutions in SKA3 are sufficient for loading Ska onto kinetochores in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>), where Ndc80 is oligomerized, compared to our SEC experiments with monomeric Ndc80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In line with previous studies that assessed Ndc80:Ska binding on microtubules with monomeric Ndc80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Helgeson et al., 2018</xref>) or fragments thereof (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakraborty et al., 2019</xref>), these observations suggest that microtubules facilitate an interaction of unphosphorylated Ska and Ndc80. However, microtubule binding is not a strict requirement for kinetochore localization of Ska, as the latter localizes to KTs, but not to spindle MTs, also upon deletion of the SKA1 microtubule-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abad et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our conclusions partly agree with a previous analysis showing that CDK1-mediated phosphorylation of the C-terminal region of SKA3 is important for Ska:Ndc80 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly to that study, we find that Ndc80<sup>bonsai</sup> does not bind Ska, an observation that contradicts another recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Janczyk et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhang et al. (2017)</xref> concluded that Ska interacts with the Ndc80-loop, which is required for Ska recruitment in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). We show here that both the Ndc80-loop and the Ndc80-tail, another Ndc80 region previously implicated in the interaction with Ska (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheerambathur et al., 2017</xref>), are dispensable for the Ska:Ndc80 interaction. Instead, Ska interacts with the coiled-coils of NDC80:NUF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The role of the Ndc80 coiled-coils in Ska binding agrees with a recent report in which the interaction of Ska and Ndc80 had been studied in the absence of phosphorylation but in presence of microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Helgeson et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The direct and robust interaction of Ska with Ndc80 in the absence of tension suggests that tension is not required to expose an otherwise cryptic binding site for Ska on Ndc80, although we cannot exclude that the binding affinity of Ska for Ndc80 increases under force. Robust kinetochore localization of Ska in cells with depolymerized microtubules when Aurora B is inhibited also argues against a direct role of force in Ska:Ndc80 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Redli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sivakumar and Gorbsky, 2017</xref>). Aurora B kinase is believed to be exquisitely sensitive to kinetochore tension, and these observations renew the interest in the mechanisms allowing it to control Ska localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Krenn and Musacchio, 2015</xref>). We show in vitro that Aurora B activity does not disrupt the Ska:Ndc80 interaction, despite successful phosphorylation of Ska and Ndc80, suggesting that Aurora B plays an indirect role on the Ska:Ndc80 interaction. It is notable that another condition shown to prevent bi-orientation, the deletion of the Ndc80-loop, also prevents Ska recruitment to kinetochores without disrupting the potential for this interaction in vitro. Collectively, these observations point to the Ndc80:Ska interaction as an effector of a separate, yet unidentified node of tension sensing in the kinetochore, and future studies will have to address the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon, including the exact role of Aurora B and of the postulated feedback mechanisms identifying Ska as an Aurora B activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Redli et al., 2016</xref>), possibly through interactions with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Janczyk et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sivakumar and Gorbsky, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sivakumar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Welburn et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>With the demonstration that Ska and Ndc80 interact directly in a single complex, a crucial question is how this interaction affects the kinetochore-microtubule interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In previous studies, Ska (without phosphorylation) was shown to promote the ability of Ndc80 to track the depolymerizing ends of microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Helgeson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>). The significance of this observation, however, is partly unclear, because Ndc80 can track depolymerizing ends of microtubules when part of an oligomer, its normal condition within kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Powers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Volkov et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, either complex has been shown to be able to form load-bearing attachments to microtubules in isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Helgeson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Powers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tien et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Volkov et al., 2018</xref>). When added to Ndc80, Ska was shown to increase the survival probability of Ndc80 connections with microtubules, but independently of applied force, possibly reflecting lattice stabilization at high Ska concentrations rather than the direct interaction of Ska and Ndc80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Helgeson et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>An ongoing challenge for in vitro studies is to investigate the kinetochore-microtubule interface as a unit, using systems that approximate stoichiometry, composition, and regulation of real attachment sites. Here, after identifying conditions that promote Ska:Ndc80 binding, we combined phosphorylated Ska to Ndc80 trimers that we have previously characterized as microtubule end trackers and good force couplers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Volkov et al., 2018</xref>). An original conclusion of our studies is that, after oligomerization of Ndc80, the NDC80 N-terminal tail is dispensable for robust binding to the microtubule lattice but is required for tracking a depolymerizing microtubule end in the absence of force. Deletion of the Ndc80-tail or its phosphorylation by Aurora B impaired the ability of Ndc80 to stall and rescue microtubule shortening and promoted detachment from microtubule ends under force.</p><p>End-on attachments in vitro can stall microtubule depolymerization in a force-dependent manner and trigger a switch to a growing state. In case of unphosphorylated Ndc80 complexes, rescue events were more likely for high stalling forces, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Volkov et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we discovered that such rescue events only occurred after stall duration reached a threshold of approximately ~1 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This temporal threshold appeared to persist in the presence of Ska, whereas forces required for producing rescue events in the presence of Ska varied widely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Binning of data obtained with the entire range of tested Ndc80 and Ska complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1g</xref>) readily revealed stall duration as a good indicator for the binary outcome of a force-induced stall (detachment or rescue) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). We therefore speculate that the threshold of ~1 s reflects a general property of a force-induced switch from a depolymerization to polymerization, possibly the time needed to stabilize protofilaments mechanically and assemble a growth-supportive GTP-tubulin cap. The presence of Ska increased the overall duration of microtubule stalls, possibly through stabilization of microtubule plus-ends in the stalled state. We speculate that, in our experimental setup and in vivo, Ska stabilizes kinetochore-proximal protofilaments in a force- or curvature-dependent manner. Although many molecular details remain unclear, the idea that Ska both requires and promotes force-coupling at the kinetochore-microtubule interface is consistent with gradual and tension-dependent recruitment of Ska to kinetochores during chromosome congression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Auckland et al., 2017</xref>). While phosphorylation of the SKA3 C-terminal region was required for Ndc80 binding in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and stimulated binding on beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), our force measurements with these beads in optical tweezers did not identify obvious effects of CDK1-phosphorylation of Ska (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–I</xref>). While we do not have a clear explanation for this, we surmise that it may reflect the specific configuration of Ndc80 binding sites in our reconstituted system. The precise spatial and temporal regulation of Ska recruitment to kinetochores in vivo and its relationship to the establishment of tension is a topic for further investigation.</p><p>Kinetochore-microtubule interactions need to be reversible in the absence of tension and stabilized upon bi-orientation. Although the reconstitution of a <italic>bona fide</italic> tension-sensitive kinetochore-microtubule interface requires additional components and remains a long-term goal, our data in the absence of Ska recapitulate tension-stabilized kinetochore-microtubule attachments. These results establish the N-terminal tail of Ndc80 as a crucial force-coupling element, demonstrate that phosphorylation of the Ndc80-tail by Aurora B ensures reversible and tension-sensitive kinetochore-microtubule interactions, and provide mechanistic insight into the well-described in vivo effects of mutations that mimic constitutively phosphorylated or unphosphorylated Ndc80-tails. How phosphorylation of the Ndc80-tail and Ska levels at the kinetochore are tuned in a tension-sensitive manner and whether phosphatases play a role remain open questions of great interest.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

At the start of each experiment, 50 frames of bead-free fields of view in the chamber were captured, averaged, and used later for on-the-fly background correction. The images were acquired at eight frames per second, subjected to background substraction and each 10 consecutive frames were averaged. The signal from the quadrant photo-detector (QPD) signal was sampled at 10 kHz without additional filtering. Experiments were performed at 0.4–0.8W of the 1064 nm laser resulting in a typical trap stiffness of 0.03–0.07 pN/nm. Trap stiffness was determined for each bead after it detached from a microtubule. If a microtubule was stalled by a bead for more than 90 s, the power of the trapping laser was increased to 4W (corresponding to a typical trap stiffness of 0.4 pN/nm) and the bead was ruptured from the microtubule using 100 nM steps of the piezo stage. A typical force required to rupture a bead from a microtubule exceeded 40 pN.</p><p>QPD traces were analyzed in MatLab R2013b. Each force trace was analyzed manually and confirmed to correspond with a respective DIC movie in both the time of force development and the direction of microtubule pulling. We assumed that all detachment and rescue events were preceded by a stall and imposed a lower limit of 2 ms on the stall duration. The stall force was determined as a difference in mean bead displacement between the stall level and the free bead level along the microtubule multiplied by trap stiffness, corrected for the nonlinear increase of the force as a function of the distance from the trap centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Simmons et al., 1996</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>MD acknowledges funding from the European Research Council Synergy Grant MODELCELL (proposal 609822).

responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This paper provides exciting new insight into how kinetochores form load-bearing attachments to dynamic spindle microtubules. At the heart of the work is the use of an in vitro reconstitution approach to reveal the minimum requirements for formation of full length Ska-Ndc80 assemblies in solution: Phosphorylation of the Ska3 subunit is the key ingredient, while the &quot;loop&quot; and &quot;tail&quot; features of the NDC80 as well as the application of force or the microtubule track are not needed. These data redefine how we interpret several in vivo findings. We were impressed with the experiments that naturally extend previous work with trivalent Ndc80 assemblies: the authors show how Ska improves the ability of Ndc80 to track shrinking microtubule ends and – importantly – lengthens force-dependent stalls and the probability of microtubule rescue. The authors reveal that stalling for more than a second increases the chance of a rescue event – the underlying mechanism and whether it is generalizable await further studies. These events happen irrespective of whether Ndc80 tail is phosphorylated raising important questions regarding tension sensing and Ska recruitment at kinetochores. Overall, this study takes an important step towards the long-term ambition to reconstitute tension-sensitive kinetochore-microtubule interface.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Molecular determinants of the Ska-Ndc80 interaction and their influence on microtubule tracking and force-coupling&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper from the Musacchio and Dogterom labs uses a combination of in vitro biochemical, TIRF imaging and optical trap approaches to investigate the interaction between the Ska and Ndc80 complexes alone and on microtubules, with or without force. They show that the interaction between Ndc80 and Ska is regulated by Cdk1 phosphorylation of Ska3, and that this interaction in vitro does not require the Ndc80 loop or the Ndc80 tail, or microtubules. These findings represent an important advance in our understanding of the minimal requirements for assembly of tip-tracking complexes. Importantly, these in vitro findings redefine how we interpret several in vivo findings. They show that phosphorylation of trivalent Ndc80 particles and the presence of the Ndc80 tail both contribute to tracking shrinking microtubules. A key finding is that Ska increases the duration of Ndc80-mediated stalls of microtubule-depolymerisation and that this time can influence the outcome (rescue or detachment). The authors propose that this reflects a force-dependent switch from depolymerisation to polymerisation – and that Ska could regulate this switch. Overall the experiments are well done and provide important insights into our understanding of load-bearing at the kinetochore. We have the following suggestions to improve the manuscript:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One missing measurement is the affinity of Ndc80 for Ska in the presence and absence of phosphorylation (the bead experiments in Figure 5E show some binding of non-phosphorylated Ska to Ndc80). This would be a valuable measurement for the field. The authors should also clarify the molar ratios used in the SEC experiments: 2 to 20 μm (as stated in the Materials and methods) does not indicate whether the experiments were conducted with an excess of Ska, of Ndc80 or whether they are always in a 1:1 ratio. In this regard, the authors should comment more in the text on how they think they are probing a relevant stoichiometry and geometry for Ndc80-Ska interface in their trap assays.</p><p>2) In Figure 3 it is important to clarify what the authors can and cannot interpret from the Aurora B data. Unless the authors test pre-de/phosphorylated Ndc80 and Ska that are then mixed, the section title (“Aurora B does not affect Ska:Ndc80 binding in vitro”) and conclusion that Aurora B does not affect the binding in vitro are not appropriate given the data. The authors should either revise language or perform experiments supporting current language.</p><p>3) Tail-deleted Ndc80 was shown to have a similar residence time (i.e. affinity) but to not track depolymerizing microtubules – this is different from analysis of monovalent tail-deleted Ndc80, which shows weak affinity for microtubules. Can the similar affinity of trivalent Ndc80 with and without the tail be demonstrated using a different approach (e.g. co-sedimentation?).</p><p>4) In Figure 5 the concentrations of Ska used in the trap assay are very high, and due to the observation of hyper-stable microtubules they may be interfering with the normal features of the system. To rule out that the stabilizing effects on Ndc80 are due to lattice-binding of high Ska it is critical to repeat some of these assays with 10 nM concentration of phosphorylated and also dephosphorylated Ska. The fraction of particles in which Ska plays a role should scale with the concentration of Ska as it is titrated up. Also, what happens if Ska3 C-terminal deletion is present in solution? How would that affect interpretation of the interaction in the front part of the manuscript that is dependent on phosphorylation of the Ska3 C-terminus?</p><p>5) We believe that it is important that phosphorylated and dephosphorylated data are not pooled in order to understand the direct mechanical contribution of the Ska complex to the Ndc80-microtubule interface and what role phosphorylation plays. This will also improve the narrative from the first part of the paper (Biochemistry/phosphorylation) and the second (Biophysics) which are currently somewhat disconnected. Some expansion of the Discussion would also be helpful to provide a clearer picture of how phosphorylation impacts Ska:Ndc80 function (and how this may work in vivo).</p><p>6) We appreciate that the biophysical experiments are challenging but some increase in numbers would be important in substantiating the findings (i.e. the histograms in Figure 5—figure supplement 2 and Figure 4I and Figure 5G, H). There also needs to be statistical measurements like covariance or correlation coefficients reported for the relationship between stall duration and stall force in order to claim there are negative correlations.</p><p>7) A key finding is that Ska increases the duration of Ndc80-mediated stalls of microtubule-depolymerisation. Can the authors provide any data on whether this is specific to Ska:Ndc80 or a more general mechanisms that would occur with other linkers (i.e. a rigor kinesin)? – While not absolutely essential, we do believe this would really give the manuscript significantly more impact in the field.</p><p>8) A significant amount of biophysical analysis of Ndc80 and Ska complexes has been conducted by Asbury/Davis and Grischchuk/Cheeseman groups – the key difference here is that trivalent Ndc80 complex is used (note that antibody-based crosslinking has been shown to improve Ndc80 end tracking – e.g. in Powers et al. Figure 6). The authors need to more clearly delineate similarities and differences from the prior work and suggest reasons underlying the differences.</p><p>9) The authors need to describe the prior work in a more precise manner and be more cautious in their statements about what their work does versus does not imply. In particular, they cannot make strong claims about the degree to which the interaction they focus on in vitro accounts for Ska localization dynamics in vivo. The authors state that prior work has indicated a requirement for the Ndc80 tail in Ska localization – this is not correct. For example, the Cheerambathur manuscript cited in support of this claim showed that Ska localized in tail-deleted Ndc80 (see Figure 3E and F in that paper). The authors should more clearly acknowledge Zhang et al., 2017, in the Introduction for the discovery that phosphorylation of Ska3 by Cdk1 is important for Ska kinetochore localization and for interaction with Ndc80.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49539.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One missing measurement is the affinity of Ndc80 for Ska in the presence and absence of phosphorylation (the bead experiments in Figure 5E show some binding of non-phosphorylated Ska to Ndc80).

In brief, a two-fold molar excess of Ndc80 was often used to clearly monitor Ska’s changed retention on the column due to Ndc80 binding. Typical concentrations were e.g. 4 μm for Ska and 8 μm for Ndc80 (see Figure 1D-E). Lower Ndc80 concentration (Ska 4 μm and Ndc80 2 uM) reduced Ndc80:Ska binding to levels that prevented binding assessment by gel filtration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Our conclusion from these experiments is that phosphorylated Ska binds to Ndc80 at low μM concentrations and that the binding is not complete when Ndc80 and Ska are present at equimolar concentrations.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-49539-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>It is important to point out that the situation is very different in our single-molecule TIRF microscopy and optical trap experiments. In those setups we use a) Ska complexes at much lower concentrations (100 pM – 100 nM), b) multivalent Ndc80 complexes, and c) microtubules that provide a docking site for both Ska and Ndc80. The complexity of this setup allowed us to see long co-localization between phosphorylated Ska and multivalent Ndc80 on microtubules when Ska was used at concentrations as low as 100 pM. The presence of many binding interfaces prevented us to approximate a K<italic>d</italic> between Ndc80 and Ska. The reviewers are right to point out that under these conditions, the phosphorylation of Ska3 contributes to Ndc80 binding but is no longer strictly required. We have revised our text to highlight these observations and to explain how our experimental setup mimics crucial properties of a human outer kinetochore (changes throughout the text, in particular in the subsection “Ska stabilizes end-on Ndc80-microtubule interactions under force” and in the Discussion).</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that accurately determined binding affinities between Ndc80 and phosphorylated/non-phosphorylated Ska would be of value for the field. The binding affinity can be guessed, but not precisely determined, from our non-equilibrium SEC experiments. In the past months, we therefore attempted to determine Ndc80:Ska binding affinities by equilibrium experiments, including isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and fluorescence polarization (FP). We succeeded in the purification of large amounts of these multiprotein complexes expressed in insect cells and with the right phosphorylation state, which was challenging by itself. Regretfully, however, our efforts were not successful, and for different reasons. An apparent tendency of Ska to multimerize at higher μM concentrations (consistent with SEC-MALS analysis in Figure 1—figure supplement 1) hindered ITC measurements due to the generation of very large dilution heats. Conversely, fluorophores positioned at the C-terminal end of Ska1 (as used throughout the manuscript) retained full fluorescence polarization in the absence of Ndc80, preventing the inspection of Ndc80:Ska binding through changes in polarization. This is not unexpected given the large size and the elongated nature of these complexes. So, regretfully, we are currently unable to provide a number for the binding affinity of the Ndc80-Ska complex.</p><p>We also attempted to use fluorescence polarization to determine the binding between Ndc80 and a fluorescently labeled peptide that encompasses the sequence of the Ska3 binding site around residues 358 and 360. For this purpose we ordered three different peptides with sequences encompassing different segments of SKA3 (351-367, 334-367, and 351-377) in a double phosphorylated (phospho-T358 and phospho-T360) or non-phosphorylated form. To our satisfaction, the phosphorylated Ska3 351-377 peptide bound better to Ndc80 than the other five. This demonstrates that a minimal fragment also relies on the phosphorylation of T358 and T360 for the binding to Ndc80 and hints towards a potentially interesting contribution from the Ska3 368-377 stretch. This stretch is predicted to contain an α-helix and further experiments will be required to determine its importance. Despite these results, we have not been able to saturate polarization despite efforts to concentrate Ndc80<sup>full-length</sup> or Ndc80<sup>jubaea</sup> to (unprecedentedly high) concentrations exceeding 100 uM. This prevented us from affinity determination. Moreover, SEC experiments demonstrated efficient Ndc80:Ska binding at low μM concentrations whereas the polarization signal of the phospho 351-377 Ska3 peptide increases only minimally when Ndc80 is present at such concentrations. Full-length phosphorylated Ska thus binds Ndc80 with higher affinity than the phosphopeptide. Whether this is due to Ska’s ability to dimerize or multimerize remains to be tested.</p><p>We have thus attempted to determine the binding between Ndc80 and phosphorylated Ska using different methods. Quantitative assessment proved difficult due to the size of these complexes, the non-monomeric nature of Ska at higher concentrations, and the dependency on the right Ska3 phosphorylation pattern. Our SEC experiments indicate phosphorylation-dependent binding at low μM concentrations, EM micrographs indicate that Ndc80 recruits dimers of phosphorylated Ska, and our single-molecule and single-molecule experiments indicate that multivalent Ndc80 recruits phosphorylated Ska to microtubules at concentrations as low as 0.1 nM. As presented in Figure 5—figure supplement 1, the incubation of beads coated with trivalent Ndc80 with varying concentrations of Ska indicate the phosphorylation of SKA3 increases Ska’s affinity for Ndc80 in a limited concentration range (around 10 nM), while at higher concentrations even dephosphorylated Ska is bound to the Ndc80 oligomers. This is consistent with data in Figure 5C: Ska enhances the end-tracking of tailless Ndc80 trimers in a concentration-dependent manner and the phosphorylation-dependency of this is most pronounced at a Ska concentration of 10 nM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 3 it is important to clarify what the authors can and cannot interpret from the Aurora B data. Unless the authors test pre-de/phosphorylated Ndc80 and Ska that are then mixed, the section title (“Aurora B does not affect Ska:Ndc80 binding in vitro”) and conclusion that Aurora B does not affect the binding in vitro are not appropriate given the data. The authors should either revise language or perform experiments supporting current language.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that our description of this experiment was imprecise. Aurora B was indeed added to a pre-formed Ska:Ndc80 complex and we did thus not assess effects of Aurora B on the formation of this complex. We have revised the text and now refer consistently to this experiment as: “Aurora B does not disrupt a pre-formed Ska:Ndc80 complex”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Tail-deleted Ndc80 was shown to have a similar residence time (i.e. affinity) but to not track depolymerizing microtubules – this is different from analysis of monovalent tail-deleted Ndc80, which shows weak affinity for microtubules. Can the similar affinity of trivalent Ndc80 with and without the tail be demonstrated using a different approach (e.g. co-sedimentation?).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that unchanged residence time of tailless Ndc80 trimers is surprising given that monomeric Ndc80<sup>∆80</sup> was previously reported to bind more weakly to the microtubules than the full-length complex. We confirmed using co-sedimentation assays that our tailless monomeric Ndc80<sup>∆80</sup> bound microtubules less effectively than wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). This is consistent with previous literature. Although we observed that wild-type Ndc80 trimers as well as tailless Ndc80 trimers sediment almost completely in the presence of microtubules, a quantitative assessment of binding was unfortunately prevented by the sedimentation of trivalent Ndc80 in the absence of microtubules. We conclude that Ndc80 trimers on a streptavidin-based scaffold (spanning &gt;100 nm and ~0.5 MDa) are not suited for this assay.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-49539-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 5 the concentrations of Ska used in the trap assay are very high, and due to the observation of hyper-stable microtubules they may be interfering with the normal features of the system.

How would that affect interpretation of the interaction in the front part of the manuscript that is dependent on phosphorylation of the Ska3 C-terminus?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that some stabilization of microtubule lattice is expected at 100 nM Ska and have followed the reviewer’s suggestion to repeat experiments in the optical trap with 10 nM phosphorylated and dephosphorylated Ska. We have done so for all three types of Ndc80 trimers (non-phosphorylated, Aurora B-treated, and tailless) and are pleased to report 93 new measurements in Figure 5—figure supplements 2 and 3. These results are also included in our summary in Figure 6.</p><p>Compared to experiments in the absence of Ska, we note that 10 nM Ska results in an increase in the fraction of rescues after stalled microtubule depolymerization for phosphorylated and tailless Ndc80 trimers, and in a general increase in the stall duration in all conditions. Although the addition of 10 nM and 100 nM appears to have a comparable effect, we cannot conclude this with certainty with the current number of measurements.</p><p>It is interesting to point out that we did observe three ‘superstall’ events in the presence of Ska lacking SKA3<sup>∆C</sup>. We hypothesize that this hyper-stabilization of microtubule ends requires dephosphorylated Ndc80 tails and the accumulation of Ska at microtubule ends. Apart from these three events, Ska lacking SKA3<sup>∆C</sup> did not result in the increase in the force or duration of Ndc80-mediated microtubule stalls (Figure 5—figure supplement 3D) and did not bind to beads coated with Ndc80 trimers (Figure 5D). Since also the addition of Ska lacking SKA1<sup>MTBD</sup> (also in Figure 5—figure supplement 3D) did not alter force-coupling, we conclude that both SKA3:Ndc80 and SKA1:microtubule interactions are prerequisites for the stabilization of Ndc80-mediated microtubule stalls. We have improved our explanation of these phenomena throughout the text, see e.g. –subsection “Ska stabilizes end-on Ndc80-microtubule interactions under force”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) We believe that it is important that phosphorylated and dephosphorylated data are not pooled in order to understand the direct mechanical contribution of the Ska complex to the Ndc80-microtubule interface and what role phosphorylation plays.

Some expansion of the Discussion would also be helpful to provide a clearer picture of how phosphorylation impacts Ska:Ndc80 function (and how this may work in vivo).</p></disp-quote><p>We have included separate force-duration graphs for phosphorylated and dephosphorylated Ska at 10 and 100 nM for three types of Ndc80 trimers in Figure 5—figure supplement 2, and also relevant distributions in Figure 5—figure supplement 3. The overlapping and scattered data prevents us to determine the effect of Ska phosphorylation under these conditions. We have therefore presented pooled data in Figures 5 and 6.</p><p>As described above, we attribute the reduced importance of Ska phosphorylation for Ska:Ndc80 binding in our biophysical experiments to the multivalent organization of Ndc80 in our setup and to the presence of microtubules that provide a docking site for both Ska and Ndc80. At this point it is important to point out that we have previously demonstrated that monomeric Ndc80 -also at high local concentrations- is quite inefficient as a microtubule force-coupler (Volkov et al., 2018, Figure 4D). As described above, we have updated the Results and the Discussion sections of our manuscript to highlight these differences and to connect the two parts of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) We appreciate that the biophysical experiments are challenging but some increase in numbers would be important in substantiating the findings (i.e. the histograms in Figure 5—figure supplement 2 and Figure 4I and Figure 5G, H).

The updated data are presented in Figures 4I, 5H, and Figure 5—figure supplements 2 and 3. We also calculated Spearman correlations for these force vs. stall data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="resptable1">Author response table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="resptable1" position="anchor"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>no Ska</th><th>+ 100 nM Ska</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">T<sub>1</sub>S<sub>3</sub>-[Ndc80]<sub>3</sub></td><td valign="top">0.35 (<italic>p = 0.009</italic>)</td><td valign="top">0.42 (<italic>p = 0.014</italic>)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">T<sub>1</sub>S<sub>3</sub>-[Ndc80-P]<sub>3</sub></td><td valign="top">-0.23 (<italic>p = 0.23</italic>)</td><td valign="top">0.27 (<italic>p = 0.03</italic>)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">T1S3-[Ndc80<sup>∆80</sup>]3</td><td valign="top">-0.16 (<italic>p = 0.45</italic>)</td><td valign="top">0.47 (<italic>p = 0.003</italic>)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>While negative correlation coefficients in the absence of Ska proved to be insignificant, addition of Ska converts them into significant positive correlations. These correlation coefficients, however, should be treated with caution as they describe data with two outcomes (detachment or rescue) that have very different stall durations. Stalls that are followed by a rescue last roughly an order of magnitude longer. Therefore, the positive correlations could be attributed to the (increasing) appearance of rescues in the presence of Ska. We think that the fraction of rescue events, as reported in Figure 6, is a straightforward and meaningful to look at these data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) A key finding is that Ska increases the duration of Ndc80-mediated stalls of microtubule-depolymerisation. Can the authors provide any data on whether this is specific to Ska:Ndc80 or a more general mechanisms that would occur with other linkers (i.e. a rigor kinesin)? – While not absolutely essential, we do believe this would really give the manuscript significantly more impact in the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this interesting suggestion. We believe that the correlation of the probability to rescue with the duration of the stall is a property of a microtubule end, because very different sets of conditions we have tested so far resulted in practically the same curve (see Figure 6C-D). We suspect that any molecule able to keep a microtubule end in a stalled conformation for a long enough time will produce a similar relationship. However, to our knowledge a rigor kinesin has not been shown to stall microtubule shortening. This said, while we see that this is a very interesting question, which may eventually reveal a fundamental aspect of the behavior of force coupling, we note that the analysis of different linker would require the same inquisitive approach applied here (e.g. using various mutants, etc.) and we feel that this is a long-term question that, despite its interest, is outside the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) A significant amount of biophysical analysis of Ndc80 and Ska complexes has been conducted by Asbury/Davis and Grischchuk/Cheeseman groups – the key difference here is that trivalent Ndc80 complex is used (note that antibody-based crosslinking has been shown to improve Ndc80 end tracking – e.g. in Powers et al. Figure 6). The authors need to more clearly delineate similarities and differences from the prior work and suggest reasons underlying the differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We have emphasized these differences throughout our revised Discussion. In summary, key novel features of our study include:</p><p>1) Systematic analysis of molecular determinants for the interaction of purified recombinant full-length Ska and Ndc80 complexes. Previous work was performed with protein fragments (Schmidt et al., 2012, Chakraborty et al., 2019), in the absence of Ska phosphorylation (Schmidt et al., 2012, Chakraborty et al., 2019, Helgeson et al., 2018), and using cell lysates (Zhang et al., 2017). This allowed us to distinguish direct Ska-Ndc80 binding (phosphorylated SKA3<sup>C</sup>:NDC80/NUF2 coiled coil) from molecular features that are important for kinetochore-microtubule interactions (Ndc80 tail, Ndc80 loop, SKA1<sup>MTBD</sup>).</p><p>2) Controlled oligomerization of Ndc80, which we have previously found crucial for physiologically relevant interactions with microtubule ends (e.g. stalling and rescue of microtubule shortening), but which we also now report as important for efficient loading of Ska. Previous biophysical studies were performed with either monomeric Ndc80 (Schmidt et al., 2012, Chakraborty et al., 2019, Helgeson et al., 2018), or poorly controlled multimers of Ndc80 without Ska (McIntosh et al., 2008; Powers et al., 2009).</p><p>3) In our assays we let the microtubule develop the force, mimicking kinetochore-microtubule attachments in the cell. This allows us to study the efficiency of microtubule force production, and the parameters of the kinetochore-mediated stalls. Previous studies were performed either in the absence of external force (Schmidt et al., 2012, Chakraborty et al., 2019), or under conditions where force was applied to rupture the bead-microtubule connection (Helgeson et al., 2018), which limited the analysis of the effect of Ska on the stability of the stalled microtubule conformation, which we find to be crucial.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors need to describe the prior work in a more precise manner and be more cautious in their statements about what their work does versus does not imply. In particular, they cannot make strong claims about the degree to which the interaction they focus on in vitro accounts for Ska localization dynamics in vivo. The authors state that prior work has indicated a requirement for the Ndc80 tail in Ska localization – this is not correct. For example, the Cheerambathur manuscript cited in support of this claim showed that Ska localized in tail-deleted Ndc80 (see Figure 3E and F in that paper). The authors should more clearly acknowledge Zhang et al., 2017, in the Introduction for the discovery that phosphorylation of Ska3 by Cdk1 is important for Ska kinetochore localization and for interaction with Ndc80.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out and agree that the precise wording is crucial for the description of the recruitment of Ska to kinetochores. in vitro studies (like our current study) lack the complexity of interactions observed in vivo. At the same time, this allowed us to distinguish direct Ska-Ndc80 binding (phosphorylated SKA3<sup>C</sup>:NDC80/NUF2 coiled coil) from molecular features that are important for kinetochore-microtubule interactions (Ndc80 tail, Ndc80 loop, SKA1<sup>MTBD</sup>). Our experiments show that the Ndc80 tail does not interact with Ska.</p><p>Janczyk et al., 2017 reported that Ndc80-tail directly recruits Ska to kinetochores, and therefore we respectfully disagree with the reviewer’s concern that this interaction was not suggested in the prior literature. However, we agree with the reviewers’ interpretation of the data in Cheerambathur et al., 2017. We cite this paper at different points in our manuscript and write e.g.: “In another study, the Ndc80 N-terminal tail was shown to regulate the localization of Ska to kinetochores (Cheerambathur et al., 2017)”, which does not imply a direct interaction and is in agreement with major conclusions from that study.</p><p>We have updated our reference to the Zhang et al. 2017 study in the Introduction and changed “In yet another study…” to “In a key recent study …”. This change reflects how important this work was for our current study (as is also reflected by our frequent references to this work throughout our manuscript).</p></body></sub-article></article>
