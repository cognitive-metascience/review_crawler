control actin dynamics is not well defined. Here, we identify direct palmitoylation of the actin regulator LIM kinase-1 (LIMK1) as a novel mechanism to control spine-specific actin dynamics. A conserved palmitoyl-motif is necessary and sufficient to target LIMK1 to spines and to anchor LIMK1 in spines. ShRNA knockdown/rescue experiments reveal that LIMK1 palmitoylation is essential for normal spine actin polymerization, for spine-specific structural plasticity and for long-term spine stability. Palmitoylation is critical for LIMK1 function because this modification not only controls LIMK1 targeting, but is also essential for LIMK1 activation by its membrane-localized upstream activator PAK. These novel roles for palmitoylation in the spatial control of actin dynamics and kinase signaling provide new insights into structural plasticity mechanisms and strengthen links between dendritic spine impairments and neuropathological conditions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06327.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06327.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06327.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Neurons transmit information from one cell to the next by passing signals across junctions called synapses. For the neurons that receive these signals, these junctions are found on fine branch-like structures called dendrites that stick out of the cell. Dendrites themselves are decorated with smaller structures called dendritic spines, which typically receive information from one other neuron via a single synapse. Dendritic spines form in response to the signaling activity of the neuron, and problems with forming these spines have been linked to conditions such as autism and schizophrenia.</p><p>Dendritic spines are created by the cell's cytoskeleton—a network of proteins that creates a constantly changing internal scaffold that shapes cells. One cytoskeleton protein called actin exists as thin filaments that can be extended or broken up by other proteins. It is not fully understood how actin is regulated in the dendritic spines. However, some researchers thought that the proteins that control the formation of the actin filaments would need to be localized to the dendritic spines to ensure that the spines form correctly.</p><p>Some proteins can be made to localize to cell membranes by attaching a molecule called palmitic acid to them. Previous research has suggested that this ‘palmitoylation’ process is particularly important in neurons. Through a combination of experimental techniques, George et al. now show that palmitoylation is required to localize a protein called LIMK1, which regulates the construction of actin filaments, to the tips of dendritic spines. Further experiments showed that blocking the palmitoylation of LIMK1 alters how actin filaments form, makes spines unstable and causes synapses to be lost.</p><p>George et al. also discovered that palmitoylation is necessary for LIMK1 to be activated by another protein that is found at dendritic spine membranes. This ‘dual-control’ mechanism makes it possible to precisely control where actin filaments form within dendritic spines. In addition to LIMK1, several other enzymes are also modified by palmitoylation. It will therefore be interesting to determine whether this dual control mechanism is broadly used by neurons to precisely regulate the structure and function of individual spines and synapses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06327.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06327.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>DHHC</kwd><kwd>dendritic spine</kwd><kwd>protein trafficking</kwd><kwd>LTP</kwd><kwd>glutamate</kwd><kwd>LIMK1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21NS087414</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>Gareth M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shriners Hospitals for Children</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>Gareth M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shriners Hospitals for Children</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>George</surname><given-names>Joju</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The protein-lipid modification palmitoylation targets the kinase LIMK1 to dendritic spines to ensure precise control of the size of individual spines in response to synaptic activation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most excitatory synapses are formed on dendritic spines—small protrusions that decorate the shaft of neuronal dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bourne and Harris, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hotulainen and Hoogenraad, 2010</xref>). Changes in the size and shape of individual spines are closely associated with Long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular correlate of learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fifková and Van Harreveld, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yuste and Bonhoeffer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bosch and Hayashi, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Murakoshi and Yasuda, 2012</xref>). Moreover, abnormal spine morphology and/or density are hallmarks of Intellectual Disability and other cognitive dysfunctions, including Autism-Spectrum Disorders and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fiala et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Penzes et al., 2011</xref>). These findings suggest that precise regulation of dendritic spine morphology and number is critical for normal cognition.</p><p>Spines are highly enriched in actin filaments, and dynamic modulation of the actin cytoskeleton is crucial for controlling not only spine formation and elimination, but also modifications of the size, shape and motility of existing spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hotulainen and Hoogenraad, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bosch and Hayashi, 2012</xref>). In response to local synaptic cues, neurons can rapidly alter the morphology of individual spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Okamoto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Honkura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Murakoshi et al., 2011</xref>). This process likely requires precise spatial regulation of proteins that increase actin polymerization and those that sever/disassemble actin filaments in a given spine. However, many actin regulators are predicted to be soluble, diffusible proteins, which appear poorly suited to operate with the necessary spatial specificity. This raises the question of how spatially precise, spine-specific actin regulation is achieved.</p><p>We hypothesized that neurons must possess mechanisms to localize and/or confine certain actin regulatory proteins within dendritic spines, not only to ensure spine-specific regulation but perhaps also to control actin polymerization/depolymerization at the subspine level. One mechanism to control protein localization is palmitoylation, a protein-lipid modification that targets cytosolic proteins to specific membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fukata and Fukata, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thomas and Huganir, 2013</xref>). Palmitoylation occurs in all eukaryotic cells but appears to be especially important in neurons because human genetic mutations and mouse knockouts of Palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs, which catalyze palmitoylation) frequently lead to neurological and/or cognitive deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fukata and Fukata, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Greaves and Chamberlain, 2011</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that palmitoylation might modulate actin regulators to ensure spatially restricted signaling in spines.</p><p>Two important actin regulatory proteins are the LIM kinases (LIMK1 and LIMK2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tada and Sheng, 2006</xref>]), which phosphorylate and inactivate the actin severing protein cofilin, thus promoting actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mizuno et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arber et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang et al., 1998</xref>). Interestingly, LIMK1 appears particularly important for actin regulation in spines, because <italic>LIMK1</italic> knockout in mice or genetic mutation in humans is associated with spine abnormalities and cognitive impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frangiskakis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tassabehji et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meng et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, although LIMK1's upstream activator in neurons is unclear, spine abnormalities and intellectual impairments are also linked to mutations in <italic>PAK3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boda et al., 2004</xref>), a member of the p21-activated kinase (PAK) family that phosphorylates and activates LIMK1 in non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edwards et al., 1999</xref>). These findings link PAK/LIMK1-dependent regulation of actin polymerization to the control of spine morphology and higher brain function. However, PAKs and LIMKs are predicted soluble, cytosolic proteins. How, then, might they regulate actin with the necessary spatial precision?</p><p>Here we report that palmitoylation of LIMK1 at a specific N-terminal motif is necessary and sufficient to target LIMK1 to spines. Palmitoyl-LIMK1 is essential for normal spine actin turnover, activity-dependent morphological plasticity and long-term spine stability. Strikingly, palmitoylation controls not only LIMK1 localization but also its activation by PAK in neurons. This novel ‘dual-control’ mechanism ensures spatially precise actin regulation at the single spine and potentially also the subspine levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A conserved palmitoyl-motif in LIMK1</title><p>To address whether palmitoylation of actin regulators facilitates spatial control of actin polymerization in spines, we performed two bioinformatic searches for potential palmitoyl-motifs in actin regulatory proteins.

To isolate palmitoyl-proteins, we subjected lysates to Acyl-biotin exchange (ABE). ABE uses an exchange of thioester-linked acyl modifications (i.e., palmitoylation), for biotin, with the resultant biotinylated proteins being affinity-purified using neutravidin-conjugated beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thomas et al., 2012</xref>). Wt-LIMK1-myc was clearly detected in ABE fractions, indicative of palmitoylation, but was not detected in control purifications in which the essential ABE reagent hydroxylamine (NH<sub>2</sub>OH) was omitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, CCSS-LIMK1-myc was not detected in ABE fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that LIMK1 is palmitoylated at Cys7/Cys8.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Palmitoylation is necessary to target and confine LIMK1 to dendritic spines</title><p>To investigate the neuronal role of palmitoyl-LIMK1, we examined LIMK1 palmitoylation in cultured hippocampal neurons, focusing on four developmental stages: 4 days in vitro (DIV4), when neurites are extending; DIV8, when dendrites elaborate and undergo branching; DIV12, when dendritic spines first appear and DIV20, when spines and synapses are mature (a time course similar to previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaech and Banker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beaudoin et al., 2012</xref>]). Interestingly, despite similar LIMK1 protein expression across these developmental stages, palmitoyl-LIMK1 was not detected in ABE fractions from DIV4 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, palmitoyl-LIMK1 became detectable at DIV8, increased markedly at DIV12 and remained prominent at DIV20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These findings suggest that LIMK1 is palmitoylated in hippocampal neurons and that its palmitoylation coincides with spine development and maturation. This conclusion is consistent with the robust palmitoylation of LIMK1 in adult rat forebrain homogenates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>The temporal correlation of LIMK1 palmitoylation and spine formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and the altered spine morphology in <italic>LIMK1</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meng et al., 2002</xref>), suggested that palmitoyl-LIMK1 might play a specific role in spines. In support of this hypothesis, wt-LIMK1 was highly enriched in spines but CCSS-LIMK1 was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). We reasoned that palmitoylation might anchor LIMK1 in spines to limit its diffusion, thus enhancing spatial control of actin regulation. We therefore transfected neurons with GFP-tagged LIMK1 and monitored its diffusibility by Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) using time-lapse imaging. Prominent FRAP, indicative of diffusion of the tagged protein, was observed with CCSS-LIMK1-GFP but not with wt-LIMK1-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Quantitative analysis of FRAP data confirmed that CCSS mutation decreased the stable fraction of LIMK1-GFP in spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We note that the time course of LIMK1-GFP FRAP, irrespective of its palmitoylation status, is markedly slower than previously characterized soluble proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Star et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bingol et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>). This suggests that other factors, most likely protein–protein interactions, are important to constrain LIMK1 in spines. However, our FRAP results suggest that palmitoylation, in addition to targeting LIMK1 to spines, also increases the fraction of LIMK1 that is stably anchored in spine heads.</p><p>As an additional line of evidence that the impaired spine targeting caused by Cys7,8 mutation is palmitoylation-specific, we used a pharmacological approach. The palmitoylation inhibitor 2-Bromopalmitate (2-Br; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jennings et al., 2009</xref>]) did not affect endogenous LIMK1 protein levels, but greatly reduced LIMK1 palmitoylation in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), reinforcing the conclusion that LIMK1 is palmitoylated. In parallel experiments, 2-Br greatly reduced wt-LIMK1 spine targeting without affecting overall spine numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The similar effects of CCSS mutation and 2-Br treatment strongly suggest that Cys7/Cys8 palmitoylation is required for LIMK1 spine targeting.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>LIMK1's dual palmitoylation motif is sufficient for spine targeting</title><p>We next asked whether LIMK1's palmitoylation motif is sufficient for spine targeting.

However, despite links between LIMK1 and activity-dependent spine signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bosch et al., 2014</xref>), the pathway that activates LIMK1 in spines is unclear. LIMK1 can be phosphorylated by either PAK or ROCK family kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edwards et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maekawa et al., 1999</xref>), both of which are active at the membrane because they bind active forms of Rac/Rho/Cdc42 small G proteins. Interestingly, PAK inhibition, but not ROCK inhibition, greatly reduced LIMK1 phosphorylation in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>), suggesting that PAK is the key LIMK1 activator in spines. This conclusion is supported by the robust phosphorylation of LIMK1 by PAK3 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), and by prior links between PAKs and activity-dependent morphological plasticity of single spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Murakoshi et al., 2011</xref>).

This study reveals a novel role for palmitoylation in the spatial control of signaling events that regulate neuronal actin polymerization. It has been unclear how actin regulatory proteins, many of which are predicted to be diffusible, can control spatially precise changes in dendritic spine morphology. Our results suggest that one key factor in the spatial control of actin dynamics is palmitoylation of the actin regulator LIMK1, which is required for normal actin turnover in spines, for spine-specific structural plasticity and for long-term spine stability. These findings reveal new mechanisms that may govern both spine-specific morphological plasticity and perhaps also intra-spine control of actin dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>How does palmitoylation regulate LIMK1 localization and signaling?</title><p>The functional requirement for palmitoyl-LIMK1 in spine-specific regulation likely arises from at least three different effects of palmitoylation on LIMK1 at the cellular and molecular level. First, palmitoylation is critical for LIMK1 enrichment in dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Interestingly, even LIMK1 mutants that are predicted to be dually lipidated (Myr-SC- and Myr-CS-LIMK1) are not spine-enriched, suggesting that dual palmitoylation is the key factor that controls LIMK1 spine targeting. Consistent with this notion, LIMK1's dual palmitoylation motif is sufficient to target a heterologous protein (GFP) to spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). It is remarkable that such specific targeting information is contained within such a short sequence. Moreover, to our knowledge, no other specific spine-targeting motif has been described. LIMK1's 1–15 sequence could hence be extremely useful to deliver any protein of interest specifically to spines, which could facilitate a range of studies into spine and synaptic biology.</p><p>Second, palmitoylation increases the stable fraction of LIMK1 in spines and thus helps to anchor LIMK1 in spine heads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, although this effect is significant, even CCSS-LIMK1 fluorescence recovery is far slower than that reported for cytosolic GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Star et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>) and is also markedly slower than that of the proteasome subunit Rpt1, a protein of similar size to LIMK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bingol et al., 2010</xref>). Other factors, most likely protein–protein interactions, are thus likely major determinants of LIMK1's limited diffusibility in spines, with palmitoylation exerting an additional stabilizing effect.</p><p>Third, dual palmitoylation is critical for LIMK1 phosphorylation at its activatory T508 site in neurons. In contrast, palmitoyl-site mutants (CCSS-LIMK1, SC-LIMK1 and CS-LIMK1), although not absent from spines, are not phosphorylated, and phosphorylation of myristoylated LIMK1 mutants (Myr-CCSS-LIMK1, Myr-SC-LIMK1, Myr-CS-LIMK1) is also very low. These results suggest that enrichment on the spine membrane, rather than membrane attachment per se, is essential for LIMK1 phosphorylation in neurons. A plausible reason for this spine-specific activation is that key LIMK1 activators, in particular active forms of CaMKII and PAK, are also specifically enriched on or adjacent to the spine membrane ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shen and Meyer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06327.021</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model of palmitoyl-LIMK1-dependent control of actin dynamics in dendritic spines.</title><p>Dendritic spine schematic (left panel) with the indicated region expanded (blue boundary) to the right. Palmitoylation targets LIMK1 to the spine membrane, where it is phosphorylated by membrane-bound activators such as Rac/Cdc42/PAK. In contrast, any non-palmitoylated LIMK1 in the spine ‘core’ remains inactive. By governing both LIMK1 localization and activation, palmitoylation may also facilitate local, juxtamembrane-specific phosphorylation of cofilin and/or other LIMK1 substrates to enhance the spatial control of actin filament turnover in spines.

Multiple lines of evidence suggest a key role for cofilin, LIMK1's best known substrate, in these processes. Not only is cofilin phosphorylation critical for activity-dependent spine enlargement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gu et al., 2010</xref>), but elevated neuronal activity rapidly increases both spine volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2008</xref>]) and also endogenous levels of phosphorylated, inactive cofilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rex et al., 2009</xref>). However, despite these links, it is possible that additional and/or different palmitoyl-LIMK1 substrates contribute to the functional effects that we observe.</p><p>Even if cofilin is the key substrate via which palmitoyl-LIMK1 exerts effects on spines, some of our results are worthy of further discussion. One might predict that increases in dephospho- (active) cofilin, caused by LIMK1 knockdown, would lead to an excess of short actin filaments and/or actin monomers, so that GFP-actin fluorescence in our FRAP experiments would recover more rapidly and/or to a greater extent. Surprisingly, though, a significant percentage of actin in LIMK1 knockdown (and CCSS-LIMK1 ‘rescue’) spines appears to be very stable. One possible explanation for this finding is that LIMK1 knockdown may increase the formation of cofilin-actin rods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bamburg et al., 2010</xref>), stable structures that are formed only by dephospho-cofilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernstein et al., 2006</xref>). However, while well documented within neurites, cofilin-actin rods have not been reported within spines.</p><p>A second explanation arises from the ability of active (dephospho-) cofilin to induce a twist in actin filament conformation that propagates along the filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bamburg et al., 1999</xref>). Filaments are more likely to sever at boundaries between cofilin-bound (twisted) and unbound (untwisted) regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bobkov et al., 2006</xref>). However, an entire cofilin-bound filament, as might occur in some LIMK1 knockdown (or CCSS-LIMK1 rescue) spines, is more stable than a bare filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dedova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrianantoandro and Pollard, 2006</xref>). Thus, LIMK1 knockdown may lead to a subset of filaments that are decorated with active cofilin but which are actually more stable.</p><p>A third, intriguing explanation arises from findings that LTD-like stimuli (low frequency electrical stimulation or bath application of NMDA) markedly increase actin filament stability in spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Star et al., 2002</xref>). Strikingly, our LTP-like glutamate uncaging stimulus results in shrinkage of a subset of spines (an LTD-like effect), almost exclusively restricted to the LIMK1 knockdown and CCSS-LIMK1 rescue conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that some LIMK1 knockdown (and CCSS-LIMK1 rescue) spines respond to LTP-like inputs with LTD-like outputs that is, that their learning rules are impaired. LIMK1 knockdown and CCSS-LIMK1 ‘rescue’ spines may therefore interpret spontaneous bursts of activity in cultured neurons as an LTD-like stimulus. In the short term this may result in decreased actin filament turnover, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Star et al., 2002</xref>), while over longer times this impaired actin turnover may underlie the spine shrinkage and synapse loss seen in the absence of palmitoyl-LIMK1.</p><p>Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility that additional palmitoyl-LIMK1 substrate(s) rather than cofilin are responsible for effects on actin turnover and/or morphological plasticity. Super-resolution and/or electron microscopy approaches may provide more insight into how actin filament structure and/or turnover is altered in the absence of palmitoyl-LIMK1. However, while the molecular explanation remains to be elucidated, our results strongly suggest that palmitoylation of LIMK1 is critical for normal actin filament turnover in spines.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Could palmitoyl-LIMK1 control polarized ‘shell-to-core’ actin regulation in spines?</title><p>If cofilin is indeed the key palmitoyl-LIMK1 substrate responsible for the functional effects that we observe then could this provide insight into the sub-spine control of actin dynamics? Previous studies reveal a directional flow of actin from the spine tip to the neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Honkura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frost et al., 2010</xref>). These findings are consistent with models of actin array treadmilling, in which new actin molecules are incorporated at actin filament barbed ends, predominantly located close to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Le Clainche and Carlier, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hotulainen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bugyi and Carlier, 2010</xref>). These models suggest that actin polymerization is favored in this juxtamembrane region, or ‘shell’ of the spine. Conversely, though, disassembly/severing must be favored towards the center of the spine head (‘core’), both to prevent filament overgrowth and to supply new actin monomers for ongoing treadmilling.</p><p>Many proteins likely contribute to the intra-spine balance of actin filament polymerization/ depolymerization. However, a key generator of actin monomers is cofilin, which enhances filament disassembly by severing ‘aged’ regions of filaments (those in which ADP-actin subunits predominate, usually toward filament pointed ends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mizuno, 2013</xref>]). It has been hypothesized that in order for treadmilling to occur normally, LIMK1 may need to phosphorylate and inhibit cofilin specifically in juxtamembrane regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ridley, 2006</xref>). How such spatially precise cofilin regulation might be achieved has been unclear, but could be aided by the enrichment of active, palmitoylated LIMK1 on the spine membrane. Juxtamembrane-specific phosphorylation of cofilin by palmitoyl-LIMK1 would be predicted to locally favor actin filament polymerization to maintain or, in response to local synaptic cues, rapidly expand the size of the spine head. Conversely, palmitoyl-LIMK1's absence from the spine core would allow cofilin to remain active and disassemble/sever actin filaments, ensuring a supply of actin monomers for treadmilling and limiting excess filament polymerization. A key ‘security feature’ of this model is that inappropriately localized (depalmitoylated) LIMK1 is inactive in neurons and thus would not adversely affect such spatially precise cofilin regulation.</p><p>In support of this model, the phosphatase Slingshot-1L, which dephosphorylates and activates cofilin, is active only when bound to actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nagata-Ohashi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Soosairajah et al., 2005</xref>) and would thus be predicted to be less active in juxtamembrane regions. However, we emphasize that such a cofilin gradient model is speculative, and that overall cofilin activity in spines is likely controlled not only by LIMK1, but also by proteins such as Actin-interacting protein-1 (Aip1) that regulate cofilin activity, and those such as Coronins that control cofilin-actin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ono, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kueh et al., 2008</xref>). Nonetheless, an intriguing possibility arising from this model is that palmitoylation of signaling enzymes (discussed further below) is used by neurons to establish or maintain polarized (shell-to-core, or edge-to-center) signaling gradients.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>What lies upstream of LIMK1 palmitoylation?</title><p>Another key question regards how LIMK1 palmitoylation is regulated in spines. Changes in neuronal activity acutely alter palmitoylation of a subset of synaptodendritic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kang et al., 2008</xref>). However, our preliminary findings suggest that LIMK1 does not fall into this category, because LIMK1 palmitoylation in ABE assays is unaltered by treatment of neurons with Bicuculline or KCl (JG and GT, unpublished observations). However, it is still possible that extracellular stimuli, particularly those such as ephrins that acutely regulate spine dynamics via PAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Penzes et al., 2003</xref>), may dynamically alter LIMK1 palmitoylation. In addition, limitations of the ABE assay (which detects the entire cellular complement of palmitoyl-LIMK1, irrespective of location) could mask selective changes in LIMK1 palmitoylation at spines.</p><p>It is also unclear which PAT(s) controls LIMK1 palmitoylation in spines. Multiple PATs can palmitoylate LIMK1 in cotransfected HEK293T cells, including both Golgi-localized and synaptodendritic PATs (JG and GT, unpublished observations). This finding suggests that no single PAT is likely to control LIMK1 palmitoylation. It is also unclear whether the activity of LIMK1's upstream activators PAK and/or CaMKII is required for LIMK1 palmitoylation. These are all interesting questions to address in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>New roles for palmitoylation in the spatial control of neuronal signaling</title><p>Two broader points that emerge from our findings is that palmitoylation can ensure spatially precise control of actin regulation and of kinase signaling. With this in mind, it is interesting that the actin regulators profilin and coronin are also likely palmitoylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kang et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that palmitoylation may control multiple aspects of spine-specific actin regulation.</p><p>In addition, recent reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Takemoto-Kimura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yang et al., 2012</xref>) and our own ongoing experiments (in which we have identified several other palmitoyl-kinases; JG and GT, unpublished observations) suggest that signaling by other kinases is palmitoylation-dependent. Moreover, numerous other signaling enzymes contain predicted palmitoylation sites similar to those found in LIMK1 (not shown). Neurons may thus broadly use palmitoylation to localize diverse groups of signaling enzymes to enhance the spatial specificity of myriad intracellular signaling events.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Links between LIMK1 palmitoylation, cytoskeletal regulation and cognitive function</title><p>Aberrant regulation of the spine actin cytoskeleton is strongly linked to impaired cognition. There has been considerable interest in LIMK1 in this regard, due to <italic>LIMK1'</italic>s frequent genetic deletion in Williams syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frangiskakis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tassabehji et al., 1996</xref>) and the impaired performance of <italic>LIMK1</italic> knockout mice in learning tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meng et al., 2002</xref>). This latter phenotype was linked to impaired spine morphology, but whether LIMK1 acts directly in spines was unclear. Our results strongly support this hypothesis and further implicate LIMK1 palmitoylation as critical for the control of spine structure. Moreover, differential spine targeting of LIMK1 and LIMK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) may explain LIMK2's failure to compensate following loss or mutation of LIMK1.</p><p>We do, however, note some differences between effects of germline <italic>LIMK1</italic> knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meng et al., 2002</xref>) and LIMK1 knockdown in mature neurons (this study). In particular, conventional <italic>LIMK1</italic> knockout mainly affects spine morphology and PSD size, while LIMK1 knockdown reduces spine and synapse numbers. The more subtle effects of conventional <italic>LIMK1</italic> knockout may be due to developmental compensation by other pathways. Indeed, acute knockdown of other synaptic proteins causes more dramatic effects than germline knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elias et al., 2006</xref>). Nonetheless, our findings strengthen links between LIMK1 and the control of spine morphology and plasticity, both of which are linked to higher brain function.</p><p>Finally, spine-associated impairments in the absence of palmitoyl-LIMK1 are reminiscent of phenotypes seen in human patients with Intellectual Disability and other cognitive disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fiala et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nadif Kasri and Van Aelst, 2008</xref>).

Spine ‘growth success’ and spine ‘shrinkage’ events reflect instances where the average normalized intensity values remained above, or below, 2× the SD of the baseline (±16% for growth success and spine shrinkage, respectively) for the duration of the experiment after glutamate uncaging. Spine diameter measures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) were estimated based on a full width at half maximum value (in μm), calculated by applying a Gaussian fit to the intensity profile across the spine head of the first baseline image.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Quantification of synaptic puncta</title><p>Synaptic puncta in transfected neurons were defined as signals that were positive for GFP (morphology marker), PSD-95 (postsynaptic marker) and Synapsin (presynaptic marker). Synaptic puncta per unit length of dendrite were quantified using NIH ImageJ software. Briefly, PSD-95 and Synapsin images in each channel were thresholded by gray value at a level close to 50% of the dynamic range. This threshold value was kept constant for all images in each condition, and background noise from these images were negligible. The GFP fill was used to trace 100 µm segments along the three most prominent dendrites emanating from the cell body. Synaptic puncta of 2–20 pixel units, defined as above, were measured using the Boolean function ‘AND’ for the selected channels within each dendritic segment. Results were logged to a spreadsheet.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr C Benedict and S Karnam for molecular biological assistance, all Thomas lab members for helpful discussions and Drs G Gallo, Y Son (both SHPRC/Temple) and C Su (UCSD) for invaluable suggestions.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Pekka Lappalainen, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before reaching the decision. As you will see, they all considered your findings on LIMK1 palmitoylation important and interesting, and found majority of the data convincing and of high technical quality. However, they stated that a few additional experiments are required to strengthen the conclusions presented, and that the manuscript text and some figures should be revised. Most importantly, it appears that palmitoylation has a more complex role in LIMK1 localization and function in spines than proposed in the present version of the manuscript. Furthermore, the model concerning cofilin activity gradient generated solely by LIMK1 activity was not found particularly convincing.</p><p>Major comments (required):</p><p>1) Does dipalmitoylation of LIMK1 simply function in membrane anchoring or does the membrane insertion of this region alter the interactions of the LIMK1 N-terminus with other binding partners? This could be tested by using a N-myr mutant protein with a single cysteine in the palmitoylation region (CS or SC) such that a doubly acylated N-terminal tail (myristate and palmitate) would be expressed in cells. Would this behave identically to the dipalmitoylated species? Unless the N-terminal myristoylation interferes with recognition of the palmitoylation domain by the PAT, this experiment should be easily done. If the Myr/Palm form accumulates to spines, is it activated normally by signaling through Pak?</p><p>2) The FRAP data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> should be properly fitted and analyzed. In addition to examining the sizes of immobile fractions, the authors should obtain information about the dynamics of the mobile fractions. Furthermore, it would be important to perform FRAP analysis also on GFP alone as a control for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>, (i.e. to measure the dynamics of a truly soluble protein in spines). Overall, the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> suggest that both wild-type and CCSS-LIMK1 display very slow dynamics in spines, indicating that LIMK1 associates with other proteins that severely limit its diffusion at these sites. Thus, palmitoylation seems to play a more complex role in LIMK1 localization and function that just anchoring this protein to the plasma membrane. Moreover, the results of FRAP analysis presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> should be more precisely discussed by considering the known functions of LIMK1 and ADF/cofilins.</p><p>3) Actin dynamics and structural plasticity of dendritic spines have been associated with the maintenance and plasticity of “functional” strength of excitatory synapses. Demonstrating the importance of LIMK1 palmitoylation in the maintenance of excitatory synaptic transmission and glutamate uncaging-induced functional plasticity would thus significantly strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>Other comments:</p><p>1) The “shell-to-core” cofilin activity gradient hypothesis is not sufficiently well supported by the data in the present study. Therefore, the manuscript text and Figure 10 should be accordingly modified.</p><p>2) To provide the readers more balanced view on the mechanisms regulating cofilin activity in cells, it would be important to discuss the possible roles of phosphatases and other interacting proteins in regulating cofilin activity and actin dynamics in dendritic spines.</p><p>3) The palmitoyl acyltransferase data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) are not particularly convincing, and should be either significantly strengthened or omitted from the manuscript.</p><p>4) The authors should discuss what lies upstream of LIMK1 palmitoylation in neurons.</p><p>Below, please also find the specific comments by the three reviewers. These will provide you additional information about how to deal with the points listed above.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>Precisely controlled actin filament assembly and disassembly are crucial for morphogenesis of dendritic spines in neurons. However, the spatial mechanisms controlling actin dynamics in spines are incompletely understood. Here, George et al. identify palmitoylation of LIMK1 as an important mechanism controlling actin dynamics in spines. They show that palmitoylation is critical for enrichment of LIMK1 (but not LIMK2) in spines and for its activation at these sites. Consequently LIMK1 palmitoylation is important for proper regulation of actin dynamics and long-term stability of dendritic spines.</p><p>The majority of the experiments presented appear to be of good technical quality, and the manuscript provides important new information concerning the spatial control of actin dynamics in neurons as well as on the mechanisms that control the subcellular localization of LIMK1. However, there are few important points that should be addressed to improve the study.</p><p>1) The results of FRAP experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> are somewhat confusing, and the authors should perform better analysis of the FRAP data. From the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, it seems that that the actual rates of fluorescence recovery are quite similar in all cases (although this should be carefully examined by fitting the data). However, LIMK1 knockdown and CCSS-LIMK1 rescue cells exhibit a significantly larger immobile fraction of actin compared to control cells. Thus, while majority of actin filaments in control cells undergo relatively rapid turnover, approximately 30 % of actin filaments in LIMK1 (and CCSS-LIMK1 rescue spines) appear to be very stable. How does inactivation of LIMK1, which is a negative regulator of ADF/cofilin-mediated rapid actin filament disassembly, result in appearance of a stable actin filament pool in spines (because increased ADF/cofilin activity would be expected to increase (not decrease) actin filament turnover in spines)? This surprising result should be discussed in the 'Results' and 'Discussion' sections in more detail. Furthermore, the FRAP data should be properly fitted and analyzed as described e.g. in Koskinen et al., (Mol. Cell. Neurosci., 2014) to obtain information about the dynamics of the mobile actin fraction.</p><p>2) Similarly, the FRAP experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> provided somewhat surprising results, and should be analyzed and discussed more carefully. Based on these experiments, it seems that both wild-type LIMK1 and CCSS-LIMK1 display very slow dynamics in spines. This indicates that LIMK1 associates in spines with other proteins that severely limit its mobility. To understand the dynamics of wild-type LIMK1 and CCSS-LIMK1 in spines, the authors should perform similar data fitting as requested for GFP-actin above as well as perform FRAP analysis on GFP alone as a control (i.e. to measure the dynamics of a truly soluble protein in spines). Overall, these data seem to suggest that palmitoylation is not required to immobilize LIMK1 in spines, but rather plays a more complex role in localizing this protein to dendritic spines and regulating its activity at these sites.</p><p>3) The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are not particularly convincing and could perhaps be deleted from the manuscript. Is it possible that the differences in LIMK1 and NPY co-localization as well as in LIMK1 targeting to spines after brefeldin A treatment in proximal vs. distal regions could result from differences in the rate of depalmitoylation at these regions (instead of different palmitoyl acyltransferases interacting with LINK1 at different regions of dendrites)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>This manuscript by George et al reports the role of LIMK1 palmitoylation in the regulation of actin polymerization and morphological plasticity in dendritic spines. In support of this, the authors show that LIMK1 is palmitoylated at the N-terminal double cysteines, and that this modification promotes spine localization of the protein. Functionally, this palmitoylation is required for actin polymerization and stability of dendritic spines, and also for activity-dependent spine volume increase. Lastly, LIMK1 palmitoylation promotes LIMK1 activation (T508 phosphorylation), which requires CaMKII and PAK activation.</p><p>This is an interesting identification of a novel synaptic protein that is modified by palmitoylation, and demonstration of a novel role of a protein palmitoylation in the regulation of synaptic actin polymerization and activity-dependent structural plasticity of dendritic spines. Given the importance of actin-regulatory mechanisms in dendritic spines, and the known involvement of LIMK1 in cognitive impairments in humans, this study seems to have a significant impact in the field.</p><p>1) This study mainly monitors actin polymerization and activity-dependent changes in spine volume as functional measures of the proposed mechanisms. However, actin dynamics and structural plasticity of dendritic spines have been keenly associated with the maintenance and plasticity of “functional” strength of excitatory synapses. Demonstrating the importance of LIMK1 palmitoylation in the maintenance of excitatory synaptic transmission and glutamate uncaging-induced functional plasticity would much strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>2) It is unclear what lies in the upstream of LIMK1 palmitoylation. Is NMDAR activation required? Is the activation of CaMKII or PAK required for LIMK1 palmitoylation? Which PATs are involved in LIMK1 palmitoylation? Is the T508 phosphorylation of LIMK1 required for its palmitoylation? These aspects are all unclear and should be explored to some extent or, less ideally, discussed. Some questions marks can be added to the summary diagram in Figure 10.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:</p><p>Summary: In this very well written manuscript, the authors clearly demonstrate that the double cysteine motif at residues 7 and 8 of LIM kinase 1, which is not present in LIMK2, serves as a site for dipalmitoylation. This motif is both necessary and sufficient to target and anchor LIMK1 within dendritic spines. Interestingly, the authors find a brefeldin A-dependent and independent mechanism for spine delivery of palmitoylated-LIMK1, the former being used to supply proximal spines within about 100 μm of the soma and the latter used to deliver palmitoylated LIMK1 to distal spines. The activation of LIMK1 in spines by Pak is shown to be dependent upon LIMK1 palmitoylation, although in vitro, soluble active Pak can phosphorylate wild type and the non-palmitoylatable mutant CCSS-LIMK1 equally well. Studies on actin assembly dynamics using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) in spines of neurons expressing WT and mutant forms of LIMK1 show that normal dynamics and spine enlargement driven by glutamate stimulation requires palmitoylated LIMK1.</p><p>Critique: The sound experiments presented and the high quality results shown in the figures require very little comment. However there are some results that are missing which would be welcome additions to what is presented.</p><p>A question remains as to the role of the dipalmitoylation—is it simply membrane anchoring or does the membrane insertion of this region alter the interactions with other binding partners of the LIMK1 N-terminus? I am surprised that the authors did not use the N-myr mutant protein with a single cysteine in the palmitoylation region (CS or SC) such that a doubly acylated N-terminal tail (myristate and palmitate) resulted. Would this behave identically to the dipalmitoylated species? Unless the N-terminal myristoylation interfered with recognition of the palmitoylation domain by the PAT, this experiment should be easily done. If the Myr/Palm form is bound to membrane in spines, is it activated normally by signaling through Pak?</p><p>The evidence for the Golgi-dependence for proximal spine delivery of the palmitoylated LIMK1 is very strong, but the evidence for distal spine delivery requiring localized PAT activity is speculative. Although this mechanism is certainly possible, it may not be the only possibility for distal delivery. Until somatodendritic PATs can be down regulated differentially from those at the Golgi, it may remain a speculation.</p><p>In spite of the very high quality work shown in the studies presented here, there are still many unanswered questions regarding the model put forward to explain the centripetal retrograde flow of actin subunits that are adding onto actin filaments at the spine periphery and disassembling in the center. In this regard it is incorrect to talk about cofilin as “severing filament pointed ends” (in the subsection headed “Polarized “shell-to-core” actin regulation in spines by palmitoyl-LIMK1”) and referencing the 2003 Pollard and Borisy review. Severing can occur anywhere in the filament where ADP-actin subunits predominate (which is generally more toward the pointed end of dynamic filaments). However, the type of turnover of these branched networks that is occurring is more correctly termed array treadmilling and there are many more current reviews, one of which should be cited for this. Given that the authors favor a cofilin gradient model, it is surprising that the Discussion fails to include a reference to work published from the Zheng lab in Nature Neuroscience (Gu J, et al., Nat Neurosci 13, 1208-1215, 2010) in which cofilin inhibition by LIMK1 was required for LTP-induced spine enlargement, a role proposed here for the LIMK1 in spines.</p><p>The speculative model that focuses on the possibility of a cofilin activity gradient also requires some comment. There are many additional factors that need to be considered. First, for cofilin to be regulated in such a manner its concentration would have to be quite low in spines and one would expect the phosphatases, which regulate its activation, would also need to be localized to the central domain because their activity seems to dominate the phosphorylation state of cofilin (see Gu paper referenced above and others). There is evidence that slingshot-1L, a major cofilin phosphatase is only active when bound to F-actin, a fact that could help support the gradient model (Nagata-Ohashi K, et al. J Cell Biol. 165: 465-471, 2004: Soosairajah J, et al., EMBO J 24, 473-486, 2005). However, other studies suggest that the actin filament severing activity of cofilin is modulated (enhanced) in vivo by Aip1 (see recent Chen et al., J Biol Chem, 290: 2289-2300, 2015 and references theirin) and that cofilin's recruitment to F-actin is also modulated by coronin 1A (Kueh HY et al., J Cell Biol. 182:341-353, 2008). These proteins likely impact the actin dynamics and retrograde flow. Finally, many (perhaps all?) spines may undergo transient penetration by microtubules (Merriam EB, et al., J Neurosci 33: 16471-82, 2013)), whose assembly may also be modulated in a LIMK1-dependent manner by p25/TPPP, a protein that affects HDAC activity and acetylation of MTs (Acevedo K, et al., Exp Cell Res, 313, 4091-4106, 2007; Schofield AV, et al., J Biol Chem 288: 7907-17, 2013). I am not trying to argue for any one of these models, but simply believe that in this paper the authors have not convinced me that a gradient of cofilin activity exists nor that cofilin is the only target involved in regulating the actin dynamics. Maybe tone this model down a bit and remove the figure since such a figure is often what the reader will take away, even if totally speculative.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06327.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Does dipalmitoylation of LIMK1 simply function in membrane anchoring or does the membrane insertion of this region alter the interactions of the LIMK1 N-terminus with other binding partners? This could be tested by using a N-myr mutant protein with a single cysteine in the palmitoylation region (CS or SC) such that a doubly acylated N-terminal tail (myristate and palmitate) would be expressed in cells. Would this behave identically to the dipalmitoylated species? Unless the N-terminal myristoylation interferes with recognition of the palmitoylation domain by the PAT, this experiment should be easily done. If the Myr/Palm form accumulates to spines, is it activated normally by signaling through Pak</italic>?</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that analyzing LIMK1 mutants modified with myristate plus palmitate is an excellent way to gain more insight into the role of LIMK1 palmitoylation. As suggested, we therefore generated Myr-C7S and Myr-C8S LIMK1 mutants and assessed their localization and activation status in hippocampal neurons. Interestingly, neither mutant recapitulated the spine enrichment of wild type LIMK1, and neither mutant was as efficiently phosphorylated at T508. We have included these additional localization experiments in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref> and have added the phosphorylation data to a modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (renumbered following removal of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, as per the reviewers’ suggestion). We mention in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> that phosphorylation of Myr-C8S-LIMK1 differs significantly from that of Myr-CCSS-LIMK1, suggesting that, at least for this mutant, the myristoylation sequence does not interfere with recognition by the PAT. Taken together, these results suggest that myristate + palmitate modification is not equivalent to dipalmitoylation, and that an intact CC di-palmitoylation motif is essential to target LIMK1 to spines. Based on our accompanying pharmacological data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), the spine enrichment of key ‘upstream’ kinases (activated forms of PAK and CaMKII) likely explains why LIMK1 mutants in other locations are not activated. We have modified the Discussion to include these new findings and to summarize how dipalmitoylation controls LIMK1 localization and signaling in neurons.</p><p><italic>2) The FRAP data presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1"><italic>Figure 1–figure supplement 1</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>should be properly fitted and analyzed.

Overall, the data presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1"><italic>Figure 1–figure supplement 1</italic></xref> <italic>suggest that both wild-type and CCSS-LIMK1 display very slow dynamics in spines, indicating that LIMK1 associates with other proteins that severely limit its diffusion at these sites. Thus, palmitoylation seems to play a more complex role in LIMK1 localization and function that just anchoring this protein to the plasma membrane. Moreover, the results of FRAP analysis presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>should be more precisely discussed by considering the known functions of LIMK1 and ADF/cofilins</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate the need to more fully analyze our FRAP data and now include these additional analyses in updated versions of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> (for LIMK1-GFP) and in both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref> (for GFP-actin; again, please note the adjusted numbering following removal of our original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>For the GFP-actin experiments, we performed two analyses to determine the size of the stable fraction, both of which reinforced our initial conclusion that loss of palmitoyl-LIMK1 increases the fraction of stable actin. We also used two analytical methods to determine the kinetics of recovery of the dynamic fraction, both of which revealed that this is not significantly affected under any condition examined. In addition to updating the Figures as described above, we have modified the Methods section to include details of these additional analyses, which benefitted greatly from the reference kindly provided by Reviewer #1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koskinen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Regarding our LIMK1-GFP FRAP experiments, we agree with the reviewer that both wild type and CCSS-LIMK1-GFP display very slow dynamics in spines. Our new analysis of the stable fraction of LIMK1-GFP in spines (modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>) supports the conclusion that CCSS mutation decreases the fraction of stable LIMK1. We also quantified the recovery times of the mobile pool for each LIMK1-GFP construct. Although the lack of wild type LIMK1-GFP fluorescence recovery makes determining the precise recovery kinetics difficult, (a point explained in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>) both wt- and CCSS-LIMK1-GFP clearly recover markedly more slowly than freely soluble cytosolic proteins. We thus fully agree with the reviewer that these results suggest that LIMK1 associates with other proteins that limit its diffusion. Thus, although the effect of palmitoylation on stabilizing LIMK1 in spines is significant, it may be less critical than its roles in spine targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and in ensuring LIMK1 phosphorylation by spine-specific upstream activators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig8">Figures 7, 8</xref>). We have modified our Discussion to include these points.</p><p>We also attempted to measure the kinetics of recovery of cytosolic GFP alone, but using the parameters for our GFP-actin and LIMK1-GFP FRAP experiments we found that cytosolic GFP fluorescence recovered too rapidly for us to accurately plot recovery curves. In the limited time available for revision we were unfortunately unable to re-optimize conditions for this experiment, but we note that several reports (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Star et al., 2002</xref>, Nat Neurosci; Sharma et al., 2006, Mol. Cell. Neurosci; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>, J. Neurosci) have already demonstrated very rapid FRAP for cytosolic GFP in dendritic spines (time constant &lt;1 sec; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Star et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, another report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bingol et al., 2010</xref>, Cell 140, 567-578) found that FRAP of GFP-tagged Rpt1, a protein of similar size (75 kDa) to LIMK1-GFP (95 kDa) was also extremely rapid. We have modified both our Results and Discussion to include these points and note that they all support the reviewer’s hypothesis that LIMK1 does not behave like a soluble protein and that other factors, most likely protein-protein interactions, markedly limit LIMK1 diffusion in spines.</p><p>Finally, in response to both this comment and to further points raised by Reviewers #1 and #3, we have considered our GFP-actin FRAP results with regard to known roles of LIMK1 and ADF/cofilins. We agree that the increase in immobile actin in the absence of palmitoyl-LIMK1 is surprising, given LIMK1’s known roles. We have therefore modified our Results to highlight this finding and have included three possible explanations in the Discussion, which we summarize here:</p><p>One explanation for our results could arise from the ability of active (dephospho-) cofilin to induce a twist in actin filament conformation that propagates along the filament (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bamburg et al., 1999</xref>, Trends Cell Biol.). Filaments are more likely to sever at boundaries between cofilin-bound (twisted) and unbound (untwisted) regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bobkov et al., 2006</xref>, J. Mol. Biol.). However, an entire cofilin-bound filament, as might occur in the absence of LIMK1, is more stable than a bare filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dedova et al., 2004</xref>, Biophys Chem; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrianantoandro and Pollard, 2006</xref>, Mol. Cell). Thus, if cofilin phosphorylation is reduced in LIMK1 knockdown (and CCSS-LIMK1 ‘rescue’) spines, then these spines may contain a subset of filaments that are decorated with active cofilin but which are actually more stable.</p><p>A second, related possibility is that increased levels of dephospho-cofilin, caused by loss of palmitoyl-LIMK1, may enhance formation of cofilin-actin rods. Rods are stable structures that are only formed by dephospho-cofilin and actin turnover within rods is very slow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernstein et al., 2006</xref>, Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol.), which could account for the increased stable GFP-actin that we observe. However, we note that cofilin-actin rods have been documented in neurites but not, to our knowledge, within spines.</p><p>A third, intriguing explanation, which we favor, arises from a prior report that LTD-like stimulation (low frequency electrical stimulation or bath application of NMDA) markedly increases actin filament stability in spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Star et al., 2002</xref>, Nat Neurosci). Strikingly, as noted in our initial manuscript, the LTP-like stimuli used in our uncaging experiments result in shrinkage of a significant subset of spines (an <underline>LTD</underline>-like effect) in the LIMK1 knockdown and CCSS-LIMK1 rescue conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that ‘learning rules’ are impaired in some LIMK1 knockdown (and CCSS-LIMK1 rescue) spines, so that they respond to LTP-like inputs with LTD-like outputs. Spontaneous bursts of activity in our cultured neurons may therefore be interpreted as LTD-like stimuli by some LIMK1 knockdown spines. In the short term this would be predicted to decrease actin filament turnover, as reported by Star et al., while over longer times this impaired actin turnover may contribute to the spine shrinkage and synapse loss that we observe. We note in our revised Discussion that the three explanations above are not mutually exclusive and could all contribute to the impaired actin filament turnover in the absence of palmitoyl-LIMK1. Moreover, we also mention the possibility that other potential LIMK1 substrates, in addition to cofilin, may contribute to this effect.</p><p><italic>3) Actin dynamics and structural plasticity of dendritic spines have been associated with the maintenance and plasticity of</italic> “<italic>functional</italic>” <italic>strength of excitatory synapses. Demonstrating the importance of LIMK1 palmitoylation in the maintenance of excitatory synaptic transmission and glutamate uncaging-induced functional plasticity would thus significantly strengthen the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate and share the reviewers’ interest in palmitoyl-LIMK1’s role in the regulation of synaptic transmission and functional plasticity. We therefore performed new experiments to address whether the activity-dependent structural plasticity, which is palmitoyl-LIMK1-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), is accompanied by changes in functional plasticity. In a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref> we now include important proof-of-principle experiments that confirm that our 2-photon uncaging stimulation reliably increases not only spine volume but also AMPA uncaging-evoked postsynaptic currents (uEPSCs), and that both changes are specific to the stimulated spine. Importantly, previous studies reported very similar molecular requirements for uncaging-induced structural and functional plasticity, and in particular identified key roles for both actin polymerization and Cdc42 signaling in both processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</xref>, Nature; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Murakoshi et al., 2011</xref>, Nature). Our new experiment therefore supports the hypothesis that LIMK1 palmitoylation may also be required for activity-dependent functional plasticity, and may be a key link between the Cdc42 signaling and actin polymerization described by others. We have modified our Discussion to include these important points. Finally, we note that in several studies that focused on mechanisms of spine cytoskeletal regulation using 2-photon uncaging (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bosch et al., 2014</xref>, Neuron; Steiner et al., 2008, Neuron; Tanaka et al., 2008, Science), functional plasticity experiments were limited to confirming that the same uncaging protocol induces both structural and functional plasticity, as we now demonstrate.</p><p><italic>Other comments</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) The</italic> “<italic>shell-to-core</italic>” <italic>cofilin activity gradient hypothesis is not sufficiently well supported by the data in the present study. Therefore, the manuscript text and Figure 10 should be accordingly modified</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate this concern of the reviewers and have therefore modified the text of the Discussion accordingly. We also discuss other factors that may influence spatial control of filament polymerization/ depolymerization by palmitoyl-LIMK1, including other proteins that bind and/or affect activity of cofilin and/or additional LIMK1 substrates. Our discussion of these issues benefits greatly from (but is not limited to) the references kindly provided by Reviewer #3, and we expand on these points in our reply to this reviewer below. In addition, we have modified Figure 10 to remove the gradient of cofilin activity, though we retained the schematic showing membrane-specific activation of palmitoyl-LIMK1.</p><p><italic>2) To provide the readers more balanced view on the mechanisms regulating cofilin activity in cells, it would be important to discuss the possible roles of phosphatases and other interacting proteins in regulating cofilin activity and actin dynamics in dendritic spines</italic>.</p><p>As described in the reply to Point #1 above, we agree with the need to discuss other regulators of cofilin activity and interactions and have modified the Discussion to include these points.</p><p><italic>3) The palmitoyl acyltransferase data (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>) are not particularly convincing, and should be either significantly strengthened or omitted from the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>To address this comment and to gain more insight into how LIMK1 palmitoylation is controlled, we performed a preliminary screen of all 23 mouse PATs (see also reply to Reviewer #2 below). We identified both Golgi-localized PATs and synaptodendritic PATs that can palmitoylate LIMK1, a finding that is broadly consistent with our original hypothesis that LIMK1 palmitoylation occurs in both of these locations. However, we prefer not to include these data as we realize that significantly more work will be required to properly define how LIMK1 palmitoylation is controlled in neurons. We have therefore followed the reviewers’ suggestion to remove <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and will address this question fully in future studies.</p><p><italic>4) The authors should discuss what lies upstream of LIMK1 palmitoylation in neurons</italic>.</p><p>We agree that this point is worthy of further discussion and have modified the Discussion text to address it. We both summarize our PAT screening findings (in reply to Point #3 above) and also discuss possible regulation of LIMK1 palmitoylation by neuronal activity or other factors. We mention additional preliminary findings that Bicuculline and KCl treatments do not increase LIMK1 palmitoylation, suggesting that LIMK1 is palmitoylation is likely constitutive. However, we also stress potential caveats regarding this conclusion, in particular the possibility that other stimuli could alter LIMK1 palmitoylation e.g. ephrins (which rapidly affect spine morphology via PAK) and/or that technical limitations of the ABE assay (which detects the entire cellular complement of palmitoyl-LIMK1, irrespective of location) could mask selective changes in LIMK1 palmitoylation at spines.</p><p><italic>Below, please also find the specific comments by the three reviewers. These will provide you additional information about how to deal with the points listed above</italic>.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>1) The results of FRAP experiments presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>are somewhat confusing, and the authors should perform better analysis of the FRAP data. From the data presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5D</italic></xref><italic>, it seems that that the actual rates of fluorescence recovery are quite similar in all cases (although this should be carefully examined by fitting the data). However, LIMK1 knockdown and CCSS-LIMK1 rescue cells exhibit a significantly larger immobile fraction of actin compared to control cells. Thus, while majority of actin filaments in control cells undergo relatively rapid turnover, approximately 30 % of actin filaments in LIMK1 (and CCSS-LIMK1 rescue spines) appear to be very stable. How does inactivation of LIMK1, which is a negative regulator of ADF/cofilin-mediated rapid actin filament disassembly, result in appearance of a stable actin filament pool in spines (because increased ADF/cofilin activity would be expected to increase (not decrease) actin filament turnover in spines)? This surprising result should be discussed in the 'Results' and 'Discussion' sections in more detail. Furthermore, the FRAP data should be properly fitted and analyzed as described e.g. in Koskinen et al., (Mol. Cell. Neurosci., 2014) to obtain information about the dynamics of the mobile actin fraction</italic>.</p><p>As described in our reply to the Major Comments, we appreciate the reviewer’s concern and have analyzed our GFP-actin FRAP data accordingly. The additional analyses confirm the reviewer’s assessment that, in both LIMK1 ‘knockdown’ and CCSS-LIMK1 ‘rescue’ neurons, there is an increased percentage of stable GFP-actin, but no significant effect on the kinetics of the remaining mobile GFP-actin. We have added these data in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref> (renumbered following removal of our original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, as per reviewers’ suggestions) and include details of these analyses in the Methods.</p><p>We agree with the Reviewer that the increase in immobile actin is surprising, given the known roles of LIMK1.

Strikingly, as noted in our initial manuscript, the LT<underline>P</underline>-like stimulus used in our uncaging experiments usually triggers spine enlargement, but in a subset of LIMK1 knockdown and CCSS-LIMK1 rescue spines, instead triggers spine shrinkage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that some LIMK1 knockdown (and CCSS-LIMK1 rescue) spines respond to LTP-like inputs with LTD-like outputs i.e. that their learning rules are impaired. Spontaneous bursts of activity in our cultured neurons may therefore be interpreted as an LTD-like stimulus by some LIMK1 knockdown spines. In the short term this may result in decreased actin filament turnover, as reported by Star et al., while over longer times this impaired actin turnover may contribute to the spine shrinkage and synapse loss seen in the absence of palmitoyl-LIMK1. We note that the three explanations above are not mutually exclusive and could all contribute to the impaired actin filament turnover in the absence of palmitoyl-LIMK1.</p><p><italic>2) Similarly, the FRAP experiments shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1"><italic>Figure 1–figure supplement 1</italic></xref> <italic>provided somewhat surprising results, and should be analyzed and discussed more carefully. Based on these experiments, it seems that both wild-type LIMK1 and CCSS-LIMK1 display very slow dynamics in spines. This indicates that LIMK1 associates in spines with other proteins that severely limit its mobility. To understand the dynamics of wild-type LIMK1 and CCSS-LIMK1 in spines, the authors should perform similar data fitting as requested for GFP-actin above as well as perform FRAP analysis on GFP alone as a control (i.e. to measure the dynamics of a truly soluble protein in spines). Overall, these data seem to suggest that palmitoylation is not required to immobilize LIMK1 in spines, but rather plays a more complex role in localizing this protein to dendritic spines and regulating its activity at these sites</italic>.</p><p>This is another insightful point by the Reviewer, which we have also addressed in our reply to the Major Comments. To summarize briefly, we have expanded <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> to include quantitative measurements of the size of the stable fractions and the dynamics of the mobile fractions, for both wt- and CCSS-LIMK1-GFP. We agree with the reviewer that the slow dynamics of CCSS-LIMK1 recovery suggest that LIMK1 associates with other proteins that limit its diffusion and have modified our Discussion to include this point. In particular, based on the markedly different targeting and phosphorylation of wild type LIMK1, compared to myr-SC and myr-CS LIMK1, we emphasize that palmitoylation is critical for targeting LIMK1 to spines and does not act as a simple membrane anchoring signal.</p><p>As mentioned in our reply to the Major Comments, we found that soluble GFP fluorescence recovers too rapidly for us to plot recovery curves under the conditions used for our GFP-actin and LIMK1-GFP experiments. However, we note that several published studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Star et al., 2002</xref>, Nat Neurosci; Sharma et al., 2006, Mol. Cell. Neurosci; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>, J. Neurosci) have already documented this extremely fast fluorescence recovery for soluble GFP in dendritic spines. We have included this point in our Results section and noted that it supports the reviewer’s conclusion that other factors, most likely protein-protein interactions, markedly limit LIMK1 diffusion in spines.</p><p><italic>3) The data presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref> <italic>are not particularly convincing and could perhaps be deleted from the manuscript. Is it possible that the differences in LIMK1 and NPY co-localization as well as in LIMK1 targeting to spines after brefeldin A treatment in proximal vs. distal regions could result from differences in the rate of depalmitoylation at these regions (instead of different palmitoyl acyltransferases interacting with LINK1 at different regions of dendrites)</italic>?</p><p>We agree with the Reviewer that our conclusions based on the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> were somewhat premature. The possibility that differential thioesterase (as opposed to PAT) activity could explain these results is an insightful observation that we had not considered. As a result we have decided to follow the Reviewer’s suggestion to remove <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and will seek to better define the mechanisms that control LIMK1 palmitoylation in future work.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>This manuscript by George et al reports the role of LIMK1 palmitoylation in the 1) This study mainly monitors actin polymerization and activity-dependent changes in spine volume as functional measures of the proposed mechanisms.

Is the T508 phosphorylation of LIMK1 required for its palmitoylation? These aspects are all unclear and should be explored to some extent or, less ideally, discussed. Some questions marks can be added to the summary diagram in Figure 10</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate the importance of all of these questions. We previously assessed neuronal LIMK1 palmitoylation levels by ABE assay, but observed no changes following treatment with either Bicuculline or KCl. These results, while preliminary, suggest that LIMK1 palmitoylation is largely constitutive and that other aspects of LIMK1 regulation e.g. its phosphorylation by PAK, which is likely CaMKII-dependent, are more likely to be the key activity-regulated steps in neurons. However, as we detect the entire cellular complement of palmitoyl-LIMK1 in ABE assays, irrespective of subcellular location, it is still possible that synaptic activity or other stimuli alter palmitoylation of a specific subcellular pool of LIMK1. We have added these points to the Discussion.</p><p>We also comprehensively assessed, as described in our response to the overall Other Comments, the PATs that can palmitoylate LIMK1 in cotransfected HEK293T cells, but found that several PATs can increase LIMK1 palmitoylation. More work will therefore be required to determine how LIMK1 palmitoylation is controlled in neurons. Again, we have briefly noted these preliminary findings in the Discussion, and are excited to fully address this issue in future studies.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>Critique: The sound experiments presented and the high quality results shown in the figures require very little comment. However there are some results that are missing which would be welcome additions to what is presented</italic>.</p><p><italic>A question remains as to the role of the dipalmitoylation— is it simply membrane anchoring or does the membrane insertion of this region alter the interactions with other binding partners of the LIMK1 N-terminus? I am surprised that the authors did not use the N-myr mutant protein with a single cysteine in the palmitoylation region (CS or SC) such that a doubly acylated N-terminal tail (myristate and palmitate) resulted. Would this behave identically to the dipalmitoylated species? Unless the N-terminal myristoylation interfered with recognition of the palmitoylation domain by the PAT, this experiment should be easily done. If the Myr/Palm form is bound to membrane in spines, is it activated normally by signaling through Pak</italic>?</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s interest in the role of the dipalmitoylation of LIMK1 and agree that examining the targeting and regulation of a “myristoyl + palmitoyl” LIMK1 is an excellent way to gain more insight into this issue. We therefore generated both Myr-SC- and Myr-CS-LIMK1 mutants and examined their localization and activation status in neurons. Interestingly, neither mutant recapitulates the spine enrichment or activation status of wild type LIMK1. We have included the additional localization data in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>, modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> to include the additional phosphorylation data, and have added an additional statement regarding the unique role of dipalmitoylation to the Discussion. We also include a brief statement that the phosphorylation of Myr-CS-LIMK1 differs from either SC-LIMK1, CS-LIMK1 or myr-CCSS-LIMK1. This result suggests that, at least for Myr-CS-LIMK1, the addition of the myristolyation tag does not interfere with recognition of the remaining palmitoyl-site, but that myristate+palmitate is not equivalent to di-palmitoylation.</p><p><italic>The evidence for the Golgi-dependence for proximal spine delivery of the palmitoylated LIMK1 is very strong, but the evidence for distal spine delivery requiring localized PAT activity is speculative. Although this mechanism is certainly possible, it may not be the only possibility for distal delivery. Until somatodendritic PATs can be down regulated differentially from those at the Golgi, it may remain a speculation</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that our current evidence is insufficient to conclude that localized PAT activity controls distal spine delivery of palmitoyl-LIMK1. This point was also raised by Reviewer #1, who suggested that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> could therefore be removed. We have decided to follow this suggestion and to fully address the control of LIMK1 palmitoylation in future studies.</p><p><italic>In spite of the very high quality work shown in the studies presented here, there are still many unanswered questions regarding the model put forward to explain the centripetal retrograde flow of actin subunits that are adding onto actin filaments at the spine periphery and disassembling in the center. In this regard it is incorrect to talk about cofilin as</italic> “<italic>severing filament pointed ends</italic>” <italic>(in the subsection headed “Polarized “shell-to-core” actin regulation in spines by palmitoyl-LIMK1”) and referencing the 2003 Pollard and Borisy review. Severing can occur anywhere in the filament where ADP-actin subunits predominate (which is generally more toward the pointed end of dynamic filaments). However, the type of turnover of these branched networks that is occurring is more correctly termed array treadmilling and there are many more current reviews, one of which should be cited for this. Given that the authors favor a cofilin gradient model, it is surprising that the Discussion fails to include a reference to work published from the Zheng lab in Nature Neuroscience (Gu J, et al., Nat Neurosci 13, 1208-1215, 2010) in which cofilin inhibition by LIMK1 was required for LTP-induced spine enlargement, a role proposed here for the LIMK1 in spines</italic>.</p><p><italic>The speculative model that focuses on the possibility of a cofilin activity gradient also requires some comment. There are many additional factors that need to be considered. First, for cofilin to be regulated in such a manner its concentration would have to be quite low in spines and one would expect the phosphatases, which regulate its activation, would also need to be localized to the central domain because their activity seems to dominate the phosphorylation state of cofilin (see Gu paper referenced above and others). There is evidence that slingshot-1L, a major cofilin phosphatase is only active when bound to F-actin, a fact that could help support the gradient model (Nagata-Ohashi K, et al. J Cell Biol. 165: 465-471, 2004: Soosairajah J, et al., EMBO J 24, 473-486, 2005). However, other studies suggest that the actin filament severing activity of cofilin is modulated (enhanced) in vivo by Aip1 (see recent Chen et al., J Biol Chem, 290: 2289-2300, 2015 and references theirin) and that cofilin's recruitment to F-actin is also modulated by coronin 1A (Kueh HY et al., J Cell Biol. 182:341-353, 2008). These proteins likely impact the actin dynamics and retrograde flow. Finally, many (perhaps all?) spines may undergo transient penetration by microtubules (Merriam EB, et al., J Neurosci 33: 16471-82, 2013)), whose assembly may also be modulated in a LIMK1-dependent manner by p25/TPPP, a protein that affects HDAC activity and acetylation of MTs (Acevedo K, et al., Exp Cell Res, 313, 4091-4106, 2007; Schofield AV, et al., J Biol Chem 288: 7907-17, 2013). I am not trying to argue for any one of these models, but simply believe that in this paper the authors have not convinced me that a gradient of cofilin activity exists nor that cofilin is the only target involved in regulating the actin dynamics. Maybe tone this model down a bit and remove the figure since such a figure is often what the reader will take away, even if totally speculative</italic>.</p><p>These are all excellent points and we thank the reviewer for this very informative summary of possible alternative explanations and hypotheses. We have markedly modified our Discussion of sub-spine regulation by LIMK1 to reference the supportive studies mentioned by the reviewer, but also to include the alternative/additional explanations that s/he describes. We have taken care to note that our thoughts on intra-spine actin regulation by palmitoyl-LIMK1 are speculative and have modified Figure 10 to remove the cofilin gradient model as suggested.</p></body></sub-article></article>
