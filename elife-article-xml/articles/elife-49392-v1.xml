evaluate on-target off-tumor adverse effect, hindering the development of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies for solid tumors, due to limited human/mouse cross-reactivity of antibodies used in CAR and sever graft-versus-host disease induced by administered human T cells. We have evaluated safety and antitumor efficacy of CAR-T cells targeting glypican-1 (GPC1) overexpressed in various solid tumors. GPC1-specific human and murine CAR-T cells generated from our original anti-human/mouse GPC1 antibody showed strong antitumor effects in xenogeneic and syngeneic mouse models, respectively. Importantly, the murine CAR-T cells enhanced endogenous T cell responses against a non-GPC1 tumor antigen through the mechanism of antigen-spreading and showed synergistic antitumor effects with anti-PD-1 antibody without any adverse effects in syngeneic models. Our study shows the potential of GPC1 as a CAR-T cell target for solid tumors and the importance of syngeneic and xenogeneic models for evaluating their safety and efficacy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adverse effects</kwd><kwd>anti-PD-1 Ab</kwd><kwd>combination immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>CAR-T cells</kwd><kwd>solid tumor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grants-in-aid for Scientific Research 262221005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kawakami</surname><given-names>Yutaka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project for Development of Innovative Research on Cancer Therapeutic 14069014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yaguchi</surname><given-names>Tomonori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project for Cancer Research And Therapeutic Evolution</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kawakami</surname><given-names>Yutaka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Tokyo Biomedical Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kawakami</surname><given-names>Yutaka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001697</institution-id><institution>Keio University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Keio Gijuku Academic Development founds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yaguchi</surname><given-names>Tomonori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The safety and strong antitumor effects of GPC1-specific CAR-T cells against GPC1-expressing solid tumors were demonstrated by using both syngeneic and xenogeneic mouse models.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Immunotherapies with a chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells have been demonstrated robust clinical responses in hematological malignancies. However, developments of CAR-T cell therapies for solid tumors have met several obstacles including on-target off-tumor lethal toxicities, insufficient activation of administered CAR-T cells in tumor tissues, and loss of target antigens in tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">June et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kato et al., 2017</xref>). For example, even weak expression of target antigen on normal tissues caused lethal toxicities in the first-in-human clinical trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morgan et al., 2010</xref>). To develop CAR-T cell therapies for solid tumors, it is important to identify suitable target antigens and to evaluate their safety as well as their antitumor efficacy in the preclinical models.</p><p>Majority of preclinical studies for CAR-T cell therapies have been performed in vivo using xenogeneic mouse models wherein response of human T cells against human xenografted tumors are tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shiina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carpenito et al., 2009</xref>). This strategy is often the only available option for development of CAR-T cells therapies targeting human tumors, due to the lack of cross-reactivity of CAR against the homologous mouse antigen. However, because of the restricted CAR cross-reactivity, the effects of human CAR-T cells against normal tissues cannot be fully studied in xenogeneic models. Indeed, preclinical studies of CAR-T cell therapies in xenogeneic mouse model could not predict the lethal toxicities that occurred in the first-in-human clinical trial of HER2-specific CAR-T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morgan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhao et al., 2009</xref>). On the other hand, if the human CAR-T cells can recognize mouse homogenous antigens, syngeneic mouse models can be used to evaluate the on-target off-tumor toxicities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Siegler and Wang, 2018</xref>). Moreover, such syngeneic models enable analyses of the effects of CAR-T cell therapy on endogenous antitumor immune responses and efficacy of combined therapies that are limited in xenogeneic mouse models due to their incompetent host immunity and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) by the xenografted T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yaguchi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Glypican-1 (GPC1) is a cell-surface heparansulphate proteoglycan expressed in normal fetal tissues and tumor cells. A major function of GPC1 is its involvement in the development of brain in fetal phase. While knockout of GPC1 exhibits no abnormalities in morphology, behavior, or life span in adult mice, reduction in brain volume has been reported in early fetal phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jen et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, GPC1 seems to have no critical function in healthy adult stage. Recently, we and other groups have reported the overexpression of GPC1 in various human cancers including glioma, mesothelioma, several squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) such as esophageal and cervical cancers, and several adenocarcinomas such as breast and pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hara et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matsuzaki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matsuda et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Melo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Duan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Su et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amatya et al., 2018</xref>). GPC1 expression in cancer is linked with malignant phenotypes such as promotion of cell-cycle and enhanced metastatic potential, and is considered as a prognostic factor in some cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kleeff et al., 1998</xref>). In order to develop a cancer therapy targeting GPC1, we have previously generated anti-GPC1 cytotoxic monoclonal antibodies (mAb) (clone: 1â12). This anti-GPC1 mAb recognized both human and mouse GPC1, and inhibited the growth of GPC1-expressing human esophageal SCC xenografted in immunodeficient mice without any obvious adverse effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harada et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we generated GPC1-specific CAR-T cells from the variable regions of the anti-GPC1 mAb (clone: 1â12) that recognize both human and mouse GPC1, and evaluated their efficacy and safety, using not only tumor xenografts in immunodeficient mouse models but also immunocompetent syngeneic mouse models.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Low protein expression of hGPC1 was detected by anti-GPC1 mAb (clone: 1â12) in normal human adult tissues</title><p>We and others have reported that human GPC1 (hGPC1) was preferentially expressed in various tumors and fetal brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hara et al., 2016</xref>).

In the MCA205-mGPC1 mice that resulted in complete eradication of the tumors, we found that the mCAR-T cells were present in the peripheral blood for over 60 days (data not shown).

For this, CD8<sup>+</sup> TIL were harvested from the tumor of MC38-mGPC1-bearing mice and re-stimulated in vitro with gp70, an epitope peptide of MC38 for induction of gp70-specific T cell response. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>, gp70-specific IFNÎ³ production was significantly enhanced by the administration of mCAR-T cells. Moreover, to evaluate the presence and importance of endogenous T cell responses in vivo, mGPC1-negative parental MCA205 tumor cells were re-challenged into the mice which had complete tumor eradication by mCAR-T cell therapy in the MCA205-mGPC1 model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

The results from the syngeneic mouse models suggested that mCAR-T cells could eliminate established solid tumors and display persistent antitumor activity without obvious adverse effects.

The hCAR-T cells specifically recognized and controlled tumor growth in xenograft mouse models, and the mCAR-T cells completely eradicated established solid tumor in vivo without any histological or symptomatic adverse effects in syngeneic mouse models. In addition, immune response against non-GPC1 endogenous tumor antigen was enhanced in syngeneic mouse models, suggesting the role of antigen spread induced by the CAR-T cell therapy in promoting further antitumor activity. Moreover, we were able to demonstrate synergistic antitumor effects by combining the CAR-T cell therapy with anti-PD-1 Ab therapy. Immunogenicity of the chicken-based CAR-T cells may cause rejection of the CAR-T cells and poor responses in patients. However, non-humanized CD19-specific CAR-T cells have demonstrated significant antitumor effects for a variety of B cell malignancy possibly due to their relatively immunosuppressed condition via malignancy and chemotherapy/preconditioning. And the chicken-based GPC1-specific CAR-T cells showed strong antitumor effects in this study. Therefore, this form of CAR-T cells could be used for clinical trials, although we are also considering further humanization for clinical trials. Our preclinical study suggests that GPC1-specific CAR-T cells using the scFV of anti-GPC1 mAb (clone: 1â12) may provide not only safe but also highly effective treatment for patients with solid tumor.</p><p>Others and we have reported high expression of GPC1 in various solid tumors. On the other hand, we detected low expression of hGPC1 mRNA in all tested normal tissues and we also previously reported that some normal tissues showed slight staining by the commercial polyclonal anti-GPC1 Ab in IHC. In this study, we evaluated hGPC1 protein expressions by IHC using our anti-GPC1 mAb (clone: 1â12) and found that GPC1 expression was under the detection sensitivity in human normal tissues, whereas human esophageal SCC tissues showed strong and broad expression. The difference in IHC results of commercial polyclonal Ab and our anti-GPC1 mAb might be related to the difference of epitopes recognized by the antibodies. Although it is still uncertain whether GPC1 protein expression is completely negative in normal tissues of human, our anti-GPC1 mAb (clone: 1â12) specifically recognizes GPC1 protein expressed on tumor cells and is suitable for the generation of CAR-T cells.</p><p>A major mechanism of on-target off-tumor adverse effects is thought to be the recognition of target antigens expressed in normal cells by CAR-T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lamers et al., 2006</xref>). However, some CAR-T cell therapies in clinical trials are targeting antigens that are expressed in both tumor and normal tissues (e.g. mesothelin, GD2, and IL13RÎ±2) and are demonstrating favorable responses without obvious adverse effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beatty et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rossig et al., 2002</xref>). For example, although mesothelin is broadly expressed on mesothelial cells at protein levels, patients treated with mesothelin-specific CAR-T cells show objective antitumor responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beatty et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morello et al., 2016</xref>). These results suggest the presence of unknown mechanisms of CAR-T cells in recognizing antigens in a tumor-specific manner. In our study, tumor-specific killing by our CAR-T cells may be explained by a tumor-specific recognition by the anti-GPC1 mAb (clone: 1â12). Another possibility may be that, even if GPC1 is expressed on some normal tissues and can be recognized by anti-GPC1 mAb (clone: 1â12), its expression might be too low to activate GPC1-specific CAR-T cells. Indeed, our GPC1-specific human or murine CAR-T cells did not respond to LK2-mock or MC38-mock tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C and D</xref>), although LK2-mock weakly expressed <italic>hGPC1</italic> mRNA (<italic>hGPC1/GAPDH</italic>; 0.00059) at similar level to the normal cervix tissues (<italic>hGPC1/GAPDH</italic>; mean 0.00209Â Â±Â 0.00185, range 0.00065â0.00473) and MC38-mock expressed weak <italic>mGpc1</italic> mRNA (<italic>mGpc1/Gapdh</italic>; 0.00532) at similar level to the evaluated various normal tissues (<italic>mGpc1/Gapdh</italic>; mean 0.02284Â Â±Â 0.01684, range 0.00341â0.06406) without detectable GPC1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). In addition, some reports demonstrated that CAR-T cells have thresholds of antigen density required to induce responses against target antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">James et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">James et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). Other possible explanation is the existence of anatomical barriers or deficiency of chemokines for the attraction of T cells into normal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beatty et al., 2014</xref>). Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms behind the lack of adverse effects in our models.</p><p>With exception of few studies using syngeneic immune-competent mouse, most previous preclinical studies have mainly used in vitro assays or xenogeneic immune-deficient mouse models for the evaluation of CAR-T cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carpenito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shiina et al., 2016</xref>). Rosenberg et al. reported the use of syngeneic mouse models for the evaluation of CAR-T cells targeting VEGFR2 and FAP expressed in the stromal cells in tumor microenvironment rather than the tumor cells themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chinnasamy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tran et al., 2013</xref>). Although VEGFR2-specific CAR-T cells exhibited effective antitumor activity without any adverse effects, FAP-specific CAR-T cells resulted in lethal bone toxicities. These findings suggested the benefits of utilizing syngeneic mouse models for assessing the possible adverse effects of CAR-T cells. In this study, we first evaluated the efficacy and safety of CAR-T cells therapy targeting the tumor-expressing antigen using syngeneic mouse models. We generated GPC1-specific CAR-T cells using the scFv derived from anti-GPC1 mAb, which cross-reacted with both human and mouse GPC1. With the use of syngeneic mouse model, we demonstrated in vivo that our GPC1-specific CAR-T cells exhibited antitumor activity without any obvious adverse effects. These results suggest that our GPC1-specific CAR-T cells may become an effective treatment for patients with GPC1-positive tumor.</p><p>Syngeneic mouse model also allows us to evaluate the interaction of CAR-T cells and endogenous host immunity. We demonstrated that CAR-T cells enhanced the CTL induction and generated immunological memory against non-GPC1 endogenous tumor antigens. These findings might explain stronger antitumor effects of mCAR-T cells in the immunocompetent syngeneic mouse models compared to the delayed antitumor effects of hCAR-T cells in the immunodeficient xenogeneic mouse model. We speculated that lysis of tumor cells and secretion of multiple cytokines by CAR-T cells created an optimal environment for the activation of dendritic cells and CTL. Such kinds of phenomena were actually reported in some clinical trials. For example, induction of antitumor antibodies against novel antigens was reported in clinical trials of mesothelin-specific CAR-T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beatty et al., 2014</xref>). Development of adaptive immunity against a broad spectrum of tumor-specific antigens by antigen spread is an important secondary mechanism underlying the potency of immunotherapy, which could overcome immune escape of the CAR-T cell therapy targeting single antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Galon and Bruni, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kato et al., 2017</xref>). In order to promote antitumor effects of antigen spread, it would be important to optimize pre- and post-conditioning protocols for CAR-T cell therapy by, for instance, lymphodepeletion and cytokine administration. Syngeneic mouse models for CAR-T cell therapies would provide important insights into the interaction of CAR-T cells and endogenous immunity.</p><p>Through the syngeneic mouse models, we can also evaluate the efficacy of combination immunotherapy in physiological condition, which cannot be evaluated precisely in xenogeneic immunodeficient mouse models because of their immunodeficiency and altered CAR-T cell phenotypes, which are activated by xenogeneic stimuli. For example, delayed antitumor effects observed in the NOG mouse model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) compared to syngeneic mouse models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4E, F and G</xref>) might be explained by xenogeneic GVHD reaction that might promote late activation and expansion of hCAR-T cells. In the syngeneic mouse models, strong PD-1 expression on the administered CAR-T cells and endogenous TIL, which suggested occurrence of T cell activation and exhaustion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iwai et al., 2017</xref>), prompted us to evaluate synergistic effects of CAR-T cells and anti-PD-1 Ab therapies in our syngeneic mouse model. We found that the combination therapy led to synergistic antitumor effects without any obvious adverse effects. This synergistic effect may be explained by enhanced effector function of administered CAR-T cells and endogenous antitumor CTL by anti-PD-1 Ab. In addition, as PD-1 is reported to be involved in the suppression of CD28/B7 signal, it might be also possible that the anti-PD-1 Ab recovered the suppressed CD28 signal from dendritic cells during the T cell priming phase and consequently led to enhanced CTL induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hui et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kamphorst et al., 2017</xref>). The expression of PD-1 on CAR-T cells pre- and post-infusion was reported in human clinical trials and high frequency of PD-1 expression was associated with treatment failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fraietta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">O'Rourke et al., 2017</xref>). In the clinical trials of EGFRvIII-specific CAR-T cells for glioma patients, upregulation of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells after infusion of CAR-T cells was observed in non-responder patients. These reports suggest that PD-1 is a potential target to improve the efficacy of CAR-T cell therapies and syngeneic mouse models are effective tools to evaluate the effectiveness of combination therapy with CAR-T cells.</p><p>Collectively, we have generated CAR-T cells targeting GPC1 of both human and mouse, and shown their efficacy in xenograft mouse models. By establishing the syngeneic mouse models, we were able to evaluate not only the efficacy but also the safety of GPC1-specific CAR-T cells and their enhanced antitumor activity in combination with anti-PD-1 Ab. Taken together, we have demonstrated the strong antitumor effects and safety of GPC1-specific CAR-T cells against GPC1-expressing solid tumors using both syngeneic and xenogeneic mouse models.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">NOG (NOD/Shi-<italic>Prkdc<sup>scid</sup>Il2rÎ³<sup>tm1Sug</sup></italic>/Jic) mouse</td><td valign="top">Central Institute for Experimental Animals</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Female and Male, 6â10 week-old</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6 mouse</td><td valign="top">CLEA Japan, Inc</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Female, 6â8 week-old</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">G3Thi</td><td valign="top">Takara Bio Inc</td><td valign="top">TKR-6163</td><td valign="top">Human kidney cell line derived packaging cell line</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">TE14</td><td valign="top">RIKEN BioResource Center</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Human esophageal squamous cancer cell lines</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">LK2-hGPC1</td><td valign="top">Previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harada et al., 2017</xref>), see Materials and methods</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Human lung squamous cancer cell lines expressing hGPC1</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">LK2-mock</td><td valign="top">Previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harada et al., 2017</xref>), see Materials and methods</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Human lung squamous cancer cell lines expressing empty vector</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">PG13</td><td valign="top">Takara Bio Inc</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Murine leukemia cell line</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">EL4</td><td valign="top">National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health (MD, USA)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Mouse T cell lymphoma cell line</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MCA205</td><td valign="top">National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health (MD, USA)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Mouse sarcoma cell line</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MCA205-mGPC1</td><td valign="top">This paper, see Materials and methods</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Mouse sarcoma cell line expressing mGPC1</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MC38-mGPC1</td><td valign="top">This paper, see Materials and methods</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Mouse colon adenocarcinoma cell line expressing mGPC1</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (Gallus gallus domesticus<italic>, Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">hCAR-LH</td><td valign="top">This paper, see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (Gallus gallus domesticus<italic>, Homo-sapiens s</italic>)</td><td valign="top">hCAR-HL</td><td valign="top">This paper, see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (Gallus gallus <break/>domesticus<italic>, M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">mCAR</td><td valign="top">This paper, see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">OKT-3 (anti-human CD3 mAb)</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fischer Scientific</td><td valign="top">Cat #

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a guest Reviewing Editor and Jeffrey Settleman as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Although the CAR-T cell treatment has been very effective for leukemia, it has been difficult for the treatment of solid tumors. The authors report that CAR-T cell using anti-GPC1 monoclonal antibody, which reacts with both human and the mouse GPC1, can serve a good reagent for the solid tumor treatment. They showed significant anti-tumor effects in the xenogeneic and syngeneic mouse models. They have also shown this CAR-T cells have minimal side effects. However, this study contains significant shortcoming and the experimental problems to convincingly prove that CAR-T cell is effective for solid tumors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. The revisions proposed by the reviewers (below) should all be considered essential to support further consideration of the revised manuscript. We realize that the requested revisions will take several months to carry out and suggest that you take the time needed to revise the paper appropriately.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors report that GPC1, which is expressed at high levels in several types of cancers but at low levels in normal tissues, is a good target for CAR T cell therapy. They established CAR T cells derived from the anti-GPC1 mAb (1-12), which reacts with both human and mouse GPC1. The GPC1-specific human and murine CAR-T cells showed significant anti-tumor effect in xenogeneic and syngeneic mouse model, respectively, without any side effect. This manuscript presents a novel candidate target for CAR T cells against solid tumors. In addition, they succeeded in showing the safety of the CAR T cells by establishing CAR T cells that react with both human and murine GPC1. Thus, I recommend Accept with Major Revisions.</p><p>1) In Figure 1A and Figure 3A, GPC1 expression levels in cancer cells should be also shown. It will be helpful for readers to understand the difference of GPC1 expression levels between normal cells and cancers.</p><p>2) GPC1 mRNA is also expressed in normal tissues, although at lower levels than tumor cells, according to the results (Figure 1A or Figure 3A). As discussed in the manuscript (Discussion, third paragraph), the GPC1 antigen densities in normal tissues may be under the threshold level for the CAR recognition. This hypothesis should be tested by experiments, and discuss why normal cells are not damaged by the CAR T cells.</p><p>3) In xenograft model (Figure 2E), the in vivo effect of the CAR T cells was statistically significant, but not strong. In addition, the difference in tumor sizes between the CAR group and the control group became significant at relatively late time points. In contrast, in the syngeneic model using murine CAR T cells, especially in the MCA-mGPC1-transplanted mice (Figure 4F), the effect of CAR T cells was striking. This discrepancy suggests that endogenous T cells (or other immune cells) have substantial roles in the elimination of tumor cells in the syngeneic model. The authors may be able to examine it by using mice lacking T cells such as Rag2-KO for syngeneic models. At least, the authors are recommended to discuss more about this point.</p><p>4) Expression level of GPC1 in LK2-hGPC1 shown in Figure 2B and that in Figure 4B looks different. This information is important to know how high GPC1 expression in the mouse tumor cells in which GPC1 is enforcedly expressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this study, the authors demonstrated that GPC1 could be a potential target of CAR-T cell therapy in some types of solid tumors. It was also shown that the anti-tumor efficacy of the anti-GPC1 CAR-T cells was augmented by the combination with anti-PD-1 antibody. Based on cross-reactivity of the anti-GPC1 Ab, they also proposed the safety of anti-GPC1 CAR-T cell therapy. While CAR-T cell therapy against solid tumors are of highly interest as the next generation of cancer immunotherapy, this study contains significant defects in the experimental data and conclusion led by the authors. Inclusion of additional data and discussions according to below comments are necessary.</p><p>1) The authors concluded the safety of anti-GPC1 CAR-T cell therapy based on the cross-reactivity of Ab to mouse GPC1 and the similarity of GPC1 expression patterns between mouse and human normal tissues. However, this conclusion is hardly acceptable due to following reasons: 1) Even though their anti-GPC1 Ab cross-reacts with mouse GPC1, detail characteristics of the protein interaction are not necessarily identical. For example, affinity, avidity, Kd, and Ka of the Ab to human GPC1 and mouse GPC1 might not be the same. Moreover, the CAR construct utilized scFv instead of full form of Ab. Thus, detail characteristics as above must be assessed by using scFv. 2) As anti-GPC1 Ab used in this study was generated in chicken, immunogenicity of anti-GPC1 scFv will not be identical in human and mouse. Due to these reasons, observations in this study are not enough to conclude the safety of anti-GPC1 CAR-T cell therapy in human.</p><p>2) As for anti-tumor effects of anti-GPC1 CAR-T cells, experimental models are not appropriate to evaluate its potency. In syngeneic mouse models, CAR-T cells were injected 3 days after tumor inoculation. Day 3 tumor size is too small to consider as pre-established tumor models. Experiments to treat late-stage tumors with larger size are necessary. In addition, 50,000 IU IL-2 was injected up to 6 doses after CAR-T cell therapy, which is unusual in mouse CAR-T experiments and will not be used in clinical settings. Anti-tumor efficacy of anti-GPC1 CAR-T cells without IL-2 injections are needed.</p><p>3) Epitope spreading following anti-GPC1 CAR-T therapy was suggested based on IFN-g responses to gp70 in the treated mice (Figure 4I). However, it remains unclear whether the epitope spreading plays a crucial role in the anti-tumor effects of anti-GPC1 CAR-T therapy or is merely a by-stander phenomenon. In order to address this important question, efficacy of anti-GPC1 CAR-T cells should be examined in the mice with a depletion (or deficient) of endogenous T cell (or CD8 T cells). In addition, experiments to re-challenge GPC1-negative parental tumor into the mice which had rejected GPC1-positive tumor by CAR-T therapy are important.</p><p>4) In NOG mouse model, CAR-T cells were injected 9 days after tumor inoculation, but the suppression of tumor growth was visible only after day 30 (Figure 2E). Please explain any reason why there is such a gap between CAR-T injection and the detection of anti-tumor efficacy. Were any GVHD symptoms such as body weight loss observed in these NOG mice with CAR-T treatment?</p><p>5) MC38 is known as PD-1 Ab treatment-sensitive tumor. In this study, however, control T + anti-PD-1 Ab did not show any significant anti-tumor effects compared to control T + isotype Ab (Figure 6). Potential reasons for this observation should be explained.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49392.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors report that GPC1, which is expressed at high levels in several types of cancers but at low levels in normal tissues, is a good target for CAR T cell therapy.

It was also shown that the anti-tumor efficacy of the anti-GPC1 CAR-T cells was augmented by the combination with anti-PD-1 antibody. Based on cross-reactivity of the anti-GPC1 Ab, they also proposed the safety of anti-GPC1 CAR-T cell therapy. While CAR-T cell therapy against solid tumors are of highly interest as the next generation of cancer immunotherapy, this study contains significant defects in the experimental data and conclusion led by the authors. Inclusion of additional data and discussions according to below comments are necessary.</p><p>1) The authors concluded the safety of anti-GPC1 CAR-T cell therapy based on the cross-reactivity of Ab to mouse GPC1 and the similarity of GPC1 expression patterns between mouse and human normal tissues. However, this conclusion is hardly acceptable due to following reasons: 1) Even though their anti-GPC1 Ab cross-reacts with mouse GPC1, detail characteristics of the protein interaction are not necessarily identical. For example, affinity, avidity, Kd, and Ka of the Ab to human GPC1 and mouse GPC1 might not be the same. Moreover, the CAR construct utilized scFv instead of full form of Ab. Thus, detail characteristics as above must be assessed by using scFv. 2) As anti-GPC1 Ab used in this study was generated in chicken, immunogenicity of anti-GPC1 scFv will not be identical in human and mouse. Due to these reasons, observations in this study are not enough to conclude the safety of anti-GPC1 CAR-T cell therapy in human.</p></disp-quote><p>To evaluate detailed characteristics of the protein interaction between anti-GPC1 scFv and human or murine GPC-1 protein, we performed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis using anti-GPC1 scFv and human and mouse recombinant GPC1 protein. The SPR analysis showed high binding affinity of anti-GPC1 scFv against both human and mouse GPC1 proteins as shown in Author response tables 1 and 2 below. Although the anti-GPC1 scFv shows higher affinity against hGPC-1 than against mGPC-1, its difference is less than 10-times and both affinities are higher than K<sub>D</sub> 1x 10<sup>7-8</sup>, indicating that biological activities of anti-GPC1 scFv could be observed against both human and mouse GPC1. In in vitro study, both HL and LH versions of GPC1-specific CAR-T cells had antitumor responses to human and mouse GPC1 positive cancer cells without response to low GPC1 expressing human LK2 and murine MC38 cancer cell lines. These observations indicate that the GPC1-specific CAR-T cells may be utilized for the evaluation of antitumor effects and adverse effects in both human and mouse tumor models.</p><table-wrap id="resptable1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>Anti-GPC1 scFv HL form.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"/><th valign="top">Ka (1/Ms)</th><th valign="top">Kd (1/s)</th><th valign="top">K<sub>D</sub> (M)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">hGPC1</td><td valign="top">1.40E+05</td><td valign="top">0.0017</td><td valign="top">1.22E-08</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">mGPC1</td><td valign="top">2.73E+04</td><td valign="top">0.002963</td><td valign="top">1.09E-07</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="resptable2" position="float"><label>Author response table 2.</label><caption><title>Anti-GPC1 scFv LH form.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"/><th valign="top">Ka (1/Ms)</th><th valign="top">Kd (1/s)</th><th valign="top">K<sub>D</sub> (M)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">hGPC1</td><td valign="top">1.45E+05</td><td valign="top">0.00131</td><td valign="top">9.06E-09</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">mGPC1</td><td valign="top">4.21E+04</td><td valign="top">0.002179</td><td valign="top">5.18E-08</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>With these new findings, we added the sentences in the Results and Materials and methods sections as follows:</p><p>Results: âSurface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis showed high binding affinity of LH or HL forms of scFv against recombinant hGPC1 protein as calculated K<sub>D</sub> value 9.06 x 10<sup>-9</sup> M or 1.22 x 10<sup>-8</sup> M, respectively, which was as high as that of anti-CD19 scFv currently used in clinical settings (Ghorashian et al., 2019</p><p>Results: âTo generate GPC1-specific CAR-T cells from murine T cells and evaluate antitumor effects and adverse effects on normal tissues in syngeneic mouse models, we evaluated binding affinity of both LH and HL forms of scFv against recombinant mGPC1 protein by SPR analysis, and found that both LH (K<sub>D</sub> 5.18 x 10<sup>-8</sup> M) and HL (K<sub>D</sub> 1.09 x 10<sup>-7</sup> M) forms of scFv showed high binding affinity against mGPC1, although less affinity than those against hGPC1.

However, non-humanized CD19-specific CAR-T cells have demonstrated significant antitumor effects for a variety of B cell malignancy possibly due to their relatively immunosuppressed condition via malignancy and chemotherapy / preconditioning. And strong antitumor effects of the chicken based GPC1 specific CAR-T cells showed in this study. Therefore, even this form of CAR-T cells could be used for clinical trials, although we are also considering further humanization for clinical trials. We added sentences in the Discussion as follows:</p><p>âImmunogenicity of the chicken based CAR-T cells may cause rejection of the CAR-T cells and poor responses in patients.

In syngeneic mouse models, CAR-T cells were injected 3 days after tumor inoculation. Day 3 tumor size is too small to consider as pre-established tumor models. Experiments to treat late-stage tumors with larger size are necessary. In addition, 50,000 IU IL-2 was injected up to 6 doses after CAR-T cell therapy, which is unusual in mouse CAR-T experiments and will not be used in clinical settings. Anti-tumor efficacy of anti-GPC1 CAR-T cells without IL-2 injections are needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We did additional experiment to evaluatein vivo antitumor activity of our GPC1-specific CAR-T cells using large tumor model (tumor volume, more than 100 mm<sup>3</sup> on day 7) and observed a significant antitumor activity without any obvious adverse effects.

However, the need of IL-2 administration in CAR-T cell therapies is still controversial in solid cancers. We decided to inject IL-2 following the report showing that more than 6 times injections of IL-2 effectively enhanced antitumor effects of the adoptive T cell therapies in syngeneic mouse models (Klebanoff CA et al. Clin. Can. Res. 2011.). IL-2 has previously been administered with the gene engineered T cell therapies, including CAR-T cell therapies especially for solid cancers (e.g. In mouse models; Chinnasamy et al.,2010., Tran et al., 2013., In human clinical trials; Robbins PF et al. J. clin. Oncol. 2011, Goff SL et al. J immunother.2019.).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Epitope spreading following anti-GPC1 CAR-T therapy was suggested based on IFN-g responses to gp70 in the treated mice (Figure 4I). However, it remains unclear whether the epitope spreading plays a crucial role in the anti-tumor effects of anti-GPC1 CAR-T therapy or is merely a by-stander phenomenon. In order to address this important question, efficacy of anti-GPC1 CAR-T cells should be examined in the mice with a depletion (or deficient) of endogenous T cell (or CD8 T cells). In addition, experiments to re-challenge GPC1-negative parental tumor into the mice which had rejected GPC1-positive tumor by CAR-T therapy are important.</p></disp-quote><p>To evaluate the importance of endogenous T cell responses to endogenous tumor antigens in the GPC1-specific CAR-T cell therapy, we performed additional experiments as suggested by the reviewer; re-challenge of GPC1-negative parental MCA205 tumor cells in the mice which had complete regression of MCA205-mGPC1 by the GPC1-specific mCAR-T cell therapy. The cured mice showed significant growth inhibition of the re-challenged tumors, indicating the strong endogenous tumor specific T cells which may be involved in the stronger antitumor effects of CAR-T cell therapy in syngeneic murine tumor models than those in xenogeneic mouse models.
