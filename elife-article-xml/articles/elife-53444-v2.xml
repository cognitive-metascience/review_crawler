sterol-binding StARkin domains that are implicated in intracellular sterol homeostasis. Here, we show how these proteins exchange sterol molecules with membranes. An aperture at one end of the StARkin domain enables sterol to enter/exit the binding pocket. Strikingly, the wall of the pocket is longitudinally fractured, exposing bound sterol to solvent. Large-scale atomistic molecular dynamics simulations reveal that sterol egress involves widening of the fracture, penetration of water into the cavity, and consequent destabilization of the bound sterol. The simulations identify polar residues along the fracture that are important for sterol release. Their replacement with alanine affects the ability of the StARkin domain to bind sterol, catalyze inter-vesicular sterol exchange and alleviate the nystatin-sensitivity of <italic>lam2Δ</italic> yeast cells.

Like many membrane lipids, it is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to the PM by non-vesicular mechanisms that make use of lipid transport proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Holthuis and Menon, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wong et al., 2019</xref>). These proteins operate as intracellular molecular ferries, achieving lipid exchange between membranes by reversibly extracting a lipid from the cytoplasmic leaflet of one membrane bilayer, encapsulating it within a binding pocket for transfer through the cytoplasm, and depositing it in the cytoplasmic leaflet of another membrane. Proteins that contain steroidogenic acute regulatory protein related lipid transfer (StART) domains constitute a major family of intracellular lipid transport proteins — the StARkin superfamily. Proteins of this family are generally soluble and able to diffuse freely through the cytoplasm, and they are implicated in moving glycerophospholipids, ceramide and sterol between cellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wong and Levine, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alpy and Tomasetto, 2005</xref>). A new family of ER membrane proteins that have cytoplasmically disposed StARkin domains was recently identified, including six members (Lam1–Lam6) in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and three members (GramD1a–GramD1c, also termed Aster-A–C) in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gatta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Elbaz-Alon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Murley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sullivan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sandhu et al., 2018</xref>). Members of this new sub-family have one or two StARkin domains that bind sterols and catalyze sterol exchange between populations of vesicles in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gatta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Murley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sandhu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jentsch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Horenkamp et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tong et al., 2018</xref>). Lam1–Lam4 localize to ER–PM contact sites in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gatta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Quon et al., 2018</xref>) where they play a role in sterol homeostasis. Thus, yeast cells that lack one or more of these proteins are hypersensitive to the sterol-binding polyene antibiotics amphotericin and nystatin, implying that they have alterations in PM sterol content and/or organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gatta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Roelants et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, they esterify exogenously supplied sterols up to 3-fold more slowly than wild-type cells, indicating a delay in some aspect of PM–ER sterol transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gatta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Roelants et al., 2018</xref>). A sterol homeostatic role has also been suggested for the mouse GramD1b (Aster-B) protein, which is highly expressed in steroidogenic organs. Thus, adrenal glands from a GramD1b knockout mouse are devoid of lipid droplets and show a severe reduction in cholesteryl ester content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sandhu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We recently reported crystal structures of the second StARkin domain of Lam4 (here termed Lam4S2) in <italic>apo</italic>- and sterol-bound states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jentsch et al., 2018</xref>). The protein has an overall α/β helix-grip fold that forms a capacious binding pocket into which the sterol appears to be admitted head-first, through an aperture at one end, such that its 3-β-hydroxyl head-group is stabilized by direct or water-mediated interactions with polar residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The interior surface of the binding pocket is surprisingly polar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) considering the hydrophobicity of its sterol clients, which include cholesterol, ergosterol, dehydroergosterol (DHE) and 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) (Results [also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gatta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jentsch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gatta et al., 2018</xref>]). The surface of the protein near the entrance to the pocket is decorated with lysine residues, accounting for the enhanced ability of Lam4S2 to transfer sterol between anionic vesicles compared with its ability to transfer sterol between neutral vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jentsch et al., 2018</xref>); the entryway itself is partially occluded by a flexible loop, termed Ω1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), whose functional importance in the StARkin family has been well-documented through mutagenesis studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Horenkamp et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gatta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iaea et al., 2015</xref>).

The wall of the sterol binding cavity in all Lam/GramD1 StARkin domains is fractured along part of its length, not unlike one of Lucio Fontana's slashed canvases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Candela, 2019</xref>), exposing the sterol backbone to bulk solvent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Different modes of Lam4S2-membrane association deduced from 'Stage 1' molecular dynamics simulations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structural elements of the Lam4S2 domain used to construct collective variables (CVs) for time-structure independent components analysis (tICA).

We posited that the ability to load sterol into the pocket, or to discharge it from the pocket into the membrane, might be controlled by water permeation via the side-opening. We used a combination of large-scale atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and functional tests to explore this hypothesis. Analysis of extensive ensemble and umbrella sampling MD trajectories revealed that sterol egress from Lam4S2 is associated with widening of the side-entrance to the binding pocket, penetration of water molecules into the cavity, and consequent destabilization of the bound sterol. The simulations identified several polar residues that line the side-opening to the pocket and that appear to play a critical role in the initial steps of the release process. The functional importance of these residues was validated experimentally by showing that their replacement with alanine compromises the ability of Lam4S2 to rescue the nystatin-sensitivity of <italic>lam2Δ</italic> yeast cells. Furthermore, these substitutions reduce the efficiency with which the purified protein is able to extract membrane-bound sterol and catalyze sterol exchange between populations of vesicles in vitro.

In one mode (Mode 1, occurring with ~85% frequency [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>]), the protein interacted with lipid headgroups via its N- and C-termini (green and red; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In the second mode (Mode 2), observed with ~15% frequency, Lam4S2 engaged with the membrane via its Ω1 loop (purple; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref>) and its C-terminal helix (yellow; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref>). Consistent with the overall electrostatic properties of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>), both modes of binding are driven by electrostatic interactions between the protein and the membrane surface. Thus, Mode 1 implicates the protein face composed of the basic C-terminus region (e.g. K203) and nearby K62 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>) as well as the positively charged N-terminal amino group, whereas Mode 2 is stabilized by contacts between the membrane and basic residues K163/K167 on the C-terminal helix and K98 in the Ω1 loop region.</p><p>Although more frequent, Mode 1 is probably a non-physiological consequence of simulating the isolated Lam4S2 domain. Indeed, the N- and C-terminal regions that stabilize this mode of association are covalently linked to the remainder of the protein chain in full-length Lam4, that is, the first StARkin domain and the transmembrane helix, respectively. Furthermore, in this mode, Lam4S2 is positioned on the membrane in such a way that the hydrophobic tail of cholesterol is directly exposed to the solvent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In Mode 2, on the other hand, Lam4S2 is engaged with the membrane via structural regions that have been implicated in the function of the protein. Thus, the Ω1 loop is known to be a functionally important feature of all StARkin domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Horenkamp et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gatta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iaea et al., 2015</xref>), and the cationic residues K163/K167 in the C-terminal helix have been implicated in the in vitro sterol transfer activities of Lam4S2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jentsch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gatta et al., 2018</xref>) and StARD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iaea et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, in Mode 2, cholesterol is oriented orthogonally to the plane of membrane, with its 3-β-OH group engaging Q121 in the binding pocket of Lam4S2 and its iso-octyl tail facing the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that Mode 2, in which the protein appears to be situated correctly to release sterol into the membrane, is required for proper function. To test this premise, we considered the Lam4S2 K163D/K167D double mutant, which retains an electrostatic surface that is strongly positive at the C-terminus but is negatively charged around the C-terminal helix (compare panels [A] and [B] in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The double mutant binds to membrane vesicles indistinguishably from the wild type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>), but fails to transport sterol between vesicles, as we previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jentsch et al., 2018</xref>). These results suggest that this mutant, like the wild-type protein, binds the membrane predominantly via the unproductive Mode 1 form of association, which is unperturbed by the mutations. However, unlike the wild-type protein, the double mutant is unable to populate Mode 2. Indeed, when the K163D/K167D mutation was introduced into the computational model of Lam4S2 representing binding Mode 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>), and the resulting system was subjected to ~50 ns MD simulations, we observed a spontaneous reorientation of the protein-membrane complex to the Mode 1 pose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E</xref>). These results suggest that the K163D/K167D mutations destabilize Mode 2 and drive Lam4S2 to exclusively adopt the Mode 1 pose on the membrane surface. Importantly, given that the double mutant is functionally inactive, these observations confirm that Mode 1 is functionally irrelevant.</p><p>On the basis of these results, we chose not to explore Mode 1 further, but rather to test the premise that Mode 2 mediates release of sterol into the membrane. To this end, we enhanced the sampling of this mode of Lam4S2–membrane interaction by initiating a new set of 100 independent MD simulations (with random starting velocities) from 10 conformations of the system in which the Ω1 loop and the C-terminal helix were simultaneously engaged with lipids (Stage 2 ensemble simulations, 37.5 µs cumulative time). As described next, these trajectories revealed detailed mechanistic steps leading to spontaneous release of the protein-bound cholesterol into the membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mechanistic steps of cholesterol transfer from Lam4S2 to the membrane</title><p>To facilitate analyses of the conformational dynamics of the membrane-bound Lam4S2–cholesterol complex in Stage 2 simulations, we used the time-structure-based independent component analysis (tICA) approach to reduce the dimensionality of the system (see 'Materials and methods').

Microstate 1 represents an ensemble of states in which the sterol-binding cavity is occluded from both the solvent and the membrane. Thus, in Microstate 1 conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>), cholesterol is stably bound in the protein (‘chol RMSD’ histogram [bottom panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>]), while the sterol-binding pocket is dehydrated (‘water count’ histogram [bottom panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>]) and sealed from the side by the side-chains of residues S181 and D61 that line the side-opening of the pocket (d<sub>61–181</sub> distance histogram [bottom panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>]). In addition, the Ω1 loop is positioned close to the C-terminal helix so that the C<sub>α</sub> atoms of residues I95 in the Ω1 loop and A169 in the C-terminal helix are within ~10 Å of each other (d<sub>95–169</sub> distance histogram [bottom panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>]; see the middle structure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> for the location of A169), thus occluding the sterol-binding pocket from below, that is the vantage point of the membrane. Indeed, in the ensemble of conformations representing Microstate 1, cholesterol has essentially no contact with membrane lipids (‘number of lipids’ histogram [bottom panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>]).</p><p>The first step in the sterol-release process involves widening of the side-entrance to the sterol-binding site, which is enabled by gradual separation of the side-chains of residues D61 and S181. This structural change on the tICA landscape can be followed in the evolution of the system from Microstate 1 to Microstates 2 and 3 (see d<sub>61–181</sub> distance histogram [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>]). Concomitant with the widening of the side-opening, the level of hydration (water count) of the binding pocket progressively increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>).</p><p>Cholesterol remains stably bound throughout these initial events (cholesterol RMSD is unchanged in Microstates 1–3). However, the rising level of hydration in the binding site results in destabilization of the polar interactions between the 3-β-OH group of cholesterol and the side-chain of residue Q121 as cholesterol initiates its translocation towards the membrane. Indeed, as the system transitions from Microstate 3 to Microstate 4, the RMSD of the cholesterol molecule increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Correspondingly, the minimum distance between the cholesterol oxygen and residue Q121 increases by ~4 Å (compare d<sub>chol–121</sub> for Microstates 1 and 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Notably, as the cholesterol molecule assumes this new position, the distance between the Ω1 loop and the C-terminal helix increases, as seen in the broadening of the d<sub>95–169</sub> histogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating initial opening of the sterol-binding pocket towards the membrane.</p><p>Cholesterol egress then proceeds through Microstates 5–7 in which the sterol-binding pocket remains open and solvated, while the Ω1 loop continues to sample conformations that position it relatively far from the C-terminal helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). The cholesterol molecule leaves the binding pocket with its tail ‘down’, becoming gradually encapsulated by the hydrophobic chains of neighboring lipids until it fully embeds into the lipid membrane (‘number of lipids’ histogram [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>] and corresponding structural snapshots [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>]). The process of translocation is complete when the system reaches Microstate 7. The remaining part of the tICA space (corresponding to lower tIC1 and tIC2 values, that is, the bottom left region of the 2D space in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) describes trajectory data in which Lam4S2 disengages from the membrane, after the release of the sterol, and diffuses into the solvent. Of note, the high level of hydration of the binding site in empty Lam4S2, that is after sterol egress, is recapitulated in MD simulations of the <italic>apo</italic> Lam4S2 system (initiated from the sterol-free Lam4S2 structure, PDB ID 6BYD) run under the same conditions as the Stage 1 simulations of cholesterol-bound Lam4S2 described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> and 'Materials and methods' for more details).</p><p>The sterol translocation process outlined above was sampled in its entirety in 5 out of 100 Stage 2 simulations (trajectories highlighted in red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).

We found that D61 is engaged in electrostatic interactions with residue K89 located in the β2 strand preceding the Ω1 loop.

Specifically, we considered two snapshots taken at different time points (120 ns and 150 ns, respectively) from one of the Stage 2 trajectories (350 ns-long) of the wild-type protein system in which sterol release was observed. For the wild-type protein at these time points, the side-opening to the pocket is closed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A</xref>), the cholesterol molecule is stably bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5B</xref>), and the level of hydration is relatively low (between 5–10 water molecules as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5C</xref>).

This high energy cost is associated with the clear change in hydration of the sterol-binding site and the concomitant opening of the side-opening to the pocket (see WT profiles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Indeed, the water count increases and the D61–S181 interaction is destabilized when the system transitions from d<sub>Z(chol–121)</sub>∈ [2 Å; 6 Å] to d<sub>Z(chol–121)</sub> ≥ 7 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, C</xref>). LM-2 represents the ensemble of states in which cholesterol is on the verge of exiting the protein, that is, states in which cholesterol is mostly engaged by lipids and with its head-group on the level of the Ω1 loop (see Microstate 6 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). LM-1 and LM-2 are separated by an energy barrier of ~2 kcal/mole. Overall, the presence of multiple minima on the PMF plot is consistent with our findings from the tICA analysis of the unbiased MD simulations described above: in some of the Stage 2 trajectories, the system evolved from Microstate 1 to Microstate 5 (i.e. transitioned from the global minimum to LM-1 on the PMF plot), but either did not progress further to complete sterol egress (i.e. they did not reach LM2) or returned to the conformational space of the tICA landscape characterized by relatively low hydration of the sterol-binding pocket (i.e. they returned to the global energy minimum). For comparison, we also investigated the energetics of sterol release from wild-type Lam4S2 in water. In this case, the PMF profile no longer has LM-1 and LM-2 minima (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Instead, only one global minimum can be found, corresponding to the position of cholesterol in the binding site. The energy difference between the bound and released states on the PMF profile in water is &gt;10 kcal/mole, at least ~2-fold higher than the energy barrier for sterol release into the membrane. These differences can be explained by the different solvent exposure of the hydrophobic tail of cholesterol during the egress process in water versus that in the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, comparison of the PMF plots for the wild-type and the K89A systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) reveals that the mutation significantly lowers the barriers that must be overcome in order for transition between the different energy minima to occur. Thus, although the PMF profile for the K89A construct still has three energy minima, the energy cost of transitioning between the global minimum and LM-1 in this system is ~2 kcal/mole, and between LM-2 and LM-3 is ~1 kcal/mole, resulting in an energy barrier of only ~3 kcal/mole for the entire release process (d<sub>Z(chol–121)</sub>∈ [2 Å; 20 Å]). This is approximately half of that determined for the wild-type system. This reduction in the energy cost can be explained by the greater extent of hydration of the binding site in K89A compared to that in the wild-type protein. Indeed, in wild-type Lam4S2, the binding site remains largely dehydrated until cholesterol disengages from Q121 (d<sub>Z(chol–121)</sub>∈ [2 Å; 6 Å]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), whereas in the K89A protein, the level of solvation of the binding pocket is relatively high (&gt;10 water molecules) even when cholesterol is interacting with Q121 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These trends in binding-site hydration are mirrored by changes in the d<sub>61–181</sub> distance along the d<sub>Z(chol–121)</sub> coordinate (note destabilization of D61–S181 interactions in the K89A system versus those in the wild-type system for small d<sub>Z(chol–121)</sub> values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the global minimum on the PMF profile of the K89A mutant is shifted compared to its location on the PMF plot of the wild-type system, from d<sub>Z(chol–121) </sub>~2 Å to ~5 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We found that, at the shortest d<sub>Z(chol–121)</sub> distances, cholesterol–Q121 interactions in the mutant are mostly mediated by water molecules, whereas at d<sub>Z(chol–121) </sub>~5 Å, the hydroxyl group of cholesterol is in direct contact with Q121 (see sharp peak at ~2 Å for the d<sub>Z(chol–121) </sub>= 5 Å plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>; note that d<sub>Z(chol–121)</sub> is the Z-distance between the hydroxyl and the C<sub>α</sub> of Q121). This may also explain why the water content in the cavity is skewed towards lower values for d<sub>Z(chol–121) </sub>~5 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, for both the wild-type and K89A systems (and for the wild type simulated in water, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>), the global minimum on the PMF plot corresponds to the ensemble of states in which cholesterol is engaged in direct interactions with Q121. Overall, the PMF calculations reveal that the K89A substitution lowers the energy barrier for cholesterol release from Lam4S2 into the membrane and suggests that cholesterol is consequently less stable in the binding pocket.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Alanine substitution of residues at the side-entrance to the sterol-binding pocket impacts the function of Lam4S2 in cells and in vitro</title><p>Our computational studies indicate that substitution of D61, K89 or S181 with alanine affects the degree of hydration of the sterol-binding pocket and the stability of bound sterol, with the most significant effects seen for the K89A mutant.

Strikingly, the sterol-binding pocket in these proteins is fractured along part of its length, exposing bound sterol to solvent. The analyses presented here describe a potentially general mechanism by which sterol egress (or entry) from Lam/GramD1 StARkin domains is controlled by the concomitant entry (or egress) of water molecules via this unusual lateral fracture.</p><p>Our MD simulations reveal that Lam4S2 docks onto anionic phospholipid membranes mainly via two modes, one of which (termed Mode 2 here) is likely to be physiologically relevant. In this mode, the protein engages the membrane via its Ω1 loop and C-terminal helix, two structural regions that have been identified previously as being functionally important in StART domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jentsch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Horenkamp et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gatta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iaea et al., 2015</xref>). Once membrane-bound, the protein adopts diverse conformations that are characterized by different extents of widening of the side-opening to the sterol-binding pocket. The side-opening in sterol-loaded Lam4S2 can be occluded by the polar side-chains of residues S181, D61, and K89, resulting in a low level of hydration within the cavity. In this condition, the cholesterol molecule is stably bound, with its hydroxyl group forming hydrogen-bonding interactions with residue Q121. Cholesterol egress is triggered stochastically, by gradual widening of the side-opening and concomitant penetration of water into the binding site. These dynamic events destabilize cholesterol in the binding site by ~4–5 kcal/mole, driving it from the binding site towards the membrane. The subsequent steps of the release process are enabled by repositioning of the Ω1 loop away from the C-terminal helix. This fully exposes the binding pocket to the membrane, that is widens the axial aperture, thus creating a continuous passageway to the membrane. The sequence of events by which sterol exits Lam4S2 and enters the membrane is shown in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-53444-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Molecular dynamics trajectory of cholesterol egress from Lam4S2.</title><p>The movie is based on one of the Stage 2 simulations of wild-type Lam4S2.

This value is in reasonable agreement with the ~10–15 kcal/mole estimate for the energy barrier for sterol extraction by Lam4S2 based on (i) measurement of its transport rate, (ii) the assumption that intermembrane sterol transfer is rate-limited by sterol pick-up/delivery, and (iii) the observation that the rate constant for this process can be described by a simple Arrhenius relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dittman and Menon, 2017</xref>). Thus, using the measured transport rate of ~0.8 sterol molecules per second per Lam4S2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jentsch et al., 2018</xref>), and Arrhenius prefactors in the range 10<sup>9</sup>–10<sup>10</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dittman and Menon, 2017</xref>), we estimate the energy barrier to be 20.9–23.2 <italic>k<sub>B</sub>T</italic>, equivalent to ~12.5–14 kcal/mole. Overall, the computational findings reported here reveal that the conformational state of the side-opening to the sterol-binding cavity in the Lam4S2 StARkin domain plays a major role in regulating the energetic stability of the sterol in the pocket.</p><p>This prediction was probed first computationally by analyzing MD trajectories of Lam4S2 in which residues that line the side-entrance to the binding site were substituted with alanine. For all three mutations (S181A, D61A and K89A), we found destabilization of cholesterol in the binding site. Using potential of mean force calculations, we found that the K89A mutation lowered the energy barrier for cholesterol release by ~2 fold compared with that for wild type Lam4S2. Experimental tests confirmed that the K89A mutant was non-functional, whereas the S181A mutant was only partially compromised in its ability to bind sterol, a defect that did not appear to influence its ability to rescue the nystatin-sensitivity of <italic>lam2Δ</italic> cells or to exchange sterols between membranes in vitro. Our test of the D61A mutant was limited to a cell-based assay in which it performed as well as the wild-type protein in rescuing the nystatin-sensitivity of <italic>lam2Δ</italic> cells.</p><p>Considering the functional importance of K89, and to a lesser extent S181, we examined the conservation of these residues in the Lam/GramD1 family using a previously reported structure-based sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Horenkamp et al., 2018</xref>). We found that the positions aligning with K89 and S181 were among the residues with the highest conservation score. Interestingly, it has been noted that the side-chain of residue K910 in the S1 domain of Lam2 (Lam2S1), which aligns with K89 of Lam4S2 (note that K89 in Lam4S2 corresponds to K1031 in the full-length protein [<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>]) is positioned slightly differently in the ergosterol-bound and <italic>apo</italic> structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Horenkamp et al., 2018</xref>). This led to speculation that a path for ergosterol movement into and out of Lam2S1 could be enabled by movement of K910. Consistent with this, our study reveals that residue K89 in Lam4S2 does indeed reposition when cholesterol is released from the protein. Importantly, we find that this movement is a part of larger-scale dynamic changes involving neighboring polar residues, D61 and S181, that lead to widening of the side-opening to the binding pocket.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Constructs and strains.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2" valign="top">Bacterial plasmids (all constructs are in the pTrcHis6A expression vector and start with the sequence MGGSHHHHHHGMASHHHHHARALEVLFQGPM)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Lam4S2<sup>1</sup></td><td valign="top">Lam4 946–1145</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Lam4S2(D61A)<sup>3</sup></td><td valign="top">Lam4 946–1145 (D1003A)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Lam4S2(K89A)<sup>3</sup></td><td valign="top">Lam4 946–1145 (K1031A)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Lam4S2(S181A)<sup>3</sup></td><td valign="top">Lam4 946–1145 (S1123A)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">Yeast plasmids</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">GFP only<sup>2</sup></td><td valign="top">pRS416 (CEN <italic>URA3</italic>): GFP + GFP</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">GFP-Lam4S2<sup>2</sup></td><td valign="top">pRS416 (CEN <italic>URA3</italic>): GFP + Lam4 946–1155 + DV<sup>4</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">GFP-Lam4S2(D61A)<sup>3</sup></td><td valign="top">pRS416 (CEN <italic>URA3</italic>): GFP + Lam4 946–1155 (D1003A) + DV<sup>4</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">GFP-Lam4S2(K89A)<sup>3</sup></td><td valign="top">pRS416 (CEN <italic>URA3</italic>): GFP + Lam4 946–1155 (K1031A) + DV<sup>4</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">GFP-Lam4S2(S181A)<sup>3</sup></td><td valign="top">pRS416 (CEN <italic>URA3</italic>): GFP + Lam4 946–1155 (S1123A) + DV<sup>4</sup></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">Bacterial strain</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>E. cloni</italic> EXPRESS BL21(DE3)</td><td valign="top">F– <italic>ompT hsdSB (rB– mB–) gal dcm lon</italic> λ(DE3 [<italic>lacI lac</italic>UV5-T7 gene one <italic>ind1 sam7 nin5</italic>])</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Yeast strain</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>lam2Δ</italic> (also called <italic>ysp2Δ</italic>)<sup>5</sup></td><td valign="top"><italic>MATa his3∆1 leu2∆0 met15∆0 ura3∆0 ysp2∆::hphNT1</italic></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p><sup>1</sup> Described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jentsch et al.

We find that water penetration destabilizes hydrogen-bonding interactions between the 3-β-OH of cholesterol and the side-chain of Q121, leading to initiation of sterol egress. Although the current computations have not directly addressed the mechanism of sterol <italic>entry</italic> into the binding site, the PMF profile that we report here suggests that the continuous water pathway connecting the binding site to the bulk solution, as observed in our simulations of <italic>apo</italic> Lam4S2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), should play an important role in the delivery of sterol into the binding site. In this respect, it is important to note that similar to Lam4S2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), the sterol-binding pocket in all other Lam/GramD1 domains with known structure show strong polar characteristics. Furthermore, although in some X-ray structures of Lam/GramD1 StARkin domains, the polar head-group of the bound sterol is seen in direct contact with neighboring polar residues, in others it is engaged with the protein indirectly through water-mediated interactions. The former mode is observed in Lam4S2, Lam2S2 and GramD1a, whereas the latter mode is seen in Lam2S1. Interestingly, in both Lam4S2 and Lam2S2, the head-group of the bound sterol hydrogen-bonds to the side-chain of a Gln residue (Q121 in Lam4S2). In Lam2S1, on the other hand, the position aligning with Q121 is occupied by a small-size polar residue, Ser. Therefore, the head-group of the sterol does not form a direct hydrogen bond within the binding pocket of Lam2S1 but rather associates with the protein through water-mediated interactions. In GramD1a, in which the residue analogous to Q121 of Lam4S2 is also Ser, the bound sterol is seen in direct contact with another adjacent polar residue (Tyr). Similar to Lam/GramD1 StARkin domains, structural information on yeast Osh4/Kes1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Im et al., 2005</xref>) in complex with different sterols reveals the prominence of water-mediated interactions between the 3-β-OH group of the bound sterol and a cluster of polar residues in the binding site. Furthermore, steered MD simulations of cholesterol release from Osh4 into water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Singh et al., 2009</xref>) suggested that the release process unfolds via a <italic>molecular ladder</italic> mechanism whereby the 3-β-OH group switches between different sets of water-mediated interactions with the binding-site residues as it leaves the protein. Taken together, the structural information highlights the importance of polar interactions for the stability of the sterol molecule in the binding site, consistent with our results demonstrating that disruption of these interactions by influx of water through the cavity side-opening leads to sterol release. Therefore, the molecular mechanism of sterol release that we have identified in Lam4S2 is likely to be generalizable to other homologous domains.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Computational methods</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Molecular constructs of wild-type Lam4S2</title><p>The computations were based on the X-ray structures of the second StARkin domain of Lam4, Lam4S2 (PDBIDs 6BYM and 6BYD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jentsch et al., 2018</xref>).

Aliquots of the sample (5 μl) were removed at different points of preparation (after the freeze–thaw step, post-extrusion and after final resuspension) and taken for liquid scintillation counting to track lipid recovery by monitoring [<sup>3</sup>H]cholesterol.</p><p>The ability of Lam4S2 (wild-type and point mutants) to extract cholesterol from the vesicles was determined as follows. Liposomes (15 μl, ~1500 pmol cholesterol) and protein (500–750 pmol, as indicated) were combined in assay buffer to a total volume of 500 μl. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 hr, before removing a 20 μl aliquot for liquid scintillation counting. The remainder of the sample was centrifuged in a Beckman TLA100.2 rotor (75,000 rpm, 1 hr, 4°C). Most of the supernatant (350 μl) was transferred to a fresh 1.5 ml tube, whereas the remainder was removed immediately and discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl assay buffer containing 5% (w/v) SDS. Duplicate aliquots (50 μl each) of the supernatant were taken for liquid scintillation counting to determine the amount of extracted cholesterol. Protein in the remainder of the supernatant (250 μl) and the resuspended pellet was precipitated by adding 1.2 ml ice-cold acetone, followed by overnight incubation at −20°C. The precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation, air-dried after removal of the acetone, and dissolved in SDS gel loading buffer. The relative amount of protein in the supernatant and pellet fractions was determined by SDS-PAGE, Coomassie staining and quantification of band intensity using Image J software (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link>). The data are represented as pmol cholesterol extracted/pmol protein in the supernatant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Tim Levine and Ganiyu Alli-Balogun (Department of Cell Biology, University College London Institute of Ophthalmology) for plasmids, Trudy Ramlall (Eliezer laboratory, Weill Cornell Medical College) for help with protein purification, and Harel Weinstein for insightful comments on the manuscript.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Water for sterol: an unusual mechanism of sterol egress from a StARkin domain&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Your study examines the interesting and poorly-understood question of how a sterol-binding protein releases its bound sterol into a lipid bilayer. You provide several lines of evidence that the bound sterol is ejected from a sterol-binding STARkin protein domain by the penetration of water into the binding pocket. Your finding that the binding pocket accommodates the hydrophobic sterol as well as water is surprising and intriguing.</p><p>All the reviewers agreed that this study was thought-provoking and constituted a significant Research Advance. However, they also raised several concerns, addressing which would take more than the two-month revision window. The reviewers welcome assessment of a revised submission, but only if it addressed all the points raised in the full reviews listed below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This study by Khelashvili et al. follows up on two previous studies, one in <italic>eLife</italic> where ER proteins with sterol-binding StARkin domains were identified (2015) and a second in JBC where the structure of a yeast StARkin domain was determined (2018). Those previous studies did not yield mechanistic insights into how the StARkin domain delivered its bound sterol to the membrane. Here, the authors use molecular dynamics simulations to show that the ejection of the sterol into the membrane is preceded by penetration of water into the binding cavity – hence the &quot;water for sterol&quot; title. Since sterols are extremely hydrophobic, this is a surprising finding in that the binding pocket seems to accommodate the hydrophobic sterol as well as the complete opposite molecule on the hydrophobicity scale – water! The simulations identify a lysine residue (K89) that is important for modulating this egress step. This is an intriguing paper that could constitute an advance, but there are two main issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>1) This study focuses on the transfer of cholesterol from cholesterol-Lam4S2 complex to the membrane. The crystal structure in the Jentsch et al. paper shows sterol-bound Lam4S2, but the bound sterol is 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), not cholesterol (or ergosterol). The complex that is the starting point here replaces the bound 25HC with cholesterol. To fortify their starting point, the authors should show that bound 3H-25HC is competed away by unlabeled 25HC as well as cholesterol (or ergosterol). The authors report a sterol extraction assay with 3H-cholesterol in Figure 6D, so a binding assay seems possible to design to address this point. Alternatively, the simulations could be done with Lam4S2-ergosterol complexes, which may yield more robust results since it is the natural ligand, and is likely the sterol that is transported. I understand the authors want to make a general point about these StARkin domains, but the use of ergosterol instead of cholesterol would not dampen the provocative &quot;water-for-sterol&quot; ejection mechanism.</p><p>2) The elegant simulations indicate that the first step in sterol egress is widening of the side-entrance (microstate 2 and 3) to allow more water molecules into the binding pocket. Presumably, this only happens when the Lam4S2/sterol binds to or is close to a membrane? What in the membrane-bound state mediates this widening? In other words, why doesn't the widening and water penetration occur when the Lam4S2 is in solution?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In their manuscript Menon and co-workers examine at the atomistic level how cholesterol exits the binding pocket of the Starkin domain of Lam4 (LAMS2), a recently discovered sterol transfer protein that functions in ER/PM contacts in yeast. By an impressive number of unbiaised MD simulations and elegant analyses by PCA, they reveal a mechanism by which water molecules enter via a fracture along the sterol-binding pocket to destabilize a key interaction between the 3-OH of sterol and Lam4S2. A triad of residues closing the top of this fracture is involved in the pace of this mechanism and plays a substantial role in stabilizing sterol in Lam4. Overall the work is very interesting mostly due to the in silico approaches. Indeed we see sterol egress in a non-steered MD and its entry in a bilayer. Yet it is difficult in the second-part of the manuscript to apprehend to what degree the water-mediated mechanism of sterol exit is supported by in vivo/in vitro experiments. Rather, experimental data suggest that a point mutation of a residue K89, found in simulation to limit sterol stability, renders Lam4 inactive but is this sufficient to validate the occurrence of the water-mediated mechanism? I think the manuscript deserves to be published in <italic>eLife</italic> but with more experimental data to buttress the MD simulations.</p><p>- Stage 1 simulations identify two poses for LamS2 on a bilayer: one seems impossible due to steric constraints imposed by the N and C regions around the Starkin domain whilst the second one seems compatible. Functional assays suggest that a few residues found to insert in the membrane by MD are indeed key for membrane recognition. However, this does not tell that the selected orientation of Lam4S2 in MD is the genuine one. Authors should provide evidences on this as this orientation is the starting point for the analysis of sterol exit, thus of the rest of the study.</p><p>- There is somehow a gap between MD and functional assays as there is no structural analysis in between. Indeed, there is no direct experiments to measure the accessibility of the binding pocket to water molecules in the presence/absence of the ligand and/or mutation – possibly, H-D exchange experiments by NMR using D<sub>2</sub>O could be useful in that respect. Also there is no assay to quantitatively measure the stability of sterol in Lam4S2 at equilibrium and/or its release in membrane. Osh3 and Osh4 were found to load DHE by measuring energy transfer between W residues, surrounding the pocket, and DHE (Tong et al., Structure. 2013, 21(7):1203-13; De Saint-Jean et a, J Cell Biol. 2011;195(6):965-78.). Offloading of DHE into membrane can be measured also by FRET in lipidic vesicles in real time. Authors should try such approaches that could more directly support MD simulations. Last they might use transport rates inferred from DHE transport assays with Lam4S2 to estimate an energy barrier for sterol extraction by the protein instead of quoting Dittman and Menon, 2017.</p><p>- Authors should check at least that single-mutation K89A or S181A does not affect the membrane-binding ability of Lam4S2</p><p>- it is quite surprising that 2 mutants out of 3 are not defective in yeast. In particular the D61A mutant do not phenocopy the K89A mutant, which is unexpected considering the existence of a electrostatic interaction with K89 and its central position in the triad of residues, making also contact with S181. Is there any explanation for this ?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The mechanism of cholesterol release from endoplasmic reticulum domains that possess sterol-binding domains was studied. A computer model of the protein was derived from recently published crystallographic and spectroscopic structural data. Simulations have been well executed. Appropriate literature regarding previous evidence has been cited. The mildly steered molecular simulations provide deeper insight into the process of cholesterol release as well as its energetics. It highlights the role of water molecules in release of cholesterol from the binding domain. Conclusions are strengthened by studying the influence of alanine mutations on cholesterol binding and release both experimentally and in simulations.

However, they also raised several concerns, addressing which would take more than the two-month revision window. The reviewers welcome assessment of as revised submission, but only if it addressed all the points raised in the full reviews listed below.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] This is an intriguing paper that could constitute an advance, but there are two main issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>1) This study focuses on the transfer of cholesterol from cholesterol-Lam4S2 complex to the membrane. The crystal structure in the Jentsch et al. paper shows sterol-bound Lam4S2, but the bound sterol is 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), not cholesterol (or ergosterol). The complex that is the starting point here replaces the bound 25HC with cholesterol. To fortify their starting point, the authors should show that bound 3H-25HC is competed away by unlabeled 25HC as well as cholesterol (or ergosterol). The authors report a sterol extraction assay with 3H-cholesterol in Figure 6D, so a binding assay seems possible to design to address this point.</p></disp-quote><p>Lam4S2 has been previously shown to bind cholesterol, dehydroergosterol (DHE) and 25HC; binding to ergosterol was shown indirectly via competition experiments.</p><p>Thus, in Gatta et al., 2015, on which this Research Advance is based, we showed that Lam4S2 binds DHE and cholesterol. DHE binding was demonstrated using a FRET assay, and the extent of binding was reduced in the presence of cholesterol or ergosterol. Binding of Lam4S2 to cholesterol was also explicitly shown by demonstrating the specific ability of the protein to extract radiolabeled cholesterol from permeabilized HL-60 cells that had been metabolically radiolabeled with [<sup>14</sup>C]acetate to label all lipids. As noted by the reviewer, our crystal structure (Jentsch et al., 2018) additionally shows that the protein binds 25HC. We now report competition data that confirm these findings. Using the FRET assay of Gatta et al., 2015, we show that DHE binding is reduced by ergosterol and also by 25HC (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). It is also noteworthy that binding of either 25HC ((Jentsch et al., 2018) or cholesterol (Gatta et al., 2018) to Lam4S2 results in similar changes to the NMR spectrum of the protein, indicating that the two sterols bind in a highly similar fashion.</p><p>These cumulative data – indicating equivalence of binding of all four sterols – are supported by structural models (Figure 1A (Lam4S2-cholesterol), Figure 1—figure supplement 2C (Lam4S2-ergosterol), Figure 1—figure supplement 2C (Lam4S2-25HC)), which show that 25HC, ergosterol and cholesterol adopt the same pose within the binding site. We therefore believe that our studies with cholesterol-bound Lam4S2 provide insight into the ejection mechanism for any of the four sterols mentioned here. See also our last response to point 1 below.</p><p>We have surveyed these points at the beginning of the Results section to clarify our choice of cholesterol-bound Lam4S2 for the simulations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alternatively, the simulations could be done with Lam4S2-ergosterol complexes, which may yield more robust results since it is the natural ligand, and is likely the sterol that is transported. I understand the authors want to make a general point about these StARkin domains, but the use of ergosterol instead of cholesterol would not dampen the provocative &quot;water-for-sterol&quot; ejection mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>As per the reviewer's suggestion, we built the ergosterol-Lam4S2 complex <italic>in silico</italic> and studied its dynamics. To this end we docked ergosterol into Lam4S2, using the cholesterol-Lam4S2 structure which was used as the starting point for the Stage 2 ensemble simulations that we report. The resulting ergosterol-Lam4S2 system was then subjected to MD simulations using NAMD 2.13. The model was first energy-minimized and then equilibrated with unbiased MD for ~23 ns. In Figure 1—figure supplement 2C we show the structure of the complex in the final frame of the MD trajectory. As can be seen from the figure, ergosterol-bound Lam4S2 is structurally similar to cholesterol-bound Lam4S2 from the ensemble of states representing Microstate 1. Although significantly longer and computationally expensive MD trajectories will need to be accumulated in order to simulate the full process of ergosterol release from the binding site, these results strongly indicate that the release mechanism for ergosterol will be the same as the one we describe for cholesterol.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The elegant simulations indicate that the first step in sterol egress is widening of the side-entrance (microstate 2 and 3) to allow more water molecules into the binding pocket. Presumably, this only happens when the Lam4S2/sterol binds to or is close to a membrane? What in the membrane-bound state mediates this widening? In other words, why doesn't the widening and water penetration occur when the Lam4S2 is in solution?</p></disp-quote><p>To address the questions posed, we quantified the energetics of cholesterol release from Lam4S2 in water, in the same way as we did for Lam4S2 in the presence of the membrane. Specifically, we calculated the potential of mean force (PMF) as a function of d<sub>z(chol-121)</sub> (z-directional distance between the cholesterol oxygen and C<sub>α</sub> of residue Q121) from umbrella sampling simulations in water. The resulting PMF (black trace, Figure 4—figure supplement 2A) is clearly different from the PMF that we calculated in the presence of the membrane (red trace, Figure 4—figure supplement 2A). Thus, we find that the energy difference between the bound and released states in water is &gt;10 kcal/mole which is a ~2-fold increase compared to the energy barrier for sterol release into the membrane. Furthermore, the PMF in water no longer has the secondary minimum (at ~12-14Å) that we observed in the PMF in the presence of the membrane. These major differences stem from the fact that during the egress process in the presence of the membrane, exposure of the hydrophobic tail of cholesterol to solvent is limited while this is clearly <italic>not</italic> the case when the sterol comes out into water (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B, left panels). Indeed, during egress from the Lam4S2 binding pocket in the presence of the membrane (as described in the original manuscript) the cholesterol tail becomes gradually encapsulated by the hydrophobic chains of neighboring lipids as it fully embeds into the lipid bilayer. In contrast, in water, cholesterol is released straight into the solvent, a process that is less energetically favorable as might be expected. Interestingly, the dynamics of the Ω<sub>1</sub> loop (quantified by d<sub>65</sub>-d<sub>169</sub> distance in Figure 4—figure supplement 2B, right panels) appear to be very similar in the two environments. These new computational results are included in the revised manuscript (Figure 4—figure supplement 2 and in the second paragraph of the subsection “K89A-Lam4S2 has a lower energy barrier for cholesterol release”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] I think the manuscript deserves to be published in eLife but with more experimental data to buttress the MD simulations.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the overall positive evaluation of our manuscript and for recognizing the value and quality of the computational studies presented in the paper. The revised manuscript contains substantial additional data, and we believe that these data together with our response to the specific points raised by all reviewers addresses the link between MD predictions and experimental validation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Stage 1 simulations identify two poses for LamS2 on a bilayer: one seems impossible due to steric constraints imposed by the N and C regions around the Starkin domain whilst the second one seems compatible. Functional assays suggest that a few residues found to insert in the membrane by MD are indeed key for membrane recognition. However, this does not tell that the selected orientation of Lam4S2 in MD is the genuine one. Authors should provide evidences on this as this orientation is the starting point for the analysis of sterol exit, thus of the rest of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We assume that by referring to the selected binding mode as “genuine” the reviewer questions whether Mode 2 identified from our computations is functionally important. The standard approach to establish the relevance of computational results is to use them to make testable predictions, and we have done this. Thus, we have identified residues (K163 and K167) that are important for Mode 2 binding (now illustrated in Figure 1—figure supplement 3A, B). Indeed, we showed previously that charge reversal mutation of these residues perturbs function, as the K163D/K167D double mutant is unable to transport sterol between vesicles (Jentsch et al., 2018). The reviewer suggests that these mutations may simply prevent membrane recognition/binding, and therefore do not speak specifically to the significance of Mode 2. To explore this further, we obtained new data (Figure 1—figure supplement 3C) showing that the K163D/K167D mutation does not eliminate membrane recognition as suggested by the reviewer. Instead, this mutant binds to membranes as well as the wild type protein. New simulations (Figure 1—figure supplement 3D/E) reveal that this mutant destabilizes Mode 2 binding while retaining Mode 1 binding. Given the loss-of-function phenotype of this double mutant, these new results support the physiological relevance of Mode 2 as well as our assertion that Mode 1 represents an artifactual and non-functional binding mode. With that, our new results provide additional consistency between simulation and experiments. An updated discussion of these issues is provided in the subsection “Lam4S2 associates with the membrane via its Ω1 loop and C-terminal helix”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- There is somehow a gap between MD and functional assays as there is no structural analysis in between. Indeed, there is no direct experiments to measure the accessibility of the binding pocket to water molecules in the presence/absence of the ligand and/or mutation – possibly, H-D exchange experiments by NMR using D2O could be useful in that respect.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer suggests H-D exchange to measure the accessibility of the binding pocket to water in the presence/absence of the ligand. It is not entirely clear what one might hope to learn from such measurements. Clearly, in the absence of ligand, the binding pocket is accessible to water (see our published apo crystal structure (Jentsch et al., 2018) as well as the water count in apo Lam4S2 simulations presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 3) and one would see significant H-D exchange. In the presence of ligand, the pocket would be protected to some extent from such exchange, but these observations would not fill the gap referred to by the reviewer as we have already observed the endpoints experimentally in crystal structures (apo protein and sterol-loaded protein). The requested experiments would most likely provide information that is redundant with the available structural information without lending new insights. To truly fill the gap between simulations and functional assays, one would need to monitor H-D exchange during cholesterol loading or unloading, and to correlate changes in exchange rates with the departure of sterol, but this would immensely difficult, if not outright impossible. Indeed, the strength and purpose of the MD simulations is to provide exactly this type of information since it is not readily obtainable experimentally.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also there is no assay to quantitatively measure the stability of sterol in Lam4S2 at equilibrium and/or its release in membrane. Osh3 and Osh4 were found to load DHE by measuring energy transfer between W residues, surrounding the pocket, and DHE (Tong et al., Structure. 2013, 21(7):1203-13; De Saint-Jean et a, J Cell Biol. 2011;195(6):965-78.). Offloading of DHE into membrane can be measured also by FRET in lipidic vesicles in real time. Authors should try such approaches that could more directly support MD simulations. Last they might use transport rates inferred from DHE transport assays with Lam4S2 to estimate an energy barrier for sterol extraction by the protein instead of quoting Dittman and Menon, 2017.</p></disp-quote><p>We make several points in our response to these comments from the reviewer.</p><p>First, we do indeed provide data on the 'stability' of sterol in Lam4S2. Using a standard assay in which protein is incubated with vesicles containing [<sup>3</sup>H]cholesterol, we obtain a stoichiometry (mol sterol/mol protein) at equilibrium of 0.11 ± 0.02 for Lam4S2 (see legend of Figure 6D) and 0.47 ± 0.20 (mean ± SD (n=7)) for Osh4 (data not included). The difference in equilibrium binding stoichiometries for the two proteins under our assay conditions is likely a reflection of their structural differences. The reviewer will appreciate that it is difficult to obtain KD values from such an assay, but it is clear that the relative K<sub>D</sub> of Lam4S2 and Osh4 for cholesterol is only a few-fold different.</p><p>Second, as noted by the reviewer, DHE loading into the sterol binding pocket of Osh and Lam proteins can be measured by FRET-mediated changes in the fluorescence of local tryptophan residues. The reviewer cited the Tong et al. paper in error: this paper reports that Osh3 does NOT bind sterol. However, Osh4 binds sterol and this has been demonstrated by many authors using different techniques (see results of our measurement above) included the DHE-based FRET assay. Previously, as well as in the revised manuscript, we used the DHE-based FRET assay to demonstrate sterol binding to Lam4S2 (Gatta et al., 2015; Figure 1—figure supplement 2B).</p><p>Third, we previously reported difficulties in fully loading DHE into Lam4S2 (Jentsch et al., 2018), despite the spectral change upon DHE binding that we (Gatta et al., 2015) observe in the FRET-based assay. The DHE assay has never been used to report a stoichiometry of binding as the spectra are difficult to deconvolute – the best use of the assay is to monitor changes in DHE environment as described in the paper of de Saint Jean et al., 2011. Because of the difficulty in quantitative sterol loading, we ultimately reported the crystal structure and NMR HSQC spectrum of protein loaded with 25HC (Jentsch et al., 2018).</p><p>Fourth, related to the previous point, the difficulty in quantitative loading makes the release assay suggested by the reviewer hard to interpret; indeed, it is not clear how such an assay can be used to support or evaluate the MD data as there would be no way to load the K89A mutant with sterol.</p><p>Fifth, we have taken the reviewer's suggestion to use rates from DHE transport assays to infer the energy barrier for sterol extraction. This information is presented in the third paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Authors should check at least that single-mutation K89A or S181A does not affect the membrane-binding ability of Lam4S2</p></disp-quote><p>We now include data to show that introduction of the point mutations (K89A or S181A) does not affect the ability of Lam4S2 to bind membranes. Thus, under our standard assay conditions the percentage of Lam4S2 bound to membranes is – WT 42 ± 7.2 (WT), 43 ± 3.0 (S181A), 49 ± 4.5 (K89A) (mean ± standard deviation (n=8)). This information is reported in the legend of Figure 6D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- it is quite surprising that 2 mutants out of 3 are not defective in yeast. In particular the D61A mutant do not phenocopy the K89A mutant, which is unexpected considering the existence of a electrostatic interaction with K89 and its central position in the triad of residues, making also contact with S181. Is there any explanation for this ?</p></disp-quote><p>To address the question, we carried out MD simulations of the D61A Lam4S2 mutant in which we specifically concentrated on how polar interactions with residue K89 are modified due to this mutation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, we find that in the wild type system, K89 mostly interacts with D61, while in the mutant protein the sidechain of K89 interacts instead with the carbonyl group of the adjacent N63. K89 can also interact with S181 as well as with water molecules, in both the WT and the D61A mutant. These results suggest that in the absence of the aspartic acid side chain at position 61, the dynamics of the binding site side-entrance are regulated by interactions between K89 and N63, resulting in wild type-like phenotype. While this argument is reasonable, it is speculative at this stage and more extensive computations will be needed to understand fully the functional mechanism of the D61A mutant. For this reason, we chose not to include this discussion and figure in the revised manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Snapshots of cholesterol-Lam4S2 complex from MD simulations of the wild type protein(left) and the D61A mutant (right), highlighting residue K89 and its interacting partners.</title><p>In the wild type system, K89 interacts with D61, whereas in the mutant it interacts with N63.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53444-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] I suggest addressing the following question in more detail: Sterol molecules are amphipathic.

Indeed, as we show in Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, the β strands that line the wall of the cavity contain multiple polar/charged residues (see green (polar), blue (positive), red (negative) colors). This includes the β4 strand that harbors Q121 which coordinates the sterol hydroxyl group in the X-ray structure of Lam4S2 and in our MD simulations. The sterol binding sites in other Lam/GramD1 domains have similarly strong polar characteristics. This finding supports our water-mediated mechanism of sterol release from these domains. This point is highlighted in the Introduction (last paragraph) as well as in Figure 1—figure supplement 1B as noted above.</p></body></sub-article></article>
