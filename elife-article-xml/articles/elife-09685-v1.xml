Here we show that dopamine, a positive reinforcement signal, can retroactively convert hippocampal timing-dependent synaptic depression into potentiation. This effect requires functional NMDA receptors and is mediated in part through the activation of the cAMP/PKA cascade. Collectively, our results support the idea that reward-related signaling can act on a pre-established synaptic eligibility trace, thereby associating specific experiences with behaviorally distant, rewarding outcomes. This finding identifies a biologically plausible mechanism for solving the ‘distal reward problem’.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09685.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09685.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09685.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To help someone learn a new task, we might give them a reward after they have performed well. However, these rewards tend to be given several seconds or minutes after the behavior they are supposed to promote. Therefore, it is unclear how the rewards affect the brain and help accelerate the learning process.</p><p>Information is processed and sent around the brain by networks of cells called neurons. These networks are constantly remodeled because learning changes the connections—called synapses—that neighboring neurons signal across. Synapses can be strengthened so that signals are sent across them more easily in the future. Synapses can also be weakened, making it harder for the neurons to subsequently communicate.</p><p>A chemical called dopamine is often produced in the brain when a reward is received. If dopamine is present in a synapse whilst a neuron is signaling to its neighbor, it can affect how effectively this communication occurs. Brzosko et al. have now investigated whether dopamine can also change the synapses if it is applied after signaling has already happened.</p><p>The strengthening or weakening of synapses can be triggered by electrically stimulating the neurons on either side of a synapse at particular times. Brzosko et al. did this to neurons in slices of mouse brain, and then applied dopamine to the neurons. The results suggest that dopamine can reverse synaptic weakening and can even cause the synapses to strengthen. However, the dopamine had to be applied immediately after stimulation to be able to strengthen the synapse. The next challenge is to establish whether this change in synaptic strength is responsible for the change in behavior.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09685.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09685.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>reward</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council (MRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brzosko</surname><given-names>Zuzanna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000735</institution-id><institution>University of Cambridge</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Student research support fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brzosko</surname><given-names>Zuzanna</given-names></name><name><surname>Schultz</surname><given-names>Wolfram</given-names></name><name><surname>Paulsen</surname><given-names>Ole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dopamine, a reward signal in the brain, can retroactively convert hippocampal synaptic depression into potentiation, suggesting an elegant biological solution to the distal reward problem.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a physiologically relevant form of Hebbian learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caporale and Dan, 2008</xref>). In its classic form, STDP depends on the order and precise timing of presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes: pre-before-post spike pairings induce timing-dependent long-term potentiation (t-LTP), whereas post-before-pre pairings induce timing-dependent long-term depression (t-LTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Markram et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bi and Poo, 1998</xref>). However, the quantitative rules of STDP are profoundly influenced by neuromodulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seol et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pawlak et al., 2010</xref>), including dopamine (DA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Edelmann and Lessmann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang and Dani, 2014</xref>). Although it is well established that reward-motivated behavior depends on the activity of DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Suri and Schultz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pan et al., 2005</xref>), the mechanisms that associate specific experiences with rewarding outcomes, which typically occur after a delay, are not well understood. This is referred to as the <italic>distal reward problem</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hull, 1943</xref>). To address this problem, here, we examined whether DA modulates STDP not only when applied during, but also—more importantly—when applied <italic>after</italic> the pairing event.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We first sought to corroborate the shape of the STDP induction curve by varying the time interval between the presynaptic and postsynaptic activity (Δt; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B,G</xref>). To this end, we monitored excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) that were evoked by extracellular stimulation of the Schaffer-collateral-CA1 pathway during whole-cell recordings of CA1 pyramidal cells in mouse horizontal slices (postnatal days 12–18; ‘Materials and methods’). Plasticity was induced in current clamp mode using an induction protocol that involved 100 pairings of a single EPSP followed by a single postsynaptic spike (t-LTP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) or a single postsynaptic spike followed by a single EPSP (t-LTD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) at 0.2 Hz. Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bi and Poo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Edelmann and Lessmann, 2011</xref>), the pre-before-post pairing protocol with Δt = +10 ms induced t-LTP (182 ± 14%; <italic>t</italic>(4) = 5.6, p = 0.0049 vs 100%, <italic>n</italic> = 5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and the post-before-pre pairing protocol with Δt = −20 ms induced t-LTD (61 ± 9%; <italic>t</italic>(4) = 4.4, p = 0.0121 vs 100%, <italic>n</italic> = 5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Surprisingly, however, we found that the post-before-pre pairing protocol with Δt = −10 ms instead of inducing t-LTD, elicited robust t-LTP (202 ± 21%; <italic>t</italic>(6) = 5.0, p = 0.0025 vs 100%, <italic>n</italic> = 7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D,G</xref>). This conflicts with previous reports from hippocampal cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bi and Poo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>) and acute slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Edelmann and Lessmann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang and Dani, 2014</xref>), where post-before-pre pairing protocols never elicited synaptic potentiation in baseline conditions. Given that DA has been found to widen the time window for the induction of t-LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang and Dani, 2014</xref>), we wanted to assess whether endogenous DA could be responsible for the potentiation observed with the post-before-pre pairing under our experimental conditions. Therefore, we repeated this set of experiments using the post-before-pre pairing protocol with Δt = −10 ms in the presence of DA receptor (DAR) antagonists. Indeed, combined application of the D1/D5 receptor antagonist SCH23390 (10 μM) and D2-like receptor antagonist sulpiride (50 μM) from the start of the recordings prevented t-LTP and enabled t-LTD instead (72 ± 8%; <italic>t</italic>(5) = 3.6, p = 0.0160 vs 100%, <italic>n</italic> = 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D,G</xref>), rendering the STDP induction curve similar to that observed in hippocampal cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bi and Poo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>).

Indeed, the post-before-pre pairing protocol with Δt = −20 ms, which elicited robust t-LTD in control condition (74 ± 9%, <italic>t</italic>(8) = 3.0, p = 0.0165 vs 100%, <italic>n</italic> = 9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>), induced significant t-LTP when exogenous DA (20 μM) was bath-applied for 10–12 min from 2 min before and during the post-before-pre pairings in interleaved experiments (144 ± 12%; <italic>t</italic>(5) = 3.7, p = 0.0148 vs 100%, <italic>n</italic> = 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>). Therefore, in accordance with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang and Dani, 2014</xref>), the presence of DA during the coordinated spiking activity widens the spike time interval for induction of t-LTP.</p><p>A crucial aspect of reinforcement learning models is the ability of the reinforcing signal (DA) to strengthen active synapses, even when it arrives after the activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sutton and Barto, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Izhikevich, 2007</xref>). To test this hypothesis experimentally, we applied DA <italic>after</italic> the t-LTD induction protocol. Exogenous DA (100 μM) added to the perfusion system for 10–12 min starting within 1 min after the post-before-pre pairing protocol with Δt = −20 ms converted t-LTD into t-LTP (169 ± 16%, <italic>t</italic>(5) = 4.3, p = 0.0078 vs 100%, <italic>n</italic> = 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). This implies that DA can have a retroactive effect allowing negative spike pairings to induce t-LTP. The specificity of this DAergic conversion of STDP was assessed using DAR antagonists. Indeed, combined application of DAR antagonists, SCH23390 (10 μM) and sulpiride (50 μM), prevented DA-induced conversion of t-LTD into t-LTP, resulting in significant t-LTD instead (63 ± 12%, <italic>t</italic>(5) = 3.0, p = 0.0289 vs 100%, <italic>n</italic> = 6, Δt = −20 ms). Thus, the conversion of t-LTD into t-LTP was due to specific DAR activation. Importantly, when the test pathway was not stimulated following the pairing protocol until after DA washout (stimulation resumed 15 min after pairing), robust t-LTD was induced (61 ± 5%, <italic>t</italic>(5) = 8.1, p = 0.0005 vs 100%, <italic>n</italic> = 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). The effect of DA was, therefore, activity dependent, demonstrating that the reinforcing signal is capable of acting specifically on the active inputs. To exclude the possibility that DA by itself could potentiate the test pathway, control experiments with ongoing synaptic stimulation over 60 min at 0.2 Hz, but without pairing with postsynaptic action potentials, were performed. Consistent with earlier reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Otmakhova and Lisman, 1999</xref>), DA had no significant effect on the basal Schaffer-collateral transmission (110 ± 7%, <italic>t</italic>(7) = 1.4, p = 0.2169 vs 100%, <italic>n</italic> = 8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09685.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Dopamine retroactively converts t-LTD into t-LTP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) DA applied immediately after the pairing protocol with Δt = −20 ms converted t-LTD into t-LTP (+Pairing +Stim; red).

Application of the NMDA receptor antagonist <sc>d</sc>-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (<sc>d</sc>-AP5, 50 μM) after the post-before-pre pairing protocol did not by itself affect the development of t-LTD (57 ± 12%, <italic>t</italic>(5) = 3.6, p = 0.0156 vs 100%, <italic>n</italic> = 6, Δt = −20 ms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,D</xref>). Nevertheless, DA in the presence of <sc>d</sc>-AP5 reversed t-LTD back to baseline albeit failing to convert t-LTD into t-LTP (105 ± 12%, <italic>t</italic>(5) = 0.4, p = 0.6898 vs 100%, <italic>n</italic> = 6, Δt = −20 ms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,D</xref>). This suggests an important dissociation between two mechanisms involved in the DA-induced conversion of t-LTD into t-LTD, namely a reversal of synaptic depression (de-depression) and synaptic potentiation, one of which is NMDA receptor dependent.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09685.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Cellular mechanisms involved in the DA-induced conversion of t-LTD into t-LTP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) DA applied immediately after the pairing protocol (Δt = −20 ms) converted t-LTD into t-LTP (red; data combined from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2A, 3A</xref>).

Even though combined application of D1-like and D2-like receptor antagonist completely blocked the DA effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,D</xref>), application of either D1-like or D2-like receptor antagonist alone only partially prevented the conversion of t-LTD into t-LTP (SCH 23390: 131 ± 16%; <italic>t</italic>(6) = 1.4, p = 0.0113 vs DA (t-LTP); <italic>t</italic>(6) = 3.6, p = 0.2277 vs control (t-LTD); <italic>t</italic>(6) = 1.9, p = 0.0994 vs 100%; <italic>n</italic> = 7. Sulpiride: 94 ± 13%; <italic>t</italic>(6) = 3.2, p = 0.0228 vs DA (t-LTP); <italic>t</italic>(6) = 1.5, p = 0.1932 vs control (t-LTD); <italic>t</italic>(6) = 0.5, p = 0.6435 vs 100%; <italic>n</italic> = 7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). This suggests that both receptor subtypes might mediate the retroactive effect of DA on STDP. Given the astounding complexity of D2-like receptor pharmacology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Neve et al., 2004</xref>), we first wanted to evaluate the possible involvement of D1-like receptor-activated cAMP/PKA signaling cascade in the DA-induced conversion of t-LTD into t-LTP. D1/D5 receptor stimulation leads to the activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC) and subsequent increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and protein kinase A (PKA) activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greengard et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Neve et al., 2004</xref>). We found that the general AC activator, forskolin (50 μM), applied for 10–12 min immediately after the pairing protocol with Δt = −20 ms resulted in robust conversion of t-LTD into t-LTP (167 ± 17%, <italic>t</italic>(6) = 3.9, p = 0.0078 vs 100%, <italic>n</italic> = 7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,D</xref>). Notably, forskolin (50 μM) applied in the absence of the pairing protocol had no significant effect on baseline EPSPs (83 ± 12%, <italic>t</italic>(6) = 1.4, p = 0.2046 vs 100%, <italic>n</italic> = 7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The forskolin-induced conversion of t-LTD into t-LTP was also NMDA receptor dependent since bath application of <sc>d</sc>-AP5 (50 μM) 1 min before forskolin treatment prevented synaptic potentiation from developing, although synaptic depression was reversed (102 ± 11%, <italic>t</italic>(5) = 0.2, p = 0.8616 vs 100%, <italic>n</italic> = 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,D</xref>). This result suggests that the cAMP cascade works either upstream of or in parallel to NMDA receptor activation for the development of potentiation to occur. Downstream of cAMP, PKA is involved because the PKA inhibitor, H-89 (20 µM), blocked the DA-induced conversion of t-LTD into t-LTP, revealing significant t-LTD (76 ± 5%, <italic>t</italic>(6) = 5.0, p = 0.0025 vs 100%, <italic>n</italic> = 7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). Taken together, these results imply that the DA-induced conversion of t-LTD into t-LTP involves activation of the cAMP/PKA signaling cascade, which closely mimics the effects of DA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> vs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Although, D2-like receptors are typically associated with the inhibition of AC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Neve et al., 2004</xref>), interestingly, there is also evidence that D2-like receptor stimulation can potentiate AC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glass and Felder, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Watts and Neve, 1997</xref>). Therefore, while the possibility that D2-like receptors contribute to the conversion of t-LTD into t-LTP via a different signaling cascade cannot be excluded, it is tempting to suggest that the DA-induced conversion of t-LTD into t-LTP is mediated primarily via the cAMP/PKA pathway. Hence, based on our results, we propose that the stimulation of postsynaptic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5ai</xref>) or presynaptic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5aii</xref>) DARs activates the cAMP/PKA pathway, which—via two cellular mechanisms (de-depression and potentiation)—leads to the retroactive conversion of t-LTD into t-LTP.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09685.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Proposed mechanisms underlying the DA-induced conversion of t-LTD into t-LTP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram depicting core components of the proposed cellular mechanisms underlying the DA-induced conversion of t-LTD into t-LTP (de-depression and potentiation).

On one hand, it has been argued that noradrenergic terminals from the locus coeruleus, which mediates arousal and the optimization of behavioral performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chamberlain and Robbins, 2013</xref>), may provide a major source of DA release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Smith and Greene, 2012</xref>). On the other hand, hippocampal pyramidal cell assemblies are directly affected by concurrent activity in midbrain DAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McNamara et al., 2014</xref>), which have been linked to reward-seeking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>) and appetitive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mirenowicz and Schultz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fiorillo et al., 2013</xref>).

While this narrow temporal detection window may be important in the striatum, it cannot account for the experimental evidence from behavioral studies of response acquisition with an extended reinforcement delay in rats and pigeons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lattal and Gleeson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sutphin et al., 1998</xref>), rhesus monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Galuska and Woods, 2005</xref>), and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Okouchi, 2009</xref>). Meanwhile, our finding demonstrates that DA can modulate STDP in the CA1 with a reinforcement delay of at least 1 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Such extended reinforcement delay is likely to be particularly important in hippocampus-dependent learning during spatial exploration.</p><p>In conclusion, our work demonstrates a retroactive effect of DA on STDP—converting t-LTD into t-LTP. This effect is mediated at least in part through the activation of the cAMP/PKA cascade and requires the activation of synaptic NMDA receptors. This in turn suggests that the conversion can only occur at synapses that are re-activated following the initial pairing event. Interestingly, it has been reported that hippocampal reactivation events (sharp wave ripples) increase in frequency following reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Singer and Frank, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atherton et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, in behaving animals, the conditions for the conversion of depression into potentiation might occur during reward-related sharp wave ripple activity.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. One of the reviewers, Guoqiang Bi, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>All three reviewers viewed the study as valuable for the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. The main observation that spike-time dependent LTD can be converted into LTP upon DA release 10 min after the initial LTP-pairing protocol, was viewed as interesting. However, major criticism was formulated in relation to the missing explanation on how the timing of bath-applied DA may relate to reward-based conditioning. The reviewers asked for diagrams describing the timing issues, in particular the possible linkages between the cAMP pathway and its relation to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling caused by action potentials and NMDAR activation. A stronger discussion of the data with existing literature is necessary. Moreover, one reviewer asked for additional experiments in which SCH23390 and sulpiride are separately applied. The reviewers were also curious for your thoughts about how the possible cAMP/PKA-mediated mechanism could be linked to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, NMDA receptor activation and finally the switch from LTD to LTP. The specific comments of the reviewers are attached below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The study by the Paulsen's group shows nicely that spike-time dependent LTD can be converted into LTP upon DA release 10 min after the initial LTP-pairing protocol. They propose and show good experimental evidence for their hypothesis that this is caused by activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway plus activation of NMDARs. The data fit very well with a recent study from McNamara et al. (Nature Neuroscience, 2014) showing that DA improves reactivation of cell assemblies in CA1 and memory persistence. I have mild concerns regarding the precise timing of bath-applied drugs in the bath. How fast does the drug get to the DA receptors located at the recorded cell? This is important in defining the time window during which the DA effect can take place and induce the observed conversion of synaptic plasticity. The difference in the finding presented here to the one by the McNamara group should be emphasized.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This study by Brzosko et al. addressed how dopamine (DA) retroactively regulates spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) in order to account for the distal reward problem, where rewards promote learning of experiences preceding rewards. The main result is that DA applied after the delivery of the post-before-pre pairing protocol converted LTD into LTP.</p><p>1) DA was bath applied for 10-12 min starting within 1 min after the delivery of the post-before-pre pairing protocol, which took ∼8 min. It is not clear how this relates to behaviorally relevant timing during reward-based conditioning, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schultz, Dayan and Montague (1997)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Suri and Schultz (1999)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pan, Schmidt, Wickens and Hyland (2005)</xref>. Furthermore, how does the millisecond order timing dependence in STDP relate to the second order timing dependence during reward-based learning (for example, see Drew and Abbott, PNAS, 2006, “Extending the effects of spike-timing-dependent plasticity to behavioral timescales”)? A schematic diagram on this timing issue (from millisecond to second to min in the current study) should be provided to account for the behavioral relevance.</p><p>2) In terms of the cellular mechanism, it is not clear how DA-induced activation of cAMP/PKA pathway relates to Ca signals caused by spikes and NMDA receptor activation. A schematic diagram describing the possible linkage should be provided with the timing diagram mentioned above. The authors may want to compare their data with a recent paper that addressed this issue on DA/spike timing dependent plasticity of dendritic spines (Yagishita et al., Science, 2015, A critical time window for dopamine actions on the structural plasticity of dendritic spines).</p><p>3) In the bar graphs, it is not clear what the significance mark on each bar means. I do understand the significance marks between bars.</p><p>4) It should be stated if any of the treatments (plasticity induction, DA/forskolin application, etc.) affected the amount of current necessary to hold the membrane potential at -70 mV, preferably with actual data.</p><p>5) According to the description in the Results section, LTP induced with -10 ms post-before-pre timing was “surprising”. This effect is ascribed to the release of endogenous DA by the stimulating electrode. It should be discussed in further detail how this observation compares to previous studies in brain slices and cultures.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors investigated the temporal specificity of dopaminergic modulation of STDP. They found that dopamine application within 10 minutes after STDP pairing could retroactively convert t-LTD into t-LTP. This conversion is apparently mediated by cAMP/PKA signaling, and requires synaptic activation as well as functional NMDA receptors. Together, the results provide an elegant cellular mechanism for the delayed effect of dopamine in reinforcement learning.</p><p>Overall I think the experiments were well designed and carried out. The results are important and intriguing, and should be of interests for both cellular and systems neuroscientists. I do have several questions:</p><p>1) Throughout the study, the authors used combined SCH23390+sulpiride to block both D1/D5-like receptors and D2-like receptors. Can the authors test differential roles of the two receptor types in STDP conversion by using the two antagonists separately, as has been done in previous studies?</p><p>2) Regarding the cellular signaling mechanisms, the authors argue that since AP-5 blocks the effect of DA and forskolin in t-LTD/LTP conversion, the cAMP/PKA signaling works either upstream of, or in parallel to NMDA receptor activation. Can the authors further allude to a potential mechanism(s) how such signaling interaction could happen?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09685.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>The study by the Paulsen's group shows nicely that spike-time dependent LTD can be converted into LTP upon DA release 10 min after the initial LTP-pairing protocol.

It should be discussed in further detail how this observation compares to previous studies in brain slices and cultures.</italic></p><p>In view of the conventional presentation of STDP, we found this finding surprising. We now explicitly state that “This conflicts with previous reports from hippocampal cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bi and Poo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang, Lau and Bi, 2009</xref>) and acute slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Edelmann and Lessmann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang and Dani, 2014</xref>), where post-before-pre pairing protocols never elicited synaptic potentiation in baseline condition.”</p><p>However, it has been shown earlier that DA widens the time window for the induction of t-LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang, Lau and Bi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang and Dani, 2014</xref>), and this has now been discussed in the same paragraph.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>1) Throughout the study, the authors used combined SCH23390+sulpiride to block both D1/D5-like receptors and D2-like receptors. Can the authors test differential roles of the two receptor types in STDP conversion by using the two antagonists separately, as has been done in previous studies?</italic></p><p>In response to this comment, we have carried out a new set of experiments, applying D1-like or D2-like receptor antagonist separately. Even though combined application of D1-like and D2-like receptor antagonist completely blocked the DA effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1A, D</xref>), application of either D1-like or D2-like receptor antagonist alone only partially prevented the conversion of t-LTD into t-LTP (SCH 23390: 131 ± 16%; <italic>t</italic>(6) = 1.4, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0113 vs. DA (t-LTP); <italic>t</italic>(6) = 3.6, <italic>P</italic> = 0.2277 vs. control (t-LTD); <italic>t</italic>(6) = 1.9, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0994 vs. 100%; <italic>n</italic> = 7. Sulpiride: 94 ± 13%; <italic>t</italic>(6) = 3.2, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0228 vs. DA (t-LTP); <italic>t</italic>(6) = 1.5, <italic>P</italic> = 0.1932 vs. control (t-LTD); <italic>t</italic>(6) = 0.5, <italic>P</italic> = 0.6435 vs. 100%; <italic>n</italic> = 7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1B-D</xref>). This suggests that both receptor sub-types might mediate the retroactive effect of DA on STDP. This is now reported in the text (in the sixth paragraph of the Results and Discussion section), and presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>We further discuss the implications of this in the same paragraph as follows: “D1/D5-receptor stimulation leads to the activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC) and subsequent increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) […] to the retroactive conversion of t-LTD into t-LTP.”</p><p><italic>2) Regarding the cellular signaling mechanisms, the authors argues that since AP-5 blocks the effect of DA and forskolin in t-LTD/LTP conversion, the cAMP/PKA signaling works either upstream of, or in parallel to NMDA receptor activation. Can the authors further allude to a potential mechanism(s) how such signaling interaction could happen?</italic></p><p>Please see the response to Reviewer 2, point 1 above.</p><p>Additional changes to the manuscript:</p><p>To clarify the presentation in accordance to the reviewers’ comments, we have also updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and expanded and moved Figure 2–figure supplement 1 to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
