Although active cell-in-cell invasion depends on RhoA and actin, the precise mechanism as well as the underlying actin structures and assembly factors driving the process are unknown. Furthermore, whether specific cell surface receptors trigger entotic invasion in a signal-dependent fashion has not been investigated. In this study, we identify the G-protein-coupled LPA receptor 2 (LPAR2) as a signal transducer specifically required for the actively invading cell during entosis. We find that G<sub>12/13</sub> and PDZ-RhoGEF are required for entotic invasion, which is driven by blebbing and a uropod-like actin structure at the rear of the invading cell. Finally, we provide evidence for an involvement of the RhoA-regulated formin Dia1 for entosis downstream of LPAR2. Thus, we delineate a signaling process that regulates actin dynamics during cell-in-cell invasion.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02786.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02786.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02786.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Entosis is the invasion of one cell by another and can be observed in aggressive cancers. Although the invading cell is usually killed, the surviving cell is sometimes left with the wrong number of chromosomes. This suggests that entosis may help cancer to progress because cells with an abnormal number of chromosomes are common in cancers.</p><p>For entosis to occur, the invading cell must be released from the tissue that surrounds it, so it can move towards and attach to the cell it is about to invade. Very little is currently known about the cellular and molecular events that enable these processes to occur.</p><p>Purvanov et al. studied entosis in cells grown in the laboratory and observed that invading cells produce bulges and projections at their rear end for invasion. These projections contain a protein called mDia1. This protein is involved in controlling the growth of the cytoskeleton—the structure that helps cells to both maintain their shape and to move.</p><p>Adding the signaling molecule lysophosphatidic acid, which is present in human serum, increased the likelihood that cells would invade others. From this, Purvanov et al. established the identities of the proteins involved in transmitting the lysophosphatidic acid signal that controls mDia1 activity during entosis. Changes to this signaling pathway have been associated with cancer and how it spreads between different organs and its involvement in entosis lends further support to the notion that there may be a link between cell-in-cell invasion and the advancement of cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02786.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02786.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>cell-in-cell invasion</kwd><kwd>entosis</kwd><kwd>actin dynamic</kwd><kwd>blebbing</kwd><kwd>GPCR, LPA-receptor</kwd><kwd>mDia1 formin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 593, SFB-TR17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grosse</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Deutsche Krebshilfe e.V.</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>110405</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holst</surname><given-names>Manuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>siRNA knockdown experiments reveal in detail the signaling pathway that controls cytoskeletal function during cell-in-cell invasion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Entosis has been described as a specialized form of homotypic cell-in-cell invasion in which one cell actively crawls into another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Overholtzer et al., 2007</xref>). Frequently, this occurs between tumor cells such as breast, cervical, or colon carcinoma cells and can be triggered by matrix detachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Overholtzer et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that loss of integrin-mediated adhesion may promote cell-in-cell invasion. This is further supported by the fact that homotypic cell-in-cell structures can be regularly found when tumor cells are released into fluid exudates such as ascites or during pleural carcinosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Overholtzer and Brugge, 2008</xref>). Although the consequence of entotic invasion is not well understood, the process may contribute to tumor progression by inducing aneuploidy in human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Krajcovic et al., 2011</xref>). The ultimate outcome of an entotic event also depends on the fate of the invaded cell, which can remain viable or even divide inside or escape from the host cell or undergo vacuolar degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Florey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Krajcovic et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>It was previously shown that for a cell to invade into a neighboring cell Rho-dependent signaling and actin are required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Overholtzer et al., 2007</xref>). However, potential extracellular ligands or cell surface receptors involved in this migratory process are entirely unknown. Furthermore, what type of actin structures and which actin polymerization factor triggers active cell-in-cell invasion in a signal-regulated fashion remained unclear. In this study, we investigated actin-mediated entotic invasion and delineate a signaling pathway downstream of the LPAR2 that ultimately targets the formin mDia1 for polarized actin assembly at the rear of the invading cell to drive cell-in-cell invasion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Plasma membrane blebbing followed by actin assembly at the rear mediates entotic invasion</title><p>To monitor actin assembly during life cell-in-cell invasion over time, we generated MCF10A cells expressing either mCherry- or GFP-LifeAct. Red and green LifeAct-cell populations were mixed and plated on top of polyHEMA-coated coverslips to prevent matrix adhesion and to induce entotic incidences. Under these conditions, cell-in-cell invasion was confirmed to require ROCK as assessed using the ROCK-inhibitor Y-27632 (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Overholtzer et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, imaging LifeAct-expressing cells over time, we consistently observed that specifically the actively invading cell displayed extensive blebbing early on during invasion followed by the formation of an actin-rich uropod-like structure at the rear of the invading cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Plasma membrane blebbing was highly dynamic under these cell culture conditions with a bleb cycle lasting about 2 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>) and the total number of blebs ranged from 60 to 100 blebs per cell depending on the MCF10A cell size.

A ligand known to be present at micromolar concentrations in FCS is lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Thus, we speculated that LPA might trigger entosis. Indeed, under serum-free conditions addition of LPA efficiently stimulated entotic events of MCF10A cells in a concentration-dependent manner already at nanomolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This ligand mediated cell-in-cell invasion was dependent on cell surface receptor activity since the LPA-receptor 1, 2 and 3 inhibitor Ki16425 completely blocked LPA-stimulated entosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

One phenotypic hallmark characterizing the host cell from the invading cell during cell-in-cell invasion is the typically half-moon-shaped nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Overholtzer and Brugge, 2008</xref>). Examination of entotic events using confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that only cells silenced for LPAR2 failed to actively invade into another, while LPAR2 suppression did not inhibit the host cell during this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Notably, transient expression of LPAR2 in HEK293 cells significantly triggered entotic invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that disease-associated overexpression or upregulation of LPAR2 as observed in various human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Goetzl et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kitayama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Yun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Wang et al., 2007</xref>) may be instrumental for entosis.</p><p>Next, we assessed the endogenous localization of LPAR2 in entotic cells using immunofluorescence microscopy.

Therefore, we used siRNA to suppress each of the three RhoGEFs in cells. Interestingly, siRNA-mediated knock-down of PDZ-RhoGEF specifically inhibited entotic events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Furthermore, analyzing ectopically expressed GFP-PDZ-RhoGEF during cell-in-cell invasion revealed a strikingly polarized distribution to the invading cell rear where it strongly colocalized with F-actin as determined by LifeAct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Similar observations were made by staining for phosphorylated myosin-light-chain II (pMLC2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), a downstream target of the Rho-ROCK pathway, in agreement with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Wan et al., 2012</xref>).

We have shown previously that bleb-associated cancer cell invasion through collagen matrices requires the activity of the Diaphanous formin mDia1 downstream of RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kitzing et al., 2007</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that the actin nucleation factor mDia1 may also be involved in entotic invasion. Interestingly, we found endogenous mDia1 to be enriched at the cell rear of the invading cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting that mDia1 function spatially controls entosis. Indeed, ectopically expressed mDia1-GFP was localized to the actin-rich cup formed in HEK293 cells upon LPAR2 transfection to trigger entotic invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

It is tempting to speculate that such active invasive and complex process may result in some survival advantage or even represent an escape mechanism for carcinoma cells, although often the inner cell undergoes a cell death process involving components of the autophagy machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Florey et al., 2011</xref>). In this study, we report on a cell surface receptor pathway that facilitates active invasion to produce a cell-in-cell structure. Interestingly, some of these components such as RhoA and mDia1 have been shown to function during rounded cancer cell invasion, which is similarly accompanied by cell blebbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Sanz-Moreno and Marshall, 2010</xref>), although this processes can still depend on integrin-based matrix adhesions. Our findings suggest that entotic invasion, although independent of integrins, resembles at least in some aspects that of amoeboid and bleb-dependent motility. Indeed, actin filaments also coincide at the Ezrin-rich uropod in amoeboid blebbing thereby pushing cells through collagen-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lorentzen et al., 2011</xref>) and ezrin is further an essential component for non-apoptotic blebbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Charras et al., 2006</xref>). It seems reasonably that Ezrin is potentially also required for entosis as we observed strong Ezrin localization at the invading cell uropod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), however, its precise role and regulation in this process remains a future task for investigations. The relevance of entosis for tumor progression in vivo is currently unclear. Nevertheless, our data uncover LPA and LPAR2 as important drivers of entotic invasion, both of which are also important factors during cancer metastasis, suggesting that entosis may be a phenomenon associated with advanced malignancy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Materials</title><p>All cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection.

While the phenomenon itself is well-described, and a role for actin and autophagy has been shown to be important for events after engulfment, little is known about the receptor(s) that recognize cells for entosis. They noted that you describe the identification for a receptor and downstream pathway for entosis. You identify a requirement for LPA, and this led them to identify, by siRNA and ectopic expression, the G-protein coupled receptor LPAR2 as the critical receptor. You go on to show that the downstream pathway involves G12/13 family GPCRs, PDZ-RhoGEF and mDia1 that induce actin remodeling in the rear uropod of the engulfing cell.</p><p>The 3 reviewers found the work interesting and potentially important. However, all raised important questions about the relationship(s) between blebbing, RhoA signaling, mDia1 function, trailing uropod formation/function and entosis. These concerns will need further work and, if completed, another round of consultation. The major concerns are summarized below:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> shows the effect of the LPAR inhibitor Ki16425 in the presence of added LPA, but this should also be tested in the presence of serum to show that the LPAR/LPA link is the “only” critical component in whole serum as well.</p><p>2) An increase in blebbing in the invading cells is mentioned throughout in the manuscript, and is used as a rationale for examining mDia1. The blebbing phenotype should be better characterized (number of blebs/membrane protrusions over time, changes in ERM protein expression/localization, etc.), and it would be important to test whether inhibiting signaling and knockdown of actin regulatory protein (particularly PDZ-RhoGEF and mDia1) affect entosis-associated blebbing.</p><p>3) What is the role of the uropod in entosis? Is it required for entosis, or is it a by-product of the entosis process? Linking the role of the uropod and the Rho/mDia1 signaling pathway could be addressed by testing whether inhibition of mDia1 (or RhoA signaling) blocks uropod formation and either the initiation of entosis (i.e., LPAR localization and binding to the recipient cell) or the final stage(s) of engulfment.</p><p>4) Is the localization of LPAR to the uropod dependent on an intact actin cytoskeleton, and is its distribution affected by the knockdown of expression of G12/13, RhoGEF or mDia1, or inhibition of ROCK? This information is important in the context of showing whether LPAR localization is independent or dependent of downstream effectors and actin organization.</p><p>5) Roles for Gα12/13 and PDZ-RhoGEF in entosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) are intriguing, but more work is needed to rigorously establish whether this leads to Rho activation. Activation could be measured using a Rho FRET sensor, and tested if and where RhoA is active at sites of entosis under both activating (LPA addition, LPAR overexpression, Gα12QL) and inhibiting (siRNA knockdown of Gα12/13, PDZ-RhoGEF) conditions.</p><p>6) The cellular localization of mDia1, both endogenous and GFP-tagged, appears cytoplasmic in the invading cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and it is difficult to see the enrichment in the trailing uropod as the authors claim: for example, mDia1 appears to be excluded from the F-actin rich band in the trailing uropod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The effects of mDia1 knockdown on actin cytoskeleton and membrane blebbing should be quantitatively analyzed to test whether mDia1 is inducing these changes.</p><p>Other concerns:</p><p>1) The percent knockdown of different LPAR isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), GPCR isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), RhoGEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and mDia1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) should be shown by western blot so that the conclusion that one isoform is required and not others is based on equal degrees of loss expression.</p><p>2) It should be clearly stated in the text that localization of specific proteins (e.g. mDia in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) is by monitoring ectopically-expressed, GFP-labeled fusion proteins.</p><p>3) Statistical analysis:</p><p>- Student's t-test should only be employed when 2 conditions are being compared (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Where there are more than 2 groups, appropriate tests (e.g. one-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc test) should be used.</p><p>- Wherever possible, the true variance of the control group (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) should be included, even when normalized to 100%. Including the variance would allow for robust statistical analysis, which currently is not the case since the variance has been removed.</p><p>- The number of replicates should be listed in the figure legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, and statistics provided for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>.</p><p>4) The LPAR localization studies would benefit from the inclusion of general membrane and cytoplasmic markers (e.g. membrane-targeted and cytoplasmic GFP). This would help to demonstrate that LPAR2 is indeed clustered at the trailing edge. Examining the localization another LPAR (4 or 5) would be useful to show specificity of LPAR1 localization.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02786.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1D</italic></xref> <italic>shows the effect of the LPAR inhibitor Ki16425 in the presence of added LPA, but this should also be tested in the presence of serum to show that the LPAR/LPA link is the “only” critical component in whole serum as well</italic>.</p><p>We agree that this is an important point that we have previously overlooked and have performed the suggested experiments now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, showing a strong and significant requirement for LPAR also under serum-induced entosis.</p><p><italic>2) An increase in blebbing in the invading cells is mentioned throughout in the manuscript, and is used as a rationale for examining mDia1. The blebbing phenotype should be better characterized (number of blebs/membrane protrusions over time, changes in ERM protein expression/localization, etc.), and it would be important to test whether inhibiting signaling and knockdown of actin regulatory protein (particularly PDZ-RhoGEF and mDia1) affect entosis-associated blebbing</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers rightly point out that blebbing in the invading cell is observed and described throughout the manuscript but may have been less well characterized in the previous version. We thank the reviewers for these comments in particular as the blebbing activity observed here occurs under integrin-independent cell culture conditions and we have made efforts to address these issues with further experiments. We now provide data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> on the bleb dynamics as requested (see also <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). The average number of blebs per cell is now mentioned in the text. We have further, as requested, examined Ezrin (ERM) expression/localization and blebbing after knockdown of the actin-regulatory protein mDia1 and found that overall Ezrin expression appears to be unaffected, however, blebbing and hence Ezrin localization is severely inhibited and disturbed in mDia1 knockdown cells. These data are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> C, D, E, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3 media4">Videos 3 and 4</xref>.</p><p>Together these data show that mDia1 is essential for proper and productive blebbing and that the blebbing of the invading cell is in fact required for the invasion process. Thus, if blebbing is perturbed no entotic invasion can occur and hence no uropod can be formed by the invading cell later in the process.</p><p><italic>3) What is the role of the uropod in entosis? Is it required for entosis, or is it a by-product of the entosis process? Linking the role of the uropod and the Rho/mDia1 signaling pathway could be addressed by testing whether inhibition of mDia1 (or RhoA signaling) blocks uropod formation and either the initiation of entosis (i.e., LPAR localization and binding to the recipient cell) or the final stage(s) of engulfment</italic>.</p><p>We agree that these are exciting questions. As mentioned above in point 2, we cannot address the requirement of Rho/mDia1 for uropod formation since inhibition of these factors interferes with blebbing and entotic invasion or intitiation early on before uropod formation during later stages of entosis. Thus, these factos are also required for bleb-associated initiation of entosis as also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>), which illustrates that si-mDia1 (red) treated cells do not invade although they still make contacts to a neighboring cell, which becomes entosed by a control cell (green). Thus it seems that the entire actin-driven processes is under the control of the Rho/mDia1 pathway such as blebbing for initiation and completion of entotic invasion. Along these lines, it can be noted that the actin-rich uropod-like structure is also actively blebbing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig4">Figure 1A, 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2 media4">Video 2 and 4</xref>). Furthermore, we do find good accumulation of endogenous or mDia1-GFP specifically in the invading cell rear <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>.</p><p>In addition, we find strong signal accumulation of p-MLC2 at the actin rich cup/uropod, clearly indicating that polarized Rho-actin signalling is occurring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>). This supports a model in which this trailing actin structure provides Rho/actin-dependent force to push the remaining cell body inside the other. In fact, when we add LatB just before completion of entosis we halt invasion due to cortical actin relaxation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref> from time frame 104 minutes).</p><p>Thus, although we cannot instantly inhibit specifically Rho or mDia1 late during entotic uropod formation at present (efforts trying to add the generic and unspecific formin inhibitor smiFH2 have failed at least in our hands) our overall data support the notion that the uropod-like structure is necessary for completion of entotic invasion.</p><p><italic>4) Is the localization of LPAR to the uropod dependent on an intact actin cytoskeleton, and is its distribution affected by the knockdown of expression of G12/13, RhoGEF or mDia1, or inhibition of ROCK? This information is important in the context of showing whether LPAR localization is independent or dependent of downstream effectors and actin organization</italic>.</p><p>We have addressed this by studying the localization of Flag-LPAR2 during entosis after addition of Latrunculin B (5 minutes before fixation) to dissolve the F-actin cytoskeleton during late entotic invasion and observed that LPAR polarization to the cell rear is independent of downstream actin organization despite profound perturbation of the cortical actin cytoskeleton (now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, lower panel).</p><p><italic>5) Roles for Gα12/13 and PDZ-RhoGEF in entosis (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>) are intriguing, but more work is needed to rigorously establish whether this leads to Rho activation. Activation could be measured using a Rho FRET sensor, and tested if and where RhoA is active at sites of entosis under both activating (LPA addition, LPAR overexpression, Gα12QL) and inhibiting (siRNA knockdown of Gα12/13, PDZ-RhoGEF) conditions</italic>.</p><p>We regret that we are at present unable to perform the requested experiments using a Rho-FRET sensor since the establishment of such more complex assay in an already difficult to study cell system such as entosis, including that we have no experience with FRET in our lab so far, would take us very likely more than 6 month with an unclear success outcome. We can only say that we will try to establish this procedure in the future, as these are certainly relevant aspects. Nevertheless, we performed phospho-myosin light chain 2 (p-MLC2) stainings and find that p-MLC2 appears to be strongly enriched at the actin-rich cup now shown as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>6) The cellular localization of mDia1, both endogenous and GFP-tagged, appears cytoplasmic in the invading cell (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>), and it is difficult to see the enrichment in the trailing uropod as the authors claim: for example, mDia1 appears to be excluded from the F-actin rich band in the trailing uropod (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4A</italic></xref><italic>). The effects of mDia1 knockdown on actin cytoskeleton and membrane blebbing should be quantitatively analyzed to test whether mDia1 is inducing these changes</italic>.</p><p>We now provide what we hope is more convincing evidence for mDia1 enrichment at the trailing uropod (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>) as well as at the sites of blebbing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We also, as suggested, quantified the effects of mDia1 knockdown on cell blebbing, now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>.</p><p><italic>Other concerns:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The percent knockdown of different LPAR isoforms (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>), GPCR isoforms (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>), RhoGEFs (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>) and mDia1 (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>) should be shown by western blot so that the conclusion that one isoform is required and not others is based on equal degrees of loss expression</italic>.</p><p>We now provide these data as suggested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref> and for mDia1 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) It should be clearly stated in the text that localization of specific proteins (e.g. mDia in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>) is by monitoring ectopically-expressed, GFP-labeled fusion</italic> proteins.</p><p>We apologize if this was not clearly indicated and we have now corrected that accordingly.</p><p><italic>3) Statistical analysis:</italic></p><p><italic>- Student's t-test should only be employed when 2 conditions are being compared (e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2C</italic></xref><italic>).

This further suggests that LPAR2 polarized localization can precede downstream actin assembly such as for actin-rich trailing cup formation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
