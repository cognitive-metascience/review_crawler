Hedgehog (Hh) signaling has been shown to inhibit adipose tissue development, but its effect on diet-induced obesity during postnatal life is not known. Here by inducing expression of constitutively active Smoothened (SmoM2) or Gli2 (ΔNGli2) in the adipocyte lineage of postnatal mice, we show that targeted activation of Hh signaling suppresses high-fat-diet-induced obesity and improves whole-body glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Both SmoM2 and ΔNGli2 induce the expression of Wnt6, a known anti-adipogenic factor, in fat depots of the mouse. Hh-Gli2 signaling inhibits not only adipocyte differentiation but also lipogenesis in adipocytes in vitro. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of Porcupine, an acyltransferase essential for Wnt secretion, alleviates both anti-adipogenic and anti-lipogenic effects of Hh in cell culture models. Overall, targeted activation of Hh signaling ameliorates diet-induced obesity and may be explored for pharmaceutical development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hedgehog</kwd><kwd>Wnt</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>adipogenesis</kwd><kwd>lipogenesis</kwd><kwd>glucose metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK111212</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Long</surname><given-names>Fanxin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR060456</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Long</surname><given-names>Fanxin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Targeted activation of Hedgehog signalling via Gli2 facilitated the reduction of high-fat-diet-induced obesity and improvement of whole-body glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in adult mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The global epidemic of obesity affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide in 2016, as estimated by the World Health Organization. In the United States, one third of the adult population is obese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Flegal et al., 2002</xref>). It is well known that clinically obese individuals exhibit a markedly higher chance of developing cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, cancer and stroke. A recent meta-analysis shows that obesity is associated with significantly higher all-cause mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Flegal et al., 2013</xref>). Although the obesity epidemic clearly requires comprehensive solutions, pharmacological strategies are urgently needed.</p><p>Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway controlling tissue development and homeostasis. In this pathway, Hh ligands bind to the receptor Patched 1 (Ptch1) to relieve its inhibition on Smoothened (Smo), a seven-pass transmembrane protein, resulting in transcriptional activation by the Gli family of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ingham and McMahon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Goetz et al., 2009</xref>). However, point mutations in Smoothened, such as W535L (hereafter SmoM2) originally discovered in human sporadic basal-cell carcinoma, can activate Gli-mediated transcription independent of a Hh ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Xie et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Long et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jeong et al., 2004a</xref>). Of the three Gli proteins in mammals, Gli2 and Gli3 are the primary effectors to transduce Hh signaling whereas Gli1, a direct target of Gli2 and Gli3, functions to amplify the transcriptional response of Hh signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Park et al., 2000</xref>). Moreover, Gli2 is predominantly a transcriptional activator in response to Hh whereas Gli3 mainly exists as a repressor that is de-repressed upon Hh signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bai and Joyner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hilton et al., 2005</xref>). The activator function of Gli2 normally requires Hh input but an N-terminally truncated form (ΔNGli2) has been found to stimulate transcription constitutively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sasaki et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Joeng and Long, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mill et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Hh signaling has been implicated in the development of adipose tissues. Genetic studies in Drosophila identified Hh as a potent inhibitor of fat body formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pospisilik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Suh et al., 2006</xref>). Deletion of Sufu, an endogenous inhibitor of Hh signaling, with aP2-Cre impaired the formation of white (WAT) but not brown (BAT) adipose tissue in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pospisilik et al., 2010</xref>). However, a recent study showed that Hh activation through deletion of Ptch1 or expression of SmoM2 with aP2-Cre inhibited BAT development in newborn mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nosavanh et al., 2015</xref>). Because all of the mouse genetic studies to date perturbed Hh signaling throughout embryogenesis, it is not known whether Hh signaling can influence adiposity when activated specifically at the adult stage.</p><p>Besides Hh, Wnt proteins have also been shown to inhibit adipogenesis. Transgenic mice expressing Wnt10b from the <italic>Fabp4</italic> (also known as <italic>aP2</italic>) promoter resisted fat accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Longo et al., 2004</xref>). In vitro studies have also implicated Wnt6 and Wnt10a in the suppression of adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cawthorn et al., 2012</xref>). Although Wnt acts downstream of Hh in the context of osteoblast differentiation, it is not known whether or how the two signals interact during fat formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hu et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, by inducing the expression of either SmoM2 or ΔNGli2 in the adipocyte lineage of postnatal mice, we show that Hh signaling exerts a relatively modest effect in mice on the regular diet, but notably suppresses both WAT and BAT accumulation caused by a high-fat diet. We further demonstrate that Hh induces Wnt expression to inhibit not only adipocyte differentiation but also the conversion of glucose to lipids.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hedgehog activation suppresses high-fat-diet-induced obesity and metabolic symptoms</title><p>To activate Hh signaling in the adipose tissue specifically in postnatal mice, we wished to use the Pparg-tTA allele to target the adipocyte lineage following withdrawal of doxycycline (Dox) from the drinking water. To this end, we first assessed the tissue specificity and efficacy of Pparg-tTA by generating mice with the genotype of Pparg-tTA;TetO-Cre;mT/mG and monitoring GFP expression in response to Dox withdrawal. After two months of Dox withdrawal starting at two months of age, we observed GFP in both the gonadal fat (white adipose tissue, hereafter WAT) and the interscapular fat depot (brown adipose tissue, hereafter BAT) as well as the bone marrow fat, but not in the liver, the intestine or the heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, immunostaining indicated that only a subset of perilipin +adipocytes expressed GFP (48 ± 6.1% in WAT; 35 ± 4.1% in BAT; 18 ± 3.0% in bone marrow fat, n = 3), indicating mosaic Cre activity due to varied expression of tTA or uneven clearance of Dox, or both. Thus, Pparg-tTA in combination with TetO-Cre predominantly but incompletely targets the adipose tissue in adult mice after Dox withdrawal.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31649.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Long-term activation of Smo reduces fat accumulation without altering glucose metabolism in mice on regular chow diet.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pparg-tTA targets adipose tissues in adult mice.

Specifically, we raised mice harboring one allele each of Pparg-tTA, TetO-Cre and R26-SmoM2 (genotype Pparg-tTA;TetO-Cre;R26<sup>SmoM2/+</sup>) on regular chow plus Dox from conception through two months of age, at which point they either continued on Dox (+Dox) or were weaned off Dox (-Dox) for up to 8, 18 or 26 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). After 8 weeks of Dox withdrawal, the Hh target genes Ptch1 and Gli1 were markedly induced whereas the adipocyte marker genes Pparg, Cebpa and Fabp4 were suppressed in WAT, thus confirming the efficacy of the approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, the mice maintained a normal body weight even after 18 weeks of Dox withdrawal although they eventually showed a decrease after 26 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). At 26 weeks, the –Dox mice also exhibited a lower percentage of body fat but glucose metabolism appeared to be normal according to glucose tolerance tests (GTT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Thus, prolonged Hh activation in the adipose tissue suppresses fat accumulation without altering glucose homeostasis in mice fed with the regular chow.</p><p>We next examined whether Hh activation affects obesity caused by a high fat diet. For this, the triple transgenic mice (Pparg-tTA;TetO-Cre;R26<sup>SmoM2/+</sup>) raised on regular chow and Dox from conception through two months of age were subjected to a high-fat diet (HFD) for up to 16 weeks, with or without continued Dox treatment (+Dox or –Dox, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The –Dox mice were noticeably leaner than +Dox group after 8 weeks of HFD treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). At 8 weeks, the –Dox mice already showed a lower percentage of fat than the +Dox mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Both the gonadal (WAT) and the interscapular (BAT) fat depots were markedly reduced in the -Dox mice, consistent with a notable decrease in the size of adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). In addition, the bone marrow adipocytes, readily detectable by perilipin immunostaining in the long bones of the +Dox mice, were essentially absent in the –Dox group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Molecular analyses confirmed that the adipocyte marker genes were significantly suppressed in WAT and BAT of the –Dox mice, whereas Gli1 and Ptch1 were greatly elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>). Moreover, the induction of Gli1 was restricted to WAT and BAT but not the other tissues in the -Dox mice, confirming the intended specificity to adipose tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Finally, because obesity often leads to glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, we examined whether suppression of fat accumulation by Hh results in metabolic benefits. The –Dox mice exhibited faster clearance of glucose in the glucose tolerance test (GTT), and greater sensitivity to insulin in the insulin tolerance test (ITT) than their +Dox counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K,L</xref>). To test the possibility that the phenotypes here might be due to the lipodystrophic effect of the Pparg-tTA allele or the antimicrobial effect of Dox as previously reported, we repeated the experiment with mice carrying either no transgene or only Pparg-tTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 2012</xref>). After 8 weeks of HFD with or without Dox (starting at two months of age), we did not observe any difference in body weight, body composition or glucose metabolism between the +Dox and –Dox groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, Hh activation in the Pparg-lineage is sufficient to suppress obesity and improve glucose metabolism in response to a high-fat diet.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31649.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Smo activation prevents obesity and improves glucose metabolism in mice on high fat diet.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic for experimental design.

To gain additional insights, we studied the anti-adipogenenic effect of Hh signaling in the murine bone marrow mesenchymal progenitor cell line M2-10B4 (hereafter M2), which we have previously shown to respond robustly to Hh signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shi et al., 2015a</xref>). The M2 cells underwent adipogenesis when cultured in the adipogenic medium, as indicated by the induction of Cebpb and Cebpd as early as 6 hr and that of Pparg, Cebpa and Fabp4 after 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Addition of the Hh agonist purmorphamine (PM) to the adipogenic media completely abolished adipogenesis, as indicated by the loss of oil-red O staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Interestingly, PM markedly suppressed Pparg, Cebpa and Fabp4, but not Cebpb or Cebpd that is known to function at an earlier stage of adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, Hh signaling inhibits adipocyte differentiation in a stage-specific manner.</p><p>We next sought to distinguish the relative contribution of the different Gli transcription factors to the anti-adipogenic function of Hh. Knockdown of Gli2 with shRNA reduced the mRNA level of Gli2 by 75%, and essentially nullified the inhibitory effect of PM on Pparg, Cebpa and Fabp4 induction by the adipogenic media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, knocking down either Gli1 or Gli3 to a similar degree did not blunt the anti-adipogenic effect of PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Oil red O staining confirmed that knockdown of Gli2 but not Gli1 or Gli3 completely restored the number of adipocytes in the presence of PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To confirm the anti-adipogenic effect of Gli2, we cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) from the R26<sup>ΔNGli2/+</sup> mice, and activated expression of ΔNGli2 (a constitutively active form of Gli2) from the Rosa26 locus with an adenovirus expressing Cre (Ad-Cre) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Joeng and Long, 2009</xref>). ΔNGli2 essentially abolished the induction of Cebpa, Pparg and Fabp4 mRNA as well as the oil red O-positive cells by the adipogenic media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>).

The –Dox mice was significantly leaner than their +Dox counterparts after 8 weeks of HFD, and their difference in body weight increased with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). Body composition analyses with MRI revealed a notable reduction in fat and a corresponding increase in lean mass in the –Dox mice after 8 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). At that time, both gonadal (WAT) and interscapular fat depots (BAT) were diminished and contained smaller adipocytes in the –Dox mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). Immunostaining of perilipin on long bone sections revealed that the bone marrow fat was essentially eliminated in the –Dox mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Molecular analyses confirmed that Dox withdrawal led to marked induction of Ptch1 and Gli1 in both WAT and BAT, reduction of Pparg, Cebpa, Fabp4 in WAT, and suppression of Ucp1, Cidea in BAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H,I</xref>). Finally, compared to the +Dox counterparts, the –Dox mice exhibited a lower basal glucose level, better glucose tolerance and greater insulin sensitivity after 8 weeks of HFD treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J,K</xref>).

Among the upregulated genes, Wnt5a, Wnt6 and Wnt9a attracted our attention as Wnt signaling is known to inhibit adipogenesis. RT-qPCR confirmed the induction of all three Wnt genes by PM in M2 cells, with that of Wnt6 being most robust, reaching over 10 fold after 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Knockdown of Gli2 with shRNA essentially eliminated the induction of the Wnt genes by PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Consistent with the findings in M2 cells, MEFs isolated from the R26<sup>ΔNGli2/+</sup> mouse and infected with Ad-Cre upregulated Wnt5a, Wnt6 and Wnt9a expression by 216, 1200 and 64 fold, respectively, over the cells infected with Ad-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

The induction of Wnt6 could be relevant as it was previously shown to inhibit adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cawthorn et al., 2012</xref>).

The failure to detect Wnt5a or Wnt9b induction in the whole fat depot may result from the cellular heterogeneity, and the incomplete penetrance of Pparg-tTA within the tissue as shown earlier. Alternatively, Wnt5a or Wnt9b may not be induced by Hh signaling in vivo.

To examine this regulation in more detail, we induced primary preadipocytes from wild type mice to form adipocytes (three days in adipogenic media) and then assessed the effect of PM specifically on the lipid-accumulating phase (eleven days in insulin-only media). RT-qPCR assays indicated that PM significantly reduced the expression of lipogenesis genes such as Lpl (lipoprotein lipase), Fasn (fatty acid synthase), Plin (perilipin) and Dgat1 (diacylglycerol acyltransferases 1) without affecting the differentiation marker Fabp4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

To assess the relevance of Wnt secretion in this regulation, we tested the effect of IWP2 specifically on the lipid-accumulating phase (eleven days in insulin-containing media) either alone or together with PM.

To investigate directly the contribution of glucose to lipid formation, we tracked the incorporation of glucose carbons to cellular lipids by adding the radioactively labeled [U-<sup>14</sup>C6]-glucose to the insulin-only media for the final three days of the lipid-accumulating phase (total 11 days) with or without the addition of PM or IWP2.

At the cellular level, Hh inhibits not only adipocyte differentiation but also lipid production by adipocytes. Molecularly, Gli2 is the principle transcription factor in the Gli family to mediate the anti-adipogenic and anti-lipogenic effects of Hh signaling. The study not only sheds new light on the mechanism of Hh signaling in adipogenesis but also provides a proof of principle that Hh activation may be explored for pharmaceutical treatment of obesity.</p><p>To our knowledge, the present study is the first to investigate the effect of Hh signaling specifically in adult mice and in response to high fat diet. Although previous studies have identified an inhibitory role for Hh in adipose tissue formation during embryogenesis, it is necessary to assess its effect in adults and in response to dietary influences if the pathway were to be explored for therapeutic purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pospisilik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nosavanh et al., 2015</xref>). Recent studies have demonstrated that both adipocyte de novo formation (hyperplasia) and hypertrophy contribute to fat accumulation in response to high fat diet, and that anatomically different fat depots employ the two mechanism differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Because distinct adipose tissues differ substantially in their contribution to whole-body nutrient metabolism, it is critical to evaluate whether Hh signaling differentially affects the different fat depots. Here, we have found that Hh activation markedly suppressed adipocyte hypertrophy in both WAT and BAT in mice fed the high fat diet. Together with the studies in vitro, these results establish that Hh activation prevents obesity caused by high fat diet through inhibition of both adipocyte hyperplasia and hypertrophy.</p><p>The current study has provided new mechanistic insight about the inhibitory effect of Hh signaling on adipogenesis. The work distinguishes Gli2 from other members of the Gli family as the principale effector for Hh to suppress adipocyte differentiation. The downstream effectors for Gli2 in this process however, remain unresolved at present. Our cell culture work indicates that Wnt activation partly mediates the anti-adipogenic and anti-lipogenic functions of Hh signaling, but the physiological relevance of such a Hh-Wnt relay mechanism is yet to be tested in vivo. In this regard, it is worth noting that secreted frizzled-related protein 5, a secreted antagonist of Wnt proteins, was reported to stimulate adipocyte hypertrophy in obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mori et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, previous studies have implicated Hes1 in mediating the anti-adipogenic function of Hh, and we have also observed the induction of Hes1 by PM in M2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pospisilik et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, it is likely that Hh-Gli2 signaling employs multiple effectors to suppress adipocyte formation and function.</p><p>Our results indicate that Hh may employ non-cell-autonomous mechanisms to suppress adipose tissue formation. Although Pparg-tTA targeted less than 50% of the adipocytes in either WAT or BAT, Hh activation in the targeted cells not only markedly diminished the overall dimension of all adipose depots, but also reduced the individual size of all adipocytes in WAT or BAT. Even more strikingly, Hh activation in less than 20% of bone marrow adipocytes essentially abolished all marrow fat. These results are consistent with the model that Hh activation in adipocyte-lineage cells induced expression of paracrine signals such as the Wnt proteins to suppress adipocyte differentiation and hypertrophy. Alternatively, Hh activation in a subset of the cells may lead to changes in circulating factors that in turn suppress fat accumulation systemically. Future experiments are necessary to distinguish those possibilities.</p><p>A major health burden of obesity is the dysregulation of whole-body glucose metabolism. Our result shows that by suppressing fat accumulation caused by HFD, Hh activation improved the systemic glucose metabolism in the mouse. Interestingly, even though Hh activation also suppressed adipose tissue accumulation in mice on regular chow diet, the lean mice did not exhibit any changes in glucose metabolism. This observation is similar to the previous study where Sufu was deleted with aP2-Cre, and indicates that Hh activation in the adipose tissues in a healthy state has minimal effects on general glucose metabolism. Thus, targeted activation of Hh signaling may be explored pharmaceutically to ameliorate the metabolic abnormalities associated with obesity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse studies</title><p>The mouse strains of Pparg-tTA, TetO-Cre, R26-SmoM2 and R26-ΔNGli2 have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Joeng and Long, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jeong et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Perl et al., 2002</xref>).

The amount of <sup>14</sup>C radioactivity was normalized to lipid quantity (cpm/μg). Glucose and lactate measurements were done as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Esen et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, for glucose consumption measurements, preadipocytes were incubated with AdipoM for 3 days and then switched to insulin-only medium with or without PM or IWP2 for three more days. Aliquots of the media and glucose standards were assayed with Glucose (HK) Assay Kit (Sigma catalog number GAHK20) and read at 340 OD using a plate reader (BioTek model SAMLFTA, Gen5 software). Lactate was measured with L-lactate assay kit from Eton biosciences (catalog number 1200011002). Each cell culture well was considered a biological replicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical and power analyses</title><p>All quantitative data are presented as mean ±SD with a minimum of three independent samples.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Hedgehog signaling via <italic>Gli2</italic> prevents obesity induced by high fat diet in adult mice&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work as it stands will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. It is the consensus opinion of the reviewers that this study nicely builds upon previous work in cultured cells and mice which established that activation of Hh signaling leads to inhibition of adipogenesis in both white and brown adipose tissue. The novel contribution of this study is that Hh signaling can protect mice from obesity and its related metabolic complications. In vivo and in vitro data suggest that specific activation of Hh signaling in adipose tissue of postnatal mice have a direct effect on diet-induced obesity. This activation also showed significant improvement of glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity implying that adipose tissue specific activation of Hh can affect glucose utilization (uptake, transport, or consumption) in tissues other than adipose tissue. This inhibitory effect appears to be mediated by the Hh downstream effector, <italic>Gli2</italic>, likely through activation of the <italic>Gli2</italic> target gene, Wnt6. These are significant findings of general interest.</p><p>However, despite the interesting set of experiments, the paper has several weaknesses relating to the Dox treatments and alleles used, level of modification of Wnt singaling, and presentation which we anticipate will require extensive reanalysis and the generation of additional data. Since it is <italic>eLife</italic> policy to only invite revisions in cases where revisions can be reasonably completed within two months, we cannot invite revision of the current manuscript. However, we are in principle interested in the study and we would be enthusiastic about reviewing a substantially revised version that addresses our concerns, with the proviso that it will be treated as a new submission. Such a submission would not necessarily be seen by the same reviewers and thus additional concerns might be raised. <italic>eLife</italic> is highly selective, which means that the majority of submissions are rejected, but we thank you for sending your work for review and we hope you will submit to <italic>eLife</italic> again in the future.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Shi et al. use a conditional approach to activate Hh signaling in a subset of adult WAT and BAT cells or their precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Hh pathway activation has a mild effect on reducing adiposity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). In vitro, Hh pathway activation inhibits adipogenesis, as has previously been described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Knockdown studies suggest that this in vitro inhibition is mediated through <italic>Gli2</italic>, the principal transcriptional activator used by Hh signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). <italic>Gli2</italic> is able to induce Wnt6 (Figure 8) and inhibition of Wnt secretion modestly reverses the <italic>Gli2</italic>-mediated inhibition of adipogenic gene expression in vitro (Figure 9E). In addition to affecting adipogenesis, Hh pathway activation in vitro has mild effects on fat formation in those adipocytes that do form (Figure 10).</p><p>Several previous studies have demonstrated that the Hh pathway is a strong anti-adipogenic pathway including two in vivo studies, in which adipose-specific Hh activation completely inhibits WAT (Pospisilik, 2010) and BAT (Nosavanh, 2015) formation. This study complements these previous data nicely by suggesting that Hh activation can also inhibit diet-induced obesity in adult mice. This group then carefully analyzed the downstream cascade and convincingly argue for <italic>Gli2</italic> as the main effector of pathway activation in the fat.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>The Ppary-tTA allele used here has been shown to cause lipodystrophy in the absence of Dox (Kim, 2007, PNAS). Moreover, Dox treatment suppresses these pathologies, suggesting that the observed lipodystrophy results from promiscuous transcriptional activity of tTA. Since the phenotype reported in this manuscript is that fat mass is reduced in the absence of Dox, an alternative explanation could be that as soon as Dox is removed, the anti-adipogenic effects of this allele are activated, thereby counteracting the fat mass gain due to the high fat diet. To separate their findings from the anti-adipogenic role of the Ppary-tTA line, the authors should repeat the experiment with mice just carrying the Ppary-tTA allele {plus minus} Dox.</p><p>Similarly, many different classes of antibacterial agents, including tetracyclines, promote animal growth. Subtherapeutic levels of chlortetracycline causes increased adiposity and metabolic alterations in mice (Cho et al.,). Since the phenotype reported in this manuscript is that fat mass is reduced in the absence of Dox, an alternative explanation could be that removal of Dox removes this recognized pro-adipogenic influence. To separate their findings from the pro-adipogenic role of Dox, the authors should repeat the experiment with mice lacking one of the three transgenic alleles {plus minus} Dox.</p><p>Given that Wnt6 is induced by Hh signaling 17-fold in M2 cells, 1500-fold in MEFs but only 3-fold in vivo (Figure 8E), and IWP2 has a modest effect (less than twofold on Pparg expression) on preadipocytes, and certainly doesn't restore the robust inhibition of adipogenesis caused by purmorphamine (Figure 9D vs E), it isn't clear that Wnt signaling is the primary means by which Hh signaling inhibits adipogenesis. Some confirmation of the effect on Wnt signaling in vivo by Western of animal tissue and analysis of Wnt signaling in fat pads would lend important support to this crucial point. Similarly, is Wnt6 induced in the SmoM2 model, as one would expect?</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>That activation of Hh signaling inhibits adipogenesis (both in white and brown adipose tissue) is well established in cultured cells and in mice. However, whether this can protect mice from obesity and its related metabolic complication has not yet been reported. In this paper, Shi and Long presented a comprehensive set of in vivo and in vitro data to show that adipose tissue specific activation of Hh signaling in postnatal mice not only reduces adiposity but also improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in diet-induced obese mice. This inhibitory effect is mainly carried out by the Hh downstream effector, <italic>Gli2</italic>. These authors further showed that both differentiation and lipid accumulation were inhibited by Hh signaling, likely through activation of a <italic>Gli2</italic> target gene, Wnt6. Wnt6 expression is dependent on Hh signaling in M2 cells, MEFs, and adipose tissue. Blocking palmitoylation of Wnt6 reduced Wnt signaling activity and alleviated the inhibitory effect of Hh signaling on adipogenesis.</p><p>As far as I know, this is the first paper to provide genetic evidence that activation of Hh signaling in mice can have a direct effect on diet-induced obesity. Because Hh signaling can inhibit adipogenesis in cultured cells, it's no surprise to see that mutant mice with high Hh pathway activity in adipose tissue are leaner even under high fat-diet treatment. However, the fact that these mice also showed significant improvement of glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity is impressive and suggests that adipose tissue specific activation of Hh can affect glucose utilization (uptake, transport, or consumption) in tissues other than adipose tissue. In my view, this is the most important finding from this study and needs to be further characterized in this paper. For example, gene expression analysis of skeletal muscle, liver, or subcutaneous adipose tissue would provide insight into the expression of genes responsible for glucose uptake and insulin pathway activation in these tissues. Therefore, it is somewhat disappointing that the authors focused on characterizing the effect of Hh on inhibiting adipogenesis, which has been previously reported by several studies rather than on how Hh regulates glucose tolerance and insulin insensitivity through controlling adipose tissue formation in high-fat diet fed mice.</p><p>Overall, the data presented in this paper is well organized and easy to understand, and the genetic data is convincing and nicely shows the epistatic relationship between Smo and <italic>Gli2</italic>. However, the in vitro differentiation assays appear not to be working very well. In all the cell lines (M2, MEFs, and primary preadipocytes) examined, adipogenic induction (control cells) only resulted in the differentiation of a low% of cells, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the extent to which differentiation is disrupted because most of the cells did not respond to the adipogenic induction. Perhaps adjusting the concentration of the adipogenic induction media components will in the first place improve the efficiency of differentiation and provide more definitive results to support the author's conclusions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this study, Shi and Long report that activation of Hedgehog pathway reduced the development of obesity among mice fed a high fat diet. This repression occurs through <italic>Gli2</italic>, at the transcriptional level. In ChIP-seq experiments in a cell culture system, they find that <italic>Gli2</italic> binds to several Wnt loci, and knockdown of <italic>Gli2</italic> prevents Hedgehog stimulated activation of these Wnts. The pharmacological inhibition of Wnt proteins largely (but not completely) prevents Hedgehog-mediated reduction of adipogenesis in cultured cells, suggesting that Wnts are the major mediator of <italic>Gli2</italic>-mediated suppression of adipogenesis. This model is consistent with their earlier data suggesting that Hh-repression occurs cell autonomously.</p><p>This study is interesting and logically presented but I do have one major concern. The connection between Hedgehog signaling and Wnt activation, a major conclusion of the study, seems somewhat contrived, relying on 'cherry-picked' ChIP binding data that (see below) and cell culture experiments with different Gli and Wnt kinetics that are hard to compare with the in vivo models. Clarifying the transcriptional relationship between Hedgehog and Wnts in these systems is critical for solidifying this connection.</p><p>1) As I understand it, the current data suggest that Hedgehog inhibits adipogenesis but whether it would cause an already obese mouse to lose weight remains unaddressed. While I realize that doing this experiment is beyond the scope of the study, I raise this concern because the authors are making the claim that Hedgehog pathway activation could potentially be used to treat obesity. If my understanding is correct, the authors should consider toning-down / or qualifying statements like &quot;Thus, targeted activation of the Hh pathway may be explored to combat diet-induced obesity.&quot;</p><p>2) Why is the magnitude of Hh-mediated response so different between high fat and regular diets for SmoM2? Both Gli1 and Ptch1 have higher responses in the RosaSmoM2 and RosaGli2deltaN dominant active genetic systems compared to the SmoM2 in mice maintained on a normal diet. Is this a confounding biological factor?</p><p>3) Related to point #2, it is not clear in Figure 9D how long pre-adipocytes were cultured without DOX before assaying by qRT-PCR. There, the difference in Gli1 induction (4-fold) is really striking compared to the in vivo Gli1 response using RosaGli2deltaN system, which appears at least 25-fold higher (c.f. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This makes me concerned about whether this assay really effectively models the Hh-mediated repression observed in 16 week of the high fat diet regimen.

Would this level of Wnt really be sufficient to account for cell autonomous Gli-mediated repression? Is this discrepancy due to negative feedback from prolonged Wnt signaling, that the in vitro systems are not effectively modeling the in vivo response, or that Wnts are, despite the ChIP data, not directly regulated by <italic>Gli2</italic> in the in vivo systems?</p><p>5) The <italic>Gli2</italic> ChIP data provided for review is incomplete and does not meet current standards for providing all raw data.

The methods for analyzing the ChIP data need to be clarified. For example, what does the P-value in the table refer to?

A confounding factor in the current level of data analysis is that, if my understanding is correct, the nearest gene in the genome is shown on the dataset regardless of whether it is transcriptionally active in adipocytes.

Although a mouse model used in the study provides limited efficiency in targeting different fat depots, it shows strong anti-adipogenic and anti-lipogenic effects of Hh signalling activation in high-fat diet condition. The lineage tracing experiments using Pparg-tTA;TetO-Cre in combinations with R26-SmoM2 and R26-ΔNGli2/+, separately, are both convincing of a SHH mediated effect on adult adipogenesis, high-fat diet induced obesity and suppressing metabolic dysfunctions as assessed by glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. The in vitro data using primary adipocytes is also convincing of SHH-mediating Wnt induction. RNA from whole gonadal fat pad from both transgenic lines overexpressing SHH or <italic>Gli2</italic> shows Wnt6 induction. Primary preadipocytes isolated from gonadal fat pad of PPAR ΔNGli2/+ and in the presence of doxycycline and IWP2 induce Pparg and Fabp4 adipocyte markers. This is an interesting study that the authors have strengthened since the original submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The major concern remains the link between Hedgehog signalling and Wnt activation, since the results do not strongly support the authors' conclusions.

First, the two sites are less than 2-fold activated. For in vitro GLI enhancer assays, this is not a compelling increase in activity. It is possible that this is because the M2 cells were only treated with an unspecified amount of purmorphamine for 24 hours when previous work by this lab showed maximal stimulation was achieved at 48 hours (Shi et al., 2015). Alternatively, perhaps the M2 bone marrow line does not model adipogenic responses under the current culture conditions, or that Wnt signaling is not active under these biological conditions. Finally, it is certainly still possible that these regions are not biological enhancers.

Moreover, Dox treatment suppresses these pathologies, suggesting that the observed lipodystrophy results from promiscuous transcriptional activity of tTA. Since the phenotype reported in this manuscript is that fat mass is reduced in the absence of Dox, an alternative explanation could be that as soon as Dox is removed, the anti-adipogenic effects of this allele are activated, thereby counteracting the fat mass gain due to the high fat diet. To separate their findings from the anti-adipogenic role of the Ppary-tTA line, the authors should repeat the experiment with mice just carrying the Ppary-tTA allele {plus minus} Dox.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern and have now repeated the experiment with mice just carrying the Pparg-tTA allele as recommended. Specifically, the Pparg-tTA mice were raised with Dox from conception to 2 months of age, and then fed HFD with or without Dox water for 2 additional months. We have found no Dox effect on body composition, body weight or GTT. Please see the data in the supplemental figures (Figure S1C-E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, many different classes of antibacterial agents, including tetracyclines, promote animal growth. Subtherapeutic levels of chlortetracycline causes increased adiposity and metabolic alterations in mice (Cho et al.,). Since the phenotype reported in this manuscript is that fat mass is reduced in the absence of Dox, an alternative explanation could be that removal of Dox removes this recognized pro-adipogenic influence. To separate their findings from the pro-adipogenic role of Dox, the authors should repeat the experiment with mice lacking one of the three transgenic alleles {plus minus} Dox.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now repeated the experiment as suggested. Specifically, wild type mice without any of the transgenic alleles were raised with Dox from conception to 2 months of age, and then fed HFD with or without Dox water for 2 additional months. We detected no Doc effect on body weight or body composition (Figure S1A, B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that Wnt6 is induced by Hh signaling 17-fold in M2 cells, 1500-fold in MEFs but only 3-fold in vivo (Figure 8E), and IWP2 has a modest effect (less than twofold on Pparg expression) on preadipocytes, and certainly doesn't restore the robust inhibition of adipogenesis caused by purmorphamine (Figure 9D vs E), it isn't clear that Wnt signaling is the primary means by which Hh signaling inhibits adipogenesis. Some confirmation of the effect on Wnt signaling in vivo by Western of animal tissue and analysis of Wnt signaling in fat pads would lend important support to this crucial point. Similarly, is Wnt6 induced in the SmoM2 model, as one would expect?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that Hh signaling likely engages multiple downstream effectors besides Wnt6 to inhibit adipogenesis in vivo (see Discussion section). As per the reviewer’s suggestion, we have now performed additional experiments to confirm the involvement of Wnt signaling. Specifically, we show that a common Wnt target gene Axin2 was up-regulated in the gonadal fat pad upon ΔNGli2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). We further show that in the SmoM2 model Wnt6 was also upregulated by ~4 fold in the gonadal fat pad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>As far as I know, this is the first paper to provide genetic evidence that activation of Hh signaling in mice can have a direct effect on diet-induced obesity. Because Hh signaling can inhibit adipogenesis in cultured cells, it's no surprise to see that mutant mice with high Hh pathway activity in adipose tissue are leaner even under high fat-diet treatment. However, the fact that these mice also showed significant improvement of glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity is impressive and suggests that adipose tissue specific activation of Hh can affect glucose utilization (uptake, transport, or consumption) in tissues other than adipose tissue. In my view, this is the most important finding from this study and needs to be further characterized in this paper. For example, gene expression analysis of skeletal muscle, liver, or subcutaneous adipose tissue would provide insight into the expression of genes responsible for glucose uptake and insulin pathway activation in these tissues. Therefore, it is somewhat disappointing that the authors focused on characterizing the effect of Hh on inhibiting adipogenesis, which has been previously reported by several studies rather than on how Hh regulates glucose tolerance and insulin insensitivity through controlling adipose tissue formation in high-fat diet fed mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that the reviewer recognizes the significance of our finding. As the anti-obesity effect of Hh activation in the face of high fat diet is of potential translational value, we have focused our effort on gaining more mechanistic insights about the effect. The studies have uncovered an Hh-<italic>Gli2</italic>-Wnt6 signaling axis as an important part of the anti-adipogenic mechanism.</p><p>Besides the reduced adiposity, Hh activation also achieved impressive metabolic benefits in insulin signaling and glucose handling. We believe that the metabolic benefits are secondary to the reduced obesity but not necessarily specific to Hh signaling. We agree with the reviewer that a mechanistic understanding of the link between adiposity and whole-body metabolism is critical, but believe that such a fundamental question warrants a separate study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the data presented in this paper is well organized and easy to understand, and the genetic data is convincing and nicely shows the epistatic relationship between Smo and Gli2. However, the in vitro differentiation assays appear not to be working very well. In all the cell lines (M2, MEFs, and primary preadipocytes) examined, adipogenic induction (control cells) only resulted in the differentiation of a low% of cells, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the extent to which differentiation is disrupted because most of the cells did not respond to the adipogenic induction. Perhaps adjusting the concentration of the adipogenic induction media components will in the first place improve the efficiency of differentiation and provide more definitive results to support the author's conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern. We think the relatively insufficient adipogenesis (judged by oil red O staining) of M2 cells may reflect their nature as bipotent mesenchymal progenitors for osteoblast and adipocytes. In addition, the adipogenic media that we used for M2 and MEFs did not contain troglitazone that could have produced more robust adipogensis. The primary preadipocytes however did exhibit robust differentiation in our assays, although we did not include images of oil red O staining in the paper for the sake of brevity. Regardless, in all cases in addition to quantifying the number of oil red O-stained cells, we have performed qPCR for several molecular markers to assess adipogenesis quantitatively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Therefore, we feel confident about the conclusions drawn from those experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1) As I understand it, the current data suggest that Hedgehog inhibits adipogenesis but whether it would cause an already obese mouse to lose weight remains unaddressed. While I realize that doing this experiment is beyond the scope of the study, I raise this concern because the authors are making the claim that Hedgehog pathway activation could potentially be used to treat obesity. If my understanding is correct, the authors should consider toning-down / or qualifying statements like &quot;Thus, targeted activation of the Hh pathway may be explored to combat diet-induced obesity.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern and agree that future experiments are necessary to determine whether Hh activation is sufficient to reverse diet-induced obesity. We have deleted the statement in question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2)Why is the magnitude of Hh-mediated response so different between high fat and regular diets for SmoM2? Both Gli1 and Ptch1 have higher responses in the RosaSmoM2 and RosaGli2deltaN dominant active genetic systems compared to the SmoM2 in mice maintained on a normal diet. Is this a confounding biological factor?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the astute observation. We do not know for certain why this is the case at the moment. As targeting of the adipocytes by our strategy was &lt; 50% in mice on the regular diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), it is possible that the high fat diet caused more adipocytes to be targeted by PpargtTA;tetoCre, resulting in the apparent increase in Hh response when the fat pad was assayed as a whole. It is also possible that the high fat diet somehow increased the transcriptional output of Hh signaling, which in itself would be very interesting to investigate in the future. Although the difference in question could help to explain why the mutant mice on the regular diet did not show a phenotype until much later (26 weeks) than those on high fat diet (8 weeks) after Dox withdrawal, it should not affect our main conclusion that Hh activation reduces adiposity in response to high fat diet.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to point #2, it is not clear in Figure 9D how long pre-adipocytes were cultured without DOX before assaying by qRT-PCR. There, the difference in Gli1 induction (4-fold) is really striking compared to the in vivo Gli1 response using RosaGli2deltaN system, which appears at least 25-fold higher (c.f. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This makes me concerned about whether this assay really effectively models the Hh-mediated repression observed in 16 week of the high fat diet regimen. If it does not, then the subsequent Wnt inhibitor assays used to show a loss of Hedgehog-mediated suppression of adiopogenesis markers might also be hard to compare meaningfully in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>The preadipocytes were cultured with or without Dox for three days before assaying by qRTPCR. The relatively low induction of Gli1 compared to that in vivo could be due to the short duration of Dox withdrawal, or the small percentage of cells expressing Pparg-tTA due to cell heterogeneity in the preadipocyte preparation (i.e., stromal vascular fraction of the adipose tissue). It is also possible that the transcriptional response to <italic>Gli2</italic> in preadipocytes is less robust than that in the more mature adipocytes that are only present in the intact adipose depot. We acknowledge the limitations of the in vitro system, and that the in vivo anti-adipogenic effect of Hh signaling may be mediated by additional mechanisms besides Wnt induction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The fat pads from the activated Gli2-deltaN activated mice have no upregulation Wnt 5a or Wnt 9a. While they do have significant upregulation of Wnt 6 (3-fold; Figure 8E) it is much lower than the values obtained in the cell culture assays. Would this level of Wnt really be sufficient to account for cell autonomous Gli-mediated repression? Is this discrepancy due to negative feedback from prolonged Wnt signaling, that the in vitro systems are not effectively modeling the in vivo response, or that Wnts are, despite the ChIP data, not directly regulated by Gli2 in the in vivo systems?</p></disp-quote><p>These are all very thoughtful questions. The reviewer raises an interesting negative feedback mechanism that could potentially explain the muted response of Wnt expression in vivo. It is also possible that Wnt 6 is induced by <italic>Gli2</italic> only in the preadipocytes that may be a small constituency of the adipose depot in vivo. As per the reviewer’s suggestion, we have now performed in vitro luciferase reporter assays to assess the Gli-bound sites in mediating the transcriptional activation by Hh signaling. The results show that two out of the four sites exhibit measurable activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). We therefore conclude that Wnt6 is likely a direct transcriptional target for <italic>Gli2</italic> in preadipocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The Gli2 ChIP data provided for review is incomplete and does not meet current standards for providing all raw data.
