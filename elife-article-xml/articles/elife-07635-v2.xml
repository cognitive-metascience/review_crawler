K-fibers are composed of many microtubules that are held together throughout their length. Here, we show, using 3D electron microscopy, that K-fiber microtubules (MTs) are connected by a network of MT connectors. We term this network ‘the mesh’. The K-fiber mesh is made of linked multipolar connectors. Each connector has up to four struts, so that a single connector can link up to four MTs. Molecular manipulation of the mesh by overexpression of TACC3 causes disorganization of the K-fiber MTs. Optimal stabilization of K-fibers by the mesh is required for normal progression through mitosis. We propose that the mesh stabilizes K-fibers by pulling MTs together and thereby maintaining the integrity of the fiber. Our work thus identifies the K-fiber meshwork of linked multipolar connectors as a key integrator and determinant of K-fiber structure and function.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07635.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07635.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07635.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Before a cell divides, its genetic material must be copied and then equally distributed between the newly formed daughter cells. In the cells of plants, animals, and fungi, a structure known as the spindle pulls the two copies of the chromosomes apart. The spindle is made up of a network of long, protein filaments called microtubules, and the bundles of microtubules that attach to the chromosomes are referred to as ‘K-fibers’.</p><p>K-fibers are organized in a way that provides strength. These bundles of microtubules are held together throughout their entire length and, in 2011, it was suggested that a group of proteins including one called TACC3 could cross-link adjacent microtubules within K-fibers. However, it remained unclear how these proteins achieved this.</p><p>Now, Nixon et al.—including several of the researchers involved in the 2011 work—have used a technique called 3D electron tomography to analyze what holds the K-fibers together in human cells. This analysis revealed struts or connectors that hold together adjacent microtubules within K-fibers. These connectors can vary in size and a single connector can link up to four microtubules. This means that, in a three-dimensional view, the connectors appear as a ‘mesh’ between the microtubules in the bundle.</p><p>Nixon et al. then increased the levels of the TACC3 protein and found that the K-fibers became disorganized. The spacing of the microtubules with the K-fibers was reduced so that they were more tightly packed than normal. These observations suggest that ‘the mesh’ influences the microtubule spacing within a K-fiber.</p><p>Nixon et al. analyzed how disorganized K-fibers affected dividing cells and found that it took longer for the chromosomes to move to the newly forming daughter cells. This suggests that cells must maintain optimal levels of TACC3 to ensure that the K-fibers can effectively separate the chromosomes. Further work is needed to identify the other proteins and molecules that make up the mesh.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07635.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07635.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C25425/A15182</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gutiérrez-Caballero</surname><given-names>Cristina</given-names></name><name><surname>Royle</surname><given-names>Stephen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000357</institution-id><institution>North West Cancer Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CR928</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nixon</surname><given-names>Faye M</given-names></name><name><surname>Royle</surname><given-names>Stephen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Microtubules of mitotic spindle fibers are positioned and held together by a meshwork of multipolar connectors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Accurate mitosis is essential to eukaryotic life. It requires the correct assembly of a bipolar array of microtubules (MTs) into a mitotic spindle which, in concert with hundreds of different motors and non-motor proteins, segregates the duplicated sister chromatids to the two daughter cells. Many of the chromosome movements in mitosis are governed by the kinetochore fibers (K-fibers) of the spindle apparatus. In human cells, K-fibers are bundles of 20–40 parallel MTs that typically run from the kinetochore to the spindle pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McDonald et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mastronarde et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McEwen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Booth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sikirzhytski et al., 2014</xref>). K-fibers can be thought of as coherent units: their constituent MTs are held together throughout their length, as well as being focused at either end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rieder, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Spurck et al., 1997</xref>). The coherence of the K-fiber is thought to be crucial for accurate chromosome segregation in mitosis. However, the ultrastructural and molecular basis of K-fiber coherence is not well understood.</p><p>Lateral MT connectors are important for the function of MT arrays, such as K-fibers, in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brangwynne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ward et al., 2014</xref>). Classic electron microscopy (EM) studies uncovered the presence of electron density between MTs of the K-fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wilson, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hepler et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Witt et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastmeyer and Fuge, 1986</xref>). These inter-MT bridges appear as bipolar struts laterally connecting two MTs in 2D electron micrographs. The bridges are typically ∼5 nm thick and range from 6–20 nm in length. The morphology of bridges is heterogeneous, and they are likely composed of a variety of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Booth et al., 2011</xref>). The mitotic spindle is an ensemble of hundreds of MT-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sauer et al., 2005</xref>), some of which are candidates for inter-MT bridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Manning and Compton, 2008</xref>). The number of inter-MT bridges scales with the number of MTs and also with the number of paired MTs in a bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastmeyer and Fuge, 1986</xref>), and it was proposed that it is the inter-MT bridges that hold K-fiber MTs together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Witt et al., 1981</xref>). The connection between the kinetochore and K-fiber MTs has been studied by 3D-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McIntosh et al., 2008</xref>). However, a similar 3D investigation of inter-MT connections away from the kinetochore has not been reported.</p><p>One molecular candidate for inter-MT bridges in K-fibers is TACC3–ch-TOG–clathrin. The assembly of this complex is regulated by phosphorylation of TACC3 at serine 558 by Aurora-A kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hubner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Booth et al., 2011</xref>). This allows two domains from TACC3 and clathrin to come together in space, making a single, composite MT interaction surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Booth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheeseman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hood et al., 2013</xref>). Previous work showed that this complex is necessary for K-fiber stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Royle et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Booth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheeseman et al., 2013</xref>) and that the complex forms a distinct class of short inter-MT bridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Booth et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we set out to examine the 3D ultrastructure of K-fiber inter-MT bridges. Surprisingly, we found that inter-MT bridges are not simply bipolar connections between two MTs but are a network of interconnected struts that contact multiple MTs. We term this structure ‘the mesh’. This novel subcellular structure positions MTs within the K-fiber and is required for normal mitosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inter-MT connectors in K-fibers are ‘bridges’ in 2D and a ‘mesh’ in 3D</title><p>Inter-MT bridges were first described in 2D electron micrographs as faintly stained fine threads projecting from the surface of the tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hepler et al., 1970</xref>). For example, 2D views of inter-MT bridges connecting adjacent MTs within a K-fiber are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. The morphology of inter-MT bridges is heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Booth et al., 2011</xref>), as noted in the original report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hepler et al., 1970</xref>). In order to examine the morphology of bridges in more detail, we used electron tomography of sections taken from mitotic HeLa cells fixed by high-pressure freezing/freeze substitution (HPF/FS). This gave a 3D view of the K-fiber MTs and the material that connected them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Careful examination of the tomograms revealed that inter-MT bridges are not just simple bipolar struts connecting two adjacent MTs: they are interconnected and can contact multiple MTs within the K-fiber. This network of inter-MT connectors is best illustrated by rendering the densities seen in the tomogram and visualizing the resultant computer model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

This method was used for all subsequent quantification. We found that mesh preservation was superior using HPF/FS compared with chemical fixation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, the mesh was associated with K-fiber MTs. In contrast, segmentation of non-K-fiber areas resulted in distinct, particulate density and translating MTs to a non-K-fiber area meant that globular density, which passed through the MTs, was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Ultrastructural morphology of the mesh</title><p>Having established a detection method, we next explored the anatomy of this novel subcellular structure. Three types of connectors within the mesh could be distinguished in these 3D models. Bipolar, tripolar, or quadrupolar connectors could be selected using the criterion of uninterrupted density that connects two, three, or four MTs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These connectors were highly heterogeneous in size. Where the volumes of individual connectors could be determined easily, we found that bipolar, tripolar, and quadrupolar connectors had mean volumes of 6,689, 17,370, and 32,376 nm<sup>3</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Therefore, there is not a linear relationship between the number of struts in a connector and the connector volume. The volume of mesh within each fiber was, on average, equivalent to the volume of MTs that it encapsulates and larger than the volume of MT walls alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

These larger, composite footprints extended for some distance along both linked MTs, but these were not confined to a co-axial line on the MT wall. Moreover, several mesh connectors could contact the same MT at the same axial position (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which further argues that the mesh has no preference for the MT seam.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Manipulating the mesh influences K-fiber organization</title><p>Previous work indicated that one component of the mesh is a complex of TACC3–ch-TOG–clathrin whose assembly is regulated by Aurora-A kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Booth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hood et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, the amount of this complex on K-fibers can be increased simply by overexpressing TACC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Booth et al., 2011</xref>).

The most obvious effect of this manipulation was to alter MT organization. K-fibers in cells expressing GFP-TACC3 had more MTs per fiber, and the cross-sectional area that those MTs occupied was larger, compared to fibers in control uninduced HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Both analyses showed that <italic>local</italic> MT packing density within the fiber had increased substantially in TACC3 overexpressing cells compared to uninduced controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), although the fibers themselves were larger overall. A simple manifestation of this tighter local packing was the increased frequency of doublet and triplet MTs within TACC3 overexpressing K-fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The median distance to the nearest neighboring MT had decreased from 56.1 to 48.1 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), a change in edge-to-edge proximity from 31.1 to 23.1 nm. This means that in TACC3 overexpressing cells, the average nearest neighboring MT is less than the width of one MT away. Because the overexpression of TACC3 alters the MT packing within the K-fiber, these experiments suggested to us that the mesh might influence MT spacing within the K-fiber. We return to the hypothesis that the mesh has an important role in MT spacing below.</p><p>Are the additional MTs in TACC3 overexpressing K-fibers stably attached to the kinetochore? To address this question, we used a 3D confocal microscopy assay of tubulin staining in the vicinity of kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheeseman et al., 2013</xref>). In agreement with the EM analysis, we detected a higher tubulin signal in cells expressing GFP-TACC3 compared to those expressing GFP alone. Following cold treatment, the tubulin intensity in the vicinity of kinetochores was reduced to comparable levels in both conditions, suggesting that the additional MTs in TACC3 overexpressing K-fibers are attached by mesh to the rest of the K-fiber but were not stably attached to the kinetochore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>Overexpression of TACC3 also increased the volume of mesh between K-fiber MTs in a tomogram to 5.2 ± 1.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> nm<sup>3</sup> (mean ± s.e.m.). This corresponds to 9.1 ± 0.01% of the fiber volume in the tomogram, whereas control mesh was 5.7 ± 0.01%. This change is somewhat difficult to interpret because of the significant increase in the number of MTs per fiber and the tighter local packing. More MTs per fiber might push up the volume of mesh, but the closer proximity of MTs limits the space available for mesh to be present.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Overexpression of TACC3 increases MT interconnectivity in K-fibers</title><p>One defining characteristic of the mesh is that it connects multiple MTs within K-fibers. This interconnectivity means that a MT that is contacted by the mesh is connected to one or more MTs and each of these, in turn, may be connected to one or more MTs and so on. We defined these connected MTs as ‘chains’. In uninduced cells, chain sizes were small, containing at most 6 MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). By contrast, cells overexpressing TACC3 had chains containing up to 12 MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting that the MTs were more interconnected as a result of TACC3 overexpression. Although MTs in TACC3 overexpressing K-fibers were more interconnected, the constitution of the connectors within the mesh was not noticeably altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Accordingly, we constructed 2D MT maps, where each MT's chain membership was displayed, and we compared these to the heat maps of local packing as previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The entire dataset was analyzed computationally in order to test the idea that chain membership depended on MT proximity. For each MT, we calculated the number of neighboring MTs within a given search radius and compared these values for single (‘unchained’) MTs and those that were part of a chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This analysis showed that in controls, the single MTs and chained MTs had similar numbers of neighbors, that is, meshed MTs were not more likely to be in tightly packed regions of the fiber. However, in the TACC3 overexpressing fibers, the MTs that were part of a chain had significantly more neighbors than single MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), this pattern was seen for search radii &gt;50 nm and was not seen if the dataset was randomized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, inset, see ‘Materials and methods’). The closer proximity of chained MTs vs single MTs indicates that the mesh influences MT positioning, effectively pulling them closer together. An alternative possibility is that the mesh is passive and only encapsulates MTs if they are in close proximity. However, this possibility is less likely because MTs in control fibers exhibit no difference in their proximity relative to their chain status.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Bundling of MTs by mesh components</title><p>The two possibilities for mesh stabilization of K-fibers are shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Fluorescently labeled MTs assembled in vitro and stabilized with taxol were incubated with proteins, and any effect on MT bundling was observed by light or EM. To reconstitute the mesh component containing TACC3, a protein mixture comprising clathrin, TACC3, ch-TOG, and GTSE1 was prepared and phosphorylated by Aurora-A kinase (see ‘Materials and methods’).

K-fibers are bundles of parallel MTs, and we sought to characterize how parallel the MTs are and to test if this is altered by TACC3 overexpression. Deviations from parallel would suggest that the mesh tethers MTs closer together and interferes with their trajectory. Qualitatively, we could see that MTs in TACC3 overexpressing K-fibers were more disorganized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). To measure parallelism more rigorously and to allow comparison of multiple K-fibers, we used several computational approaches (described in ‘Materials and methods’), which allowed us to normalize the 3D trajectory of each fiber and then examine the deviation of MT trajectories from this vector. K-fibers in cells overexpressing TACC3 had a higher proportion of MTs that deviate from parallel. They frequently had significantly larger polar angles compared to MTs in K-fibers from control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). The deviation of MTs from a completely parallel condition is easier to visualize, by examining the Cartesian intersection coordinates of each MT vector with an x-y plane at a given distance (z) from a common origin (see ‘Materials and methods’). These scatter plots show that MTs in TACC3 overexpressing cells deviate further from parallel than those in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The fraction of MT vectors intersecting this plane at radial distances of &lt;10 nm from the center is 0.39 and 0.18 in control and TACC3 overexpressing cells, respectively.

If they resided towards the periphery of the fiber, they may represent ‘extra MTs’, perhaps non-kinetochore MTs, that became enmeshed in the fiber when TACC3 was overexpressed. Alternatively, if the deviant MTs are throughout the fiber, this could be evidence for a role of the mesh in influencing MT spacing and packing within the fiber. To assess this, we plotted the polar and azimuthal angles as a function of distance from the K-fiber center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). These plots show that deviant MTs in TACC3 overexpressing cells are distributed at all distances from the center of the fiber. In controls, there was a weak tendency for deviant MTs to be at the fiber periphery, but the overall extent of trajectory deviancy was lower than in TACC3 overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,E</xref>). The lack of relation between distance from the fiber center and the deviancy from the fiber trajectory of MTs in fibers from TACC3 overexpressing cells indicates that the mesh plays an influential role in organizing MTs <italic>within</italic> the fiber. Together our results show that the change in composition of the mesh, caused by TACC3 overexpression, results in tighter local packing of MTs, more interconnectivity and disruption of the parallel organization of MTs within a K-fiber.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Mitotic problems associated with TACC3 overexpression</title><p>What are the functional consequences of the ultrastructural changes in MT organization <italic>within</italic> K-fibers? To address this question, we used live-cell imaging of our stable inducible cells expressing H2B-mCherry, growing asynchronously and compared mitotic progression in cells, where GFP-TACC3 expression was induced vs not induced. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> shows that TACC3 overexpression increases the time taken for cells to congress all chromosomes to the metaphase plate (prometaphase-to-metaphase). In addition, the time from last chromosome alignment to the onset of anaphase (metaphase-to-anaphase) is also longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). No change was seen in the duration of anaphase (anaphase-to-telophase).

We showed that the mesh is comprised of different connector types and is a major component of the K-fiber. Overexpression of TACC3 alters the mesh and changes the trajectory of MTs within the fiber, indicating that the mesh is a determinant of K-fiber structural integrity. This manipulation causes defects in mitosis and establishes that TACC3 levels at the spindle must be regulated for optimal mitosis.</p><p>Since the first EM studies of mitotic spindles, it has been clear that K-fiber MTs are held together throughout their length, presumably to function as an integrated unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hepler et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rieder, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Witt et al., 1981</xref>). The importance of inter-MT connections along the length of the K-fiber was demonstrated by severing K-fibers at their midpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Spurck et al., 1997</xref>). This resulted in two K-fiber stubs attached to the pole and kinetochore. The stubs do not immediately collapse but instead maintain their structural integrity. Our work identifying the mesh suggests that it is the structure that holds MTs together. This makes sense structurally, but there is a possibility that the mesh is passive and simply connects MTs in the fiber, wherever they may be. However, our work points to a role for the mesh in influencing MT position within the K-fiber. The evidence for this is: first, in K-fibers overexpressing TACC3, interconnected MTs are closer together than those not contacted by mesh. Second, a complex containing TACC3 was able to bundle MTs in vitro. Third, mesh in TACC3 overexpressing fibers pulls MTs out of alignment. In this way, the mesh plays an active role in MT positioning in K-fibers by favoring inter-MT interactions of defined distances. An extension of this is that the mesh can actively pull MTs together, in an energy-consuming process. We have no evidence for this intriguing possibility, which is compatible with our findings.</p><p>It seems counterintuitive that overexpression of a mesh component results in skewed MTs; shouldn't it make the MTs in the fiber ‘more parallel’? However, it is likely that the mesh is made of other proteins, besides the TACC3–ch-TOG–clathrin complex, for example, CHD4, HURP/DLGAP5, and HSET/KIFC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mountain et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sharp et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Koffa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yokoyama et al., 2013</xref>). We favor the idea that because we have increased only one component of the mesh experimentally and not others, we do not see uniform changes in spacing and packing. This seems plausible as previous analysis determined TACC3–ch-TOG–clathrin was the shortest crosslinks in K-fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Booth et al., 2011</xref>), and so an imbalance of connector sizes in the mesh is predicted to skew MT trajectories.</p><p>The spindle matrix was originally proposed as a microtrabecular lattice that assists the motors and MTs of the mitotic spindle during chromosome movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pickett-Heaps et al., 1982</xref>). The existence of the matrix has been elusive, although several large macromolecular complexes have been proposed as matrix components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pickett-Heaps et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ma et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Johansen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schweizer et al., 2014</xref>). Although superficially similar, we do not think that the K-fiber mesh is the ultrastructural correlate of the spindle matrix. The mesh that we have observed exists between MTs within K-fibers (rather than between K-fibers) and is most likely composed of MT-associated proteins that function on K-fiber MTs. Most models of the spindle matrix envisage an elastic milieu that encompasses the entire spindle, yet is independent of the MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Scholey et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yao et al., 2012</xref>). Despite this, micromanipulation experiments have left open the possibility that an anisotropic matrix could exist along K-fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gatlin et al., 2010</xref>), and this would be compatible with our observations. The K-fiber mesh is in agreement with theoretical and experimental work showing that lateral MT connectors are important for MT arrays to sustain physical forces in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brangwynne et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We used overexpression of TACC3 as our primary tool to manipulate the mesh. Progression through mitosis is slower under these conditions due to problems in chromosome congression and satisfying the spindle assembly checkpoint. Interestingly, a similar phenotype is observed when TACC3 is depleted from the spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Booth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheeseman et al., 2013</xref>). This indicates that mitosis is sensitive to TACC3 levels. We propose that this sensitivity reflects the robustness of the K-fibers. Too little TACC3–ch-TOG–clathrin and the mesh cannot strengthen the fibers adequately. Too much, and the MTs within the fibers become less parallel and oversupported. Previous work has suggested that hyperstabilization of K-fibers is counter-productive, leading to errors in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bakhoum et al., 2009</xref>). TACC3 levels are altered in several human cancers, for example, ovarian, non-small cell lung cancer, and bladder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>), and fusions between TACC3 and FGFR3 are reported in glioblastoma and bladder cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Singh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Williams et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, the amount of TACC3–ch-TOG–clathrin at the spindle is limited by the availability of phosphorylated TACC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">LeRoy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hood et al., 2013</xref>), and since Aurora-A kinase is amplified or upregulated in a wide range of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nikonova et al., 2013</xref>), it is possible that hyperstabilization of K-fibers occurs in these cells. Under any of these conditions, erroneous mitosis leading to aneuploidy may contribute to cancer initiation or progression. While we favor the idea that normal mitosis requires optimal K-fiber stabilization by the mesh, it must be noted that TACC3 has at least one additional function in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gutiérrez-Caballero et al., 2015</xref>), and future work will seek to delineate the role of TACC3 in the mesh vs at the MT plus-ends.</p><p>Identifying and locating proteins within the mesh is the next challenge. Potentially, 3D views of K-fibers in situ will allow us to dock molecular structures of mesh components as has been achieved for other cellular systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lucic et al., 2013</xref>). Methods to unambiguously assign specific electron density to a particular protein will enable us to achieve this, and efforts are currently underway in our lab to do this.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell Biology</title><p>HeLa cells (HPA/ECACC #93021013) were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin, in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>For TACC3 overexpression, HeLa Tet-On cells (Clontech, Takara, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France) were used to inducibly express GFP-TACC3.

Each MT was rendered individually by hand, and then any 3D density connecting the MTs was automatically detected throughout the volume of the tomogram, using the average gray value of the MTs as an initial threshold for segmentation. The space between MTs in a K-fiber is less granular than the surrounding cytoplasm, which improves mesh detection. This unbiased method superseded our initial attempts at hand-rendering the mesh and allowed for unbiased quantification and visualization of the mesh. Note that measurements are taken from the unsmoothed segmentation maps. The segmentation method detects unbroken density connected to MTs. However, after smoothing for visualization, breaks in the mesh appear. In Amira, MTs were smoothed using unconstrained smoothing, and the mesh was rendered with smooth surface (50 iterations, 0.6 lambda). Hand-rendered mesh in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> was smoothed with constrained smoothing and then smooth surface generated (20 iterations, 0.6 lambda).</p><p>In longitudinal sections, K-fibers were defined as bundles of MTs contacting both the kinetochore and the pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McDonald et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Booth et al., 2013</xref>). In orthogonal sections, K-fiber bundles were defined as collections of 10 or more MTs, using an 80 nm boundary around each MT (105 nm from the MT center).

The distance to the nearest neighboring MT and the number of MTs within 80 nm (105 nm from the MT center) were calculated. Heat maps were generated by Voronoi interpolation of 3D coordinate sets that comprised the x-y coordinates together with the number of MTs within 80 nm in the z dimension.</p><p>To analyze the mesh connections and MT chaining, individual connections in rendered tomograms were classified and recorded together with the chain sizes for each K-fiber. Coordinate sets were supplemented with chain membership data. This was used for an automated comparison of the number of neighboring MTs within a given search radius, comparing chained vs single MTs. The analysis was performed from 20 to 120 nm, and non-parametric Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney two-sample rank test used to test the hypothesis that there was no difference in the number of neighboring MTs. Chain membership data were then randomized and the analysis repeated.

Custom-written procedures ran through the following steps. First, coordinates were compiled into individual MT matrices. Second, the center of the bundle was found using farthest-point clustering, and then the distance of each MT from this point was calculated. Third, the fiber direction was ‘normalized’, that is, rotated through 3D space so that most MTs pointed towards the zenith.

Fourth, a 2D plot to visualize the degree of MT deviancy was generated. To do this, the point at which each 3D MT vector starting at the origin intersects an x-y plane that was set arbitrarily at z = 100 nm was calculated and plotted. Note that the even radial dispersal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and the even spread of azimuthal angles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> show that capture of tilt series was randomized, and the data set has no bias towards a particular trajectory. Several other strategies were explored to analyze deviations in trajectory vs the fiber axis. These were: examining the variance in trajectory angles, pairwise comparison of all MTs in the bundle, and comparison to a reference MT that represented the fiber axis, using spherical rotation and rotating by an average value. These produced similar results, however, the one described here was the most robust and represents our best method for this kind of spatial statistical analysis. The computer code used in the main analysis pipeline can be found as a <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Source code 1</xref>.</p><p>Images were cropped in Photoshop, and figures were assembled in Illustrator CS5.1.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: J Richard McIntosh and Helder Maiato. A further reviewer remains anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is an interesting and one can even say “courageous” paper. Most cell biologists like to work on defined proteins or periodic structures that allow experimental rigor by established criteria. This paper describes work on a component of the mitotic spindle that certainly exists and some of whose components are known, but whose structure is ill-defined and therefore very hard to study. This group has been pursuing aspects of the inter-microtubule “mesh” seen in kinetochore fibers for some time, and this paper takes that work a big step along. However, before the paper can be published, some additional analyses and clarifications are required.</p><p>1) While the 3D rendering of the mesh suggests interaction with up to 4 microtubules, careful inspection of the electron densities in the tomograms corresponding to bridges involving more than 2 microtubules is not very convincing from the images provided. For instance, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, quadrupolar and tripolar bridges are often interrupted, but are shown as continuous electron densities in the 3D rendered images. Because the criterion of uninterrupted density was chosen for this classification, the authors need to explain why this is not visible in the tripolar and quadrupolar connections and clarify if any threshold was used for 3D-rendering.</p><p>2) The authors should show how the mesh compares to an area without microtubules in the spindle and, ideally, to non-kinetochore microtubules. This is important to understand whether the features revealed are specific for K-fibers, as they claim.</p><p>3) The authors should characterize K-fiber stability (even if by just a crude cold assay) after TACC3 overexpression. If possible, it would also be nice to compare the results with TACC3 depletion.</p><p>4) The decision of the authors to use populations of cells synchronized by thymidine and then RO-3306 (both for 16 hrs) in the analysis of control K-fibers is somewhat puzzling. 16 hrs of late G2 arrest is not benign. For example, centrosome organization becomes abnormal. This in turn affects the organization of the mitotic spindle. Whether the fine structure of K-fibers is affected is not known but there is a danger that it is. The procedure used and its justification should be clearly explained in the main text of the paper.</p><p>5) The in vitro reconstitution experiments are performed with a rather ill-defined mixture of four components. The authors should at least illustrate the quality of the individual proteins by Coomassie-stained gels.

For instance, in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1A</italic></xref><italic>, quadrupolar and tripolar bridges are often interrupted, but are shown as continuous electron densities in the 3D rendered images. Because the criterion of uninterrupted density was chosen for this classification, the authors need to explain why this is not visible in the tripolar and quadrupolar connections and clarify if any threshold was used for 3D-rendering</italic>.</p><p>The segmentation of K-fiber mesh works by connecting uninterrupted density that touches MTs, in 3D. When we show a single orthoslice (one x-y slice in a tomogram) it is not possible to see the density that exists above and below. In this case the connector appears broken. An additional issue is that when the segmented connector is very thin, the smoothing that we use to generate the 3D-rendering results in breaks in the connector. In the assessment of connector frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), we were conservative in our classification. We carefully checked each connector individually and only where we could see clear uninterrupted density connecting 2-4 MTs, did we assign the connector.</p><p><italic>2) The authors should show how the mesh compares to an area without microtubules in the spindle and, ideally, to non-kinetochore microtubules. This is important to understand whether the features revealed are specific for K-fibers, as they claim</italic>.</p><p>We have added a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>) to address the question of specificity of the mesh for K-fibers. K-fibers are typically in low noise areas of the cytoplasm and this simplifies the detection of mesh associated with K-fiber MTs. Our segmentation method works by detecting density that is connected to MTs. If we break this rule and simply detect in a non-K-fiber region, any density using the same threshold, we pick up particulate material which looks different to the mesh (“non-mesh”, brown, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2A</xref>). Another test we employed early on to give us confidence in mesh detection was to move the segmented MTs to a non-K-fiber area and do the mesh detection. When we do this, we again pick up the particulate density and this amorphous material runs through the lumens of the MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2B</xref>). These images support the idea that the mesh is genuine and associated with MTs, although they do not deal with the specificity for K-fibers versus non-kinetochore MTs. Due to the magnification used for imaging, we do not have many tomograms, which feature MTs where we can be certain that they are not part of a K-fiber. Our feeling is that there is density between non-K-fiber MTs but that it is less abundant, since there are fewer MTs running together—2-6 MTs interpolar MTs in PtK1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mastronarde et al., 1993</xref>)—and therefore less interconnectivity of MTs.</p><p><italic>3) The authors should characterize K-fiber stability (even if by just a crude cold assay) after TACC3 overexpression. If possible, it would also be nice to compare the results with TACC3 depletion</italic>.</p><p>We have carried out a cold-stable assay to assess stable attachment of MTs in cells expressing GFP or GFP-TACC3. These experiments confirmed the “more MTs per K-fiber” as seen by EM. They also showed that after cold treatment there was a similar amount of tubulin in the vicinity of the kinetochores. This was a very useful piece of information (now added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). It suggests that the additional MTs seen in K-fibers overexpressing GFP-TACC3 are “passengers” and are not stably attached to the kinetochore. The assay did not indicate that K-fibers are more stable under conditions of TACC3 over-expression, although to really get at this we would need to challenge the K-fibers with depolymerization (using a range of conditions) at different timepoints during spindle assembly. We have previously shown that clathrin depletion, which also removes the complex from spindles, results in K-fibers that are less stable under cold-treatment conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Royle et al., 2005</xref>). We also think that further molecular characterization is needed to test what extent the mesh contributes to K-fiber stability.</p><p><italic>4) The decision of the authors to use populations of cells synchronized by thymidine and then RO-3306 (both for 16 hrs) in the analysis of control K-fibers is somewhat puzzling. 16 hrs of late G2 arrest is not benign. For example, centrosome organization becomes abnormal. This in turn affects the organization of the mitotic spindle. Whether the fine structure of K-fibers is affected is not known but there is a danger that it is. The procedure used and its justification should be clearly explained in the main text of the paper</italic>.</p><p>For our EM analysis, enrichment of mitotic cells was necessary because we were freezing and sectioning blind to the state of the cells. The controlled release and shake-off allowed us to capture a reasonably pure population of cells at metaphase. It is true that very long arrest with RO3306 (40 h) is detrimental (Loncarek et al., 2010). Shorter arrests like ours (16 h) are not without problems, resulting in 16/44 cells with bipolar spindles in one study (Prosser et al., 2012). It is not known whether multipolar spindles have any difference in the fine structure of the K-fibers compared to bipolar spindles.</p><p>To address this point, we have analyzed K-fibers from cells prepared in two different ways and the results suggest that the RO3306 arrest is valid. In the first, we synchronized HeLa cells using nocodazole arrest (16 h) and release; the K-fibers under these conditions are indistinguishable from those in the present study. Secondly, we have begun correlative light-electron microscopy analysis using HPF/FS and tomography of unsynchronized cells. Although we haven’t repeated every aspect of the current study, the K-fibers and mesh are again similar to those reported here.</p><p><italic>5) The in vitro reconstitution experiments are performed with a rather ill-defined mixture of four components. The authors should at least illustrate the quality of the individual proteins by Coomassie-stained gels. They should also explain in the main text why they think that all four components need to be added to observe microtubule bundling, whether the HIS-tags present on the individual proteins can contribute to microtubule bundling and also explain the rationale of adding ch-TOG in sub-stoichiometric amounts compared to the other components. Do the authors have any indications that the four components purified by them indeed form a (defined) complex in vitro</italic>?</p><p>To address these comments we have added two new figure supplements to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. The first figure supplement highlights the limitations in the approach used in the manuscript, while the second describes an alternative way to demonstrate in vitro bundling of MTs by our complex.</p><p><italic>How specific is the bundling</italic>?</p><p>First, incubation of MTs with ch-TOG at higher concentrations (∼50 nM) caused bundling of MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1A</xref>). This is why we limited the concentration of ch-TOG to 10 nM in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Second, GTSE1 sometimes caused bundling at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1B</xref>). In an experiment where 10 nM GTSE1 and 10 nM ch-TOG caused no bundling, we could see clear bundling with the addition of clathrin and TACC3, with concentrations of GTSE1 down to 1 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). We do not think that the His tags can contribute to bundling at the concentrations used, since our controls have equivalent amount of His. However, we cannot rule out that His in combination with MAPs causes bundling whereas His in combination with MBP and GST does not.</p><p>A further limitation is that the purity of our recombinant proteins is not ideal. The quality of the protein preps used for these experiments is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1E</xref> as requested. We also did not assess whether the purified components form a complex for the bundling experiments.</p><p><italic>An alternative method</italic>:</p><p>The key issue here is whether the spindle complex that contains TACC3 and clathrin is able to bundle MTs in vitro. To answer this, we purified the complex from mitotic spindle fractions using the immunoisolation method that we used to originally identify the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Booth et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, clathrin was immunoprecipitated from mitotic cytosol (F1) or spindle fractions (F5-7). TACC3 was only associated with clathrin in the spindle fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>). These complexes were used for MT bundling experiments. We could see bundling of MTs by clathrin complexes from spindle fraction (F5-7) but not from cytosol (F1). Control anti-myc beads from F1 or F5-7 did not cause bundling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>). Since this approach uses untagged proteins, presumably in their native complex, we think this is strong evidence that the complex can bundle MTs in vitro.</p><p>Finally, in further support of the idea that this complex can bundle MTs, we have previously shown (modest) bundling activity when YFP-CHC(1-574) and TACC3(519-838) fragments are phosphorylated by Aurora A kinase and incubated with fluorescent MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hood et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Minor concerns:</p><p><italic>1) We couldn't find information about the mitotic stage in which the EM analysis was performed and how K-fibers were identified</italic>.</p><p>This is now clarified in the Methods section. We released cells from RO3306 for 30-40 min at 37°C. After shake-off and pelleting this gave mainly metaphase cells in either the control or the TACC3-overexpressed condition. K-fibers were identified as bundles of &gt;10 MTs in sections taken approximately orthogonal to the spindle axis. This is now stated under Electron Microscopy. The Data Analysis part of the Methods section explains how K-fibers were identified.</p><p><italic>2) In the Introduction, the authors mention that: “chromosome movements are governed by the kinetochore fibers (K-fibers) of the mitotic spindle”. Not all chromosome movements are governed by K-fibers.

By light microscopy, the signals for GFP-tagged TACC3, clathrin and ch-TOG disappear concomitantly with the mCherry-tubulin signal.

In light of this fast exchange, it is perhaps not too surprising that these mesh components do not hang around following MT depolymerization. Finally, related to point 2 above, we are not able to detect mesh in tomograms where there are no MTs, e.g. after depolymerization. This is because our segmentation method works by identifying density that is in contact with MTs. So, while we cannot definitively rule out that the mesh remains after MT depolymerization, we can say that at least this molecular component of the mesh is not resistant to MT depolymerization.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07635.024</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis of TACC3 dynamics in mitotic cells.</title><p>(A) Average FRAP traces for metaphase cells expressing GFP-tubulin and either mCherry-clathin light chain a or mCherry-TACC3.

In short, increasing TACC3 expression dials up the amount of the complex on the spindle.</p></body></sub-article></article>
