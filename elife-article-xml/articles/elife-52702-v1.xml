Neural circuits that underlie aggressive behavior are therefore likely under the control of sex-determining genes. However, the neurogenetic mechanism that generates sex-specific aggressive behavior remains largely unknown. Here, we found that a neuronal class specified by one of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> sex determining genes, <italic>fruitless</italic> (<italic>fru</italic>), belongs to the neural circuit that generates male-type aggressive behavior. This neuronal class can promote aggressive behavior independent of another sex determining gene, <italic>doublesex</italic> (<italic>dsx</italic>), although <italic>dsx</italic> is involved in ensuring that aggressive behavior is performed only toward males. We also found that three <italic>fru</italic> isoforms with different DNA binding domains show a division of labor on male aggressive behaviors. A dominant role of <italic>fru</italic> in specifying sex-specific aggressive behavior may underscore a genetic mechanism that allows male-type aggressive behavior to evolve at least partially independently from courtship behavior, which is under different selective pressures.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sexual dimorphism</kwd><kwd>social behavior</kwd><kwd>aggression</kwd><kwd>courtship</kwd><kwd>doublesex</kwd><kwd>fruitless</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM119844</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ishii</surname><given-names>Kenichi</given-names></name><name><surname>Asahina</surname><given-names>Kenta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC015577</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wohl</surname><given-names>Margot</given-names></name><name><surname>Asahina</surname><given-names>Kenta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007428</institution-id><institution>Naito Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ishii</surname><given-names>Kenichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ishii</surname><given-names>Kenichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001538</institution-id><institution>Mary K.

It is mostly males that perform agonistic behaviors, which are often ritualized, to gain access to mating partners. Some species have even developed male-specific weaponry organs to gain advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rico-Guevara and Hurme, 2018</xref>). Although these inter-male aggressive behaviors must have evolved to increase fitness, the effect on sexual selection is likely indirect. Unlike courtship behavior, which is selected directly through female preference, females can choose only the end result of inter-male contest and not the aggressive behavior itself. Another distinction of aggressive behavior from courtship behavior is that it can be exhibited by both males and females, but the motor programs are often sexually dimorphic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hashikawa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nilsen et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, males are aggressive almost exclusively towards other conspecific males, and not towards females. In other words, aggressive behavior is sexually dimorphic, and its execution is strongly influenced by the sex of the target animal.</p><p>The sexually dimorphic nature of aggressive behavior predicts the existence of sexually dimorphic neuronal circuits that support this behavior. Both in mice and flies, mutations in genes with sexually dimorphic expression patterns, including sex-determining genes or steroid sex hormone receptors, can alter aggressive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Juntti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ogawa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vrontou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). Neurons expressing sex-determining genes also influence aggressive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asahina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan and Kravitz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deutsch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hashikawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koganezawa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Palavicino-Maggio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yang et al., 2013</xref>), which is consistent with the above prediction that male-type aggression and female-type aggression may be generated through distinct neural circuits. However, sexual dimorphisms within neurons or circuits that are causally responsible for the generation of sexually dimorphic behavior remain unclear. The genetic and neuronal mechanisms which ensure a male only executes aggressive behaviors towards a male target is not well understood either. Although sex-specific sensory cues seem to play critical roles for both mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chamero et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hattori et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stowers et al., 2002</xref>) and flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernández et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang and Anderson, 2010</xref>), how the sensory information affects the operation of circuits that generate sexually dimorphic aggressive actions is largely uncharacterized.</p><p>Sexual dimorphism of aggressive behavior in the common fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has been well documented. Males perform aggressive behaviors almost exclusively to one another with a higher intensity than inter-female aggressive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nilsen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vrontou et al., 2006</xref>). Attack actions are also dimorphic: a male fly often perform lunges, in which it raises its front legs and pounces down toward a target fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dow and von Schilcher, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoyer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jacobs, 1960</xref>), whereas a female fly performs headbutts, in which it quickly moves its body horizontally and hits a target with its head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nilsen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ueda and Kidokoro, 2002</xref>). Sex of <italic>Drosophila</italic> is determined by two genes that encode transcription factors, <italic>doublesex</italic> (<italic>dsx</italic>) and <italic>fruitless</italic> (<italic>fru</italic>). These two genes undergo sex-specific splicing to produce male-specific (dsxM, fruM) and female-specific (dsxF, fruF) transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yamamoto and Koganezawa, 2013</xref>). <italic>fru</italic> further undergoes another round of alternative splicing among at least 3 different zing finger DNA binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Usui-Aoki et al., 2000</xref>). <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic> collectively specify anatomical and behavioral sexual dimorphisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marín and Baker, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yamamoto and Koganezawa, 2013</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, several classes of sexually dimorphic neurons, which express <italic>dsx</italic> or <italic>fru</italic> (or both), are implicated in aggressive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asahina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan and Kravitz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deutsch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koganezawa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Palavicino-Maggio et al., 2019</xref>). An outstanding question is which of these neurons are critical for the execution of male-type or female-type aggressive behaviors. Results we present in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ishii et al. (2020)</xref> support the hypothesis that <italic>dsx</italic> specifies an execution mechanism for male courtship behavior, while <italic>fru</italic> specifies neural circuits underlying sexually dimorphic aggressive actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vrontou et al., 2006</xref>). Currently, however, it remains unclear which, if any, of the <italic>fru</italic>-expressing neurons constitutes the execution mechanism for male-type aggressive behavior.</p><p>Here, we characterized Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asahina et al., 2014</xref>) as a part of a fruM-dependent neural circuit that generates male-type aggressive behavior. Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons are <italic>fru</italic>-expressing, male-specific neurons that are not only capable of promoting male-type aggressive behavior, but also are necessary for spontaneous male aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asahina et al., 2014</xref>). We first found that Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons are specified solely by <italic>fru</italic>. We then demonstrated that the activation of Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons elicited male-type aggressive behaviors irrespective of <italic>dsx</italic> genotype. However, <italic>dsx</italic> has a role in refining the application specificity of male-type aggressive behaviors toward a male target fly. We also characterized the impact of different <italic>fru</italic> isoforms on male aggression. We found that only one of the three <italic>fru</italic> isoforms is necessary for the specification of Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons, while another isoform is necessary to perform spontaneous aggressive behaviors. The dominant role of <italic>fru</italic> in specifying the circuit for executing sex-specific aggressive behavior is in contrast to the importance of <italic>dsx</italic> for the execution mechanism for courtship behavior. The distinct roles of <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic> on the specification of courtship- and aggression-controlling neurons can be the genetic basis underlying evolution of beneficial behaviors for inter-male contests while preserving species-specificity for courtship behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>fruM specifies aggression-promoting Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons</title><p>Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons are male-specific <italic>fru</italic>-expressing neurons that not only promote male-type aggressive behavior upon activation, but also are necessary for normal levels of male aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asahina et al., 2014</xref>). We first characterized the behavioral impact of optogenetic activation of these neurons in the presence of male or female target flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), because sex of the target fly can be an important biological variable in determining the function of social behavior-controlling neurons.

The tester flies increased the time orienting toward the target female during LED stimulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D<sub>1</sub></xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B1</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref> – Part 2), suggesting that the activation of Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons can promote interaction regardless of the sex of the target fly.

We next addressed the role of <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) on specifying Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons. Two splicing mutations for <italic>fru</italic>, <italic>fru<sup>M</sup></italic> and <italic>fru<sup>F</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Demir and Dickson, 2005</xref>), forces male-type (fruM) and female-type (fruF) splicing of <italic>fru</italic> transcripts irrespective of the chromosomal sex composition, which normally determines the sex-determination genetic cascade. As a result, these mutations allowed us to create ‘fruF males’ (expressing dsxM and fruF) and ‘fruM females’ (expressing dsxF and fruM), thus dissociating contributions of <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic> on sexual dimorphism at the organismal level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). fruM females are reported to show lunges and other male-type aggressive actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vrontou et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that <italic>fru</italic> is the chief architect of neural circuits underlying sexually dimorphism in aggressive behavior. However, two <italic>fru</italic>-expressing, aggression-promoting neurons (male-type NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koganezawa et al., 2016</xref>) and P1<sup>a</sup> neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>) are not specified in this genotype (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ishii et al., 2020</xref>). These observations strongly suggest that not all <italic>fru</italic>-expressing neurons underlie the sexual dimorphism of aggressive actions, even if the activation of such neurons in a normal male induces male-type aggressive behavior. Other neuronal populations specified by <italic>fru</italic>, but not <italic>dsx</italic>, must constitute a neural substrate for the execution mechanism for male-type aggression.</p><p>In contrast to male-type NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons or P1<sup>a</sup> neurons, Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons were present in fruM females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), but not in fruF males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Consistent with this observation, we detected expression of FruM, but not Dsx, proteins in Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). The cell body number of Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons in fruM females was indistinguishable from that in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). To compare Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neuronal morphology in males and fruM females, we first traced Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons using a volume visualization software FluoRender (see Materials and methods for details). The distinct neuronal processes of Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons allowed us to segment them in an unambiguous manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>3</sub></xref>). We then registered the original and segmented confocal images of brains to a unisex standard brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bogovic et al., 2018</xref>) using non-rigid spatial transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jefferis et al., 2007</xref>).

The averaged morphology of registered Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons from males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>) and from fruM females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>) appeared virtually identical (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>).

First, lunges were not induced in fruM females as consistently as in males. Forty-two percent (17/40) of fruM females did not perform a single lunge after LED stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, over 96% of male testers lunged toward a male target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The median of induced lunges observed in fruM females (2) was lower than observed for male testers (58). Second, fruM females occasionally lunged toward a female target (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref> – Part 2), in addition to a fruF male target. Even though lunges were induced even less frequently than toward fruF males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A2</xref>, 2B<sub>2</sub>), it is still noteworthy because male testers seldom lunge toward a female target, even after optogenetic activation of the <italic>Tk-GAL4<sup>1</sup></italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D<sub>2</sub></xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We noticed that headbutts performed by the female target toward these testers often outnumbered the lunges performed by the tester toward the target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). This was not the case when the target flies were fruF males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). These counter-attacks by female targets may have contributed to the lower number of lunges toward female targets than toward fruF male targets.</p><p>We asked whether social isolation, which elevates levels of aggression in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoffmann, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2008</xref>), could enhance the induction of lunges. Interestingly, optogenetic activation of <italic>Tk-GAL4<sup>1</sup></italic>-labeled neurons in single-housed fruM females failed to induce a single lunge toward fruF male targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C2</xref> F<sub>2</sub>). Instead, this manipulation resulted in higher levels of orientation and wing extensions than was exhibited by group-housed flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C1</xref>, C<sub>3</sub>). These data suggest that the relatively high levels of courtship behavior seen in fruM females interferes with the aggression-promoting function of Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons. Consistent with this idea, group-housed fruM females that did not lunge toward a target fly after optogenetic stimulation of <italic>Tk-GAL4<sup>1</sup></italic>-labeled neurons tended to show higher levels of wing extensions than testers who lunged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3E</xref>, F<sub>1</sub>). Lastly, optogenetic activation of Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons did not induce headbutts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A3</xref>, B<sub>3</sub>), confirming that this genotype is using a male-type aggressive action exclusively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vrontou et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the results above delineate complementary roles of <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic> on male aggressive behavior. The activation of Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons induces lunges even in the absence of <italic>dsx</italic>-dependent aggression-promoting neurons. Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons are therefore part of a fruM-dependent execution mechanism for male aggressive behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). However, the reduced intensity and compromised target sex selectivity of lunges shown by fruM females suggest that a <italic>dsx</italic>-dependent mechanism may play a role in establishing a target sex-selective application of aggressive behavior. This mechanism can inhibit the execution of lunges specifically toward females, which ensures that lunges are performed exclusively by males towards other males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), or can enhance aggression specifically toward male targets indirectly by inhibiting courtship toward them.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Female-type NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons in fruM females do not promote aggression</title><p>Having established that Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons can trigger lunges independent of <italic>dsx</italic> splicing pattern, we wondered whether other sexually dimorphic neurons are involved in the execution of male-type aggressive behaviors in the fruM female brain.

If fruM’s role in defining sexual dimorphism in aggression prevails, activation of NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons in fruM may promote male-type aggression (lunges) even though these neurons exhibit female-type morphology. If the morphology of NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons dictates the sexual dimorphic action of aggressive behavior, the same manipulation may promote female-type aggressive actions (headbutts).</p><p>Interestingly, we did not observe induction of either lunges or headbutts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D2</xref> and E<sub>2,3</sub>) when we optogenetically activated the NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons in fruM females. Thus, female-type NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons can promote headbutts only if other mechanisms that rely on sexually dimorphic splicing of <italic>fru</italic> are present in the brain. In addition, this result suggests that NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons with female-like morphology fail to establish functional connections with neurons that are part of the fruM-dependent execution mechanism for male-type aggression (which includes Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>We therefore conclude that female-like NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons cannot participate in generation of aggressive behavior (e.g. headbutts) without separate populations of neurons that are specified in the absence of fruM. This finding raises a possibility that the sexual dimorphism of NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons, which is largely specified by <italic>dsx</italic>, does not determine the sexual dimorphism of aggressive actions. It is also possible that activities of both <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic> may be required for the complete functional transformation of NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons.

To address this possibility, we optogenetically activated <italic>Tk-GAL4<sup>1</sup></italic>-labeled neurons in fruMA, fruMB, or fruMC mutants. Optogenetic activation of <italic>Tk-GAL4<sup>1</sup></italic>-labeled neurons in fruMB mutants elicited robust levels of male aggression across several LED intensities, as seen in genetic controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). This result suggests that Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons in fruMB mutants, once activated, can induce male aggression as efficiently as in the <italic>fru</italic> wild-type males, and argues against the hypothesis that the mutation of fruMB proteins causes defective development of downstream neurons or reduced efficiency of Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons to excite downstream neurons. Instead, these results favor the alternative hypothesis that fruMB mutation reduces aggression-promoting input to Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons from upstream circuits. This is likely mediated through fruM-dependent mechanisms as well, since activation of Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons can completely overcome the lack of such input.</p><p>Overall, our results show that three isoforms of fruM assume distinct roles in the specification and function of sexually dimorphic neurons that control male-type aggressive behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Namely, fruMC is necessary for the specification of Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons, whereas fruMB is necessary for a normal level of spontaneous aggression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we identified Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons as part of a fruM-dependent execution mechanism for male-type aggression. The exclusive role of fruM on the specification of a neural circuit for the execution of male-type aggression is in contrast to the circuit for the execution of male-type courtship behavior, for which <italic>dsx</italic> plays a major role (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ishii et al., 2020</xref>). One role of <italic>dsx</italic> on male-type aggression appears to be to prevent inappropriate aggression toward a female target, which suggests that <italic>dsx</italic> may be involved in the sex-recognition mechanism in the context of agonistic interactions. Furthermore, we found that each of three fruM isoforms play separable roles on male-type aggressive behavior. Our finding reveals a layered genetic mechanism of the <italic>fru</italic> gene for the specification and function of a sexually dimorphic aggression-controlling circuit, which may provide a genetic substrate for the male-specific evolution of contest rituals.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title><italic>fru</italic> specifies a neural circuit for sexually dimorphic aggressive actions</title><p>We found that the optogenetic activation of Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons in fruM female tester flies induced male-type aggressive behavior. This result indicates that at least Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons and downstream populations form a neural circuit that is sufficient for the execution of male-type aggressive behavior. While this does not necessarily mean that fruF males or females lack the capability to execute male-type aggressive behavior, there has been no report that these two sex genotypes perform lunges spontaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vrontou et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, female-type NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons fail to promote aggressive behaviors (lunges or headbutts) in fruM females. NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons were previously proposed to be the ‘aggression output’ of a switch circuit that selects between courtship and aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koganezawa et al., 2016</xref>). Since stimulation of NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons in fruF males did not trigger lunges (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ishii et al., 2020</xref>), at least sexual dimorphism in the neuroanatomy of NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons does not correlate with the sexual dimorphism in aggressive motor programs. These observations favor a hypothesis that neurons specified by <italic>fru</italic>, which include Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons, form the execution mechanism for male-type aggressive action, and NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons serve as modulatory neurons that act on this <italic>fru</italic>-dependent execution mechanism. Sex-specific splicing of <italic>fru</italic> defines what type of aggressive behavior an animal performs, likely by specifying a mutually exclusive neural circuit that generates either male-type or female-type aggressive actions.</p><p>The definitive role of <italic>fru</italic> in specifying the execution mechanism for aggression does not mean that <italic>dsx</italic> is irrelevant. In fact, fruM females lunge against females as well as fruF males, suggesting that <italic>dsx</italic> is important for suppressing inappropriate aggressive behavior toward a female target. Currently, we do not know whether it is the presence of dsxM, or the absence of dsxF, that is critical. Intriguingly, however, <italic>dsx</italic>-expressing neurons respond to sex-specific sensory cues, such as olfactory, gustatory, and auditory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deutsch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Since thermogenetic activation of Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons induces lunges toward a male target that lacks cuticular hydrocarbons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asahina et al., 2014</xref>), one possible scenario is that a <italic>dsx</italic>-dependent circuit is responsible for detection or transmission of female-specific, aggression-suppressing cues that have yet to be identified. Alternatively, <italic>dsx</italic> in males may allow execution of male-type aggressive behavior specifically toward male targets indirectly by inhibiting courtship behavior toward males. fruM females that showed high levels of courtship behavior generally showed low levels of male-type aggression. This observation suggests that courtship behavior can interfere with aggressive behavior, possibly through feedforward inhibitory circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clowney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kallman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koganezawa et al., 2016</xref>). Regardless of the mechanism, our results uncover distinct roles of <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic> on male-type aggressive behavior.</p><p>The contribution of <italic>dsx</italic> on the target sex-selective execution of aggressive behavior also implies that information about target sex can be supplied downstream of Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neuronal activities and modify its behavioral influence. Currently, it remains unclear how the stimulation of Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons is transformed into lunges, because the downstream partners of Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons have not been characterized yet. It is possible that <italic>dsx</italic>-specified neurons serve as a ‘block’ against neuronal activity generated by Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons and other unidentified constituents of the lunge execution mechanism. Since <italic>fru</italic>-expressing neurons have been comprehensively characterized in the male brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cachero et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yu et al., 2010</xref>), it may be necessary to establish an equally detailed catalog of <italic>dsx</italic>-expressing neurons for uncovering the neural mechanism by which male-type aggressive behavior is controlled in a target sex-dependent manner.</p><p>The neuronal population that supports execution of female-type aggressive behaviors has begun to be characterized only recently. Consistent with a previous observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koganezawa et al., 2016</xref>), we observed that NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons in females promote female-type aggression. This population belongs to a cluster of <italic>dsx</italic>-expressing ‘pC1’ neurons, which is known to promote a variety of female social behaviors including aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deutsch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Palavicino-Maggio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Robie et al., 2017</xref>), receptivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deutsch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>) or even courtship-like behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rezával et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). In spite of the importance of ‘pC1’ neurons collectively on female social behaviors, female-type NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons are unlikely to be a part of the execution mechanism that generates female-type aggressive actions. Our results suggest that there are uncharacterized sexually dimorphic neurons that are necessary for females to execute headbutts and other female-specific aggressive actions, likely downstream of female-type NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons.</p><p>Isoform-specific roles of <italic>fru</italic> on male-type aggression <italic>fru</italic> is a complex gene with multiple alternative splicing sites. Male-specific fruM transcripts can encode at least 3 different DNA binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Usui-Aoki et al., 2000</xref>). These three isoforms have distinct impacts on gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dalton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Neville et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vernes, 2015</xref>), neuronal specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Billeter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ito et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meissner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von Philipsborn et al., 2014</xref>), and courtship behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Neville et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von Philipsborn et al., 2014</xref>), prompting us to address whether these isoforms have differential roles on aggression. Indeed, we found that fruMC is important for the specification of Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons, whereas fruMB is possibly important for perceiving or transmitting relevant sensory cues about male targets to an aggression execution mechanism. Because optogenetic stimulation of Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons in fruMB mutants increases aggression as effectively as the same manipulation in normal males, any role of fruMB on modulating aggression is likely taking place upstream of Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons. In order to understand the role of fruMB on the neural circuits controlling male-type aggression, it will be important to characterize the neural inputs to Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons and to identify which of such neurons express fruMB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von Philipsborn et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our result is in line with the previously reported importance of the fruMC isoform in the development of male-specific branching patterns in several fruM-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Billeter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ito et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von Philipsborn et al., 2014</xref>). Among them, activities of ‘P1’ neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von Philipsborn et al., 2014</xref>) and mAL/aDT2 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ito et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von Philipsborn et al., 2014</xref>) are necessary for normal levels of courtship behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kallman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</xref>), reflecting the severe courtship defects of fruMC mutant males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Neville et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von Philipsborn et al., 2014</xref>). Our observation that fruMC is necessary for both male aggression and specification of Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons reveals its importance for male-type aggressive behavior as well, at behavioral and circuitry levels. Using an analogy from the function of steroid hormones in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McCarthy, 2008</xref>), fruMC can be regarded as exerting ‘organizational’ functions, while fruMB may exert ‘activation’ functions, in the sense that fruMB is dispensable for the specification of a lunge execution mechanism, yet is necessary for induction of spontaneous aggressive behaviors. The additional support of <italic>dsx</italic> ensures the aggressive behaviors are applied specifically toward male targets.</p><p>The segregation of roles within <italic>fru</italic> isoforms may increase the gene’s flexibility: for instance, change in the circuit connectivity underlying perception of male-specific cues can be independently altered if different isoforms have different roles in the aggression circuit. In mice, there are at least 3 different estrogen receptor genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2009</xref>). Although the specific function of each receptor on neural circuits that control sexual behaviors remains largely uncharacterized, it is tempting to speculate that a similar type of division of labor may exist among the estrogen receptor genes. For both <italic>fru</italic> and estrogen receptors, the functional characterization of genes which each isoform regulate will be the first important step to understand how the division of labor is implemented at the molecular level.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title><italic>fru</italic> may allow males to evolve male-type aggressive actions without altering courtship motor programs</title><p>In theory, presence or absence of just one gene can specify two sexes. However, most animal species use multiple genes for sex determination, even if one ‘master’ switch gene (such as <italic>Sex-lethal</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) may initiate the sex determination process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Robinett et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Williams and Carroll, 2009</xref>). Our results suggest that one of the reasons behind this apparent genetic cooperativity may be that each gene controls specific aspects of sexually dimorphic traits, including behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pereira et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). We further speculate that separate genetic mechanisms for establishing sexually dimorphic actions and target sex-dependent action bias may be evolutionarily adaptive.</p><p>Courtship and aggression are likely under different types of selection pressures. Courtship behavior is executed by a male toward a female, who either rejects or accepts courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hall, 1994</xref>). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ishii et al. (2020)</xref>, we showed that <italic>dsx</italic> plays an important role in specifying the male courtship execution circuit. The <italic>dsx</italic> gene produces functional proteins in both sexes, and mediates specification of not only male-type circuits for courtship but also female-type circuits that make females receptive to such motor programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deutsch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). This dual function of <italic>dsx</italic> in males and females may ensure that the species-specificity of courtship rituals are preserved between both sexes even during speciation, which must accompany co-evolution of both a male’s courtship behavior and a female’s choice process through sexual selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Majerus, 1986</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>dsx</italic>-expressing neurons show high selectivity to courtship pulse song with behaviorally relevant inter-pulse interval frequencies both in males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deutsch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, aggressive behavior is executed by sexually dimorphic motor programs often between two members of the same sex, most predominantly among males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nilsen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smith and Price, 1973</xref>). Consequently, aggressive actions can be under a different selection pressure from courtship behavior. Ample examples of male-specific weaponry organs across a variety of species support the hypothesis that sexually dimorphic traits that bring advantage specifically during inter-male competition can be fixed through evolution even if it is not directly under sexual selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rico-Guevara and Hurme, 2018</xref>). This hypothesis suggests that such traits, which can be behavioral as well as anatomical, may evolve independently of courtship behavior. Indeed, some closely related Hawaiian <italic>Drosophila</italic> species evolved species-specific aggressive rituals even though action patterns of courtship behavior as well as morphology of antennae, an organ necessary for successful courtship, remain relatively similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaneshiro and Boake, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Price and Boake, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Spieth, 1981</xref>). This example suggests that animals must be equipped with a genetic mechanism that controls motor programs for aggressive behavior at least partially separately from the motor programs for courtship behavior. <italic>fru</italic> is well situated to be a genetic agent for such a male-specific modification of aggressive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis et al., 2000</xref>), because it seems dispensable for specifying a neural circuit that generates at least certain aspects of courtship action patterns (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ishii et al., 2020</xref>). At the same time, <italic>dsx</italic> can ensure that males do not act aggressively toward a conspecific female. Female-type somatic characteristics, including sex-specific chemical cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shirangi et al., 2009</xref>), are specified by <italic>dsx</italic>. It is possible that dsxM prevents costly male aggression toward females by helping the brain process female-type sensory cues as an aggression-inhibiting signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernández et al., 2010</xref>) in a species-specific manner.</p><p>The origin of sexual dimorphism in social behavior is a fundamental neuroscientific and ethological question. While circuit manipulations offer a powerful approach to dissect the neural mechanisms behind sexually dimorphic behaviors, comparative studies of the neural circuits controlling social behaviors in genetic gynandromorphs can serve as a complementary approach to address this question from both developmental, and possibly evolutionary, perspectives. Although sex-determining genetic pathways are diverse across animal species, studying <italic>Drosophila</italic> sexual dimorphism can lead to logical predictions about the genetic or neuronal mechanisms underlying sexual dimorphism of social behavior in mammals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for details of reagents used in this study.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p>See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for the complete genotypes of <italic>Drosophila</italic> strains used in each figure panel. <italic>Tk-GAL4<sup>1</sup></italic> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_51975">BDSC_51975</ext-link>) and <italic>Otd-nls:FLPo</italic> (in attP40) were previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asahina et al.

Immunohistochemistry of the fly brains followed the protocol described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Van Vactor et al. (1991)</xref>. Briefly, the fly brains are dissected in 1XPBS and fixed in 1XPBS with 2% formaldehyde and 75 mM L-lysine for 75–90 min at room temperature. The brains were then washed in PBST (1XPBS, 0.3% TritonX-100) and were incubated in the blocking solution (10% heat-inactivated normal goad serum, 1XPBS, 0.3% TrintonX-100) for 30 min. Primary antibodies were diluted in the blocking solution and were applied to samples, which were then incubated at 4°C for 2 days. The brains were then washed in PBST and then incubated in the blocking solution for 30 min. Secondary antibodies were diluted in the blocking solution and were applied to the samples, which were then incubated at 4°C overnight. The brains were then washed in PBST, and then either incubated in 1XPBS, 50% glycerol for 2 hr at room temperature before mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Cat# H-1000) onto a slide glass, or incubated in FocusClear (CelExplorer Labs, Taiwan, Cat# FC-101) medium for 2 hr at room temperature before being mounted in MountClear (CelExplorer Labs, Taiwan, Cat# MC-301) medium. A small well was made by cutting vinyl tape fixed on a slide glass, and one brain was transferred to each well before a cover slip (#1.5) was placed on the well and was sealed with nail polish.

All data points have biological replicates of at least 8, which has sufficient power to detect mean changes in cell body number of larger than 1.75 when assuming a mean cell body number of 5 and a standard deviation of 1.5 (which is reasonable based on our data). As indicated in figures, genotype-dependent changes in cell body number had a larger effect size than 2 in all cases.</p><p>For segmentation of Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons, we first visualized each z-stack in a 3D space using a rendering software FluoRender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wan et al., 2009</xref>) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014303">SCR_014303</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/SCIInstitute/fluorender">https://github.com/SCIInstitute/fluorender</ext-link>). We then chose the channel corresponding to Alexa 568 (which labels CsChrimson:tdTomato immunohistochemistry signal), and traced neural processes emanating from the cell bodies of Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons, which could be identified unambiguously at the lateral side of the brain. The neural processes were then segmented using the Paint Brush function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wan et al., 2017</xref>), and saved as a new. nrrd file.</p><p>For registration of brains, we split each channel of a z-stack file and resaved each as an individual. nrrd files in Fiji. We added the newly created. nrrd file that represent Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons (see above) into the same folder, and used the Fiji plugin for Computational Morphometry Toolkit (CMTK) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002234">SCR_002234</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/cmtk">https://www.nitrc.org/projects/cmtk</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rohlfing and Maurer, 2003</xref>) to register the brain image stacks to the template brain as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jefferis et al.

Briefly, for each brain, the image of neuropil visualized by anti-BRP antibody was used to transform the z-stack to the template brain, and the same transformation was subsequently applied to additional channels. Registration was performed by using the same parameters implemented in ‘<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cachero et al. (2010)</xref>’ (exploration = 26, coarsest = 8, grid spacing = 80, refine = 4, accuracy = 0.4) in CMTK plugin on Fiji. We used JRC2018 INTERSEX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bogovic et al., 2018</xref>) as our template, since we experienced more robust registration result than with the FCWB template brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costa et al., 2016</xref>) (data not shown).</p><p>After the registration of z-stacks, we calculated the average of the images in a hemibrain for each genotype. We did this by horizontally flipping each transformed z-stack images, and calculating the average signal intensity in each voxel. The resulting averaged images are bilaterally symmetrical. Therefore, only the left hemisphere is shown for z-projection images.</p><p>To calculate the volumes of specific neuronal structures within Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons, we further segmented the target structures using the Paint Brush function of FluoRender, and calculated the volume of each structure using the Volume Size function. Statistical analyses were carried out using MATLAB (The Mathworks, Inc, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link>). The Kruskal-Wallis test (‘kruskalwallis’) was used to evaluate whether a volume of the given structure was significantly different among different genotypes. When the p-value was below 0.05, the post-hoc the Mann-Whitney U-test (‘ranksum’) was used to detect significant differences between testing and control genotypes. In both cases, Bonferroni correction was applied to p values. Non-parametric tests were applied for volume data since we could not necessarily assume the normal distribution of this data type.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Social behavior analysis</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Subject preparation</title><p>Flies were collected on the day of eclosion into vials containing standard cornmeal-based food, and were kept either as a group of up to 16 flies per vial, or singly at 25 °C with 60% relative humidity, and a 9AM:9PM light:dark cycle. For optogenetic experiments, the tester flies were reared on food containing 0.2 mM all-<italic>trans</italic> retinal (MilliporeSigma, Cat#R2500, 20 mM stock solution prepared in 95% ethanol), and vials were covered with aluminum foil to shield light. Every 3 days, flies were transferred to vials containing fresh food. Tester flies were aged for 5–7 days except tester flies used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>, which were aged for 14–16 days to ensure consistent labeling of targeted neurons (data not shown).</p><p>Male target flies were group-reared Canton-S (originally from the lab of Martin Heisenberg, University of Würzberg) virgin males except those used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>, which were males of an isogenic Canton-S (a gift from Anne von Philipsborn, Aarhus University). They were used as targets in these experiments because we observed that our standard Canton-S target males were sometimes aggressive and dominant towards the tester males even after being reared in groups (data not shown), which we were concerned could obscure the innate level of aggression in the tester male flies. These isogenic males performed few lunges toward the tester male flies (data not shown). To prepare mated wild-type target females, 5 Canton-S males were introduced into vials with 10 virgin females at 4 days old, and were reared for 2 more days to let them mate. At 3 days old, both male and female target flies were briefly anesthetized with CO<sub>2</sub>, and the tip of either one of their wings were clipped by a razor to create a ‘mark’. This clipping treatment did not reduce the amount of each behavior (lunge, wing extension, and headbutt) detected under our experimental settings (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ishii et al., 2020</xref> for details).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Behavioral assays</title><p>All behavior assays were conducted in the evening between Zeitberger time (ZT)7 and ZT12 (from 4 to 9PM) at 22–25°C.

The wall was coated with Insec-a-Slip (Bioquip Products, Inc, Cat# 2871C) and the ceiling was coated with Surfasil Siliconizing Fluid (ThermoFisher Scientific, Cat# TS-42800), both to prevent flies from climbing, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asahina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoyer et al., 2008</xref>). The arenas were lit by LED backlights, which were controlled by a custom-built switch box. For optogenetic experiments, 850 nm infrared LED backlights (Sobel Imaging Systems, CA, Cat# SOBL-150 × 100–850) were used, whereas white backlights (Edmunud Optics, NJ, Cat# 83873) were used for non-optogenetic experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Flies were introduced into the chamber by gentle aspiration, and were allowed to acclimate for 5 min before recording started.</p><p>Recording was done by USB3 digital cameras (Point Grey Flea3 USB3.0, FLIR Inc, Cat# FL3-U3-13Y3M-C) controlled by the BIAS acquisition software (IORodeo, CA; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bitbucket.org/iorodeo/bias">https://bitbucket.org/iorodeo/bias</ext-link>). The camera was equipped with a machine vision lens (Fujinon, Cat# HF35HA1B), and an infrared longpass filter (Midwest Optical Systems, Cat# LP780-25.5) when the infrared light sources were used. Movies were taken at 60 frames per second in the AVI format, either for 10 min in the optogenetic experiments or for 30 min for non-optogenetic experiments. Flies were discarded after each experiment. The food substrates were changed to a new one after 2 recordings for 30 min movies, or after 3 recordings for 10 min movies.</p><p>The setup for optogenetic experiments was assembled as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, the red light (655 nm) LEDs were controlled via an Arduino Uno board (Arduino, Italy) using a custom program. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, the stimulation paradigm (10 min in total) consists of 1 min pre-stimulation (time window ‘1’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), three blocks of 1 min stimulation at an indicated frequency (time window ‘2’, 3 min in total) each followed by 2 min inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs, time window ‘3’, 6 min in total).

(2020)</xref> for the creation, validation, and. jaab source files of JAABA-based behavioral classifiers used in this study, as well as the definition of 'time orienting'. The regions of interest were defined as circles corresponding to the chamber of each arena. The identities of tester and target flies were manually confirmed. The fly pair was removed from further analysis when (1) one of the two flies was killed during introduction to the chamber, (2) the wings of either fly was stuck at the extended position, or (3) the discrimination of the two flies was impossible due to wing damage of a tester fly. The amount of behavior is the number of bouts for lunges and headbutts, and the total duration (seconds) for wing extensions. These amounts were binned per minute for quantification. Extremely short bouts detected by a classifier were almost always false positives, and were eliminated from quantification. For lunges and headbutts, events with duration of less than 50 milliseconds were discarded. For wing extensions, events with a duration of less than 100 milliseconds were discarded. The post-processing of data was done using custom MATLAB codes which are available on Github (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/wohlmp/Ishii_Wohl_DeSouza_Asahina_2019">https://github.com/wohlmp/Ishii_Wohl_DeSouza_Asahina_2019</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wohl, 2019</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Ishii_Wohl_DeSouza_Asahina_2019">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Ishii_Wohl_DeSouza_Asahina_2019</ext-link>).</p><p>The frame in which the infrared indicator LED turned on during the first LED stimulation period was used to align frames of movies. Statistical analyses were carried out using MATLAB. After behavior within each time window were calculated (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), the Kruskal-Wallis test (‘kruskalwallis’) was used to evaluate whether a given behavior was significantly different among different illumination periods (periods 1, 2, and 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) or among different genotypes. When the p-value was below 0.05, the post-hoc Mann-Whitney signed rank test (‘signrank’) was used to detect significant differences between illumination period, and the Mann-Whitney U-test (‘ranksum’) was used to detect significant differences between testing and control genotypes. In both cases, Bonferroni correction was applied to p values. When the uncorrected p value was less than 0.05 but the corrected value did not pass the significant level, the uncorrected value was shown on panels with parenthesis. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–G</xref>, Dunn’s multiple comparison test was applied to detect significant groups using a custom code (‘dunn.m’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cardillo, 2006</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/12827">http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/12827</ext-link>).</p><p>While it is not feasible to perform power analyses for non-parametric datasets, we performed a bootstrapped power analysis with a sample dataset from 171 single-housed wild-type male fly pairs (which is not included in this manuscript). We asked how many pairs of flies (biological replicates) are necessary to achieve a power of 0.8 when attempting to detect a 50% difference in the number of lunges and found that 22 pairs are sufficient. Thirty pairs of flies would increase the power to 0.9. We tested at least 24 pairs per genotype for all social behavior assays, and many groups contain more than 30 pairs. While the data distribution appears different among different genotypes and behaviors, we are confident that the number of biological replicates used in this study gives us sufficient power to support our conclusions.</p><p>Generally, male testers seldom performed lunges toward female targets. Also, noticeably less lunges were detected in fruM females. Behavioral data from these conditions often result in zero-inflated datasets. In such cases, a few false positive incidents can impact the result of statistical tests. To avoid this pitfall, classifier results of lunges from male testers toward female targets and from fruM females were manually validated, and obvious false positives (caused by tracking errors, when a fly was near or on the wall, or when a fly suddenly jumped) were eliminated before statistical tests were applied.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Activity and sleep analysis</title><p>Male flies were collected and singly reared for 6 days as was described in ‘Social behavior analysis’.

The proboscis was also dabbed with glue to prevent its extension from altering the position of the brain. The head cuticle was removed with sharp forceps in room temperature <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult hemolymph-like saline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). After cuticle removal, the recording solution was refreshed. Optogenetic stimulation was applied with an external fiber-coupled LED of 625 nm (Thorlabs Inc, Cat# M625F2) controlled by a programmable LED driver (ThorLabs, Cat# DC2200). The end of the LED fiber (Thorlabs, Cat# M28L01) was placed 5 mm from the brain. LED illumination of 5 Hz, 10-millisecond pulses for a 30 s duration was applied for optogenetic activation of CsChrimson. LED power was varied so that each fly received stimulations at 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.1, and 0.2 mA. The energy from the LED that the neurons receive was estimated from the measurement of the LED power using a photodiode power sensor (Thorlabs, Cat# S130C) 5 mm away from the end of the LED fiber.

Your article has been reviewed by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. In the discussions, all the referees expressed interest in the main message (dissociating <italic>fru</italic> and <italic>dsx</italic> functions and relating these to vertebrate mechanisms) as well as enthusiasm for several very interesting and clear findings from an impressively extensive set of experiments. However, there were also substantial concerns leading to the consensus opinion that additions and revisions required were too extensive to be accomplished in the two months required by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Based on these discussions and the individual reviews appended below, we regret to inform you that, in present form, your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, if you choose to revise the paper on the lines suggested by the referees and resubmit, then <italic>eLife</italic> would be happy to consider a fresh submission (or two) that we would endeavour to have reviewed by the same referees.</p><p>In addition to the specific comments below, the referees offered some specific overall suggestions for revision that you may find useful. These include: (a) to refocus the paper on solely on the <italic>fru</italic>/<italic>dsx</italic> story; (b) to include new rigorous anatomical analysis of the &quot;P1&quot; cluster in P1<sup>a</sup> and NP2631 flies as requested in the reviews; and (c) providing a detailed discussion of limitation of using systemic/constitutive alleles of <italic>fru</italic>/<italic>dsx</italic> in relation to behavior as well as anatomy. The referees also felt that the story be clarified and better communicated by splitting into two separate but simpler manuscripts, with a potentially a separate manuscript on Tk, but you should of course make your own decision on this rather too interventional opinion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic>In both flies and mammals, multiple sexual differentiation mechanisms guide display of adult social behaviors. In flies it is <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic>, whereas in mammals it is largely testosterone and estrogen. Ishii et al. present a wide-ranging set of observations that they use to suggest that various aspects of sexually dimorphic courtship and aggression displays in flies are controlled by either <italic>dsx</italic> or <italic>fru</italic>. This seems an over-interpretation of the findings. I am supportive of the study but have a few suggestions.</p><p>1) Data from Figure 3 is used to conclude that <italic>dsx</italic> specifies both P1 and NP2631 neurons. This is inconsistent with the anatomy shown in figure panels, which shows that both <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic> contribute. It is true that cell number is dependent on <italic>dsx</italic>, but the morphology of the arbors indicates that <italic>fru</italic> is essential as well: E3/J3/K3 are different than C3/H3/I3. Similarly, data from Figure 6 is used to conclude that fruM but not <italic>dsx</italic> specifies Tk neurons; comparison of E3 and F3 indicates that dsxM is also important. The authors should quantify arborization rather than rely on gross examination for Figure 3 and Figure 6.</p><p>Presentation of the histology could be better elsewhere too. For example, from panels Figure 2A,C, I conclude that there is no overlap of <italic>R15A01</italic> and <italic>R71G01</italic>, raising the question of the intersectional identification of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons.</p><p>2) It is clear that FruM is essential for male type lunges toward other males and enhancing wing extension to females. However, FruM is also essential for the pattern of wing extension upon activation of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons; in controls (Figure 1), wing extensions in phase 2&gt;3 and 2&lt;3 toward males and females, whereas in FruF males (figure 4A-D), wing extensions in phase 2&lt;3 toward males and females. In addition, it is clear that FruM is essential for regulating intensity of wing extensions. It is a gross simplification to conclude that dsxM enables execution of male courtship whereas FruM enforces choice of target sex. Clearly, FruM is also critical for execution of this behavior.</p><p>3) Why do males not lunge toward other males in the absence of activation of P1<sup>a</sup> or NP2631 or Tk neurons (Figure 1, Figure 6)?</p><p>4) There is some over-simplification of the literature. It might be true in flies that most studies have only used one sex as a target individual to analyze function of particular neurons (subsection “Effect of a target fly’s sex on optogenetically induced social interactions”), but this is certainly not true in mice (studies from Anderson, Dulac, Lin, Shah).</p><p>Rather than draw parallels to the four core genotype in the mouse (using which not a single gene has been identified that regulates social behavior independent of sex hormones, subsection “<italic>dsx</italic>, and not <italic>fru</italic>, specifies both P1<sup>a</sup> and NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons”), it would be more appropriate to discuss the role of estrogen vs. testosterone in regulating male behaviors. It is clear that estrogen masculinizes the brain during a critical window whereas testosterone signaling amplifies male behaviors in adult life. This would be a more instructive analogy when trying to dissect the specific functions of <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic>.<italic>Reviewer #2:</italic>Unfortunately, I have some major technical concerns with the manuscript, and the lack of quantitative anatomical analyses throughout. The rather cursory analysis offered in this manuscript has several critical caveats that are not discussed and undermine the conclusions that can be drawn from the experimental data. Therefore, this manuscript is not suitable for publication without significant experimental clarification of these points.</p><p>Subsection “Effect of a target fly’s sex on optogenetically induced social interactions” and throughout the manuscript:</p><p>Neither the P1<sup>a</sup> split-Gal4 nor NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> driver are 'P1/pC1'-specific, some additional neurons in the brain express Gal4 in both cases (see both Hoopfer et al., 2015 and Koganezawa et al., 2016). Therefore, by using these drivers, the authors cannot conclude that the observed behavioral phenotypes were caused purely by the purported 'P1/pC1' neurons. Further intersectional approaches to rigorously target these neurons are essential.</p><p>Subsection “<italic>dsx</italic>, and not <italic>fru</italic>, specifies both P1<sup>a</sup> and NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons”:</p><p>The expression 'P1<sup>a</sup> neurons were specified only in the flies that had dsxM' is not accurate and is likely even wrong. Whether the presence of the P1 neurons depends on <italic>fru</italic> or <italic>dsx</italic> was originally examined in the very first P1 paper, Kimura et al., 2008. Kimura et al. previously demonstrated by using <italic>dsx</italic> mutations that the absence of dsxF, but not the presence of dsxM, is the most striking factor for determining the presence of the P1 neurons.</p><p>In Figure 3, the <italic>dsx</italic> locus was always wild type and therefore the authors could not dissociate the presence of dsxM and the absence of dsxF. It is essential for the authors to do the similar experiments in combination with the appropriate <italic>dsx</italic> mutant alleles.</p><p>The authors mentioned that 'processes of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons in fruF males appeared thinner than those in males'. What does thinner mean? What form of scientific measurement is &quot;thinner&quot;? This needs to be quantified properly. Image co-registration or any other quantitative analyses for the size differences of the neuronal processes between these genotypes must be carried out.</p><p>The authors also mention ‘sex differences both in terms of cell body numbers and branching patterns’. If the authors declare the branching patterns were different between genotypes, they must carry out quantitative analyses.</p><p>They also declare the neuronal morphology was 'similar' between particular genotypes, but what does 'similar' mean? The authors seem to conclude that the neuronal morphology is different when they expect it is different and that it is similar when they expect it is similar, without any quantitative criteria for measurement.</p><p>Subsection “P1<sup>a</sup> and NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons in fruF males can induce courtship, but not male-type aggressive behaviour”:</p><p>The logical link between the anatomy in Figure 3 and behavior in Figure 4 is unclear. In Figure 3, the authors looked at the contributions of the <italic>fru</italic> and <italic>dsx</italic> genes in the purported 'P1/pC1'-specific neurons, but in Figure 4, they carried out behavioral assays with the <italic>fru</italic> mutants, in which <italic>fru</italic> gene function is disrupted not only in P1/pC1 neurons but also all other FruM-expressing neurons throughout the PNS and CNS, they then base all their conclusions on only the behavioral function of P1/pC1 neurons. These animals will have a plethora of <italic>fru</italic> mutant phenotypes that are associated with lack of FruM in other neurons in the CNS and PNS.</p><p>To make any relevant conclusions the authors need to re-do the behavioral assays in Figure 4 using the flies in which only the P1/pC1 neurons are mutant for <italic>fru</italic> (e.g., mutant MARCM clones, UAS-Cas9 system, or fru-RNAi).</p><p>Subsection “fruM specifies aggression-promoting Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons”:</p><p>The logic of transition from P1/pC1 to Tk-Gal4 neurons is very difficult to follow. The relationship between the former and the latter need to be explained. Are they completely different stories?</p><p>Figure 6:</p><p>As a control, the authors should demonstrate that Tk-GAL4 neurons do not express <italic>dsx</italic>.</p><p>Subsection “Differential roles of <italic>fru</italic> isoforms on male-male interactions and specification of Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons”:</p><p>The authors showed that the Tk-Gal4 neurons exist in <italic>fru</italic><sup>∆B</sup> mutant males but behavior is affected in these flies. The simplest explanation would be that the neurites are malformed in these flies.</p><p>Although the authors mentioned that 'fruMA and fruM mutants did not affect […] their arborization pattern', they didn't seem to carry out any quantitative morphological analyses. Such analyses should be included.</p><p>Subsection “The Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons in fruMB mutants can induce male aggression”:</p><p>The authors mention that 'these mutants have Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons that appear to retain their morphology'. But how did they examine this?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic>This paper is a paradox. As far as I can tell it is rigorous on all levels. The scholarship is excellent, deep and well rounded. In addition, the issues are explored thoroughly and there is an enormous amount of data. In addition, an enormous number of fly lines (the table that describes the lines is phenomenal). But on the other hand, it is too much. I would like to discuss the argument and conclusions that surface relating <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic> expressing neurons with sexually dimorphic choice vs. sexually dimorphic motor patterns and the interesting differences between reproductive behavior and aggression, <italic>but</italic> the paper is simply too dense at almost every point. Reading it is a painful experience and this does the work a tremendous disservice. I say this recognizing and admiring the care that has gone into preparing this text. It seems flawless, just impossibly dense.</p><p>What to do? Here is a list of suggestions.</p><p>1) The text and figures are impeccably constructed but for the average reader they are overly complicated and far too dense. The flow of the manuscript would benefit greatly from severe editing of the text, figures and figure legends. It is with a heavy heart that I ask the authors to do this knowing the amount of effort it took to construct the manuscript.</p><p>2) Remove raster plots from figures throughout and move to supplemental material if needed. See Figure 1, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 9.</p><p>3) Figure 2 is not required. Move to supplemental material and concisely state result in text.</p><p>4) Much of the immunohistochemistry could be removed from figures and moved to supplemental material. See Figure 3, Figure 6, Figure 8.</p><p>5) The summary panels at the end of some of the figures are helpful. But a single unifying summary/model would be best. Though organized in a systematic and rational way the results still feel piecemeal and it is tiresome to continually have refer back to previous figures or supplemental material to regain your bearing. A single model would help immensely.</p><p>Alternatively, it might make sense to turn this into two papers, one about sex, the other about aggression?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Layered roles of <italic>fruitles</italic>s isoforms in specification and function of male aggression-promoting neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this follow up paper, the authors analyse male-aggression, a different sexually dimorphic behaviour and that <italic>fru</italic> function in a distinct subset of Tk-Gal4 positive neurons is required for male-male aggression independent of <italic>Doublesex</italic>, which acts in different subset of neuron to enable such aggression to be targeted towards male competitors and not females. The observation that the underlying circuits are different from those involved in courtship has interesting evolutionary implications.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The issues enumerated below need to be clarified before the paper can be accepted.</p><p>1) That activation of Tk-Gal4 neurons in single-housed FruM females does not elicit aggression is at odds with the conclusion that this circuit is sufficient for executing male type aggression. If anything, single housing should have increased aggression. The authors' suggest that the lack of aggression is because of increase in male-type courtship, but this still tacitly indicates that activating the Tk/FruM circuit is insufficient to induce aggression. The authors' conclusions should be tempered accordingly.</p><p>2) As with the companion paper (“Sex-determining genes distinctly regulate courtship capability and preference toward females through sexually dimorphic neurons”), it would appear that the effects of Fru isoform on aggression in Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons also can only really be assessed by looking at animals were the Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons are mutant/ perturbed for <italic>fru</italic> function (e.g. <italic>fru</italic> isoform-specific mutant MARCM clones, UAS-Cas9 system, or fru-RNAi). Otherwise, the data would need to be interpreted with the caveat that <italic>fru</italic> mutant phenotypes could be caused by lack of Fru isoform in other neurons in the CNS and/or the PNS. This issue needs to addressed directly – ideally experimentally given that a lineTK-GAL4/fruP1LexA/LexAop2-FLPL that may allow these neurons to be targeted has been described in Asahina et al., 2014.</p><p>3) A key finding arising from optogenetic experiments, artificially activating Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons are a refinement of the authors previously published thermogenetic work (Asahina et al., 2014), and the isoform-specific roles of Fru on male behavior and Fru-specified neural circuits, are implied by work from other groups (Neville et al., 2014; von Philipsborn et al., 2014). The discussion must clearly articulate what new information this manuscript provides on Fru isoform function and aggressive behavior.</p><p>4) Does Figure 2—figure supplement 2E, F<sub>1</sub> (subsection “Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons are a part of a fruM-dependent circuit for the execution of male-type aggressive behaviour”) refer to a different figure panel. Please correct.</p><p>5) <italic>Dsx</italic> immunolabeling in Figure 1—figure supplement 2C is poor.

We agree that our attempts to integrate our findings on 2 genes (<italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic>), 2 behaviors (courtship and aggression), and 3 neuronal populations (NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup>, P1<sup>a</sup> , and Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons) caused difficulties with the flow of logic. We believe that two separate manuscripts allow us to focus on two relatively simpler messages individually, and help us present relevant data without causing confusion. “Sex-determining genes distinctly regulate courtship capability and target preference via sexually dimorphic neurons” also serves to incorporate your first major recommendation: “to refocus the paper on solely on the <italic>fru</italic>/<italic>dsx</italic> story”. In line with this recommendation, we now include a new set of data showing that <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic>-co-expressing neurons in males can promote both courtship and aggressive behaviors in a target sex-dependent manner (see Figure 1 of that manuscript).</p><p>Regarding your second recommendation to provide rigorous neuroanatomical analysis, we thoroughly re-evaluated our anatomical data by registering brains to a common template and analyzing specific volumes with 3-dimentional segmentation. Please see Figure 3L-M, Figure 6H, I, in “Sex-determining genes distinctly regulate courtship capability and target preference via sexually dimorphic neurons”, and Figure 1N-P, and Figure 5I-K in “Layered roles of<italic>fruitless</italic>isoforms in specification and function of male aggression-promoting neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic>” for new quantification of neuronal morphologies. Standardized immunohistochemical data enabled us to directly compare the morphology of specific neurons across multiple genotypes. Moreover, we could detect statistical differences in neuroanatomy by quantitatively comparing segmented volumes of specific neuronal structures. This rigorous quantification revealed differences in P1<sup>a</sup> neurons between males and fruF males, which compelled us to revise our original conclusions for this class of neurons.</p><p>In response to your third recommendation, we added a discussion of the limitations of studying sex-determining genes through constitutive mutants and through cell-specific genetic manipulation (see “An organismal sex and a cellular sex” section in Discussion of “Sex-determining genes distinctly regulate courtship capability and target preference via sexually dimorphic neurons”). We believe that cell-specific manipulation of sex-determining genes is a powerful method that is not without weaknesses, and will serve complimentary roles to constitutive mutants when studying their effects on neuroanatomy and behaviors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In both flies and mammals, multiple sexual differentiation mechanisms guide display of adult social behaviors. In flies it is dsx and fru, whereas in mammals it is largely testosterone and estrogen. Ishii et al. present a wide-ranging set of observations that they use to suggest that various aspects of sexually dimorphic courtship and aggression displays in flies are controlled by either dsx or fru. This seems an over-interpretation of the findings.

Similarly, data from Figure 6 is used to conclude that fruM but not dsx specifies Tk neurons; comparison of E3 and F3 indicates that dsxM is also important. The authors should quantify arborization rather than rely on gross examination for Figure 3 and Figure 6.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we should have quantified our findings to draw conclusions about the neuroanatomy of these neurons. Reviewer #2 also raised concerns about our anecdotal statements regarding neuroanatomy. We therefore thoroughly re-analyzed our anatomical data by registering brains to a “template” <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain, and by using 3-dimentional segmentation and volume measurements. Please see Materials and methods section for technical details. In essence, we used a non-rigid transformation technique described by Jefferis et al., 2007, to register individual sample brains to the standard unisex <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain described in Bogovic et al., 2018. This allowed us to compare labeling patterns across multiple brains and sexes in the single reference space.</p><p>Immunohistochemical labeling can have technical as well as biological variability. Such inter-sample variability might have been perceived as inter-genotype differences. To better represent labeling patterns that are consistent across samples, we averaged the signal intensity of imaged neurons after registration in the standard brain. The resulting images are shown in 2-dimensional projections as well as in 3-dimensional movies. A similar approach was taken to show the neuroanatomy of various <italic>fru</italic>-expressing neurons (Yu et al., 2010, von Philipsborn et al., 2014), and we feel this is the best approach to concisely summarize our observations from multiple samples.</p><p>As a quantification, we compared the volumes of specific neuronal innervations across different genotypes. We used the 3-dimensional rendering program FluoRender to segment structures of interest, and calculated the volumes of each structure.</p><p>With these new and rigorous approaches, we are now able to quantitatively support our initial conclusions that (1) NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons are largely specified by <italic>dsx</italic>, and (2) Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons are specified by <italic>fru</italic>.</p><p>In “Sex-determining genes distinctly regulate courtship capability and preference toward females through sexually dimorphic neurons” Figure 3H-K and Video 3, Video 4 and Video 5, we demonstrate that the overall morphology of NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons in males and fruF males overlap well, and that these neurons in females and fruM females are also similar. We quantified three neuropils that show noticeable sexual dimorphism, and in all cases, volumes of these neuropils in fruF males are statistically indistinguishable from those in males. Volumes in fruM females are comparable to values in females except in one neuropil. We acknowledge that our quantification is based on the entire neural population, and that we may not have sufficient sensitivity to detect either subtype-specific contributions of <italic>fru</italic>, or differences at finer scales such as number or length of branches. We mention this possibility in the main text. Overall, however, our analysis provided us with evidence arguing that sexual dimorphism of NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons is mainly, if not entirely, specified by <italic>dsx</italic>.</p><p>Likewise, data in “Layered roles of <italic>fruitless</italic> isoforms in specification and function of male-type aggression-promoting neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic>” Figure 1L, M and Video 3 clearly show that average Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons from males and from fruM females almost perfectly overlap (light cyan in Video 3 indicates the overlap between male (green) and fruM female (dark blue) Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons). As is shown in “Layered roles of <italic>fruitless</italic> isoforms in specification and function of male-type aggression-promoting neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic>” Figure 1N-P, three prominent innervations of these neurons show similar volumes across males (both <italic>fru</italic> +/+ and <italic>fru<sup>M</sup>/fru<sup>4-40</sup></italic>) and fruM females. We therefore retain our original conclusion that Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons are predominantly specified by <italic>fru</italic>.</p><p>In contrast, we found that both <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic> are important for specifying P1<sup>a</sup> neurons. In the previous version, we hastily concluded that <italic>dsx</italic> specified P1<sup>a</sup> neurons mainly because P1<sup>a</sup> neurons appear in fruF male brains, but not in fruM female brains. However, quantification of volumes of two neuropils clearly indicates that P1<sup>a</sup> neurons in fruF males have distinct morphology from those in males (see “Sex-determining genes distinctly regulate courtship capability and preference toward females through sexually dimorphic neurons”, Figure 6F-I). Results from this and re-analysis of behavioral data (discussed below) compelled us to revise our conclusion about P1<sup>a</sup> neurons. We now fully acknowledge the role of <italic>fru</italic> in both specification and function of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons. We feel this is a striking contrast to NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons, and further supports the idea that these two neurons are distinct subpopulations within what has been collectively described as P1 or pC1 neurons.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for encouraging us to take an extra step for verification (which turned out to require substantial manual and computational works), as we feel our revised conclusions are now better supported by the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Presentation of the histology could be better elsewhere too. For example, from panels Figure 2A,C, I conclude that there is no overlap of R15A01 and R71G01, raising the question of the intersectional identification of P1a neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We admit that images in our original version were not sufficiently clear, especially on printed media. It is a challenge to show all visible neurons clearly without over-saturating strongly labeled cells, or without dominating the figure panel. We enlarged the images by 20%, and would like to draw attention to original images provided as source data.</p><p>Regarding the overlap of R15A01 and R71G01 promoters, our initial submission used the <italic>R71G01-LexA</italic> transgene in attP40. It is known in the community that transgene expression at the attP40 landing site is not as robust as at the attP2 landing site, which is used for creating the Rubin GAL4 collection. We had created a transgenic animal with <italic>R71G01-LexA</italic> in attP2, and tested its overlap with NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> and with NP2631 ∩ fru<sup>FLP</sup> (“Sex-determining genes distinctly regulate courtship capability and preference toward females through sexually dimorphic neurons”, Figure 5C, D and Figure 5—figure supplement 3C, D, respectively). As anticipated, we observed more <italic>R71G01-LexA</italic>-labeled neurons from the attP2 transgene than from the attP40 transgene. The overlap with NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> or NP2631 ∩ fru<sup>FLP</sup> neurons is still very small, confirming our initial conclusion that P1<sup>a</sup> neurons have minimal overlap with these neurons. We strengthen this conclusion by comparing registered and averaged 3D images of NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> and P1<sup>a</sup> neurons (“Sex-determining genes distinctly regulate courtship capability and preference toward females through sexually dimorphic neurons”, Figure 5E-G). Neuroanatomy of these two populations shows significant differences.</p><p>In addition, Hoopfer et al., 2015 showed that optogenetic stimulation of <italic>R15A01-LexA</italic> neurons recapitulates the behavioural effects of the P1<sup>a</sup> neuronal activation (see Figure 3H in the citation). This data suggest that <italic>R1501-LexA</italic> indeed includes P1<sup>a</sup> neurons. We therefore remain confident with our conclusion which this piece of data is most relevant: NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> and P1<sup>a</sup> neurons are largely separate subpopulations.</p><p>We would like to add that split GAL4 lines are often created from lines labeling seemingly different neurons at a population level, especially in z-projection images. In fact, it may be difficult to discern overlapping neurons from the images of R15A01-GAL4 and R71G01-GAL4 in Figure 1C of Hoopfer et al., 2015 (which described</p><p>P1<sup>a</sup> neurons).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is clear that FruM is essential for male type lunges toward other males and enhancing wing extension to females. However, FruM is also essential for the pattern of wing extension upon activation of P1a neurons; in controls (Figure 1), wing extensions in phase 2&gt;3 and 2&lt;3 toward males and females, whereas in FruF males (Figure 4A-D), wing extensions in phase 2&lt;3 toward males and females. In addition, it is clear that FruM is essential for regulating intensity of wing extensions. It is a gross simplification to conclude that dsxM enables execution of male courtship whereas FruM enforces choice of target sex. Clearly, FruM is also critical for execution of this behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer was right in pointing out the importance of <italic>fru</italic> on the function, as well as on neuroanatomy (discussed above), of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons. We confirmed that optogenetic stimulation of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons in fruF males induced significantly less wing extensions than in regular males regardless of target sex (“Sex-determining genes distinctly regulate courtship capability and preference toward females through sexually dimorphic neurons”, Figure 6—figure supplement 2). This means that the courtship-executing function, as well as specification, of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons require the activity of both <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic>. Currently, we do not know whether <italic>dsx</italic> and/or <italic>fru</italic> is necessary within P1<sup>a</sup> neurons, or whether the proper function of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons requires another population of <italic>dsx</italic>- or <italic>fru</italic>-dependent neurons (see also discussions regarding cell type-specific manipulation of sex-determining genes). We therefore reasoned that it would be prudent to avoid speculations about the roles of <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic> on P1<sup>a</sup> neurons, and decided to re-frame P1<sup>a</sup>-related data in the context of discussing the potential diversity of the P1/pC1 neuronal cluster.</p><p>On the other hand, optogenetic stimulation of NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons in fruF males induced a similar amount of wing extensions as the same manipulation in regular males did toward male target flies (“Sex-determining genes distinctly regulate courtship capability and preference toward females through sexually dimorphic neurons”, Figure 4C). Together with our observation that the neuroanatomy of NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons in regular males and in fruF males showed little difference, we conclude that (1) fruF males are capable of executing wing extensions, (2) NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons are one neuronal component that belongs to a <italic>dsx</italic>-dependent wing extension execution circuit, and (3) fruM is important for enhancing courtship behavior specifically toward females.</p><p>By referring to the “execution” of courtship behavior, we are specifically focusing on the animal’s capability to express courtship behavior. We aim to uncover a neurogenetic process that enables animals to perform courtship behavior at all, in contrast to the ability to adjust the intensity of courtship behavior toward females. Please note that we <italic>do not</italic> argue that <italic>fru</italic> is not required for proper courtship behavior. What we argue is that <italic>fru</italic> is not necessary for <italic>all</italic> aspects of male courtship behavior. The importance of <italic>fru</italic> on male sexual behavior has been extensively demonstrated, leading some to state that fruM specifies all aspects of male sexual behaviors. Here, we wish to shed light on the fundamental characteristics of <italic>fru</italic> mutants, which is the unusually high level of courtship behavior toward males, not the absence of courtship behavior altogether. This phenotype has been consistently and repeatedly reported (literature include Gailey and Hall (1989), Villella et al. (1997), Ito et al. (1996), Demir and Dickson (2005), Shirangi et al. (2006), Pan and Baker (2014), among others), even though these observations may not have received sufficient attention. Moreover, many of previously characterized <italic>fru</italic>-expressing neurons are sensory neurons or early-stage interneurons that transmit sensory information. We feel that our conclusions are entirely consistent with past literature. Our novel functional characterization of NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons provides a neuronal substrate that accounts for the courtship behavior-execution capability of fruF males.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Why do males not lunge toward other males in the absence of activation of P1a or NP2631 or Tk neurons (Figure 1, Figure 6)?</p></disp-quote><p>The tester flies were all housed in groups for 6 days (P1<sup>a</sup> neurons) or 14 days (for NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons), which potently reduces spontaneous aggressive behavior. Socially isolated animals show high levels of spontaneous aggression, which can cause a ceiling effect when trying to observe further increases of aggression. Both in flies and mice, group-housing is a common treatment to characterize behavioral changes in response to neuronal manipulations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There is some over-simplification of the literature. It might be true in flies that most studies have only used one sex as a target individual to analyze function of particular neurons (subsection “Effect of a target fly’s sex on optogenetically induced social interactions”), but this is certainly not true in mice (studies from Anderson, Dulac, Lin, Shah).</p><p>Rather than draw parallels to the four core genotype in the mouse (using which not a single gene has been identified that regulates social behavior independent of sex hormones, subsection “dsx, and not fru, specifies both P1a and NP2631 ∩ dsxFLP neurons”), it would be more appropriate to discuss the role of estrogen vs. testosterone in regulating male behaviors. It is clear that estrogen masculinizes the brain during a critical window whereas testosterone signaling amplifies male behaviors in adult life. This would be a more instructive analogy when trying to dissect the specific functions of dsx and fru.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s constructive suggestion to re-frame the roles of <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic>. Indeed, studies in mice often use both males (often castrated) and females as intruders. While that these neuronal manipulations may appear to trigger social behaviors largely independent of target sex, we found that some target sex-dependence has been previously reported. For instance, Lin et al. (2010) reported that optogenetic stimulation of the mediolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHml) triggered aggression more consistently toward males than toward females (Figure 4L,M in the citation). Likewise, close examination of data from Yang et al. (2017), which investigated the behavioral changes caused by chemogenetic activation of progesterone receptor expressing neurons in VMHml, suggests that aggression toward males was more consistent that toward females, although it was not explicitly tested (Figure 1F,G in citation). These past observations reinforce our idea that target sex in neuronal manipulation experiments can be an important variable in other experimental models.</p><p>We also agree that the “four core genotypes” model has not been particularly successful in providing mechanical insight into the origin of sexual dimorphism. Although the temporal dynamics between mammalian sex hormones and <italic>Drosophila</italic> sex-determining genes can be quite different, the reviewer’s opinion that the roles of <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic> can be analogous to those of estrogen and testosterone is indeed a quite useful framework for our study. We incorporated this suggestion into our Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Unfortunately, I have some major technical concerns with the manuscript, and the lack of quantitative anatomical analyses throughout.

NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons described in Figure 4D of Koganezawa et al., 2016 also seems to label a well-defined single cluster of neurons per hemisphere.

Although the number of cells that are labeled by both drivers is rather small (“Sex-determining genes distinctly regulate courtship capability and preference toward females through sexually dimorphic neurons”, Figure 3G and Figure 6E), further intersection could reveal a specific subset that is responsible for the observed behaviors. We currently do not have a means to reliably separate such subpopulations, and we also feel that such experiments would better belong to a future study.

Whether the presence of the P1 neurons depends on fru or dsx was originally examined in the very first P1 paper, Kimura et al., 2008. Kimura et al. previously demonstrated by using dsx mutations that the absence of dsxF, but not the presence of dsxM, is the most striking factor for determining the presence of the P1 neurons.</p><p>In Figure 3, the dsx locus was always wild type and therefore the authors could not dissociate the presence of dsxM and the absence of dsxF. It is essential for the authors to do the similar experiments in combination with the appropriate dsx mutant alleles.</p></disp-quote><p>We admit that we were careless in stating that either dsxM or dsxF is responsible for neuroanatomical or behavioral differences from regular males. With the reagents we used, we could only state whether sexually dimorphic splicing of <italic>dsx</italic> has an impact on NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> or P1<sup>a</sup> neurons. We do not know whether altered neuroanatomy of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons in fruF males is due to the lack of dsxM, or due to the presence of dsxF. As the reviewer points out, we must use <italic>dsx</italic> mutants (especially dsx<sup>Dom</sup>, which forces male-type splicing of <italic>dsx</italic> regardless of sex chromosome composition) to gain insight into which of the two isoforms is responsible.</p><p>However, we would like to emphasize that it is not the specific role of dsxM or dsxF, but rather the genetic origin of sexual dimorphism, that we wished to investigate in this study. That is, we are interested in addressing which sexually dimorphic characteristics (neuroanatomical and behavioral) are controlled by the dimorphism (e.g., sex-specific splicing) of <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic>. As we state in the Discussion, one sex is not a mutant of the other sex, and sex-determining genes often have different functions in each of the two sexes – although <italic>fru</italic> was often considered silent in females, we presented circumstantial evidence that the fruF allele may not be truly null (“Layered roles of <italic>fruitless</italic> isoforms in specification and function of male-type aggression-promoting neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic>”, Figure 1—figure supplement 3A-C). In this context, splicing mutants such as fru<sup>M</sup> and fru<sup>F</sup> provide a useful platform to understand the genetic nature of sex-specific transformation. These two alleles have the added benefit that experiments could be conducted in a symmetrical manner – we can exhaust all four possible combinations of <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic> sex-specific isoforms (“Sex-determining genes distinctly regulate courtship capability and preference toward females through sexually dimorphic neurons”, Figure 3B).

In Figure 3, the authors looked at the contributions of the fru and dsx genes in the purported 'P1/pC1'-specific neurons, but in Figure 4, they carried out behavioral assays with the fru mutants, in which fru gene function is disrupted not only in P1/pC1 neurons but also all other FruM-expressing neurons throughout the PNS and CNS, they then base all their conclusions on only the behavioral function of P1/pC1 neurons. These animals will have a plethora of fru mutant phenotypes that are associated with lack of fruM in other neurons in the CNS and PNS.</p><p>To make any relevant conclusions the authors need to re-do the behavioral assays in Figure 4 using the flies in which only the P1/pC1 neurons are mutant for fru (e.g., mutant MARCM clones, UAS-Cas9 system, or fru-RNAi).</p></disp-quote><p>Our experiments address what the NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> or P1<sup>a</sup> neurons can do in fruF males. We would like to clarify that our original submission <italic>did not</italic> state that <italic>fru</italic> is required cell autonomously in either NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> or P1<sup>a</sup> neurons, precisely because we were aware that we could not attribute the behavioral differences from regular males to the deficit specifically within either neuronal population. We apologize if our wording in the previous submission caused any confusion.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer’s critique that the use of constitutive mutants has a limitation. We cannot answer whether the phenotype (anatomical or behavioral) is due to the lack of <italic>dsx</italic> or <italic>fru</italic> functions in the neurons of interest, or due to their cell non-autonomous functions (likely in other neurons). However, we would like to reiterate that the cell-autonomous function of <italic>dsx</italic> or <italic>fru</italic> is not the focus of this study. We wished to address how sexual dimorphism of <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic> (in a form of sex-specific splicing) may contribute to the specification of sexually dimorphic circuits and sexually dimorphic social behaviors. As stated above, simple loss-of-function of <italic>dsx</italic> or <italic>fru</italic> does not necessarily distinguish which male-like or female-like characteristics are specified by a given gene, because the loss of a gene is not synonymous to the transformation of sex from one to the other. We respectfully disagree with the reviewer’s assertion that we cannot make “any relevant conclusions” with these mutants. Rather, we believe that systematic investigation into what changes in fruF males and fruM females at circuit and behavioral levels (e.g., comparison of all 4 genotypes shown in “Sex-determining genes distinctly regulate courtship capability and preference toward females through sexually dimorphic neurons”, Figure 3B) is crucial for understanding the transformative nature of sex determination.</p><p>We would also like to be mindful of the limitations of cell-type specific manipulations of <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic>. For instance, successful gene knockdown using ‘dead Cas9’ (CRISPRi) crucially depends on the sequence of 20-base guide RNA. RNA interference (RNAi) relies on the specificity of ~21-base double-strand RNA sequence. In both cases, off-target effects as well as incomplete (or even ineffective) knockdown of the target gene are prevalent and well documented. Incomplete knockdown can be also caused by varied strengths of GAL4 drivers. To make matters more complicated, <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic> are likely crucial during development. This means that a GAL4 driver needs to turn on very early and remain active consistently during development to provide interpretable results. In previous studies, characterization of both the efficacy of <italic>fru</italic> RNAi knockdown or the temporal activity or GAL4 drivers is disturbingly sparse, raising a question about the interpretability of such data. Presumably because of this limitation, results of RNAi against sex-determining genes are often presented only when such manipulation results in reproduction of phenotypes in systemic mutants (that is, when the result is interpretable). Considering that cell-autonomous role of <italic>dsx</italic> or <italic>fru</italic> is not necessarily the focus of our study, we do not think either RNAi or CRISPRi will further support our conclusions.</p><p>MARCM can circumvent the problem of timing and strength because the mutations become homozygous at the cell division. However, MARCM also has an often-overlooked weakness that any cell clones in which a GAL4 driver is not active remain undetected. Moreover, creation of animals with mutant cells only in the desired neuronal population is exceedingly difficult, often requiring hundreds of individuals to identify a handful of suitable samples. Because the distribution of cell clones can be analyzed only after behavioral experiments, and since there is substantial inherent variability of behavior, an unreasonable amount of labor would be required to obtain interpretable data using MARCM.</p><p>We are aware of the limitation of constitutive mutants, but systematic analysis of such mutants is fundamental to interpret cell-specific manipulations of sex-determining genes. We hope reviewers will understand the value in what we can observe, and allow us to address functions of <italic>dsx</italic> or <italic>fru</italic> within specific neuronal populations in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “fruM specifies aggression-promoting Tk-GAL4FruM neurons”:</p><p>The logic of transition from P1/pC1 to Tk-Gal4 neurons is very difficult to follow.

The authors' conclusions should be tempered accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s attention to point out an imprecise choice of words (“sufficient”). We rephrased the sentence in “Layered roles of <italic>fruitless</italic> isoforms in specification and function of male-type aggression-promoting neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic>”, subsection “Female-type NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons in fruM females do not promote aggression<bold>”</bold> to more accurately convey our point, as detailed below.</p><p>Our conclusion in the original manuscript that the fruM-dependent circuit (which includes Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons) is “sufficient for executing male-type aggression” does not mean that the presence and/or the activation of Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons and its downstream is “sufficient” to recapitulate all aspects of male-type aggressive behaviors. What we wanted to express is that the activity of Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons can generate male-type lunges in the absence of neural components specified by <italic>dsx</italic>. Although the importance of fruM on organizing male-type aggressive behavior was demonstrated in Vrontou et al., 2006, our point is noteworthy because not all fruM-expressing neurons are required for the animals to perform a lunge. Male-type NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons and P1<sup>a</sup> neurons are such “non-essential” <italic>fru</italic>-expressing neuronal components (“Layered roles of <italic>fruitless</italic> isoforms in specification and function of male-type aggression-promoting neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic>”, subsection “fruM specifies aggression-promoting Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons”: see also “Sex-determining genes distinctly regulate courtship capability and preference toward females through sexually dimorphic neurons”, Figure 4), even though their activity can also promote lunges in a (normal) male. As we discussed in “Sex-determining genes distinctly regulate courtship capability and preference toward females through sexually dimorphic neurons”, <italic>dsx</italic> plays an important role in specifying both neuronal populations.</p><p>We showed in Figure 1C and D that activation of Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons did not elicit aggression toward female target flies (which is consistent with the paper that first described Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons for male aggression (Asahina et al., 2014)). To us, the observation that artificial activation of a neuronal population can have different behavioral impacts in a context-dependent manner is an important conclusion (see also subsection “Sex of the target animals is an important biological variable” in the Discussion of “Sex-determining genes distinctly regulate courtship capability and preference toward females through sexually dimorphic neurons”). In fact, our observation that fruM females can attack female targets when their Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons were activated suggests that the absence of lunges from a male tester to a female target may be at least partially dependent on the function of <italic>dsx</italic> (Figure 2D). In this sense, the lack of “sufficiency” that the reviewer pointed out is inherent to the function of Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons itself (as stated in subsection “fruM specifies aggression-promoting Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons”), and not necessarily an issue specific to fruM females.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As with the companion paper (“Sex-determining genes distinctly regulate courtship capability and preference toward females through sexually dimorphic neurons”), it would appear that the effects of Fru isoform on aggression in Tk-GAL4FruM neurons also can only really be assessed by looking at animals were the Tk-GAL4FruM neurons are mutant/perturbed for fru function (e.g. fru isoform-specific mutant MARCM clones, UAS-Cas9 system, or fru-RNAi). Otherwise, the data would need to be interpreted with the caveat that fru mutant phenotypes could be caused by lack of Fru isoform in other neurons in the CNS and/or the PNS. This issue needs to addressed directly – ideally experimentally given that a lineTK-GAL4/fruP1LexA/LexAop2-FLPL that may allow these neurons to be targeted has been described in Asahina et al., 2014.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a parallel critique to our Ishii et al., (2020). While we acknowledge that the molecular mechanism by which <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic> specified neural sexual dimorphism is an important question, note that “the effects of Fru isoforms on aggression in Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons” was not a question we aimed to address in this manuscript. Please see our response to a parallel question for “Sex-determining genes distinctly regulate courtship capability and preference toward females through sexually dimorphic neurons”, which includes the discussion why the interpretation of RNAi or dCas9-mediated gene knockdown (which depends on the GAL4 expression), as well as MARCM analysis, have caveats for studying genes involved in development. We argue that morphological and functional phenotypes of the neurons of interest in a systemic mutant is an important knowledge that deserves attention on its own, precisely because of challenges in addressing functions of these genes within specific cell types.</p><p>We would like to point out that Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons present an extreme case of this challenge. Since Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons are not labeled in the absence of fruM, one likely scenario is that fruM is required cell-autonomously. Neither RNAi or dCas9 would be a valid method to address this possibility because GAL4 must turn on for RNAi or dCas9 to work. This is a classic “catch-22” situation: the very fact that GAL4 turns on likely means that the fate of the cell is already determined before RNAi or dCas9-mediated knockdown of <italic>fru</italic> has an opportunity to influence its developmental process. In other words, there is no possible way for RNAi or dCas9 to suppress the activity of GAL4 that drives them if fruM is required cell-autonomously to specify Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons. If Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons disappear like in fruF males – it will be an even bigger mystery that RNAi or dCas9 can exert its effect without GAL4 activity.</p><p>It is certainly possible that <italic>fru</italic> is required outside of Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons to specify its sexual dimorphism, but results of RNAi or dCas9 (that is, that Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons appear the same as the genetic controls) would not be interpretable. In other words, both RNAi and dCas9 are fundamentally flawed approaches to adequately address this important question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A key finding arising from optogenetic experiments, artificially activating Tk-GAL4FruM neurons are a refinement of the authors previously published thermogenetic work (Asahina et al., 2014), and the isoform-specific roles of Fru on male behavior and Fru-specified neural circuits, are implied by work from other groups (Neville et al., 2014; von Philipsborn et al., 2014). The discussion must clearly articulate what new information thais manuscript provides on Fru isoform function and aggressive behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to emphasize that the previous publication never addressed Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons’ specification (Figure 1H, K-P) or functions (Figure 2) in “fruM females”. Also, the contribution of specific <italic>fru</italic> isoforms on male-male aggression has never been addressed in either of the previous important publications (Neville et al., 2014; von Philipsborn et al., 2014). Therefore, the findings on the differential roles of <italic>fru</italic> isoforms for male aggression (Figure 4) are entirely new. Also, how the specification of Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons (Figure 5) and its function on aggressive behaviors (Figure 6) are affected by <italic>fru</italic> isoform mutants has never been tested. We therefore state that all key data presented here are novel, and not a mere “refinement of the previous publication (Asahina et al., 2014)” as the reviewer suggested.</p><p>Upon the reviewer’s suggestion, we clearly indicated that the courtship defects of fruMB and fruMC mutants were reported in the previous publications (“Layered roles of <italic>fruitless</italic> isoforms in specification and function of male-type aggression-promoting neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic>”, subsections “Female-type NP2631 ∩ dsx<sup>FLP</sup> neurons in fruM females do not promote aggression” and “Differential roles of <italic>fru</italic> isoforms on male-male interactions and specification of Tk- GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons”). Also note that we acknowledged <italic>fru</italic> isoforms’ functions on gene expression, neuroanatomy, and behavior have been investigated in the previous publications (“Layered roles of <italic>fruitless</italic> isoforms in specification and function of male-type aggression-promoting neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic>”, Discussion section). I hope these clarifications resolve any confusion about what has been known previously. We performed courtship assays on isoform-specific mutants (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, B) as a control for our genetic manipulations, which we felt was important for demonstrating that fruMB and fruMC mutants are qualitatively different even though their phenotype on aggression (both strong reduction) appears similar.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Does Figure 2—figure supplement 2E, F1 (subsection “Tk-GAL4FruM neurons are a part of a fruM-dependent circuit for the execution of male-type aggressive behaviour”) refer to a different figure panel. Please correct.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this mistake. It was supposed to refer to Figure 2—figure supplement 3E, F<sub>1</sub>, and was corrected accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Dsx immunolabeling in Figure 1—figure supplement 2C is poor. Please provide better images.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the new Figure 1—figure supplement 2C and D for new images, which was generated with a new batch of anti-DsxM and anti-FruM antibodies. As stated in the other letter, these new antibodies coupled with a modified fixation process clearly showed that Tk-GAL4<sup>FruM</sup> neurons indeed express FruM, but not DsxM.</p></body></sub-article></article>
