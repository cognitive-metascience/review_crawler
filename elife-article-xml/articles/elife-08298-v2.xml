its likelihood of survival. The mechanisms underlying these perceptual shifts are critical to our understanding of how neural circuits support animal cognition and behavior. Starved flies exhibit enhanced sensitivity to attractive odors and reduced sensitivity to aversive odors. Here, we show that a functional remodeling of the olfactory map is mediated by two parallel neuromodulatory systems that act in opposing directions on olfactory attraction and aversion at the level of the first synapse. Short neuropeptide F sensitizes an antennal lobe glomerulus wired for attraction, while tachykinin (DTK) suppresses activity of a glomerulus wired for aversion. Thus we show parallel neuromodulatory systems functionally reconfigure early olfactory processing to optimize detection of nutrients at the risk of ignoring potentially toxic food resources.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08298.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08298.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08298.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animals typically need to forage for their food, but doing so is not without risk. Foraging can expose an animal to predators and harmful toxins. Many animals use odors and other chemical signals to help them locate food or to avoid harm. In some animals, such as fruit flies, different parts of the nervous system are hardwired to encourage individuals to move towards attractive odors or away from unpleasant ones.</p><p>Fruit flies feed on the yeast that grows on decaying fruit. They do so by ignoring fresh fruits (which have very little yeast) and avoiding overly-rotten fruits (which might contain toxic chemicals). To determine ripeness, flies use a fruit's vinegar levels: fresh fruits contain low levels of vinegar, while fermented fruits have high levels. Previous studies using low levels of vinegar have shown that well-fed flies largely ignore the scent, while starving flies are attracted to it.</p><p>Ko et al. have built on the results of previous studies and now report that starving fruit flies are much less sensitive to unfavorable odors in high levels of vinegar and much more sensitive to favorable odors in low levels of vinegar. This behavior is due to two neuropeptides (molecules that carry signals between neurons) that have opposite effects on different parts of the fly's nervous system. One of the neuropeptides made the groups of neurons that respond to attractive odors more responsive, while the other suppressed the activity of neurons that normally respond to unpleasant odors. Together these changes could encourage the animals to take more risks when they are hungry, by suppressing of their ability to recognize noxious or harmful chemicals in favor of their ability to perceive attractive odors.</p><p>The effect of both neuropeptides is triggered by the insulin hormone, which carries information about the metabolic state (for example, whether it is starving or well-fed) throughout the whole animal. Thus, individual neurons may read the same metabolic signals and then respond in different ways to fine-tune the activity of nearby circuits of neurons to alter foraging behavior in a coordinated manner. Furthermore, it is almost certain that similar changes to the sensory system could affect an animal's appetite for food. One of the next challenges will be to attempt to understand if and how appetite in humans might be controlled in a similar way.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08298.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08298.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>sNPF</kwd><kwd>insulin</kwd><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd><kwd>two-photon imaging</kwd><kwd>substance P</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK092640</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jing W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation (NSF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>0920668</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jing W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC009597</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jing W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM050545</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wasserman</surname><given-names>Steven A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F31DC009511</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Root</surname><given-names>Cory M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Starvation upregulates activity in certain sensory channels and downregulates it in others in what appears to be an optimization strategy that serves to increase the hedonic value of food odors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sensory systems undergo dramatic functional modifications when animals enter different internal states such as hunger or arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Su and Wang, 2014</xref>). These functional changes in neural circuits support flexible and adaptive behaviors in animals in response to their changing needs and circumstances. The mechanisms driving these neural circuit modifications are under intense investigation and are fundamental to our understanding of how neural circuits support animal cognition and behavior.</p><p>Neuromodulators are an important class of molecules positioned to exert significant influence over local neural circuits through their effects on neuronal excitability and network properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bargmann and Marder, 2013</xref>). The study of hunger and satiety in fruit flies has identified key neuromodulators that serve to communicate an animal's nutritional status to its nervous system and thus, change its behavior. Neuromodulators such as dopamine, short neuropeptide F (sNPF) and NPF have been demonstrated to influence different aspects of appetitive behaviors such as taste sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Inagaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>), the formation and expression of appetitive memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krashes et al., 2009</xref>), odor preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Root et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beshel and Zhong, 2013</xref>), and control of food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In natural environments, foraging and feeding behaviors expose animals to risks of predation and harmful toxins in food. For example, food deprivation increases an animal's tolerance for noxious stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gillette et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>) and suppresses escape behavior at the risk of predation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gillette et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaudry and Kristan, 2009</xref>). Thus, when evaluating potential food sources, animals must weigh both aversive and attractive sensory inputs. Their perceptions of these sensory stimuli and behavioral decisions are influenced by their own internal states and needs for energy homeostasis. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, starvation heightens sensitivity in odorant receptor neurons (ORNs) that are critical for behavioral attraction to appetitive odors through neuromodulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Root et al., 2011</xref>). Starvation has also been shown to reduce behavioral avoidance to innately aversive odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bracker et al., 2013</xref>). This starvation effect requires the presence of appetitive odors and has been suggested to occur at higher order levels of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bracker et al., 2013</xref>). Whether starvation also reduces sensitivity of ORNs in the periphery that are critical for behavioral avoidance is unknown.</p><p>Here we describe a neuromodulatory mechanism in <italic>Drosophila</italic> controlling the reduction of aversive odor sensitivity during starvation at the level of the first olfactory synapse. This pathway operates in parallel and independently of the mechanisms driving increases in attractive odor sensitivity. We show here that starvation does not simply scale up or down global activity in the antennal lobe. Rather, it upregulates activity in certain sensory channels and downregulates it in others in what appears to be an optimization strategy that may serve to increase the hedonic value of food odors. Thus, individual neurons may read the same global metabolic signals and differentially respond in a manner that fine tunes local circuits towards a concerted modulation of appetitive behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The role of two neuropeptide modulatory systems in food search behavior</title><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, some olfactory sensory channels are hardwired for innate behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Suh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kurtovic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Semmelhack and Wang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Grosjean et al., 2011; Stensmyr et al., 2012</xref>). The hedonic value of behaviorally relevant odors is therefore encoded by glomerular activity in the early olfactory system. In particular, activation of the DM1 glomerulus, innervated by Or42b ORNs, triggers attraction to an odor, while activation of DM5, innervated by Or85a ORNs, reduces attraction to high concentrations of vinegar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Semmelhack and Wang, 2009</xref>). Thus, activity in DM1 and DM5 represents positive and negative valence, respectively, and physiological modulation of these glomeruli should alter olfactory behaviors.</p><p>To study how attractive and aversive odor input channels might be modulated in starved flies, we took advantage of the finding that the odor map changes as concentrations of odor increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). At intermediate concentrations, food odors such as vinegar are attractive to hungry flies. At low or high concentrations, however, odors are ignored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Semmelhack and Wang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Root et al., 2011</xref>). Using a single fly food odor search paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Root et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zaninovich et al., 2013</xref>), we first sought to extend our earlier study which used low concentrations of vinegar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Root et al., 2011</xref>) and evaluated how behavioral attraction in starved flies changes in response to a broader range of odor concentrations from low to high.</p><p>We measured the time required for starved and fed flies to locate a source of apple cider vinegar across a range of concentrations. Starved flies typically locate the odor source within minutes after entering the observation chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This behavior can be quantified by an appetitive index, which we define as the percentage of flies reaching the odor source within a 10 min observation period. In starved flies, the appetitive index rises (from 23 to 60) as the vinegar concentration increases (0.5â25%), but then steadily declines at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). At all tested concentrations (0.5â100%), the appetitive index in starved flies is greater than that of the fed flies.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08298.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Starvation state fine-tunes appetitive behavior.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A single fly assay was used to measure food search behavior.

To what extent does sNPF signaling account for behavioral attraction at all odor concentrations? To answer this question, we used RNAi to knock down expression of the sNPF receptor (sNPFR) in ORNs using <italic>Orco-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Larsson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vosshall and Hansson, 2011</xref>). At low concentrations (0.5â1%) of cider vinegar, knockdown of sNPFR eliminated the behavioral difference between starved and fed flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, at high concentrations (5â25%), the appetitive index of sNPFR knockdown flies remains significantly higher than that of the control fed flies. In a fed state, sNPFR knockdown had no behavioral effect compared to the control flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). These results suggest the existence of a parallel mechanism for starvation-mediated changes in appetitive behavior at high odor concentrations.</p><p>One potential mechanism for regulating appetitive behavior at high odor concentrations is to alter a sensory neuron's neuropeptide response by modulating levels of a neuropeptide receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Root et al., 2011</xref>). Most neuromodulators signal through G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greengard, 2001</xref>) and a small increase in GPCR expression can have a dramatic effect on neural circuit function and related behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bendesky et al., 2011</xref>). We therefore performed a transcriptome analysis using RNA-seq to identify differentially expressed GPCRs in the antennae of fed and starved flies. We focused on the typical GPCR families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brody and Cravchik, 2000</xref>) that include receptors for biogenic amines, neuropeptides, as well as classic neurotransmitters, because these types of GPCRs have the potential to alter excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greengard, 2001</xref>).</p><p>This analysis identified 34 GPCRs that have higher expression in the antennae of starved flies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). This group included sNPFR, a GPCR we had previously shown to undergo upregulation in Or42b ORNs after starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Root et al., 2011</xref>). Other upregulated GPCRs, not yet described in ORNs, include the dopamine 2-like and dopamine-ecdysone receptors which have both been implicated in enhancing fly sugar receptor sensitivity in the starved state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Inagaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marella et al., 2012</xref>). Additional GPCRs shown to influence feeding behaviors include the serotonin 2A receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gasque et al., 2013</xref>), a receptor that promotes anorectic behaviors and the GABA-B receptor type 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bjordal et al., 2014</xref>), a receptor that is part of a circuit that detects amino acid imbalances.

This group included a few GPCRs described as having roles in feeding behaviors or energy storage. One example is as the adipokinetic hormone receptor, which regulates lipid and carbohydrate storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bharucha et al., 2008</xref>). Another is the pyrokinin 1 receptor, which is activated by hugin, a neuropeptide that suppresses feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Melcher and Pankratz, 2005</xref>). Although it is not known whether these two antennal GPCRs are expressed in ORNs, such localization has been reported for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> tachykinin receptor (DTKR). This receptor, also known as Takr99D, mediates presynaptic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ignell et al., 2009</xref>) and is implicated in nutritional stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Winther and Nassel, 2001</xref>). We therefore focused our attention on this receptor.</p><p>To assay whether DTKR expression in ORNs is required for the post-fasting behavioral modification, we knocked down DTKR and measured the appetitive index. Starved DTKR knockdown flies do not behave differently from control starved flies in response to low concentrations (0.5â1%) of cider vinegar. In contrast, their appetitive index at high concentrations (5â25%) of cider vinegar is significantly lower than that of control flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Furthermore, we found no effect of DTKR knockdown on the behavior of fed flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, DTKR signaling is necessary for starvation-dependent change in food search behavior at high, but not low odor concentrations.</p><p>Our results indicate both sNPFR and DTKR signaling contribute to appetitive changes. Do these two pathways fully account for the starvation response? To address this question, we explored whether removal of both signaling mechanisms transforms the behavior of starved flies into that of fed flies. Indeed, simultaneous knockdown of the sNPF peptide (the equivalent of sNFPR knockdown, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>) and DTKR in Orco neurons abolished the effect of starvation, leading to behavior indistinguishable from that of fed flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, these two modulation systems are both required to bring about the appetitive behavior observed in starved flies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Starvation modulation of glomerular activity</title><p>To identify a circuit-level mechanism for modulation of food search behavior, we next examined whether corresponding changes in glomerular activity could be detected. We used two-photon microscopy to monitor odor-evoked activity in the second order projection neurons (PNs) that receive input from ORNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). Flies bearing <italic>GH146-LexA</italic> and <italic>LexAop-GCaMP</italic> transgenes allow the imaging of PN dendritic calcium responses in specific glomeruli to cider vinegar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Given that the PN response in DM1 to low odor concentrations is sensitized by starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Root et al., 2011</xref>), we compared the response to higher odor concentrations in fed and starved flies. Strikingly, starvation suppresses olfactory sensitivity of DM5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) a glomerulus that mediates aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Semmelhack and Wang, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, DM5 is the only glomerulus recruited by vinegar that is modulated by starvation at high odor intensity (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2âsource data 1</xref> for a more complete characterization of glomerular responses to vinegar in fed and starved flies). Testing a range of concentrations, we found that DM5 became activated at 20% saturated vapor (SV pressure) in fed flies, but not until 80% SV in starved flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). At the concentrations when DM5 is suppressed by starvation, DM1 responses saturate and do not exhibit further modulation by starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

To test this idea, we imaged PN responses to cider vinegar while knocking down DTKR in most ORNs in flies bearing the <italic>GH146-LexA, LexAop-GCaMP, Orco-Gal4,</italic> and <italic>UAS-DTKR-RNAi</italic> transgenes. Consistent with our hypothesis, knockdown of DTKR in ORNs abolished the starvation-dependent suppression in DM5 across a range of odor concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). DM1 responses to 80% SV vinegar, however, remained unaffected. The lack of an effect of DTKR on DM1 responses may reflect a saturation of these responses at this odor concentration that would mask further increase in response amplitude upon reduction of DTKR levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Furthermore, starvation-dependent sensitization in DM1 was abolished by knockdown of sNPFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Root et al., 2011</xref>). Although two other glomeruli (VM2 and DM2) also exhibited changes in activity at a high odor concentration when DTKR signaling is removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), it is known that these two glomeruli do not contribute to appetitive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Semmelhack and Wang, 2009</xref>). We next asked whether the starvation modulation of DM5 generalizes to other odors, and found that the response of DM5 PNs to ethyl butyrate is similarly modulated by DTKR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C,D</xref>).</p><p>What is the source of DTK peptide for DM5 suppression? Previous studies have shown that a population of GABAergic local interneurons (LNs) labeled by the <italic>GH298-Gal4</italic> line is immunoreactive for DTK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ignell et al., 2009</xref>). We investigated whether these LNs are the source of DTK for DM5 modulation, by knocking down DTK expression in LNs with RNAi. We first monitored odor-evoked activity in flies that express GCaMP in PNs and DTK-RNAi in LNs or ORNs as a negative control. Imaging DM5 responses to cider vinegar, we found that DTK peptide knockdown in LNs abolished the starvation-dependent DM5 suppression, whereas expression of DTK-RNAi in ORNs did not have any effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Next, we asked if DTK expression in LNs is required for starvation-dependent behavior, and found expression of DTK-RNAi in LNs, but not ORNs, significantly reduces the appetitive index for food search behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Together, these studies demonstrate that DTKR signaling is required for the starvation-induced suppression of DM5, which augments food search behavior.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08298.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Tachykinin released by antennal lobe local interneurons (LNs) is necessary for starvation-dependent suppression of DM5 glomerular activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative traces showing ÎF/F in the DM5 glomerulus in flies that have <italic>UAS-DTK-RNAi</italic> in ORNs (<italic>Orco-Gal4</italic>) or in LNs (<italic>GH298-Gal4</italic>).

The data suggest that sNPF and DTK receptors are preferentially upregulated by starvation in select glomeruli, such as DM1 and DM5. We therefore investigated whether DTK and sNPFRs coexist in the same ORN population, or whether each receptor selectively exerts greater effect on specific glomeruli. To test this, we first investigated the effect of exogenous application of either peptide on the activity of DM1 and DM5. We performed electrical stimulation of the olfactory nerve while measuring calcium activity in PNs before and after addition of synthetic sNPF or DTK. We found that exogenous sNPF increased the response of DM1 but not DM5 in starved flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Conversely, exogenous DTK suppressed activity in DM5 but not DM1 in starved flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In a previous report, we observed modulation of DM1 when DTKR levels were knocked down in most ORNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ignell et al., 2009</xref>). Thus our current observation that DTK peptide administration doesn't decrease responses in DM1 may be due to saturation of DTKR already present in Or42b by endogenous levels of the peptide; whereas upregulation of DTKR in Or85a may explain its enhanced response to the DTKR peptide in this population. It is noteworthy that other glomeruli such as DM2 and VM2 exhibit some DTK sensitivity even in the satiated state, as observed in the current and previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ignell et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, DM1 and DM5 appear to be specifically sensitive to the addition of sNPF and DTK, respectively, in both a glomerular-specific and starvation-dependent manner.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08298.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>sNPF and DTK modulatory mechanisms target different sensory neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>) Representative traces of calcium activity (left) in the DM1 and DM5 PNs in response to olfactory nerve stimulation before and after bath application of sNPF (<bold>A</bold>) or DTK (<bold>B</bold>) synthetic peptides.

Knockdown of sNPFR in Or42b neurons abolished starvation-dependent sensitization in DM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and reduced the appetitive index to the same extent as when the RNAi construct was expressed in most ORNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Thus, reducing sNPFR dependent modulation of Or42b activity blocks the effects of starvation in enhancing both neuronal sensitivity and behavioral attraction. According to our working model, behavioral attraction at higher odor concentrations of vinegar is the sum of the opposing effects of Or42b and Or85a. We propose that removing the sNPFR modulation of Or42b does not reduce behavioral attraction to fed levels because the weight of Or42b increases when Or85a is inhibited. This working model is supported by our observation that net behavioral attraction is not completely abolished by genetic knockdown of sNPFR. Knocking down DTKR had no effect in the same neurons for which we observed phenotypes with sNPFR-RNAi. Although DTKR could in theory be absent from this population, we prefer the hypothesis Or42b responses are saturated by the 5% vinegar that we used for these behavioral experiments.</p><p>Likewise, knockdown of DTKR in Or85a neurons abolished starvation-dependent suppression of DM5 and reduced food finding to the same extent as when the RNAi construct was expressed in most ORNs. Thus, reducing DTKR dependent modulation of Or85a activity blocks the effects of starvation on both neuronal sensitivity and behavioral attraction. Expression of sNPFR-RNAi in the same neurons had no effect. Taken together, these findings indicate that sNPF and DTK modulate distinct ORNs in opposite directions, in what appears to be a pushâpull optimization strategy to increase the attractive valence of an odor.</p><p>Based on these results, we predicted that artificial enhancement of DM1 and DM5 should shift the appetitive behavior. In particular, sensitization of DM1 in fed flies should mimic the effect of starvation, while sensitization of DM5 in starved flies should mimic the effect of satiety. To test this hypothesis, we ectopically expressed the bacterially derived sodium channel (NaChBac), which makes neurons hyperexcitable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nitabach et al., 2006</xref>). Targeted expression of NaChBac in Or42b neurons increased the olfactory sensitivity of DM1 in fed flies and resulted in a marked increase in appetitive index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Likewise, expression of NaChBac in Or85a neurons increased activity of DM5 in starved flies and was accompanied by a significant decrease in appetitive index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Interestingly, activation of Or85a drives down levels of behavioral attraction, but does not trigger behavioral repulsion, presumably because Or42b that is still present provides competing inputs. Thus, by increasing activity in DM1 or DM5, we were able to directly influence foraging behavior in opposite directions in a manner that mimics behavior appropriate for the corresponding metabolic state.</p><p>What is the metabolic sensor for starvation to suppress DM5's response to food odor? Previous work has implicated insulin signaling in mediating differences between rover and sitter, naturally occurring polymorphisms in the foraging gene that lead to dramatic differences in feeding behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Belle et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kent et al., 2009</xref>). We also recently reported that insulin negatively regulates sNPFR gene expression in DM1 ORNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Root et al., 2011</xref>). To determine whether insulin also functions as the upstream metabolic cue regulating DTKR signaling in the Or85a/DM5 neurons, we investigated the effect of insulin signaling on the olfactory sensitivity of DM5 and appetitive behavior. We first blocked insulin signaling with wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weinkove et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Root et al., 2011</xref>). Flies fed with sugar and wortmannin exhibited a suppressed DM5 response that was accompanied by an increased appetitive index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), thereby mimicking the starved state. Moreover, this suppression occurs through increased DTKR signaling, because targeted knockdown of DTKR in ORNs blocked the effect of wortmannin. We next asked whether constitutive activation of InR prevents starvation-like physiology and behavior. Indeed, ectopic expression of a constitutively active InR (InR-CA) in Or85a neurons of starved flies led to increased DM5 activity and decreased appetitive behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), thereby mimicking satiety. Thus, insulin signaling in Or85a neurons gates the expression of DTKR to modulate DM5 activity and appetitive behavior.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08298.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Insulin controls DTKR signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Peak ÎF/F responses of the DM5 glomerulus to cider vinegar (left) and the appetitive index of flies (right) that were fed overnight with 4% sucrose alone or sucrose with the PI3K blocker, wortmannin.

Starved flies exhibit enhanced odor sensitivity in ORNs that mediate behavioral attraction and decreased sensitivity in ORNs that mediate behavioral aversion. This functional remodeling of the olfactory map is mediated by parallel neuromodulatory systems that act in opposing directions on olfactory attraction and aversion. In our earlier study, we showed that sNPFR signaling increases sensitivity in Or42b ORNs and thus enhances behavioral attraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Root et al., 2011</xref>). In our current study, however, we show that sNPFR signaling does not account for all changes induced by starvation in behavioral responses to a wider range of odor concentrations. Second, we show that starvation leads to a decreased sensitivity in the Or85a ORNs, an odorant channel that mediates behavioral aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Semmelhack and Wang, 2009</xref>). Third, we show that DTKR signaling mediates the reduced sensitivity in the Or85a ORNs and partly accounts for enhanced behavioral attraction to high concentrations of vinegar. Fourth, we show eliminating DTKR and sNPFR signaling pathways together fully reverses the effect of starvation on behavioral attraction across all odor concentrations tested. Finally we show evidence suggesting that the same global insulin signal regulating sNPFR expression may also regulate DTKR expression.</p><p>In the wild, rotten fruits early in the fermentation process are more attractive to <italic>Drosophila</italic> than fresh or highly fermented fruits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chakir et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castrezana and Markow, 2001</xref>). In the laboratory, well fed flies display very little attraction to apple cider vinegar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Root et al., 2011</xref>). Low levels of vinegar are indicative of fresh fruit of limited nutritional value. Expanding odor sensitivity to lower concentrations of potential food odors may encourage flies to accept food sources of lower value. High odor concentrations typically accompany late stages of fermentation and are often aversive or uninteresting to flies. We show that starved flies are attracted to high concentrations of vinegar partly due to neuromodulatory mechanisms that enhance sensitivity in Or42b ORNs, an attractive odor channel, and partly through neuromodulatory mechanisms that reduce sensitivity in Or85a ORNs, an aversive odor channel. In our working model, behavioral attraction to higher odor concentrations of vinegar is the sum of the opposing effects of Or42b and Or85a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). When flies face starvation, the balance of these inputs shifts to favor Or42b over Or85a inputs, as mediated by selective upregulation of sNPFR and DTKR in these ORNs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>). These processes could serve to encourage flies to risk ingestion of potentially toxic foods when under nutritional stress.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08298.012</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>How starvation changes early olfactory processing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic diagram depicting anatomical locations for Or42b and Or85a ORNs in the fly antenna as well as their corresponding glomeruli, DM1 and DM5, respectively, in the antennal lobe.

(<bold>E</bold>) In the DM5 glomerulus, both DTK and sNPF are available and released from the LNs and ORNs, respectively, in both the fed and starved states.

Whether these findings extend to a broad array of food associated odors and whether additional glomeruli are modulated by these neuromodulatory systems remain to be determined. In this context, we note that a recent correlational analysis predicts DM5 activity is highly correlated with behavioral attraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Knaden et al., 2012</xref>). However, this prediction has not been confirmed by direct testing of the DM5 glomerulus in behavioral experiments and is contradicted by more recent findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2015</xref>), as well as the data in this paper. Thus our findings suggest that in starved flies the concentration range over which vinegar odor is attractive expands in both directions, with the acute need for caloric intake apparently outweighing considerations of food quality or risk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>This study highlights the importance of neuromodulators in shaping local neural circuit activity to accommodate the internal physiological state of an organism. The often unique expression patterns of specific GPCRs in sensory systems highlights the flexibility conferred by this evolutionarily ancient mechanism to translate neuroendocrine signals into local shifts in neuronal excitability and network properties that ultimately lead to adaptive behaviors. sNPF shares structural and functional similarities with its vertebrate homolog, NPY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hewes and Taghert, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2004</xref>). Both neuropeptides show roles in controlling food intake and feeding behaviors in insects and vertebrates. Interestingly, NPY is also expressed in the vertebrate olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hansel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mathieu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mousley et al., 2006</xref>) and is thus positioned to shape olfactory processing during shifts in appetitive states as well. sNPF's broad expression pattern in the fly brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nassel et al., 2008</xref>) supports the possibility it is widely used to orchestrate changes across many different neuropils to shape appetitive behaviors. Indeed, sNPF and NPF, another NPY homolog in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, have been shown in the fly gustatory system to control sweet and bitter taste sensitivity, respectively, in parallel but opposing directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>). The similar changes manifested by nutritional stress in both the olfactory and gustatory systems suggests complex networks of neuromodulators may shape sensory processing of aversive and attractive inputs differentially throughout the brain in a hunger state.</p><p>DTK and DTKR share homology with substance P and its receptor NK1, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 1991</xref>). Interestingly, they seem to share roles in shaping the processing of stressful or negative sensory cues in both flies and mammals. For example, in rodents, emotional stressors cause long-lasting release of substance P to activate NK1 in the amygdala to generate anxiety-related behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ebner et al., 2004</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, DTK signaling has also been shown to be critical for aggressive behaviors among male flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asahina et al., 2014</xref>). In previous work, we showed <italic>Drosophila</italic> tachykinin mediates presynaptic inhibition in ORNs and detected expression in the LNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ignell et al., 2009</xref>). In this current study, we map the locus of DTK's effects on behavioral responses to vinegar to the Or85a/DM5 ORNs using behavior and functional imaging. We also confirm that the source of the peptide is indeed the LNs as previous anatomical data had suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ignell et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, tachykinin's role in modulating stressful sensory inputs appears to extend to a glomerulus hardwired to behavioral aversion in the olfactory system.</p><p>Our results here resonate with discoveries in the gustatory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>) and show that starvation changes the perception of both attractive and aversive sensory inputs beginning at the peripheral nervous system. Through the use of parallel neuromodulatory systems, the internal state of the organism functionally reconfigures early olfactory processing to optimize its detection of nutrients at the risk of ignoring potentially toxic food resources. It is certainly likely that neuromodulatory systems also impact and reconfigure central circuits in appetitive contexts. Thus, it will be of great interest to understand the contributions of peripheral and central circuits towards modifying appetitive behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Transgenic flies</title><p>All <italic>Gal4-</italic> and <italic>UAS-</italic> control flies were crossed to <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> fly strain.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior editor), Mani Ramaswami (Reviewing editor), and two other reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors show that feeding and starvation influence insulin signaling, which acts through two spatially and molecularly distinct neuromodulatory pathways to differentially influence innately attractive and repulsive olfactory glomeruli in the insect antennal lobe.</p><p>Starvation causes increased appetitive behavior, measured elegantly as the speed and efficiency with which flies converge on a drop of apple cider vinegar (ACV, a probable food source). In addition, starvation changed ACV (or EB) induced responses in attractive and repulsive glomeruli, previously identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Semmelhack and Wang, 2009</xref>. Responses in the repulsive DM5 glomerulus are decreased, at the same time as responses in the attractive DM1 glomerulus are increased.</p><p>In another previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Root et al., 2011</xref>) the Wang lab showed that starvation-induced modulation of DM1 at a relatively low AMV concentration was mediated by the sNPF pathway. In this work, the authors elegantly show that sNPF signaling underlies the increase in appetitive tracking at low but not at higher vinegar concentrations.</p><p>What is the mechanism to explain increased appetitive tracking at high odor concentrations in starved flies? The authors show that starvation-induced tachykinin signaling onto DM5 causes both the increase response to vinegar at higher concentrations. Tachykinin required for this is released by the GH298 class of LNs, previously shown to express and release DTK onto OSNs. Here this is also shown to be regulated by starvation and insulin signaling, and to have a specific inhibitory effect on the DM5 glomerulus in starved flies.</p><p>The effect requires receptors for sNPF and DTK to function in cognate sensory neurons. Thus, together the authorsâ observations, nicely documented, delineate two parallel neuromodulatory pathways that independently on OSNs mediating attractive and repulsive signals.</p><p>There are, however, some concerns and recommendations.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The imaging data presented focus exclusively on the few glomeruli that this and prior work show to be relevant to attraction and repulsion. This is not unreasonable. However, practitioners in the field would be interested to see how other glomerular responses are affected by hunger, and satiety, and to know whether and how DTK or sNPF neuromodulatory activity is involved in these changes. Is there no effect in some glomeruli? Is it variable and difficult to interpret in others? These data, which must already be available, should be presented in tabular form or as supplementary data. For completeness, if necessary, the table can also include previously published data (with due citation). A brief discussion of the table will also be useful to include.</p><p>2) In this context, it is also useful to discuss the use of behavioral observations to make inferences regarding âattractionâ and ârepulsion.â In Semmelheck et al., 2009, the Wang lab used a 4-field chamber assay, in which flies show obvious repulsion from EB or vinegar under conditions where DM5 is activated and attraction when it is not (and when DM1 is active). This is broadly consistent with findings in a recent PLoS One paper from Liqun Luo's groups. In contrast, in the assay used in this manuscript, even when DM5 is activated (or DM1 is silenced), the flies show a net attraction to the food source. However, this attraction is greater when DM1 is active and DM5 is silent (and vice versa). Interestingly, observations using this assay are broadly consistent with data from Bill Hansson's extended group, who inferred that DM5 is attractive.</p><p>Both for a balanced presentation and to illuminate the field, the authors should both cite the relevant work from the Jena group and attempt to rationalize these apparently conflicting observations into a single model.</p><p>3) Previous work on DTKR in the fly olfactory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ignell et al., 2009</xref>) suggested a broader role of this receptor in mediating pre-synaptic inhibition in the antennal lobe (including DM1). The current work deals with this problem directly, and makes a strong case that starvation dependent DTK modulation of the ACV response occurs through pre-synaptic inhibition of DM5 by DTK. The manuscript should integrate Ignell et al., and discuss or account for the possibility that different odor maps may be modulated more extensively by DTK.</p><p>4) The RNAseq experiment is well designed and allowed the authors to quickly zoom in onto DTKR. On the other hand the long list of GPCRs with expression changes is not discussed in any detail. Can these data be better integrated with the rest of the paper?</p><p>5) The model at the end is really too simple and almost a cartoon. The authors should include a thoughtful and detailed model that contains all pathways and circuits including hypothesized molecular signals, their sources, effects and their anatomical sites of action.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08298.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The imaging data presented focus exclusively on the few glomeruli that this and prior work show to be relevant to attraction and repulsion.

This is broadly consistent with findings in a recent PLoS One paper from Liqun Luo's groups. In contrast, in the assay used in this manuscript, even when DM5 is activated (or DM1 is silenced), the flies show a net attraction to the food source. However, this attraction is greater when DM1 is active and DM5 is silent (and vice versa). Interestingly, observations using this assay are broadly consistent with data from Bill Hansson's extended group, who inferred that DM5 is attractive</italic>.</p><p><italic>Both for a balanced presentation and to illuminate the field, the authors should both cite the relevant work from the Jena group and attempt to rationalize these apparently conflicting observations into a single model</italic>.</p><p>First, in this manuscript, we do not present any data where Or42b/DM1 activity is completely abolished. Instead, we merely block the modulation of Or42b/DM1 activity with a sNPFR-RNAi transgene and demonstrate that this blocks the effect of starvation on the sensitivity of Or42b ORNs and on behavioral attraction. This is an important distinction, because DM1 remains responsive to vinegar even when sNPFR levels are reduced as demonstrated by our imaging data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus, according to our working model, because higher odor concentrations of vinegar recruit Or85a/DM5, behavioral attraction is the sum of the opposing effects of Or42b and Or85a. Removing sNPFR modulation of Or42b does not reduce behavioral attraction to the same level of fed flies because the weight of Or42b increases when Or85a activity is reduced by DTKR. This working model is supported by our observations that net behavioral attraction is not completely abolished by genetic knockdown of sNPFR. We clarify this issue in our text with the inclusion of the following statements in the Results section:</p><p>âThus, reducing sNPFR dependent modulation of Or42b activity blocks the effects of starvation in enhancing both neuronal sensitivity and behavioral attraction. According to our working model, behavioral attraction at higher odor concentrations of vinegar is the sum of the opposing effects of Or42b and Or85a. We propose that removing the sNPFR modulation of Or42b does not reduce behavioral attraction to fed levels because the weight of Or42b increases when Or85a is inhibited. This working model is supported by our observation that net behavioral attraction is not completely abolished by genetic knockdown of sNPFRâ.</p><p>âInterestingly, activation of Or85a drives down levels of behavioral attraction, but does not trigger behavioral repulsion, presumably because Or42b that is still present provides competing inputsâ.</p><p>Second, we also respectfully disagree with the suggestion that our results conflict with the conclusion about DM5âs role in behavioral aversion in the Semmelhack (2009) and Gao (2015) papers. Both papers directly demonstrate causality between DM5 activity and behavioral aversion using behavioral analysis and precise genetic manipulation of DM5 activity and show behavioral aversion is observed only when competing inputs from all (or nearly all) other odorant channels are removed. In our current study, a net behavioral attraction to vinegar is observed, even when DM5 activity is enhanced with NaChBac, because DM1 activity remains intact and contributes to the net behavioral response.</p><p>Thus the flyâs behavioral response reflects a sum of inputs from DM1 and DM5. These data from both the Wang and Luo groups contradict inferences made by the Hansson group that DM5 glomerular activity is largely predictive of odor attraction. It is difficult to reconcile the Hansson groupâs conclusions with our own or the Luo group without knowing more about the conditions under which DM5 would be attractive. The Jena groupâs apparent contradiction in the behavioral role of DM5 needs to move beyond correlation and be substantiated with manipulation of DM5 directly in a behavioral analysis. We acknowledge their contributions however, in the Discussion (bottom paragraph) section with the following text:</p><p>âGiven the broad array of glomeruli that can respond to odors such as vinegar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2âsource data 1</xref>), it may be surprising that the modulation of only two glomeruli is sufficient to significantly impact fly behavioral attraction. Whether these findings extend to a broad array of food associated odors and whether additional glomeruli are modulated by these neuromodulatory systems remain to be determined. In this context, we note that a recent correlational analysis predicts DM5 activity is highly correlated with behavioral attraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Knaden et al., 2012</xref>). However, this prediction has not been confirmed by direct testing of the DM5 glomerulus in behavioral experiments and is contradicted by more recent findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2015</xref>), as well as the data in this paperâ.</p><p><italic>3) Previous work on DTKR in the fly olfactory system (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68"><italic>Ignell et al. 2009</italic></xref><italic>) suggested a broader role of this receptor in mediating pre-synaptic inhibition in the antennal lobe (including DM1). The current work deals with this problem directly, and makes a strong case that starvation dependent DTK modulation of the ACV response occurs through pre-synaptic inhibition of DM5 by DTK. The manuscript should integrate Ignell et al., and discuss or account for the possibility that different odor maps may be modulated more extensively by DTK</italic>.</p><p>We are grateful for this particular comment on the Ignell paper. We realized that we may have overreached in our interpretation of our data and in the statement that DTKR may not be expressed in Or42b. In the Ignell paper, we showed that Or42b sensitivity to odors increases when DTKR is knocked down with an RNAi transgene. In our current manuscript, however, we do not see any effect on Or42b sensitivity to vinegar after a DTKR-RNAi transgene is selectively targeted to this population of ORNs. The simplest and most plausible explanation for this discrepancy is likely due to the saturation of Or42b ORN responses in starved flies to the concentrations of vinegar (0.2% SV) used in these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Indeed, our imaging data demonstrates that Or42b responses in starved flies plateau and are fairly close to maxed out at all vinegar concentrations tested, and thus may explain why further increases with DTKR knockdown were not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>In the DTKR peptide experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), we do not see additional suppression of Or42b responses, possibly, because all the DTKR receptors present on Or42b have been saturated with endogenous DTKR levels. We speculate that DTKR is upregulated in only select glomeruli such as Or85a during a starved state. Therefore, we have revised the manuscript to state that our results are consistent with a view that DTKR mediated presynaptic inhibition is widespread in different glomeruli, but starvation increases DTKR expression in specific glomeruli such as DM5.</p><p>In Results section for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>:</p><p>âIn a previous report, we observed modulation of DM1 when DTKR levels were knocked down in most ORNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ignell et al., 2009</xref>). Thus our current observation that DTK peptide administration doesnât decrease responses in DM1 may be due to saturation of DTKR already present in Or42b by endogenous levels of the peptide; whereas upregulation of DTKR in Or85a may explain its enhanced response to the DTKR peptide in this populationâ.</p><p>In Results section for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>:</p><p>âKnocking down DTKR had no effect in the same neurons for which we observed phenotypes with sNPFR-RNAi. Although DTKR could in theory be absent from this population, we prefer the hypothesis Or42b responses are saturated by the 5% vinegar that we used for these behavioral experimentsâ.</p><p><italic>4) The RNAseq experiment is well designed and allowed the authors to quickly zoom in onto DTKR. On the other hand the long list of GPCRs with expression changes is not discussed in any detail. Can these data be better integrated with the rest of the paper?</italic></p><p>We have incorporated additional text commenting on select GPCRS identified in our RNAseq experiment in the Results section:</p><p>âThis analysis identified 34 GPCRs that have higher expression in the antennae of starved flies [â¦] thus making these receptor classes highly plausible targets for internal state modulation.â</p><p>âWe also identified 11 GPCRs that exhibited reduced expression in the antennae of starved flies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). This group included a few GPCRs described as having roles in feeding behaviors or energy storage. One example is as the adipokinetic hormone receptor, which regulates lipid and carbohydrate storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bharucha et al., 2008</xref>). Another is the pyrokinin 1 receptor, which is activated by hugin, a neuropeptide that suppresses feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Melcher and Pankratz, 2005</xref>).â</p><p><italic>5) The model at the end is really too simple and almost a cartoon. The authors should include a thoughtful and detailed model that contains all pathways and circuits including hypothesized molecular signals, their sources, effects and their anatomical sites of action</italic>.</p><p>In our revised manuscript, we have included a more detailed schematic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) illustrating the molecular signals and antennal lobe circuits involved in our study of starvation mediated changes in early olfactory processing.</p></body></sub-article></article>
