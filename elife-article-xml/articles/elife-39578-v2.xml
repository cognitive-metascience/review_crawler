Disturbances in SG dynamics have been implicated as a primary driver of neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), suggesting the hypothesis that these diseases reflect an underlying disturbance in the dynamics and material properties of SGs. However, this concept has remained largely untestable in available models of SG assembly, which require the confounding variable of exogenous stressors. Here we introduce a light-inducible SG system, termed OptoGranules, based on optogenetic multimerization of G3BP1, which is an essential scaffold protein for SG assembly. In this system, which permits experimental control of SGs in living cells in the absence of exogenous stressors, we demonstrate that persistent or repetitive assembly of SGs is cytotoxic and is accompanied by the evolution of SGs to cytoplasmic inclusions that recapitulate the pathology of ALS-FTD.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

These diseases show substantial clinical and genetic overlap and share the hallmark histopathological feature of cytoplasmic inclusions composed of RNA-binding proteins and other constituents of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules in affected neurons and muscle cells. A prominent feature of this end-stage cytoplasmic pathology is ubiquitinated and phosphorylated forms of TDP-43, although a host of other proteins co-localize with these pathological inclusions, including related RNA-binding proteins and ubiquitin-binding proteins such as SQSTM1, UBQLN2, OPTN, and VCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Neumann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mackenzie et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mackenzie and Neumann, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Williams et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deng et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Many mutations that cause ALS-FTD and/or IBM impact RNA-binding proteins that are building blocks of stress granules (e.g., TDP-43, hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2B1, hnRNPDL, TIA1, matrin 3, and FUS). Furthermore, these mutations largely cluster in low-complexity, intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and in many cases have been shown to change the dynamic properties of stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mackenzie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hackman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu-Yesucevitz et al., 2010</xref>). Another set of disease-causing mutations impact ubiquitin-binding proteins (e.g., UBQLN2, VCP, p62/SQSTM1, and OPTN) whose functions intersect with disassembly and/or clearance of stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buchan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chitiprolu et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, pathological poly-dipeptides arising from repeat-expanded <italic>C9orf72</italic>, the most common genetic cause of ALS-FTD, insinuate into stress granules and other membrane-less organelles, perturbing their dynamics and/or functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boeynaems et al., 2017</xref>). Several ALS-, FTD-, and IBM-causing mutations cause aberrant phase separation and change the biophysical and material properties of stress granules, generally resulting in poorly dynamic membrane-less organelles that, it has been suggested, may evolve into the cytoplasmic pathology found in end-stage disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mackenzie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buchan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). However, no direct evidence has demonstrated that perturbation of phase separation is sufficient to drive neurotoxicity or that ALS-FTD-associated inclusions represent the endpoint of a formerly dynamic stress granule. Moreover, capitalizing on mechanistic links between stress granules and disease to identify therapeutic targets has been limited by models employing exogenous stressors (e.g., heat shock, arsenite) to initiate stress granule assembly, with numerous nonspecific and pleiotropic effects.</p><p>Stress granules are comparatively large (~50 nm to ~3 μm) biomolecular condensates that rapidly form in the cytoplasm in response to a wide variety of stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Protter and Parker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Panas et al., 2016</xref>). Like other RNP granules, stress granules are believed to arise at least in part through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), a biophysical phenomenon in which RNA-protein complexes separate from the surrounding aqueous cytoplasm to create a functional cellular compartment with liquid properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Molliex et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Protter and Parker, 2016</xref>). Stress granule assembly is a complex process that involves a cascade of events, including the dismantling of polysomes and reorganization of mRNPs into discrete cytoplasmic foci that contain &gt;400 different protein constituents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jain et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Markmiller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Youn et al., 2018</xref>) and &gt;1800 different RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Khong et al., 2017</xref>). The assembly of RNP granules, including stress granules, is driven in part by the collective behavior of many macromolecular interactions, including RNA-RNA interactions, protein-RNA interactions, conventional interactions between folded protein domains, as well as weak, transient interactions mediated by low complexity IDRs of proteins – particularly those present in RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banani et al., 2017</xref>). While there is consensus about the major underlying forces that drive RNP granule assembly, the precise mechanisms that orchestrate the assembly of distinct types of RNP granules are largely unknown, although general principles have been suggested by in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banani et al., 2016</xref>). In this conceptual framework, RNP granules and other biomolecular condensates are established and maintained by a small number of essential constituents defined as <italic>scaffolds</italic>, whereas the remaining constituents are considered <italic>clients</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banani et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Although at least six proteins have been suggested to be ‘essential’ elements of stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Markmiller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Youn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kedersha et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gilks et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kwon et al., 2007</xref>), until recently it was unknown which of these proteins (if any) are true scaffolds for stress granules. In related work that informs the study presented here, we performed a whole-genome screen that identified G3BP as a uniquely essential scaffold in stress granule assembly (Yang, Mathieu <italic>et al</italic>., unpublished). Moreover, we found that an oligomerization domain within G3BP that is essential to stress granule assembly could be functionally replaced by heterologous oligomerization domains, which suggested the possibility of engineering temporal and spatial control of stress granule assembly without the confounding influences of stress (Yang, Mathieu <italic>et al</italic>., unpublished). We built upon a previously described system, termed ‘OptoDroplets,’ which uses optogenetic oligomerization of proteins as a means to control intracellular LLPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shin et al., 2017</xref>). In this system, light-sensitive chimeric proteins are assembled from the IDRs of various RNP granule proteins combined with the light-sensitive oligomerization domain of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) photolyase homology region (PHR) to generate fusion proteins that undergo LLPS in living cells upon blue light activation. Whereas enforced aggregation of IDRs drives LLPS and thereby leads to OptoDroplet formation, it is not anticipated that droplets formed by the IDRs of any given RNP granule protein will initiate the full cascade of <italic>bona fide</italic> RNP granule assembly. However, we reasoned that adapting this OptoDroplet system might provide a means of testing the hypothesis that enforced LLPS of key stress granule constituents could distinguish between stress granule scaffolds and clients, in which LLPS of a <italic>scaffold</italic> protein would initiate a process that faithfully reconstitutes the assembly of a stress granule, whereas LLPS of a <italic>client</italic> protein would not. Moreover, if we succeeded in optical induction of stress granules, it would provide the first opportunity to examine the consequences of protracted stress granule assembly without the confounding variable of exogenous stress.</p><p>Herein we report that light-based activation of Opto-G3BP1, a chimeric protein assembled from the IDR and RNA-binding domain of G3BP1 combined with CRY2<sub>PHR</sub>, initiated the rapid assembly of dynamic, cytoplasmic, liquid granules that were composed of canonical stress granule components, including PABP, TDP-43, TIA1, TIAR, eIF4G, eIF3η, ataxin 2, GLE1, FUS, and polyadenylated RNA, thereby establishing the identity of G3BP1 as a scaffold protein for stress granules. To differentiate these complex assemblies formed by LLPS of the scaffold protein G3BP1 from the relatively homogenous clusters formed by LLPS of client proteins, we termed these structures OptoGranules. Importantly, we found that persistent or repetitive assembly of OptoGranules is cytotoxic and is accompanied by the evolution of these granules to neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions characteristic of ALS-FTD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To test whether optogenetically induced LLPS of a stress granule scaffold protein could faithfully reconstitute the assembly of a <italic>bona fide</italic> stress granule, we first investigated G3BP1 as a potential scaffold protein. G3BP1 (and its close paralog G3BP2) has been suggested to be an essential nucleator of stress granule assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kedersha et al., 2016</xref>), and a genome-wide screen recently identified G3BP1/2 as a uniquely essential protein for stress granule assembly (Yang, Mathieu <italic>et al</italic>., unpublished). G3BP1 has an N-terminal 142-amino acid dimerization domain, termed the NTF2L domain, that is essential for nucleation of stress granule assembly. Remarkably, the NTF2L domain can be replaced by generic dimerization domains, and the resulting chimeric proteins are able to fully nucleate stress granule assembly in living cells (Yang, Mathieu <italic>et al</italic>., unpublished). Thus, the domain architecture of G3BP1 is ideal for engineering light-inducible stress granule assembly by replacing the NTF2L domain of G3BP1 with the blue light-dependent dimerization domain CRY2<sub>PHR</sub> in frame with the fluorescent proteins mCherry or mRuby. We named this construct ‘Opto-G3BP1’ and also created an ‘Opto-Control’ construct referring to CRY2<sub>PHR</sub>-mCherry (or mRuby) alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39578.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>OptoGranules are light-inducible dynamic stress granules.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Design of Opto-G3BP1 and Opto-Control constructs.

In these experiments, we employed a blue-light LED array that permitted global activation of a larger number of cells. This LED array has a much lower energy density (~2 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) than the laser used for dynamic imaging, drives less oligomerization of CRY2<sub>PHR</sub>, and therefore offers slower kinetics to facilitate monitoring of the recruitment of granule components over time. In cells expressing Opto-G3BP1, but not Opto-Control, all stress granule components that we examined, including PABP, TDP-43, TIA1, TIAR, eIF4G, eIF3η, ataxin 2, GLE1, and FUS, were recruited to optically induced granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h–i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a–g</xref>). Since stress granules represent assemblies of mRNA as well as protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Panas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kedersha et al., 1999</xref>), we used fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with fluorescently conjugated oligo(dT) probes to examine whether polyadenylated mRNAs were present in these optically induced granules as in canonical stress granules. We found that polyadenylated mRNAs were recruited into optically induced granules that assembled after blue light stimulation but showed no relocalization in cells expressing Opto-Control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>). These findings indicate that optically induced Opto-G3BP1 granules are stress granules composed of mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins, including ALS-associated proteins such as TDP-43, ataxin 2, GLE1, FUS, and TIA1.</p><p>Consistent with prior reports, knockout of endogenous <italic>G3BP1</italic> and <italic>G3BP2</italic> in U2OS cells abolished stress granule assembly in response to arsenite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kedersha et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a</xref>).

To examine this in more detail, we generated a series of optically inducible chimeric proteins by generating constructs in which CRY2<sub>PHR</sub>-mCherry was fused with stress granule constituent proteins, including full-length or truncated versions of FUS, TDP-43, and TIA1. Opto-FUS [CRY2<sub>PHR</sub>-mCherry-FUS(IDR)] and Opto-TDP-43 [CRY2<sub>PHR</sub>-mCherry-TDP-43(IDR)] did assemble into droplets with blue light activation, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shin et al., 2017</xref>), but these OptoDroplets did not recruit stress granule constituents commonly used as markers, including G3BP1 and PABP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a–c</xref>), and were also negative for stress granule constituents VCP, SQSTM1, and the related protein OPTN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4d,e</xref>). Similarly, constructs containing the IDR and RNA recognition motifs of FUS or TDP-43 [CRY2<sub>PHR</sub>-mCherry-FUS (1–371 aa); CRY2<sub>PHR</sub>-mCherry-TDP-43 (106–414 aa)] assembled into droplets upon blue light activation, but these droplets were also negative for stress granule markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4f,g</xref>). Expression of Opto-constructs using full-length FUS or TDP-43 [CRY2<sub>PHR</sub>-mCherry-FUS(FL); CRY2<sub>PHR</sub>-mCherry-TDP-43(FL)] did not produce stress granules with blue light activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4f,g</xref>). Finally, Opto-TIA1, which represents fusion of CRY2 with TIA1 (CRY2<sub>PHR</sub>-mCherry-TIA1), also assembled into droplets with blue light activation, but did not drive the assembly of stress granules, as illustrated by lack of colocalization with stress granule markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4h–j</xref>). These data indicate that RNP granule assembly cannot be driven by enforced LLPS of any random constituent, but depends upon specific constituents. This conclusion is consistent with the proposition that LLPS initiated by scaffold proteins (e.g., G3BP1) has the capacity to initiate a membrane-less organelle, whereas client proteins (e.g., FUS, TDP-43, TIA1), even when forced to undergo LLPS, cannot reconstitute such a complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banani et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, we termed Opto-G3BP1-induced stress granules ‘OptoGranules’ to distinguish them from OptoDroplets.</p><p>Phase transitions are highly dependent on protein concentration, and we therefore hypothesized that the induction of OptoGranule assembly would be dependent on the local concentration of activated G3BP1, similar to the concentration-dependent formation of light-activated OptoDroplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shin et al., 2017</xref>). To test this prediction, we controlled the local G3BP1 molecular concentration by modulating either the intensity of the activating blue light or the expression level of the Opto-G3BP1 construct. As predicted, we observed a strong positive correlation between blue light intensity and induction of OptoGranules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>) and, independently, a strong positive correlation between Opto-G3BP1 expression level and induction of OptoGranules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>).

Given that conventional stress granule formation is typically linked to the disassembly of translating polysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Panas et al., 2016</xref>), we tested whether polysome disassembly is required for OptoGranule formation. We determined that treatment with cycloheximide, which traps translating mRNAs within polysomes, strongly mitigated the formation of arsenite-induced stress granules and the formation of light-induced OptoGranules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e,f</xref>), indicating that OptoGranule formation is dependent on polysome disassembly and further illustrating commonality with conventional stress granules. We next tested the role of eIF2α phosphorylation, which integrates stress granule formation downstream of a variety of stressors, such as arsenite and heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Panas et al., 2016</xref>). We used the small molecule ISRIB, which binds eIF2B and interrupts eIF2α-mediated translational control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sidrauski et al., 2015</xref>). We found that formation of arsenite-induced stress granules was blocked by ISRIB, as previously documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sidrauski et al., 2015</xref>), whereas the formation of light-induced OptoGranules was unaffected by ISRIB treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e,f</xref>). Consistent with this finding, Western blotting also showed minimal phosphorylated eIF2α accompanying OptoGranule assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, OptoGranule formation depends upon the recruitment of mRNPs from polysomes, but this assembly occurs downstream and independent of the evolutionarily conserved integrated stress response regulated by eIF2α. This observation is consistent with the notion that OptoGranule formation is not driven by the classic signaling pathway for stress granule formation, which increases the concentration of free, uncoated RNA in the cytoplasm, but rather by oligomerization of G3BP1, which increases the valency for RNA binding.</p><p>Given the accumulating evidence that disturbance of membrane-less organelles such as stress granules may contribute to the initiation or progression of disease, we hypothesized that discrete disturbance in the dynamics or material properties of stress granules should be sufficient to cause cytotoxicity and recapitulate the pathognomonic features of specific diseases. To test this prediction, we examined the consequences of chronic OptoGranule assembly. First, we examined the consequences of continuous blue light activation in cells expressing Opto-G3BP1 or Opto-Control. We found that continuous induction of OptoGranules using a blue-light LED array resulted in progressive loss of cell viability reflected by progressive loss of crystal violet staining and depletion of ATP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref>).

We first used a paradigm consisting of 2 s blue light pulses alternating with 12 s of rest, which drove robust OptoGranule assembly but left insufficient time for granules to disassemble prior to the next light pulse, resulting in persistent OptoGranule assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>).

The presence of A11 immunopositivity in newly formed stress granules suggests that non-pathological amyloid oligomers are present in the mRNPs recruited to these structures, perhaps arising from the prion-like low complexity domains of RNA-binding proteins coating these mRNPs. While these are presumably physiological amyloids, it is conceivable that their close packing in the condensed liquid state of persistent stress granules risks seeding the assembly of pathological amyloids, particularly for proteins like TDP-43 that can adopt highly stable structures.</p><p>Remarkably, the characteristics of OptoGranules changed during chronic assembly. First, OptoGranules showed time-dependent reduction in dynamics as assessed by FRAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c,d</xref>). Moreover, we observed that immunopositivity for TDP-43, A11, and ubiquitin gradually increased over time, and after approximately two hours of OptoGranule assembly, these granules showed immunopositivity using two distinct anti-phospho-TDP-43 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f–i</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1e,f</xref>). The anti-phospho-TDP-43 antibodies specifically recognize phosphorylation of TDP-43 at residues Ser409/410, a pathological signature specific to a spectrum of sporadic and familial forms of TDP-43 proteinopathies, including ALS-FTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Neumann et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, after approximately five hours of chronic OptoGranule assembly, we observed a significant increase in immunopositivity using antibodies to phospho-TDP-43 and the ubiquitin-binding proteins SQSTM1 and VCP, illustrating further evolution of these structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g–i</xref>).Thus, not only does chronic OptoGranule assembly cause a loss of cell viability, but cell death is preceded by the evolution of OptoGranules into cytoplasmic inclusions that recapitulate features that are pathognomonic for ALS-FTD.</p><p>We next examined the consequence of protracted stress granule assembly in a more disease-relevant, neuronal context by generating human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons, which we verified had a cortical molecular identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>). In response to arsenite or heat shock stresses, these iPSC-derived neurons assembled conventional stress granules that were positive for TIA1 and TDP-43, indicating that they were suitable for examining the consequences of chronic stress granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Next, we introduced mRuby-tagged Opto-G3BP1 into differentiated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). In mRuby-Opto-G3BP1-expressing neurons, blue light activation induced the assembly of OptoGranules indistinguishable from those observed in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Videos 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">5</xref>). Chronic induction of OptoGranules following transient introduction of mRuby-Opto-G3BP1 resulted in progressive loss of neuronal viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>) and the formation of neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions that were immunopositive for TDP-43, A11, and ubiquitin, with time-dependent immunopositivity for phosphorylated TDP-43 and SQSTM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d–i</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1e</xref>). We also generated iPSCs stably expressing inducible Opto-G3BP1 (doxycycline-inducible mCherry-tagged Opto-G3BP1), in which Opto-G3BP1 expression was induced simultaneously with neuronal differentiation by the addition of doxycycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a</xref>). In these cells, Opto-G3BP1 remained diffuse until activation with blue light, whereupon these neurons assembled dynamic OptoGranules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2b</xref>). With continuous stimulation, these OptoGranules further evolved into neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions that were positive for phospho-TDP-43, A11, ubiquitin, and SQSTM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2c–f</xref>). Thus, chronic OptoGranule induction recapitulates the evolution of ALS-FTD pathology and neurotoxicity in human iPSC-derived neurons.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39578.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Persistent OptoGranules are cytotoxic and evolve to pathological inclusions in human iPSC-derived neurons.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic illustrating generation of iPSC-derived neurons stably expressing Opto-G3BP1.

In particular, we contrast the consequences of optogenetically enforced, intracellular LLPS of G3BP1 to those of FUS, TDP-43, and TIA1. These proteins are all constituents of stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jain et al., 2016</xref>) that undergo LLPS in vitro (Yang, Mathieu <italic>et al</italic>., unpublished) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mackenzie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Patel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Conicella et al., 2016</xref>). Yet, LLPS of G3BP1 results in the formation of OptoGranules, whereas FUS, TDP-43, and TIA1 form OptoDroplets that do not initiate stress granule assembly. OptoGranules and OptoDroplets are similar insofar as both types of assemblies are initiated with optically induced LLPS. Indeed, it is this similarity that suggested the name ‘OptoGranules,’ since they were inspired by and built upon observations made by Shin <italic>et al</italic>. regarding OptoDroplets. Beyond this similarity, however, OptoDroplets and OptoGranules are fundamentally different. This distinction is straightforward when considering evidence that biomolecular condensates are composed of clients and scaffolds that play fundamentally different roles in the assembly and maintenance of these condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banani et al., 2016</xref>). In unpublished work that strongly informed the development of OptoGranules, we identified G3BP as a uniquely essential central scaffold protein for stress granules, in contrast to TIA1, TDP-43, FUS and many others, which are client proteins (Yang, Mathieu <italic>et al</italic>., unpublished). The differences in the assemblies formed by client proteins versus those formed by scaffold proteins make sense, since client proteins often reside in multiple biomolecular condensates with distinct identities. In contrast, enforced LLPS of a scaffold protein initiates the cascade of events that seeds the assembly of a full-fledged, complex stress granule.</p><p>We also highlight a second, more subtle distinction. OptoDroplets formed by Opto-TDP-43, Opto-FUS, and Opto-TIA1 have their biophysical origin in CRY2 oligomerization that presumably forces the IDRs of these proteins to self-associate and initiate a phase transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shin et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, activation of Opto-G3BP1 forms granules because CRY2-based multimerization (specifically via the replaced NTF2L domain) increases the valency of G3BP, permitting it to engage with another scaffolding element (i.e., a class of RNAs), and these interactions create a seed that subsequently undergoes a phase transition that mediates subsequent further assembly of a stress granule.</p><p>Among the many membrane-less organelles that arise through phase transitions, stress granules have drawn the most attention from the ALS-FTD field because of their cytoplasmic location, which matches the location of pathological deposits in ALS-FTD, and the many disease-associated proteins that are components of stress granules. However, we must emphatically note that LLPS-mediated assembly, dynamics, and material properties of stress granules must be viewed within the context of a larger cellular network of membrane-less organelles, which include a wide variety of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNP granules. Indeed, membrane-less organelles are now recognized as functionally relevant biomolecular condensates that underlie different segregated biochemistries within a single cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banani et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, their material properties (e.g., assembly/disassembly rates, mobility, viscosity) likely influence these functions; indeed, the data presented here supports the burgeoning hypothesis that ALS-FTD arises from disturbances in the dynamics and material properties of membrane-less organelles, with devastating consequences over time.</p><p>Extending this hypothesis, we speculate that disease may reflect simultaneous pathological disturbance of multiple membrane-less organelles that arises by derangement of a network of multiple, independent phases. These interconnections likely reflect communication across different types of membrane-less compartments based on rapid, dynamic exchange of macromolecules (e.g., RNA and RNA-binding proteins) and small molecules that act as vehicles to communicate material states throughout the network. An example of this is seen in the recent report that perturbation of one phase-separated compartment (stress granules) alters the properties and function of a distinct phase-separated structure (the nuclear pore) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). With such a system-wide regulation, primary disturbances in the material properties of one node of the network (e.g., stress granules) may lead to secondary disturbances that are propagated throughout the entire network of membrane-less organelles.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (Human)</td><td valign="top">U-2 OS</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">HTB-96;

These Optogranules consist of G3BP linked to a light-sensitive CRY2/PHR domain. It is demonstrated that the Optogranules contain polyadenylated mRNAs and stress granule markers (in contrast to the Optodroplets formed based on FUS, TDP-43 and TIA1). Apart from the characterization of the Optogranules, repetitive stimulation of cells with blue light induces cell death. This also leads to a change in the composition of the Optogranules as, amongst others, phospho-TDP43 and ubiquitin stain positive in these Optogranules. In general, this is an interesting paper and most of the experiments are convincingly performed. However, there are a few important issues that need to be addressed and that will further strengthen the conclusions of the paper.</p><p>Major comments</p><p>– A major concern is that at least some of the data presented in this manuscript are very qualitative in nature. A lot of what is presented is based on co-stainings of a few cells and colocalisation in (part of) one cell. Despite the fact that these are most likely typical examples, one always worries that there could be a selection bias and that stainings are more likely to be selected if these are in accordance with what one expects. With the data provided, it is impossible to judge whether for instance the maturation of the droplets into droplets that are positive for phospho-TDP-43 and ubiquitin, as well as for other markers, is a valid observation. These changes are nicely shown in a schematic overview in Figure 3E and Figure 4D. However, it is not clear on how many cells/droplets this is based and whether there was a real time-dependent quantification underlying these data. Especially Figure 4 suffers from this lack of quantification. Although images in panels e-h are representative of 3 independent experiments, a clear indication of the% of Optogranules which colocalise with pTDP-43, ubiquitin, P62 etc. and how this changes with time is crucial.</p><p>– Stress granules are thought to be transient structures, forming rapidly in response to stress. Although the authors demonstrate that Optogranules form rapidly in response to blue light, in seconds or minutes (Figure 1B, Figure 1G), it is unclear why the authors switch from an approx. 5 min induction to a 6 h induction paradigm (Figure 1H to 1J) when demonstrating recruitment of known stress granule proteins. Are these other stress granule proteins only recruited in response to sustained assembly of opto-G3BP1? The authors should look at earlier time points. The same induction paradigm is also used in Figure 2.</p><p>- It is not so clear whether it is indeed the change over time of the composition of the Optogranules after repetitive stimulation with blue light that is responsible for the induction of the cell death. Some additional experiments should be performed to clarify this issue. Is the dynamics of the formation and disassembly of Optogranules changing over time? It should also be investigated whether there is an effect of repetitive stimulation of the cells on the physicochemical properties of the stress granules. How is fluorescence for instance recovering after photobleaching?</p><p>– The added value of the iPSC related experiments is not so clear. It should be clarified in more detail in which sense the Optogranules are different in these cells in comparison to the Optogranules in the U2OS cells. At present, the overall impression is that what is concluded from these experiments is very similar (identical) to what was observed in the U2OS cells. If so, one wonders how the described process could lead to selective neuronal death.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>– The quality of some of the figures seems suboptimal (could be due to the conversion to a pdf). One clear example is the first figure illustrating the formation of Optogranules. While it is clear in the movie, it is much less clear to observe the individual droplets in Figure 1B.</p><p>– It is indicated that the Optocontrol construct also forms a modest amount of nuclear and cytoplasmic clusters. It is not clear what the identity of these clusters is. Can this be determined and discussed in more detail?</p><p>– No Opto-control is provided for the experiment in Figure 1G.</p><p>– Figure 1—figure supplement 2: The length of time that cells were exposed to blue light is not stated. Was this the same 6 h induction used in Figure 1?</p><p>– Figure 2A and 2B, quantification would be more convincing. e.g.% of cells with stress granules plotted over time after induction. The experiment should also be controlled using the Opto-control construct.</p><p>– Figure 2C and D: It is concluded that the Optogranule assembly is independent of the regulation by eIF2alpha. This important observation should be discussed in more detail.</p><p>– Figure 2E: Not clear whether the same blot was reprobed or whether different blots are shown for phospho-eIF2alpha and eIF2alpha. Why is the eIF2alpha at the top (and not in the middle) of the part of the blot that is shown?</p><p>– All stress granule components that were studied colocalised with the Optogranules. One obvious candidate that is missing in this long list is FUS (Results section). Was FUS present in these Optogranules?</p><p>– Figure 3A: What is the effect of continuous blue light on the U2OS cells?</p><p>– Figure 3C and D: From the Kaplan-Meier plots one can estimate that approximately 10-15 cells are followed after induction of the Optogranule formation. How were these cells selected and how many were selected in the three different independent experiments.</p><p>– Figure 3C and D: Is there a statistical difference between the cell death induced by the induction of chronic persistent granules or after induction of chronic intermittent granules?</p><p>– Figure 3: On the Y-axis of panel c and d, the numbers are missing. It is also not clear whether the blue boxes are based on a quantification or whether these boxes represent what is expected (should be specified in the legend).</p><p>– Figure 4: It is unclear whether persistent induction of Optogranules causes increased phosphorylation of TDP-43 or simply recruitment of a population which is already present in the cell. The authors should quantify the total levels of phospho-TDP-43 before and after chronic induction of Optogranule assembly to determine whether levels are increased.</p><p>– More details should be provided on the nature/quality of the neurons that are differentiated from the iPSCs. Are these cortical neurons? How pure are these neuronal cultures? Are these neurons electrically active?</p><p>Additional data files and statistical comments:</p><p>It is not always clear whether the correct statistics is used. One example is Figure 3B. A Student t-test doesn't seem to be the correct way to evaluate whether these differences are statistically different. Moreover, as these are box plots, it seems unlikely that the variation is indicated as standard deviations (s.d.) as is indicated in the figure legend.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Very interesting paper – extremely easy to read and parse. Important for field, enjoyed reading, lots of interesting insights.</p><p>Some comments:</p><p>* It is hard to assess the degree of recruitment of different factors without any quantification (i.e. just from pictures). For example, it is not clear to be that there is bona fide p62 recruitment in neurons (Figure 4H). If this were a normal review I would insist this must be quantified to some degree (e.g. pixel mutual information using an intensity threshold as a binary mask, given intensities are hard to interpret).</p><p>* There are three distinct modes of illumination: continuous (Figure 3A), chronic persistent (Figure 3C) and chronic intermittent (Figure 3D). It is difficult to determine which is used in which experiment. I would strongly suggest standardizing this and ensuring each experiment is clearly labelled regarding which regime is used. Without this interpreting the data (for the reader) becomes difficult.</p><p>* The OptoXXX language used is a little confusing. In the Shin et al. paper, OptoDroplets refers to the general system of a Cry2 domain fused to something:</p><p>&quot;Here, we introduce an optogenetic platform that uses light to activate IDR-mediated phase transitions in living cells. We use this 'optoDroplet' system to study condensed phases driven by the IDRs of various RNP body proteins&quot;</p><p>Here, OptoGranules refer to the physical cellular assemblies (to distinguish them from stress granules – which makes semantic sense) and OptoG3BP1 is an example of an OptoDroplet construct that contains G3BP1. The fact that the OptoDroplet work is not used to introduce the technology is odd. The results determined here are of significant biological relevance and interest, but the approach is fundamentally the OptoDroplet platform applied to a different protein. The fact that OptoDroplets are only introduced once the OptoGranule system has been described:</p><p>'These results contrast with observations made with light-induced aggregation of so-called &quot;OptoDroplets,&quot; which nicely…'</p><p>Gives the impression that this is a different approach system, which is not the case (Figure 1A from this paper and 1A from Shin et al. are essentially interchangeable), and comes across as a little disingenuous. This was a general sentiment I heard from various places when the original preprint went up. It is surprising to me, because all of the exciting results pertain to the biology, not to the method, so it's unclear why the approach is introduced without basically saying &quot;Here we extended the OptoDroplet system to examine the role of G3BP1 in nucleating stress granules…&quot; or something to this effect.</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>* It would be useful to draw the schematic (Figure 1A) with the domains proportional to their number of amino acids</p><p>* Cry2+mCherry = ~840 amino acids (96 kDa), while NTF2 = 142 amino acids (16 kDa)</p><p>* This, of course, may be impractical, in which case simply including the regional size in number of amino acids would be sufficient</p><p>* Is the absence of SGs in response to the double G3BP1/2 knockout a true absence of stress granules, or an absence of assemblies with G3BP1/Tia1/PAB1 markers – have other markers been checked?</p><p>* &quot;…insinuate into stress granules and other membrane-less organelles&quot; – not sure insinuate has an appropriate meaning here? 'Infiltrate' perhaps?</p><p>* Figure 1—figure supplement 1B is the same as part of Figure 1A?</p><p>* &quot;Opto-Control expression remained diffuse, with a modest amount of nuclear and cytoplasmic clusters (Figure 1B and Supplementary Video 1).&quot; – the text is intriguing, though it wasn't obviously clear to me where these cytoplasmic clusters are in Figure 1B? But assuming you do see some level of clusters, why is an obligate dimer able to lead to any degree of cluster formation? I would have expected dimers to be far far below the resolution limit such that monomer/dimer Opto-Control should be equally diffuse</p><p>* When the OptoControl is off it appears to partition into the nucleus (Figure 1H, 1I, 1J) but when activated it is strongly excluded. Both monomeric and dimeric version should be larger than the threshold size for free permeability into the nucleus sans an NLS, so its not clear how/why light should be changing the distribution – some explanation of this would be useful (i.e. does this imply there are additional un-characterized responses to blue-light stimulation?).</p><p>* Are the expression levels of OptoG3BP1 comparable to endogenous G3BP1? I realize expression is clearly a tunable parameter as addressed in Figure 2, so it would be useful, as a reference, to mention the expression levels of endogenous protein here.</p><p>* &quot;Expression of Opto-constructs using full-length TDP-43 or FUS [CRY2PHR-mCherry-TDP-43(FL); CRY2PHR-mCherry-TDP-43(FL)] did not produce cytoplasmic clusters with blue light activation&quot; (minor point – I believe the second instance here should be CRY2PHR-mCherry-FUS(FL))</p><p>This is a very interesting result for two reasons</p><p>1) It’ not clear to me why FL-FUS OptoDroplets should not form assemblies, especially given recent reports that FL FUS assemblies much more readily than the LCD alone. Any thoughts on this in the discussion would, I think, be very useful. [1]</p><p>2) Recent work has shown that the NTD of TDP43 forms dimers that are necessary for phase separation in full-length TDP-43. In agreement with this, the CRY2 dimerization domain appears able to replace this N-terminal domain and give rise to droplets, HOWEVER, if the N-terminal domain is present (i.e. in CRY2PHR-mCherry-TDP-43(FL)) droplet formation is suppressed – any possible mechanism here would be useful to address – specifically, how does the ADDITION of a dimerization domain between CRY2 and the C-terminal portion of TPD43 suppress assembly?</p><p>* These questions are directly related to the comparison of other optoDroplet constructs</p><p>* Not sure how to interpret the Opto-G3BP1 vs G3BP1-GFP RNA binding data? Naively from the description of the RNA binding assay I would have expected 1) cross-linking to cause G3BP1 in stress granules to extensively cross-link with local RNAs, while under non-stress/non OptoGranule inducing conditions there would be minimal RNA cross-linking and 2) for Opto-G3BP1 and G3BP1-GFP to be similar. Instead, the data appear to show that you get extensive and essentially identical RNA binding under stressed and non-stressed conditions, and that Opto-G3BP1 and G3BP1-GFP have different RNA binding profiles. Similarly, not sure how to interpret the western blot associated with 2b – it would be useful to explicitly annotate what the bands are. This is almost certainly just a limitation of my understanding of the experimental setup, but it seems at least plausible others might also be confused…</p><p>* In the protein name SQSTM1 is used, while in Figure 3 p62 is used – this may confusing for people unfamiliar with the protein, so I'd suggest a consistent naming scheme</p><p>* I found the mCherry vs. mRuby optoG3BP1 section confusing on the first read, as it was initially unclear why both would be needed. I would suggest splitting this into a 'first we used mRuby-optoG3BP1…', then once this has been completed, explain why an inducible system is needed and then introduce the inducible mCherry variant.</p><p>* Why is the pTDP-43 recruitment to SGs in neurons so much weaker than in U2OS cells? In U2OS see reasonable recruitment just 1 hour in, with robust recruitment after 2 hours. In neurons after 5 hours (4g) there is basically no co-localization with optoG3BP1, and then after 6 robust co-localization is observed.</p><p>[1] Qamar, S., Wang, G., Randle, S.J., Ruggeri, F.S., Varela, J.A., Lin, J.Q., Phillips, E.C., Miyashita, A., Williams, D., Ströhl, F., et al.

The reviewers raised some excellent points, which we address below.</p><p>We also wish to highlight our answer to one question from the reviewers regarding the difference between OptoDroplets and OptoGranules. These are similar insofar as both types of assemblies are initiated with optically induced phase separation. Indeed, it is this similarity that suggested the name “OptoGranules,” since they were inspired by and built upon observations made by Shin et al. regarding OptoDroplets. Beyond this similarity, however, OptoDroplets and OptoGranules are fundamentally different. This distinction is straightforward when considering evidence that biomolecular condensates are composed of <italic>clients</italic> and <italic>scaffolds</italic> that play fundamentally different roles in the assembly and maintenance of these condensates. In unpublished work that strongly informed the development of OptoGranules, we identified G3BP as a <italic>uniquely essential central scaffold protein</italic> for stress granules, in contrast to TIA1, TDP-43, FUS, and many others, which are <italic>client</italic> proteins (Yang, Mathieu et al., in review). Please note, this manuscript has been made available for assessment by the editors and reviewers. In Yang, Mathieu et al., we show that G3BP dimerization and multivalent RNA binding drives phase separation with long, single- stranded mRNAs to form complexes that seed stress granule assembly. Moreover, this work revealed that the native dimerization element in G3BP could be functionally replaced by heterologous dimerization domains, which informed the design of Opto-G3BP1. In fact, simply tagging G3BP1 with CRY2 <italic>does not</italic> produce a fusion protein capable of efficiently producing stress granules in response to optical induction. In the present manuscript, we show that enforced phase separation of <italic>client</italic> proteins (TIA1, TDP-43, and FUS) using CRY2 generates OptoDroplets, which are relatively homogenous intracellular condensates, thereby confirming the results of Shin et al., but we also demonstrate that these are not stress granules. This makes sense since <italic>client</italic> proteins often reside in multiple biomolecular condensates with distinct identities. In contrast, enforced phase separation of a <italic>scaffold</italic> protein initiates the cascade of events that seeds the assembly of a full-fledged, complex stress granule, which we term an OptoGranule. Thus, an important takeaway from this work is the critical role of specific scaffolding elements in establishing and maintaining the identity of specific biomolecular condensates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Separate reviews (please respond to each point):</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Liquid-liquid phase separation drives the assembly of stress granules (SGs) in response to a variety of exogenous stressors.

Other proteins likely participate in the initial phase transition that drives stress granule assembly, and thus are also “recruited” from the outset. Indeed, dynamic imaging in Figure 1G shows simultaneous recruitment of TIA1 and G3BP1 to stress granules presumably for this reason. Yet, there are &gt;400 distinct protein constituents and &gt;1800 distinct RNAs that have been reported in stress granules. As the reviewer suggests, some constituents are sequentially recruited (which we take to mean that there is a temporal delay in their recruitment after a microscopically visible stress granule is evident). For example, we have demonstrated delayed recruitment of the ubiquitin-binding proteins p62/SQSTM1 and VCP, and this is preceded by the appearance of ubiquitin signal in OptoGranules (Figures 3G-I and 4H-I). The clear implication of this finding is that a specific post-translational modification results in the subsequent recruitment of constituents that were not initially part of an RNP and we are anxious to learn how common this is. Chemical modifications of RNA or protein may be a general mechanism contributing to both delayed recruitment of constituents or time-dependent maturation of stress granules (as shown by reduced dynamics in mature stress granules in new Figure 3—figure supplement 1C-D). The OptoGranule system provides a tool to address these and many other fundamental questions about the molecular mechanism underlying RNP granule assembly in general, stress granule assembly in particular, and the relationship of stress granules to a wide variety of biological functions. These questions go beyond the scope of this initial report, which aims to illustrate (1) proof of concept that optically driven aggregation of a key scaffolding element can seed assembly of a complete membrane-less organelle, and (2) that protracted stress granule assembly is cytotoxic and recapitulates features of a specific neurodegenerative disease.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors showed that the formation of FUS-, TDP-43- or TIA1-based OptoDroplets does not recapitulate the formation of stress granules. OptoDroplets do not colocalize with G3BP1-GFP and PABP. Do OptoDroplets contain other components of SGs such as VCP, p62 and OPTN? Mutations in these ALS disease genes cause accumulation of SGs. Does mutant FUS, TDP-43 or TIA1 induce SG formation in this system?</p></disp-quote><p>No, as shown in new Figure 1—figure supplement 4D-E, J OptoDroplets formed from light-induced aggregation of TDP-43, FUS, or TIA1 do not recruit or colocalize with p62/SQSTM1, VCP, or OPTN, just as they do not recruit canonical stress granule constituents. This is an important point and speaks to a larger question addressed partially in this manuscript but more explicitly in a companion manuscript currently under review (Yang, Mathieu et al., in review). Please note, this manuscript has been made available to <italic>eLife</italic> for assessment by editors and reviewers. Quoting from this companion manuscript:</p><p>“RNP granules are complex structures composed of hundreds of RNAs and proteins. Although it has become evident as a general principle that RNP granule assembly likely reflects cooperative protein-protein, protein-RNA, and RNA-RNA interactions between the many constituents of these structures, the precise interactions required for specific types of RNP granules are almost entirely unknown. Moreover, the underlying mechanism(s) that permit distinct RNP granule identities to be established and maintained are largely enigmatic. For example, nuclear speckles and Cajal bodies can be clearly distinguished from one another by morphology, subcellular localization, constituents, and function. A similar distinction is evident for cytoplasmic P bodies and stress granules. Given that these biomolecular condensates share common principles of assembly, are built from highly similar (and sometimes overlapping) constituent RNA molecules and proteins, and remain in dynamic equilibrium with a shared milieu, how do these structures establish and maintain distinct identities?”</p><p>In brief, the answer to this question is that RNP granule assembly is initiated by a limited number of scaffolding molecules and cannot be recapitulated by enforced phase transition of any random constituent. For stress granules, a whole-genome screen identified G3BP as a uniquely essential scaffolding factor in initiating assembly and maintaining identity (Yang, Mathieu et al., in review). This scaffolding protein is distinct from other protein components of stress granules (e.g., TDP-43, FUS, TIA1), which we classify as “client” proteins. This is why optically induced phase separation of G3BP1, an essential scaffold for stress granules, initiates assembly of a complex organelle, whereas optically induced aggregation of other proteins or fragments, such as client proteins TDP-43, FUS, or TIA1, does not.</p><p>OptoDroplets (e.g., condensates formed by client proteins) also differ from OptoGranules (e.g., complex granules formed by scaffold proteins) also provide different advantages for experimental purposes. The former offers a generalizable approach to monitor the biophysical phase transition properties of proteins in cells and correlate those with behavior in reconstituted biochemical systems. The latter builds upon the experimental foundation of the OptoDroplet system to seed the formation of a specific complex membrane-less organelle by using optogenetic oligomerization of a specific, essential scaffolding protein. Thus, OptoGranules can be used to test specific hypotheses regarding the assembly, kinetics, and maturation of specific types of complex organelles.</p><p>Importantly, the OptoGranule system requires knowledge of both the <italic>identity</italic> of the critical scaffolding elements and <italic>how</italic> these elements contribute to assembly. In this case, we used our prior knowledge of G3BP1 and the mechanism of stress granule assembly to rationally design the seed for a stress granule. This approach is also likely to be generalizable as the identities of essential scaffolding proteins are identified for a variety of RNP granules.</p><p>To answer the reviewer’s related question regarding whether exogenous overexpression of mutant FUS, TDP-43, or TIA1 induces stress granule formation in this system, we show in new Figure 1—figure supplement 1B that overexpression of mutant FUS, TDP-43, or TIA1 induces stress granule formation in Opto-G3BP1 cell lines, as expected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>In Figure 1B, enlarged images showing the disassembly of granules could be presented. Discrete granules are hard to see over high expression background.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good suggestion. We have now added enlarged images to expanded Figure 1B.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper by Zhang et al. describes the formation of Optogranules induced by blue light. These Optogranules consist of G3BP linked to a light-sensitive CRY2/PHR domain. It is demonstrated that the Optogranules contain polyadenylated mRNAs and stress granule markers (in contrast to the Optodroplets formed based on FUS, TDP-43 and TIA1). Apart from the characterization of the Optogranules, repetitive stimulation of cells with blue light induces cell death. This also leads to a change in the composition of the Optogranules as, amongst others, phospho-TDP43 and ubiquitin stain positive in these Optogranules. In general, this is an interesting paper and most of the experiments are convincingly performed. However, there are a few important issues that need to be addressed and that will further strengthen the conclusions of the paper.</p><p>Major comments</p><p>– A major concern is that at least some of the data presented in this manuscript are very qualitative in nature. A lot of what is presented is based on co-stainings of a few cells and colocalisation in (part of) one cell. Despite the fact that these are most likely typical examples, one always worries that there could be a selection bias and that stainings are more likely to be selected if these are in accordance with what one expects. With the data provided, it is impossible to judge whether for instance the maturation of the droplets into droplets that are positive for phospho-TDP-43 and ubiquitin, as well as for other markers, is a valid observation. These changes are nicely shown in a schematic overview in Figure 3E and Figure 4D. However, it is not clear on how many cells/droplets this is based and whether there was a real time-dependent quantification underlying these data. Especially Figure 4 suffers from this lack of quantification. Although images in panels e-h are representative of 3 independent experiments, a clear indication of the% of Optogranules which colocalise with pTDP-43, ubiquitin, P62 etc. and how this changes with time is crucial.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, quantitative information was collected in the course of conducting the presented experiments. This quantitative data, with accompanying statistical analyses, has now been added to the figures. With reference to the reviewer’s specific comments, we call attention to new Figure 3I and Figure 4I, which show quantification of stress granule markers over time.</p><p>A brief, but not unimportant note: OptoGranules <italic>do not</italic> “consist of G3BP linked to a light- sensitive CRY2/PHR domain.” In fact, simply tagging G3BP1 with CRY2 does not produce a fusion protein capable of efficiently producing stress granules in response to optical induction. For the system to work, one must replace the native dimerization element in G3BP with an optically inducible multimerization element. Moreover, OptoGranules <italic>are not</italic> merely droplets of G3BP1. Rather, enforced phase separation of G3BP1 initiates a cascade of assembly that results in the formation of a full-fledged, complex RNP granule that is indistinguishable from an endogenous stress granule. This is because G3BP1 is the essential protein scaffold of stress granules.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Stress granules are thought to be transient structures, forming rapidly in response to stress. Although the authors demonstrate that Optogranules form rapidly in response to blue light, in seconds or minutes (Figure 1B, Figure 1G), it is unclear why the authors switch from an approx. 5 min induction to a 6 h induction paradigm (Figure 1H to 1J) when demonstrating recruitment of known stress granule proteins. Are these other stress granule proteins only recruited in response to sustained assembly of opto-G3BP1? The authors should look at earlier time points. The same induction paradigm is also used in Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We used two different blue light sources depending on the experimental design and readout. Specifically, for live imaging experiments, in which stress granule dynamics were monitored in real time, including experiments with intermittent activation, we used a photoactivation laser tuned to 455 or 488 nm, which has a powerful energy density (~2.5 MW/cm<sup>2</sup>for one-time activation or &gt; ~4.5 W/cm<sup>2</sup> for repeated activations) in a defined region of interest. However, this approach allows only a few cells to be examined at one time. For experiments requiring larger numbers of cells and therefore necessitating a broader field of illumination, we switched to a blue-light LED array (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, in a humidified incubator), which had a much lower energy density (~2 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) and induced OptoGranule formation over a longer time frame. This approach was used for experiments in which cells were fixed and stained for subsequent quantitative assessment. Importantly, in both experimental approaches the recruitment of stress granule components matched the kinetics of OptoGranule assembly. We point the reviewer to Figure 1G, Supplementary Video 3, Figures 3F-3H, and Figures 4E-4F, in which we assessed recruitment of stress granule markers at earlier time points (1-4 minutes and 1-2 hours post-induction) compared to the 6-hour time point shown in Figures 1H-1J and Figures 2C-E (now Figures 2E-G). Specific laser powers and energy densities are now consistently described in the figure legends, and we have added clarification in the main text to signal when we use each of the two light sources.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is not so clear whether it is indeed the change over time of the composition of the Optogranules after repetitive stimulation with blue light that is responsible for the induction of the cell death. Some additional experiments should be performed to clarify this issue. Is the dynamics of the formation and disassembly of Optogranules changing over time? It should also be investigated whether there is an effect of repetitive stimulation of the cells on the physicochemical properties of the stress granules. How is fluorescence for instance recovering after photobleaching?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, importantly, we see evidence of maturation of granules such that their dynamics diminish with time. We believe that this may relate to the evolution of pathological inclusions. We have quantified this data and now present these results in new Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and 1D.</p><p>Regarding the reviewer’s question about “whether it is indeed the change over time of the composition of the OptoGranules after repetitive stimulation with blue light that is responsible for the induction of the cell death,” there was a clear correlation between repetitive induction of OptoGranules and cell death, but the mechanism of that cell death is unknown at this point. We believe that cell death is related to the OptoGranules because (to the extent possible) we have eliminated the confounding elements of exogenous stressors to induce granules, controlled for misexpression of fluorescently tagged proteins, and controlled for blue light exposure. Whether death relates to the <italic>composition</italic> of the granules is an interesting suggestion, but remains speculative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The added value of the iPSC related experiments is not so clear. It should be clarified in more detail in which sense the Optogranules are different in these cells in comparison to the Optogranules in the U2OS cells. At present, the overall impression is that what is concluded from these experiments is very similar (identical) to what was observed in the U2OS cells. If so, one wonders how the described process could lead to selective neuronal death.</p></disp-quote><p>We wanted to document the phenomenology of OptoGranule assembly and evolution in two different cell types, one of which has direct relevance to disease. Indeed, the results are qualitatively the same in U2OS cells and the iPSC-derived neurons, although within the “chronic persistent” paradigm, the neurons (Figure 4C) showed cell death much sooner than the U2OS cells (Figure 3C). With respect to cell type-specific vulnerability, we do not currently have sufficient evidence to conclude that neurons have increased vulnerability to repetitive stimulation of stress granules. It should be noted that aberrant stress granules are also linked to non-neuronal cell pathology, such as is observed in muscle diseases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>– The quality of some of the figures seems suboptimal (could be due to the conversion to a pdf). One clear example is the first figure illustrating the formation of Optogranules. While it is clear in the movie, it is much less clear to observe the individual droplets in Figure 1B.</p></disp-quote><p>We have optimized the images by reverting to the original high-resolution image files, including those shown in Figure 1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is indicated that the Optocontrol construct also forms a modest amount of nuclear and cytoplasmic clusters. It is not clear what the identity of these clusters is. Can this be determined and discussed in more detail?</p></disp-quote><p>We used two different Opto-Control constructs in this paper; one (“Opto- Control”) is a fusion protein of mCherry and wild-type CRY2, and the other (“Opto-Control (olig)”) is a fusion protein of mCherry and a mutant form of CRY2 (CRY2-olig) that forms abundant CRY2 clusters upon activation.</p><p>Like many proteins containing mCherry, the Opto-Control fusion protein undergoes a modest amount of nonspecific aggregation that is related to its degree of expression. Importantly, these clusters are negative for stress granule markers, including &gt;10 proteins and polyA RNA (Figure 1H-J and data not shown). Furthermore, we affinity purified this protein and found by mass spectrometry that it does not associate with any stress granule proteins (data not shown).</p><p>To further challenge the negative results obtained with Opto-Control, we used Opto-Control (olig) to aggravate the aggregation of the fusion protein. The aggregates formed by Opto-Control (olig) were poorly dynamic by FRAP (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1D-F) and were negative for stress granule markers (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– No Opto-control is provided for the experiment in Figure 1G.</p></disp-quote><p>We now show the control experiment in new Figure 1—figure supplement 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 1—figure supplement 2: The length of time that cells were exposed to blue light is not stated. Was this the same 6 h induction used in Figure 1?</p></disp-quote><p>In the resubmission, these images have now been incorporated into Figure 1—figure supplement 4. As detailed in the figure legend, cells were imaged after different time periods of blue light exposure, as appropriate. Images capturing live-cell GFP-G3BP1 fluorescence (panels B, C, I) were captured immediately after a 5-msec pulse by a blue-light laser. Images of cells that were fixed and stained for stress granule markers were captured after 2 hours (panels F, G) and 5 hours (panels D, E, J) of blue-light LED exposure depending on the time required for each marker to accumulate in OptoGranules.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2A and 2B, quantification would be more convincing. e.g.% of cells with stress granules plotted over time after induction. The experiment should also be controlled using the Opto-control construct.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, quantitative information was collected in the course of conducting the experiments presented. With regard to the reviewer’s specific comments, we call attention to new Figures 2B and 2D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2C and D: It is concluded that the Optogranule assembly is independent of the regulation by eIF2alpha. This important observation should be discussed in more detail.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point that we now discuss more explicitly in the manuscript. Stress granule assembly may be initiated in response to a wide variety of stimuli, including viral infection, oxidative stress, heat shock, and proteasome inhibition. Recent studies have provided substantial insight into the molecular basis of stress granule assembly. Often, stress granule assembly is initiated through an accumulation of uncoated RNA in the cytoplasm. This can occur when stress signaling culminates in phosphorylation of the translation factor eIF2α, which inhibits translation initiation. Subsequent disassembly of translating polysomes and concomitant accumulation of uncoated, non-translating mRNAs favor stress granule assembly.</p><p>Alternatively, stress granule assembly may be initiated by oligomerization of the scaffolding protein G3BP, which bypasses the need for eIF2α phosphorylation. In brief, we have learned that stress granule assembly is driven by phase transition of G3BP with RNAs that have certain features (long, single-stranded, and limited secondary structure) (Yang, Mathieu et al., in review). When the collective protein-protein, protein-RNA, and RNA-RNA interactions breach a critical threshold, they undergo phase separation and initiate stress granule assembly. There are two ways to reach this threshold. The first and most common way is RNA-driven, as described above, and is based on increasing the concentration of RNA via inhibition of translation via phosphorylation of eIF2α. The second way to reach the critical threshold for phase transition is protein-driven, wherein oligomerization of G3BP increases valency for RNA binding. This latter mechanism is exploited in this manuscript, where oligomerization is forced through a CRY2- mediated interaction. As anticipated, this mechanism of stress granule assembly does require polysome disassembly, but does not involve the upstream step of phosphorylation of eIF2α.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2E: Not clear whether the same blot was reprobed or whether different blots are shown for phospho-eIF2alpha and eIF2alpha. Why is the eIF2alpha at the top (and not in the middle) of the part of the blot that is shown?</p></disp-quote><p>In this figure panel (now Figure 2G) the same membrane was reprobed sequentially using antibodies corresponding to different species. The full membrane blotting data with serial antibodies are now shown in new Figure 2—figure supplement 1. Because the actin signal appears so closely above the eIF2α signal, the final cropped blot shows the eIF2α bands at the top of the cropped image. Methodological details have now been added to the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– All stress granule components that were studied colocalised with the Optogranules. One obvious candidate that is missing in this long list is FUS (Results section). Was FUS present in these Optogranules?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, FUS is present in OptoGranules, as now shown in new Figure 1—figure supplement 2G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 3A: What is the effect of continuous blue light on the U2OS cells?</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in new Figure 3B, there is background toxicity associated with chronic exposure to blue light, which is unchanged by expression of Opto-Control. There is a significant increase in toxicity when cells express Opto-G3BP1, which we interpret as stress granule-dependent toxicity. Because of background toxicity associated with chronic exposure to blue light, we designed the “intermittent activation” paradigm to minimize the total dosage of light exposure, as described in the manuscript text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 3C and D: From the Kaplan-Meier plots one can estimate that approximately 10-15 cells are followed after induction of the Optogranule formation. How were these cells selected and how many were selected in the three different independent experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>For the experiments shown in Figures 3C and 3D, we used live imaging to monitor stress granule dynamics in real time. To accomplish this, we used a 445-nm imaging laser and 60x Plan Apo 1.40NA oil objective, which provides a limited field of view. Opto- G3BP1 expression levels were measured using Prairie View software and cells with equivalent levels of Opto-G3BP1 expression were activated by blue-light laser. All activated cells were included in the analysis. All details are included in the figure legends (Figure 3C: n = 26 for Opto-Control and n = 28 for Opto-G3BP1; Figure 3D: n = 7 for Opto-Control and n = 10 for Opto-G3BP1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 3C and D: Is there a statistical difference between the cell death induced by the induction of chronic persistent granules or after induction of chronic intermittent granules?</p></disp-quote><p>We found no statistically significant difference in the amount of cell death caused by the induction of chronic persistent granules compared to that caused by induction of chronic intermittent granules. These results are now shown in new Figure 3—figure supplement 1A. However, it should be noted that in the chronic persistent stress granule paradigm, the cells are exposed to much more blue light. Indeed, this is why we developed the chronic intermittent paradigm to minimize blue light exposure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 3: On the Y-axis of panel c and d, the numbers are missing. It is also not clear whether the blue boxes are based on a quantification or whether these boxes represent what is expected (should be specified in the legend).</p></disp-quote><p>As now clarified in the legend, the left panels are schematics that represent the design of the light induction paradigm (blue boxes) and an idealized graph of the consequent cellular response (red line). Quantitative data is presented in the right panels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 4: It is unclear whether persistent induction of Optogranules causes increased phosphorylation of TDP-43 or simply recruitment of a population which is already present in the cell. The authors should quantify the total levels of phospho-TDP-43 before and after chronic induction of Optogranule assembly to determine whether levels are increased.</p></disp-quote><p>Either of these mechanisms could account for the accumulation of phospho- TDP-43 in stress granules and our experiment does not permit us to make a distinction between them. Regrettably, although the amount of phospho-TDP-43 in cells can be detected on a cell-to- cell basis by immunofluorescence, this is not detectable by immunoblot.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– More details should be provided on the nature/quality of the neurons that are differentiated from the iPSCs. Are these cortical neurons? How pure are these neuronal cultures? Are these neurons electrically active?</p></disp-quote><p>For our study, we adapted the protocol published in Zhang et al., 2013, which produces cortical neurons, a cell type relevant to ALS/FTD. In the original Zhang et al. paper, the authors demonstrate that human iPSCs can be converted into electrically active functional neurons with nearly 100% yield and purity in 2 weeks using this protocol. To confirm that we successfully replicated the protocol of Zhang et al., we performed digital PCR to quantitatively analyze expression of the pan-neuronal marker <italic>MAP2</italic>, the pluripotent stem cell marker <italic>OCT4</italic>, the excitatory cortical neuron markers <italic>BRN2</italic> and <italic>FOXG1</italic>, and the synapsin marker <italic>SYN1</italic>.

Important for field, enjoyed reading, lots of interesting insights.</p><p>Some comments:</p><p>* It is hard to assess the degree of recruitment of different factors without any quantification (i.e. just from pictures). For example, it is not clear to be that there is bona fide p62 recruitment in neurons (Figure 4H). If this were a normal review I would insist this must be quantified to some degree (e.g. pixel mutual information using an intensity threshold as a binary mask, given intensities are hard to interpret).</p></disp-quote><p>Quantitative information was collected in the course of conducting the presented experiments. This quantitative data, with accompanying statistical analysis, has now been added to the figures. With reference to the reviewer’s specific comments, we call attention to new Figure 3I and Figure 4I, which show quantification of stress granule markers over time. For concerns relating to colocalization of p62/SQSTM1, we have now added line scans as new Figure 4—figure supplement 1E to illustrate colocalized signals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>* There are three distinct modes of illumination: continuous (Figure 3A), chronic persistent (Figure 3C) and chronic intermittent (Figure 3D). It is difficult to determine which is used in which experiment. I would strongly suggest standardizing this and ensuring each experiment is clearly labelled regarding which regime is used. Without this interpreting the data (for the reader) becomes difficult.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, there are three distinct induction paradigms used in this study, each with its advantages and disadvantages. For each light-based experiment, the corresponding induction paradigm is now clearly stated in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>* The OptoXXX language used is a little confusing. In the Shin et al. paper, OptoDroplets refers to the general system of a Cry2 domain fused to something:</p><p>&quot;Here, we introduce an optogenetic platform that uses light to activate IDR-mediated phase transitions in living cells. We use this 'optoDroplet' system to study condensed phases driven by the IDRs of various RNP body proteins&quot;</p><p>Here, OptoGranules refer to the physical cellular assemblies (to distinguish them from stress granules – which makes semantic sense) and OptoG3BP1 is an example of an OptoDroplet construct that contains G3BP1. The fact that the OptoDroplet work is not used to introduce the technology is odd. The results determined here are of significant biological relevance and interest, but the approach is fundamentally the OptoDroplet platform applied to a different protein. The fact that OptoDroplets are only introduced once the OptoGranule system has been described:</p><p>'These results contrast with observations made with light-induced aggregation of so-called &quot;OptoDroplets,&quot; which nicely…'</p><p>gives the impression that this is a different approach system, which is not the case (Figure 1A from this paper and 1A from Shin et al. are essentially interchangeable), and comes across as a little disingenuous. This was a general sentiment I heard from various places when the original preprint went up. It is surprising to me, because all of the exciting results pertain to the biology, not to the method, so it's unclear why the approach is introduced without basically saying &quot;Here we extended the OptoDroplet system to examine the role of G3BP1 in nucleating stress granules…&quot; or something to this effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this frank comment. We coined the term “OptoGranule” with the <italic>intention</italic> of telegraphing that this structure extends and builds upon the approaches and observations described in Shin et al. for the “OptoDroplet.” Scientific advancements nearly always build upon prior scientific achievements, and it is appropriate (and polite) to acknowledge these prior influences. Optical induction of protein aggregation in live cells is a strategy that has been extensively employed. From our perspective, this is not the exciting and fundamental advance presented in Shin et al. Rather, these authors extend and build upon this prior work as a means <italic>to control and monitor intracellular phase transitions</italic>. As such, the OptoDroplet system is a valuable tool to study the biophysical phenomenon of phase transition and to delineate the roles of specific domains (particularly intrinsically disordered regions, or IDRs) in the formation of condensed phases.</p><p>The OptoGranule system further extends and builds upon this work by adapting the OptoDroplet approach to exploit recent insights into (1) the mechanism of stress granule assembly and (2) the distinct roles of <italic>clients</italic> and <italic>scaffolds</italic> in initiating assembly and maintaining specific RNP granule identity. As described above, the development of OptoGranules was informed by our identification of G3BP as a <italic>uniquely essential central scaffold protein</italic> for stress granules, in contrast to TIA1, TDP-43, FUS, and many others, which are <italic>client</italic> proteins (Yang, Mathieu et al., in review). Please note, this manuscript has been made available for assessment by the editors and reviewers. In the present manuscript we show that enforced phase separation of <italic>client</italic> proteins (TIA1, TDP-43, and FUS) using CRY2 generates OptoDroplets, which are relatively homogenous intracellular condensates, thereby confirming the results of Shin et al., but we also demonstrate that these are not stress granules. This makes sense since <italic>client</italic> proteins often reside in multiple biomolecular condensates with distinct identities. In contrast, enforced phase separation of a <italic>scaffold</italic> protein initiates the cascade of events that seeds the assembly of a full- fledged, complex stress granule, which we term an OptoGranule. Thus, an important takeaway from this work is the critical role of specific scaffolding elements in establishing and maintaining the identity of specific biomolecular condensates.</p><p>We stress that the distinction between “droplets” and “granules” is more than semantic. In part this distinction derives from our observation that Opto-TDP-43, Opto-FUS, and Opto-TIA1 form structures that do not recruit stress granule constituents, whereas those formed by Opto-G3BP1 appear to reconstitute the complex composition of an RNP granule. The second distinction is more subtle: droplets formed by Opto-TDP-43, Opto-FUS, and Opto-TIA1 have their biophysical origin in CRY2 oligomerization that presumably forces the IDRs of these proteins to self-associate and initiate a phase transition. In contrast, activation of Opto-G3BP1 forms granules because CRY2-based multimerization (specifically via the replaced NTF2L domain) increases the valency of G3BP, permitting it to engage with another scaffolding element (i.e., a class of RNAs), and these interactions create a seed that subsequently undergoes a phase transition that mediates subsequent further assembly of a stress granule.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>* It would be useful to draw the schematic (Figure 1A) with the domains proportional to their number of amino acids</p><p>* Cry2+mCherry = ~840 amino acids (96 kDa), while NTF2 = 142 amino acids (16 kDa)</p><p>* This, of course, may be impractical, in which case simply including the regional size in number of amino acids would be sufficient</p></disp-quote><p>To the extent practical given the limitations of the figure, we have addressed this suggestion by adding amino acid numbering to the schematic in Figure 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>* Is the absence of SGs in response to the double G3BP1/2 knockout a true absence of stress granules, or an absence of assemblies with G3BP1/Tia1/PAB1 markers – have other markers been checked?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point that we have fully explored (Yang, Mathieu et al., in review). We performed a genome-wide screen that identified G3BP as a uniquely essential factor in stress granule assembly. In follow-up studies, we created 23 individual cell lines in which putatively essential factors for stress granule assembly (among them G3BP) were knocked out using CRISPR-Cas9. Surprisingly, among these 23 cell lines, we found that <italic>G3BP1/2</italic> double knockout cells were the <italic>only</italic> cell line that failed to form stress granules in response to arsenite. To confirm this result, we stained <italic>G3BP1/2</italic> dKO cells for 21 different stress granule markers (G3BP1, G3BP2, caprin 1, PRRC2C, TIA1, USP10, ATXN2, CSDE1, eIF3η, PABP, TAF15, TRIM25, YB1, YTHDF1, YTHDF2, YTHDF3, TIAR, TDP-43, eIF4G, ataxin 2, and DDX3X, as well as polyA RNA), none of which accumulated into granules after arsenite treatment. We have now added data for TIAR and TDP-43 in new Figure 1—figure supplement 3A, bottom right panel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>* &quot;…insinuate into stress granules and other membrane-less organelles&quot; – not sure insinuate has an appropriate meaning here?

But assuming you do see some level of clusters, why is an obligate dimer able to lead to any degree of cluster formation? I would have expected dimers to be far far below the resolution limit such that monomer/dimer Opto-Control should be equally diffuse</p></disp-quote><p>As described in the response to Reviewer 1 above, we used two different Opto-Control constructs in this paper; one (“Opto-Control”) is a fusion protein of mCherry and wild-type CRY2, and the other (“Opto-Control (olig)”) is a fusion protein of mCherry and a mutant form of CRY2 (CRY2-olig) that forms abundant CRY2 clusters upon activation.</p><p>Like many proteins containing mCherry, the Opto-Control fusion protein undergoes a modest amount of nonspecific aggregation that is related to its degree of expression. Importantly, these clusters are negative for stress granule markers, including &gt;10 proteins and polyA RNA (Figure 1H-J and data not shown). Furthermore, we affinity purified this protein and found by mass spectrometry that it does not associate with any stress granule proteins (data not shown).</p><p>To further challenge the negative results obtained with Opto-Control, we used Opto-Control (olig) to aggravate the aggregation of the fusion protein. The aggregates formed by Opto-Control (olig) were negative for stress granule markers (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1C) and poorly dynamic by FRAP (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1D-F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>* When the OptoControl is off it appears to partition into the nucleus (Figure 1H, 1I, 1J) but when activated it is strongly excluded. Both monomeric and dimeric version should be larger than the threshold size for free permeability into the nucleus sans an NLS, so it’s not clear how/why light should be changing the distribution – some explanation of this would be useful (i.e. does this imply there are additional un-characterized responses to blue-light stimulation?).</p></disp-quote><p>We don’t know, but this effect could be related to a report (Pathak et al., Nucleic Acids Res, 2017; PMID 28431041) that CRY2-mCherry shows minor protein redistribution from the nucleus to the cytoplasm following blue light stimulation. It is possible that light-induced CRY2 cluster formation may block or slow nuclear import of cytosolic and newly synthesized protein, leading to accumulation of protein in the cytosol.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>* Are the expression levels of OptoG3BP1 comparable to endogenous G3BP1?

In agreement with this, the CRY2 dimerization domain appears able to replace this N-terminal domain and give rise to droplets, HOWEVER, if the N-terminal domain is present (i.e. in CRY2PHR-mCherry-TDP-43(FL)) droplet formation is suppressed – any possible mechanism here would be useful to address – specifically, how does the ADDITION of a dimerization domain between CRY2 and the C-terminal portion of TPD43 suppress assembly?</p><p>* These questions are directly related to the comparison of other optoDroplet constructs</p></disp-quote><p>To be clear, we do not claim that CRY2<sub>PHR</sub>-mCherry-TDP-43(FL) does not form droplets; rather, we claim that this fusion protein does not form stress granules. Indeed, this is the very distinction between OptoDroplets (phase separation of a selected protein) versus OptoGranules (a cascade of events, including polysome disassembly, that leads to assembly of a stress granule). As the reviewer notes, we did observe that CRY2<sub>PHR</sub>-mCherry-TDP-43(FL) forms puncta in the nucleus, which corresponds to the normal localization of TDP-43 and is consistent with the presence of an NLS in the NTD (new Figure 1—figure supplement 4G).</p><p>Upon activation, these puncta are indeed less prominent for unclear reasons. We speculate that the presence of two dimerization domains (CRY2 and NTD) leads to tighter intermolecular interaction between any two TDP-43 molecules and this tight interaction makes TDP-43 unfavorable for weak multivalent interactions that are favorable for LLPS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>* Not sure how to interpret the Opto-G3BP1 vs G3BP1-GFP RNA binding data? Naively from the description of the RNA binding assay I would have expected 1) cross-linking to cause G3BP1 in stress granules to extensively cross-link with local RNAs, while under non-stress/non OptoGranule inducing conditions there would be minimal RNA cross-linking and 2) for Opto-G3BP1 and G3BP1-GFP to be similar. Instead, the data appear to show that you get extensive and essentially identical RNA binding under stressed and non-stressed conditions, and that Opto-G3BP1 and G3BP1-GFP have different RNA binding profiles. Similarly, not sure how to interpret the western blot associated with 2b – it would be useful to explicitly annotate what the bands are. This is almost certainly just a limitation of my understanding of the experimental setup, but it seems at least plausible others might also be confused…</p></disp-quote><p>The purpose of this experiment was to show that Opto-G3BP1 binds RNA to a similar extent as WT G3BP1. Indeed, the total amount of RNA bound by G3BP before and after stress is unchanged when assessed by CLIP (cross-linking immunoprecipitation). What is not revealed by this experiment, however, is that the types of RNA species bound by G3BP1 are shifted by stress, and this shift appears to be important in initiating stress granule assembly.</p><p>These results are elaborated in Yang, Mathieu et al.

In U2OS see reasonable recruitment just 1 hour in, with robust recruitment after 2 hours.
