epigenetic gene regulation. In the brain, Dnmt3a is the sole ‘writer’ of atypical non-CpG methylation (mCH), and MeCP2 is the only known ‘reader’ for mCH. We asked if MeCP2 is the sole reader for Dnmt3a dependent methylation by comparing mice lacking either protein in GABAergic inhibitory neurons. Loss of either protein causes overlapping and distinct features from the behavioral to molecular level. Loss of Dnmt3a causes global loss of mCH and a subset of mCG sites resulting in more widespread transcriptional alterations and severe neurological dysfunction than MeCP2 loss. These data suggest that MeCP2 is responsible for reading only part of the Dnmt3a dependent methylation in the brain. Importantly, the impact of MeCP2 on genes differentially expressed in both models shows a strong dependence on mCH, but not Dnmt3a dependent mCG, consistent with mCH playing a central role in the pathogenesis of Rett Syndrome.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>non-CpG methylation</kwd><kwd>Dnmt3a</kwd><kwd>MeCP2</kwd><kwd>inhibitory neuron</kwd><kwd>Rett syndrome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01NS057819-13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zoghbi</surname><given-names>Huda Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH112763</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ecker</surname><given-names>Joseph R</given-names></name><name><surname>Behrens</surname><given-names>M Margarita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009559</institution-id><institution>Life Sciences Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lavery</surname><given-names>Laura A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54HD083092</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zoghbi</surname><given-names>Huda Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CCSG: P30 014195</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ecker</surname><given-names>Joseph R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zoghbi</surname><given-names>Huda Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Ecker</surname><given-names>Joseph R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellow of the Life Sciences Research Foundation</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lavery</surname><given-names>Laura A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dnmt3a regulates gene expression in inhibitory neurons by writing all mCH and some mCG, and MeCP2 reads some of these mCH sites driving a portion of these gene expression changes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA methylation is a covalent epigenetic mark deposited mainly on the C5-position of cytosine nucleotides in mammals. Although DNA methylation in mammals was described by Rollin Hotchkiss in 1948 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hotchkiss, 1948</xref>), it took nearly thirty years to realize its function in the regulation of gene expression to shape fundamental biological processes including cell differentiation, genomic imprinting and genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Compere and Palmiter, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li and Zhang, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Today many features of the classic model for gene regulation by DNA methylation have proven more complex. Rather than static and solely repressive to gene expression, DNA methylation is functionally dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shen et al., 2014</xref>), and in some cases has been shown to activate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aran et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ball et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hellman and Chess, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keown et al., 2017</xref>) highlighting that context and protein factors that recognize methylated cytosine can alter the transcriptional outcome of this epigenetic mark.</p><p>It was also traditionally thought that DNA methylation in mammalian genomes could be found only at cytosines followed by guanine nucleotides (CpG methylation, or mCG), but it has become clear that cytosines in other contexts can also be methylated. This non-CpG methylation (also known as mCH, where H equals A, C or T) is not found in most mammalian cells but has been detected in pluripotent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lister et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ramsahoye et al., 2000</xref>), some human tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schultz et al., 2015</xref>), and is enriched in postnatal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He and Ecker, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lister et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Price et al., 2019</xref>). The mCH mark increases in neurons predominantly after birth and is concurrent with the period of peak synaptogenesis throughout the first 25 years of life in humans (or the first 4 weeks in mice). The resulting mCH pattern is largely conserved between mice and humans, where it makes up a high percentage of all DNA methylation in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He and Ecker, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lister et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2017</xref>). Although the timing and specification of mCH suggest it serves a critical function in maturing neurons, the molecular mechanism and functional consequences for loss of the mCH mark remain understudied.</p><p>In mammals, DNA methylation is catalyzed by de novo DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, and maintained by Dnmt1 in the CpG context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jurkowska and Jeltsch, 2016</xref>). Recent studies have shown that Dnmt3a is the sole ‘writer’ of mCH in postnatal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lister et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gabel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stroud et al., 2017</xref>), where it is preferentially found in the CAC nucleotide context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He and Ecker, 2015</xref>). Mutations in <italic>DNMT3A</italic> have recently been associated with disorders of neurodevelopment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tatton-Brown et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sanders et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heyn et al., 2019</xref>) suggesting that the mechanism by which Dnmt3a dependent methylation is written and read by other protein factors to regulate gene expression is critical for brain maturation. Loss of function of the only known ‘reader’ of mCH in the mammalian brain, Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gabel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2015</xref>), has long been associated with Rett syndrome (RTT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amir et al., 1999</xref>). RTT is an X-linked, postnatal neurological disorder; affected children are apparently healthy for the first 6–18 months of life, then lose their acquired milestones and develop a range of dysfunctions of the central and autonomic nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leonard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zoghbi, 2016</xref>). Mouse models of <italic>MECP2</italic> mutations in female mice faithfully recapitulate patient symptoms, the severity of which, in humans and mice, is determined by the specific mutation and the pattern of X-inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leonard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Young and Zoghbi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lombardi et al., 2015</xref>). Numerous conditional knockout mice have revealed the importance of MeCP2 function in different cell populations in the brain as well as the etiology of RTT symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gemelli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fyffe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Samaco et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ito-Ishida et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Meng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goffin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ward et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Su et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>). Given the apparent need of every neural cell type for MeCP2, it is not surprising that <italic>MECP2</italic> mutations have been linked to other neuropsychiatric conditions beyond RTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zoghbi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lombardi et al., 2015</xref>). Yet re-expression of MeCP2 in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ross et al., 2016</xref>) rescues even the severe neurological symptoms and the prematurely lethal phenotype of constitutive null male mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guy et al., 2001</xref>). RTT is thus driven by the loss of MeCP2 function in the nervous system, which continues to be essential into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McGraw et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheval et al., 2012</xref>), but the underlying architecture is sufficiently intact to support functional rescue.</p><p>Despite decades of research, the precise mechanism by which MeCP2 drives RTT phenotypes remains enigmatic. The recent finding that MeCP2 binds to mCH at genes that are misregulated in <italic>Mecp2</italic> knockout brains, and that mCH deposition occurs predominantly after birth in conjunction with neuronal maturation, has led to the hypothesis that failure of mutant MeCP2 to bind to mCH could account for the postnatal onset of RTT symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Whether loss of MeCP2 binding to mCH is sufficient to cause RTT has not been explored.</p><p>Here we set out to test the hypothesis that MeCP2 is the only reader that interprets the unique methylation pattern set by Dnmt3a to direct gene expression in the maturing brain. If MeCP2 is the sole reader of these methylation marks, then loss of function of the writer should produce the same phenotype as loss of the reader at the behavioral and physiological level, as well as the same changes in gene expression at the molecular level. Such comparisons must be done in a cell-specific manner, since both mCH methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mo et al., 2015</xref>) and the effects of MeCP2 loss are highly cell-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gemelli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fyffe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Samaco et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ito-Ishida et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Meng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goffin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ward et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Su et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>).

Intriguingly, our findings indicate that while mCH has significant contribution to RTT, MeCP2 is responsible for enacting only a subset of Dnmt3a dependent gene regulation.

These data were then fit with a univariate linear model to determine the percentage variance in log2 fold change explained by either mCH or mCG (R<sup>2</sup>, see Materials and methods). For genes significantly misregulated only in the <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> cKO model we found a correlation with both Dnmt3a dependent mCH and mCG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), consistent with these marks being part of the same epigenetic program. These trends were statistically robust as when the same analysis was done 1000 times using random sets of non-DEG genes, the R<sup>2</sup> values for our selected set of DEGs were significantly higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, see Materials and methods).

Importantly we find that mCH, but not Dnmt3a dependent mCG, does in fact play a central role in mediating RTT pathogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The discovery of mCH in postnatal neurons has shifted the view of how epigenetic gene regulation occurs in the brain. Beyond the obvious difference of unique context and cell-type restriction, the postnatal dynamics of this epigenetic program immediately suggest an important role for mCH in directing gene expression to ensure fully mature and functional neurons. Here we find that conditional knockout of the mCH writer, <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>, in GABAergic inhibitory neurons leads to genome-wide loss of mCH and a small subset of mCG sites, causing hundreds of gene expression changes to impair neurophysiology and behavior with some deficits mirrored in a matched deletion of <italic>Mecp2</italic>. We were surprised to find only a modest overlap of Dnmt3a/methylation dependent DEGs with MeCP2 dependent DEGs in our RNA-seq analysis. From this and our integrated gene expression and methylation analyses we distill two major conclusions. First, binding of MeCP2 to postnatal mCH contributes significantly to postnatal RTT symptoms, but there still appear to be other genomic targets recognized by MeCP2 or other functions whose loss contributes to the disease. Second, though MeCP2 ‘reads’ a subset of Dnmt3a dependent methylation sites to significantly impact gene expression, there appears to be a much broader gene regulatory program set up by the placement of global mCH and some mCG via Dnmt3a. These findings highlight the need to compare gene function at multiple biological scales, the molecular level in particular, when drawing conclusions about the functional relationship between proteins.</p><p>Uncovering the relationship between Dnmt3a and MeCP2 in the nervous system is challenging for a several reasons. First, while the phenotypes observed in whole-body knockout of <italic>Mecp2</italic> are recapitulated in the brain-specific knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guy et al., 2001</xref>), the phenotypes of whole-body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Okano et al., 1999</xref>) and brain-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nguyen et al., 2007</xref>) knockout of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> diverge, highlighting the essential role of Dnmt3a in peripheral tissues. In addition, while prior studies showed that early deletion of Dnmt3a in the brain drives neurological symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nguyen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kohno et al., 2014</xref>), deletion of Dnmt3a using Cre-drivers that turn on postnatally have been demonstrated to produce minor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morris et al., 2014</xref>) to no neurological symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feng et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that the underlying methylation pattern remains largely unaffected if Dnmt3a is deleted later in development, precluding the evolution of deficits. This is in contrast to MeCP2, where phenotypes are observed regardless of when the gene is deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McGraw et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheval et al., 2012</xref>). Our study deliberately eliminated these variations and shows that Dnmt3a and MeCP2 have overlapping but distinct roles to produce functionally normal neurons and behaviors. These data highlight the importance of extensive direct comparison between knockout models in a selected cell type, on the same genetic background, and to consider the developmental contribution for each gene being compared.</p><p>While DNA methylation remains stable in the absence of MeCP2, we find that loss of Dnmt3a in inhibitory neurons before birth leads to global loss of mCH, with a minor drop in mCG (~10%), consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lister et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stroud et al., 2017</xref>). The loss of mCG is likely due to de-methylation in the embryonic brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lister et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2017</xref>) that cannot be re-methylated in the absence of Dnmt3a. Of note, while we interpret here the major driver of the phenotype observed in our <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> cKO mice is loss of the methylation Dnmt3a catalyzes during development, future experiments are necessary to determine if non-enzymatic functions of Dnmt3a may also contribute.</p><p>At the RNA level, we show that loss of either Dnmt3a or MeCP2 leads to misregulation of hundreds of genes that normally have higher methylation (mCH in particular) relative to genes that are unchanged. We find expression of these genes changes in both the up and down direction in a manner that is independent of gene length. Importantly, the vast majority of the genes misregulated in both cKO models change to a similar degree and in the same direction, consistent with equal dependence of these genes on Dnmt3a and MeCP2 for proper regulation. While our data cannot rule out the possibility that some of the DEGs we identify in our cKO mouse models are secondary, the percentage of overlapping DEGs between cKO models is robust to p-value cutoff, direction of change or gene length. Integrating our genomic datasets, we find a significant contribution of mCH and mCG to the fold change in gene expression in <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> cKO mice consistent with these marks functioning together to regulate gene expression during neuronal maturation. Intriguingly, we see a significant contribution of mCH, but not mCG to the misregulation of a subset of genes in the <italic>MeCP2</italic> cKO. This together with overlapping behavioral and physiological data suggests that binding of MeCP2 to mCH is critical for the postnatal evolution of RTT symptoms.</p><p>Our molecular data suggest that MeCP2 is likely one of a number of functional factors interpreting Dnmt3a dependent methylation. Though the overlap in gene expression changes between models has not been quantified until here, re-analysis of single-nuclear RNA-seq datasets from cortical inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stroud et al., 2017</xref>) are consistent with our conclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, our data show a stronger dependence of <italic>Mecp2</italic> cKO DEGs on Dnmt3a function. With these data in hand we propose that the current model for Dnmt3a dependent gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stroud et al., 2017</xref>) be updated to incorporate our insights that MeCP2 is a restricted reader for Dnmt3a dependent gene regulation, as well as that postnatal mCG plays a role in the epigenetic program driven by Dnmt3a during neuron maturation.</p><p>There is a defined set of proteins in the mammalian genome that possess a methyl binding domain (MBD) and have been shown to bind mCH in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). These data highlight these proteins as primary candidates, though further studies are necessary to determine whether the other MBD-containing proteins read mCH in the brain, in vivo. However, there are other proteins involved in transcriptional regulation that do not possess a classic MBD and are sensitive to the methylation status of DNA, with some validated in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Luo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kribelbauer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lomvardas and Maniatis, 2016</xref>). For example, the DNA binding of many transcription factors is both positively and negatively affected by DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kribelbauer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yin et al., 2017</xref>), a phenomena that is not exclusive to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">O'Malley et al., 2016</xref>). Further, the DNA methylation and histone modification machinery are intimately linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lomvardas and Maniatis, 2016</xref>). This link has been specifically shown in the differentiation of neural precursor cells, where methylation written by Dnmt3a antagonizes polycomb complexes to modulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). Given these findings, it is possible that similar mechanisms involving non-canonical methylation readers could be at play in Dnmt3a dependent gene regulation. Therefore, it will be important to undertake unbiased approaches to elucidate the full set of protein factors that drive gene regulation in this novel epigenetic pathway. All in all, our discovery that MeCP2 reads only some Dnmt3a dependent methylation marks lays the groundwork to uncover novel factors responsible for postnatal gene regulation that may be critical in setting up a mature, healthy mammalian brain.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>Information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal anti-Dnmt3a</td><td>Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td>Cat. #: 20703;

On the training day, mice were placed in the chamber and subjected to two rounds of training, each of which consisted of 180 s of silence followed by a 30 second-long 80–85 dB tone and 2 s of a 0.72 mA shock. 24 hr after training, the mice were returned to the box where they received the shock and freezing behavior recorded for six minutes (Context). One hour later, the grated floor of the test chamber was covered, the shape changed with plastic panels, and vanilla scent added to the chamber. Mice were returned to the apparatus and subjected to a cue test consisting of 180 s of silence followed by 180 s of the original 80–85 dB tone. Freezing behavior for all tests was scored using Freeze Frame three software (Actimetrics) with a threshold of 5.0. Data is shown as mean ± standard error of mean.

Cue tests were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Hot plate and tail flick</title><p>Mice were habituated for 30 min in the test room prior to testing. Each mouse was placed individually on a 55°C hot plate (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL) and observed for jumping, vocalization, hind paw lifting, or licking of the hind paws. At the first incidence of any of these behaviors the mouse was removed from the hot plate and the elapsed time noted. 30 min after the hot plate test, the mouse was placed on the tail flick apparatus (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL) and restrained with a paper towel laid over the mouse and held down gently by the experimenter’s hand. The tail was laid in the groove above the lamp but was not restrained. The lamp was then turned on at 5-6eWatts; this also started the timer, which stopped automatically when the mouse moved its tail away from the lamp. The mouse was then returned to its home cage.

Each mouse was placed singly in SR-LAB PPI apparatus (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA), which consisted of a Plexiglass cylindrical tube in a sound-insulated lighted box. Once restrained in the tube, the test mouse was allowed to habituate for 5 min with 70 dB white noise playing. The mouse was presented with eight types of stimulus, each presented six times in pseudo-random order with a 10–20 ms inter-trial period: no sound, a 40 ms 120 db startle burst, three 20 ms prepulse sounds of 74, 78, and 82 dB each presented alone, and a combination of each of the three prepulse intensities presented 100 ms before the 120 dB startle burst. After the test, mice were returned to their home cage. The acoustic startle response was recorded every 1 ms during the 65 ms period following the onset of the startle stimulus and was calculated as the average response to the 120 db startle burst normalized to body weight. Percent prepulse inhibition was calculated using the following formula: (1-(averaged startle response to prepulse before startle stimulus/averaged response to startle stimulus)) x 100. Data are shown as mean ± standard error of mean. Percent prepulse inhibition was analyzed by two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc analysis, and acoustic startle response was analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Rotarod</title><p>Mice were placed on the rotating cylinder of an accelerating rotarod apparatus (Ugo Basile, Varese, Italy) and allowed to move freely as the rotation increased from 5 rpm to 40 rpm over a five-minute period.

The cage was divided across its width by a divider with holes small enough to allow scent but no physical interaction. The test mouse was provided with a KimWipe folded in fourths as nesting material. At 24 hr and 48 hr of single-housing, the KimWipe was assessed for nesting score, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chao et al., 2010</xref>). At least 16 hr before the partition test, a novel age- and gender-matched partner mouse of a different strain was placed on the opposite side of the partition. On the day of the test, the cage was placed on a well-lit flat surface. All nesting material, food pellets, and water bottles were removed from both sides of the cage, and the test mice were observed for 5 min while interaction time with the now-familiar partner mouse was recorded. Interactions involved the test mouse smelling, chewing, or actively exploring the partition. At the end of the first test (Familiar 1), a novel mouse of the same age, gender, and strain replaced the familiar partner mouse, and test mouse interactions were recorded for five minutes (Novel). The novel mouse was then removed and the familiar partner mouse returned to the cage, followed by observation for another 5 min (Familiar 2). At the completion of the partition test, test mice were returned to their original home cage. Data is shown as mean ± standard error of mean. Interaction times were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc analysis, and nesting scores were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>X-gal staining of whole E14.5 embryos</title><p>X-gal staining was done as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hurd et al.

After centrifugation, the top layer of gradient and mitochondrial layer was discarded carefully with vacuum until ~3 mL remained. Remaining solution was gently poured off and tubes dabbed with a KimWipe being careful to not disturb the nuclear pellet. Nuclei were rehydrated on ice for 45 min in 500 uL of rehydration buffer that was added drop-wise (0.5% BSA, 1X protease inhibitors, ribonuclease inhibitor 30 U/ml in 1X DPBS).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Zhaolan Zhou (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p><italic>Dnmt3a</italic> is the sole known writer of mCH in the brain and MeCP2 is the only known reader. Because the timing of mCH accumulation in neurons matches the onset of symptoms in RTT, the relationship between these two chromatin regulators has formed the basis of a current hypothesis of the pathophysiology of RTT. Here the authors set out to test this relationship by knocking out each gene separately with careful controls for genetic background and then comparing the molecular and neurological phenotypes, focusing in on VIATT-positive GABAergic neurons of the CNS. They find more widespread effects on both gene regulation and physiological function with <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> loss compared with MeCP2 loss and conclude that therefore there must be other readers of mCH. For the cases in which the molecular phenotypes do overlap, profiling of mCH and mCG suggests the RTT-relevant commonalities are related to mCH more than mCG, so they suggest this is an argument supporting mCH as important for the phenotypes of RTT that arise in the absence of MeCP2.</p><p>Many of the findings are confirmatory of current models for MeCP2 function at mCH residues, but the data also make it clear that there are very likely other neurologically-important mCH reader proteins that are not yet known. These data lay the groundwork for future discoveries and thus will have high impact in the field of neuroscience.</p><p>The reviewers have only a few clarifications that they think will substantially strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript needs to discuss a few additional possible explanations for the differences between the <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> and MeCP2 phenotypes. First with respect to the neurological phenotypes, is <italic>Slc32a1-Cre</italic> expressed outside the nervous system? This could, for example, contribute to the differences in size between the <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> and MeCP2 cKO mice. Second, this manuscript does not appear to consider the possibility that aberrant phenotypes in <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> cKO mice could arise from non-enzymatic functions of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>. Is there evidence for the phenotype of a <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> enzymatic mutant? Performing these experiments is beyond the scope of the current study, but if there is evidence for or against this possibility from the literature it should be discussed here.</p><p>2) There are presumably at least three classes of <italic>Slc32a1</italic>+ cells in the striatum, specifically the D1+ MSNs, the D2+ MSNs, and a few classes of GABAergic interneurons. The Ecker lab has already shown that interneuron methylation patterns are hidden in bulk lysates from cortex and one would expect the same here since MSNs are so much more numerous than interneurons in striatum. However in the RNAseq data some interneuron-specific genes are likely detected. This disconnect would impact the RNA/DNA methylation comparisons in Figure 4. The authors should discuss and/or bioinformatically address this point.</p><p>3) In the third paragraph of the Discussion, the authors describe that DEGs in both up and down directions are independent of gene length. Have the authors examined their relationship to gene body methylation (mCH and/or mCG)? Similarly, do common and specific targets display particular chromatin or genomic features (other than DNA methylation) that may explain why they are regulated differently. Are all methylation changes associated with changes in gene expression? For non-overlapping DEGs, they could be specific to DNMT3a or MeCP2, but could also be differential in-direct effect of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> and <italic>Mecp2</italic> loss. This possibility should be mentioned in the Discussion. We feel that addition of any further analysis of the gene expression versus methylation data would be a great benefit to readers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52981.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript needs to discuss a few additional possible explanations for the differences between the Dnmt3a and MeCP2 phenotypes.

Our analysis was able to detect 38 DEGs that could represent gene expression changes in contaminating interneurons. We removed the interneuron candidate DEGs from our analysis in Figure 4 and find that the trends and significance hold as in Figure 4 (see Figure 4—figure supplement 2). These results have been incorporated into our manuscript (subsection “Integrative gene expression and methylation analysis shows mCH and mCG loss contribute to <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> cKO DEGs, and reveals a strong mCH contribution to RTT”).</p><p>It is important to note, however, that the efficacy of our deconvolution was determined to be better than random (hypergeometric test – see Materials and methods, subsection “RNA-seq deconvolution analysis”) for medium spiny neurons and close to random for striatal interneurons. This is not surprising given that interneurons only represent at most 5% of the neuron population in the striatum. Given our statistical success with medium spiny neurons (the major population of neurons in the striatum at 95%), we interpret this to mean that our RNA-seq is fairly clean and representative of medium spiny neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the third paragraph of the Discussion, the authors describe that DEGs in both up and down directions are independent of gene length. Have the authors examined their relationship to gene body methylation (mCH and/or mCG)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have looked at DEGs in both the up and down direction and their relationship to gene body methylation. We find that DEGs that go up have higher mCH levels than those that go down. We also see that mCG levels are different between up-and down-regulated genes, though the relationship between direction of gene expression change and higher mCG levels was not constant between DEG categories. The statistics have been added to Figure 4 and we highlight this finding in the subsection “Integrative gene expression and methylation analysis shows mCH and mCG loss contribute to <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> cKO DEGs, and reveals a strong mCH contribution to RTT” and Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-B. The remaining pairwise comparisons for Figure 4A-B can be found in Figure 4—figure supplement 1E-F for the reader. We felt adding all of the comparisons to the plots in Figure 4A-B would make the panels unreadable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, do common and specific targets display particular chromatin or genomic features (other than DNA methylation) that may explain why they are regulated differently.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting question. Unfortunately, datasets for chromatin features on our specific, isolated neuron population are largely lacking and we do not feel it would be proper to make conclusions from epigenetic marks in whole tissue or other cell populations. Therefore, any possible relationship between chromatin landscape (outside of methylation) and gene expression changes that occur with loss of either or both <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>/MeCP2 needs to be experimentally explored in future studies.</p><p>Of note, we have done Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), transcription factor motif analysis (multiple tools), and Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) analysis on common or specific DEGs and have not observed any significant pattern that would explain their categorization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are all methylation changes associated with changes in gene expression?</p></disp-quote><p>From our analysis we do see changes in methylation that are not obviously correlated with changes in gene expression. Specifically, in Figure 4—figure supplement 1C-D we find that the non-DEGs show a decrease in methylation in the <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> cKO compared to wild-type or the <italic>Mecp2</italic> cKO. However, the level of methylation on non-DEGs in wild-type is significantly lower than methylation seen in wild-type animals for DEG genes altered in either model (Figure 4A-B). Therefore, we propose that it is this significantly larger change in methylation level that occurs when <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> is lost that drives gene expression changes we detect. A sentence highlighting this has been added to the subsection “Integrative gene expression and methylation analysis shows mCH and mCG loss contribute to <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> cKO DEGs, and reveals a strong mCH contribution to RTT”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For non-overlapping DEGs, they could be specific to DNMT3a or MeCP2, but could also be differential in-direct effect of Dnmt3a and Mecp2 loss.
