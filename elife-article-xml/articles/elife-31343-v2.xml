pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31343.001</object-id><p>Activating mutations in fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor 3 and inactivating mutations in the NPR2 guanylyl cyclase both cause severe short stature, but how these two signaling systems interact to regulate bone growth is poorly understood. Here, we show that bone elongation is increased when NPR2 cannot be dephosphorylated and thus produces more cyclic GMP. By developing an in vivo imaging system to measure cyclic GMP production in intact tibia, we show that FGF-induced dephosphorylation of NPR2 decreases its guanylyl cyclase activity in growth plate chondrocytes in living bone. The dephosphorylation requires a PPP-family phosphatase. Thus FGF signaling lowers cyclic GMP production in the growth plate, which counteracts bone elongation. These results define a new component of the signaling network by which activating mutations in the FGF receptor inhibit bone growth.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31343.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Between birth and puberty, the bones of mammals grow drastically in length. This process is controlled by many proteins, and mutations affecting these proteins can cause bones to either be too long or too short. For example, mutations of a protein called the fibroblast growth factor receptor, or FGF for short, and a protein called NPR2, can cause similar forms of dwarfism – a condition characterized by short stature.</p><p>The FGF protein controls bone growth, and people with overactive receptors for FGF suffer from a form of dwarfism known as achondroplasia, while people that lack FGF receptors have longer bones. The NPR2 protein, on the other hand, produces a molecule called cGMP, which is necessary for the bones to grow. When NPR2 is blocked, less cGMP is produced, which results in shorter limbs.</p><p>Previous studies of bone cells grown in the laboratory have shown that these two proteins are linked by a chain of chemical messages. When the FGF receptor is active, phosphate molecules are removed from the NPR2 protein, which reduces the amount of GMP produced. However, until now it was not known whether this mechanism also controls growth in actual bones.</p><p>Here, Shuhaibar et al. used genetically modified mice in which the phosphate group could not be removed from their NPR2 enzyme. As a result, the bones of these mice were longer than usual. Shuhaibar et al. then developed an imaging technique to examine the region in the bone were growth happens. To see whether FGF reduces the amount of cGMP produced by NPR2 in these areas, cGMP was detected with a fluorescent sensor in order to be tracked.</p><p>In normal mice, the FGF receptor reduced the rate at which cGMP was produced, but in mice with mutated NPR2, this did not happen. When the cells could not remove the phosphates from NPR2, cGMP levels stayed high and the bones grew longer.</p><p>These findings reveal new insights into the molecular causes of dwarfism. The next step will be to identify the enzyme responsible for removing phosphate from NPR2. Blocking its activity could help to enhance bone growth. In the future, this could lead to new drug treatments for achondroplasia.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>growth plate</kwd><kwd>chondrocyte</kwd><kwd>NPR2 guanylyl cyclase</kwd><kwd>dephosphorylation</kwd><kwd>cyclic GMP</kwd><kwd>fibroblast growth factor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37HD014939</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaffe</surname><given-names>Laurinda A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM098309</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Potter</surname><given-names>Lincoln R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral training grant: T32DK007203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robinson</surname><given-names>Jerid W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral training grant: R90DE022526</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shuhaibar</surname><given-names>Ninna P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fund for Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral scholarship (mentor)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaffe</surname><given-names>Laurinda A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fund for Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral scholarship (postdoc)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shuhaibar</surname><given-names>Leia C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fund for Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dealy</surname><given-names>Caroline N</given-names></name><name><surname>Potter</surname><given-names>Lincoln R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fibroblast growth factor induces dephosphorylation and inactivation of the NPR2 guanylyl cyclase, thus decreasing cyclic GMP production in growth plate chondrocytes and contributing to FGF-dependent decreases in bone growth.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Longitudinal growth of limbs and vertebrae depends on division and differentiation of chondrocytes within the cartilage growth plates located at each end of the growing bone (see Figure 2B), resulting in formation of a scaffold that is subsequently mineralized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kozhemyakina et al., 2015</xref>). These processes are tightly controlled by multiple regulatory pathways. One such regulator is the natriuretic peptide-stimulated guanylyl cyclase, natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (NPR2), also known as guanylyl cyclase B, which is found in growth plate chondrocytes and promotes bone elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yasoda et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yamashita et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chusho et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tamura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartels et al., 2004</xref>). Inactivating mutations in NPR2, which reduce cGMP, result in severe shortening of bones in mice and people, causing the condition acromesomelic dysplasia type Maroteaux (AMDM), in which height is reduced by ~30% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maroteaux et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tamura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartels et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Geister et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakao et al., 2015</xref>). Conversely, activating mutations of NPR2 result in longer bones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hannema et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miura et al., 2014</xref>), opposite to what is seen with the AMDM patients.</p><p>Activation of the NPR2 guanylyl cyclase requires the extracellular binding of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) and also the phosphorylation of multiple intracellular juxtamembrane serines and threonines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Potter, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Potter, 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Previous studies have established a close correlation between NPR2 phosphorylation and NPR2 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbey-Hosch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Egbert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Robinson et al., 2017</xref>), and if these phosphorylation sites are mutated to alanine, CNP-dependent guanylyl cyclase activity is reduced to only 6% of that of the wild type protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Potter and Hunter, 1998</xref>). Correspondingly, if the seven serines and threonines are mutated to the phosphomimetic amino acid glutamate (NPR2-7E), the maximal velocity of the CNP-dependent guanylyl cyclase activity is the same as that of the wild type enzyme, but does not decrease in response to stimuli that dephosphorylate and inactivate the wild type protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yoder et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shuhaibar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Robinson et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

NPR2 activity has been previously measured using homogenates of fetal tibia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yasoda et al., 1998</xref>) and membrane preparations from chondrocyte cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ozasa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Robinson et al., 2017</xref>). The availability of mice expressing a sensor for cGMP, combined with the development of a new method to visualize chondrocytes in live and intact growth plates by confocal microscopy, allowed us to measure NPR2 activity under physiological conditions and with high spatial and temporal resolution. cGi500 is comprised of cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), linked by a cGMP-binding domain; the sensitivity of cGi500 to cGMP is based on Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Binding of cGMP to the linker domain causes the CFP and YFP domains to move farther apart. The proximity of CFP and YFP can be detected by imaging cells using a 440 nm laser to excite CFP; the energy emitted by CFP then excites YFP in proportion to the distance between the two fluorophores. Thus measurement of the relative intensities of the light emitted by CFP and YFP provides an indicator of the cGMP concentration. The CFP/YFP emission ratio is higher when the cGMP concentration is higher, with a half-maximal response at 500 nM cGMP, and a dynamic range of ~100 nM to ~3 μM cGMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Russwurm et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Tibias were removed from newborn mice expressing cGi500, and placed in culture on a Millicell membrane.

A tibia was then placed in a perfusion slide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>) on the stage of a confocal microscope. Excitation of CFP resulted in fluorescence in all regions of the growth plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), allowing identification of chondrocytes at different stages of development, based on the shape of the cells: round (also called resting), columnar (also called proliferating), and hypertrophic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kozhemyakina et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ornitz and Legeai-Mallet, 2017</xref>).

In our isolated tissue preparation, in which the tibia is sliced to expose the growth plate, CNP can diffuse between the extracellular space into the large volume of culture medium.

Firstly, our results indicate that phosphorylation of the NPR2 guanylyl cyclase promotes bone elongation; this conclusion is based on our finding that a mutation that prevents NPR2 dephosphorylation results in longer bones. Secondly, our results indicate that part of the mechanism by which FGF signaling inhibits bone elongation is by decreasing NPR2 phosphorylation and activity. The dephosphorylation and inactivation of NPR2 is mediated by a PPP-family phosphatase. However, mice lacking the FGFR3 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colvin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deng et al., 1996</xref>) show a greater increase in bone length (~7–40%) than we report here for mice with the mutation that prevents dephosphorylation of NPR2 (8–14%), consistent with previous studies identifying multiple mechanisms by which FGF signaling opposes bone elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ornitz and Legeai-Mallet, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The working model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> shows our findings in the context of other knowledge about the cross-talk between FGFR3 and NPR2 signaling. An important pathway by which FGFR3 signaling decreases bone elongation is by activation of MAP kinase (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ornitz and Legeai-Mallet, 2017</xref>). An important pathway by which NPR2 guanylyl cyclase activity increases bone elongation is by elevating cGMP and activating the cGMP-dependent protein kinase PRKG2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pfeifer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chikuda et al., 2004</xref>). Previous studies have established that application of CNP to increase NPR2 guanylyl cyclase activity in chondrocytes, thus elevating cGMP and stimulating cGMP-dependent protein kinase, inhibits FGF-induced MAP kinase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yasoda et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krejci et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ozasa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kamemura et al., 2017</xref>), which would counteract FGF-inhibition of bone growth (solid blue line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Other mechanisms (for example, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawasaki et al., 2008</xref>) may also contribute to how PRKG2 activity increases bone growth (dotted blue line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31343.016</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A working model of the crosstalk between NPR2 and FGFR3 signaling pathways in regulating bone elongation, emphasizing the dephosphorylation and inactivation of NPR2 in response to FGFR3 signaling (orange box).</title><p>This diagram shows only some aspects of FGFR3 signaling in the growth plate; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Karuppaiah et al.

Our findings indicate that FGF activation of its receptor FGFR3 acts by way of a PPP family phosphatase to decrease the phosphorylation and activity of the NPR2 guanylyl cyclase, thus reducing production of cGMP. Cyclic GMP increases bone growth by activating the cGMP-dependent protein kinase PRKG2. FGFR3 also acts by way of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) to oppose bone elongation. One consequence of PRKG2 kinase activation is to inhibit MAPK (solid blue line), with the net effect of increasing bone elongation. PRKG2 may act by other pathways as well, as depicted by the dotted blue line.

By causing dephosphorylation of NPR2, FGF signaling reduces cGMP production, thus opposing bone elongation. How FGF signaling causes dephosphorylation of NPR2 remains to be determined; this could occur by inactivation of the kinase(s) that phosphorylate NPR2, and/or by activation of the phosphatase(s) that dephosphorylate it. Our results indicate that the phosphatase(s) belong to the PPP family, but do not identify the particular PPP family member(s). Activation of PPP2 is one possibility, since PPP2 is activated by FGF signaling in the RCS chondrocyte cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kolupaeva et al., 2013</xref>), and purified PPP2 can dephosphorylate NPR2 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Potter, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Other groups have used fluorescence microscopy to quantify chondrocyte movement, division, and volume in live avian growth plate cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2015</xref>), and to measure chondrocyte density in fixed mouse mandibular cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">He et al., 2017</xref>). However, the methods that we have developed for imaging the growth plate of mammalian bones are unique in that they allow rapid manipulation of the chemical environment surrounding the growth plate and real-time measurements of changes in signaling pathways within the intact tissue. These methods are broadly applicable to studies of signaling by other hormones and growth factors that might affect cGMP levels in growth plate chondrocytes. With mice expressing related FRET sensors for cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Calebiro et al., 2009</xref>), these methods could also be readily applied to studies of signaling by hormones such as parathyroid hormone related protein that regulate chondrocyte and osteoblast growth and differentiation by way of cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chagin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kozhemyakina et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Esbrit et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Ongoing clinical trials have shown that in patients with achondroplasia, in which skeletal dysplasia is caused by a constitutively active form of FGFR3, stimulation of NPR2 by subcutaneous injection of a hydrolysis-resistant analog of CNP increases bone length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klag and Horton, 2016</xref>). These results are consistent with the increased bone growth that results from increasing CNP in mouse models of achondroplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yasoda et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yasoda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lorget et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wendt et al., 2015</xref>). Studies using a mouse model overexpressing a constitutively active form of FGFR3 showed that applying CNP or a CNP analog in vivo or in vitro completely rescued the growth defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yasoda et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yasoda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wendt et al., 2015</xref>). However, in a study involving mice in which one allele of the <italic>Fgfr3</italic> gene was replaced with a constitutively active form, as occurs in achondroplasia, it was found that treatment with the CNP analog increased the growth rate of cultured tibia only partially, from ~40% to~70% of wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lorget et al., 2012</xref>). Such incomplete rescue might be expected, considering that NPR2 guanylyl cyclase activity depends not only on the presence of CNP but also on phosphorylation of multiple regulatory serines and threonines of NPR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). CNP levels are elevated in patients with achondroplasia, suggesting that NPR2 in their chondrocytes is resistant to CNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Olney et al., 2015</xref>), which could be due to NPR2 dephosphorylation. Thus, if NPR2 phosphorylation could be increased in chondrocytes of these patients, by inhibiting the phosphatase that dephosphorylates NPR2, this could potentially enhance the therapeutic stimulation of NPR2 activity by CNP as a treatment for achondroplasia. Our findings with the phosphatase inhibitor cantharidin support the concept of using related phosphatase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chung et al., 2017</xref>) for treatment of achondroplasia.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Npr2-7E</italic></td><td valign="top">PMID: 26522847</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">cGi500</td><td valign="top">PMID: 23801067</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-NPR2</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ter-Avetisyan et al.

The medium was changed every 2 days. Tibias were photographed using a Leica stereoscope, for measurement of length before and after a 6 day culture period, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. Measurements were done using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Measurement of cGMP production using cGi500</title><p>Cyclic GMP production was measured using tibias dissected from newborn mice (day 0–1) that globally expressed one or two copies of the cGi500 FRET sensor inserted into the <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thunemann et al., 2013</xref>). Isolated tibias were placed on Millicell membranes, in the medium described above, without CNP, and were used for imaging over the next 2 days. Prior to imaging, the epiphysis region of the proximal end of the tibia was slit with a razor blade to expose the growth plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This was accomplished by placing the tibia, dorsal side up, in a 500 µm deep channel in a plastic slide (ibidi USA, Fitchburg, WI; cat. no. 80176, special order with no adhesive). The depth of the channel was modified from 400 to 500 µm by adding a piece of tape on each side of the channel. The epiphysis region was then slid through the edge of a razor blade on the slide surface. This procedure resulted in a 500 µm thick piece of tissue underlying the growth plate surface. The overlying flap of tissue was trimmed away, and the tibia was placed in a 4-well plate (Nunc 176740; Thermo Scientific, Rochester, NY) containing 0.5–1 ml of medium/well at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, on a rotating platform. Where indicated, FGF18 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) was added at a saturating concentration (0.5 µg/ml), along with 1 µg/ml heparin (Sigma-Aldrich, H4784, St. Louis, MO). Heparin was included because it enhances FGF receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ornitz and Marie, 2015</xref>). Control samples were incubated with heparin only. For phosphatase inhibitor experiments, cantharidin (Tocris BioScience, Bristol UK) was dissolved at 50 mM in DMSO and diluted in media to 100 μM. Control tibias were incubated with 0.2% DMSO.</p><p>After the indicated pre-incubations, the distal half of the tibia was cut off, and the proximal piece placed, cut edge up, in a 600 µm deep channel in a plastic slide with access wells for perfusion (ibidi USA; cat. no. 80186; special order with no adhesive) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Silicon grease was applied around the rim of the channel. A coverslip was prepared by adhering to its surface two 200 μm thick pads that were separated by a 1–1.5 mm space. The pads were made from 2 layers of Scotch double sided tape, each 100 µm thick. The coverslip was then placed over the tibia, such that the bone spanned the two pads and the surface of the growth plate was separated by ~200 µm from the surface of the coverslip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The coverslip was pressed down gently against the silicon grease on the perfusion slide, such that the uncut surface of the tibia was held against the perfusion slide. The slide was then inverted and filled with media, by way of ports on the slide. This resulted in an assembly in which media could be flowed under the bridge formed by the tibia resting on the tape pads. For each experiment, the separation of the growth plate surface from the coverslip was confirmed by measuring the distance between these surfaces using the confocal microscope software.</p><p>The growth plate was imaged using a Pascal confocal system (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Thornwood, NY). Imaging was performed at ~34°C. The whole growth plate was imaged with a 10x/0.45 N.A. water immersion objective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). For FRET measurements, columnar/prehypertrophic chondrocytes were imaged using a 25x/0.8 NA water immersion objective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). To avoid evaporation during time-lapse imaging, Immersol (Carl Zeiss Microscopy) was used to form the contact with the coverslip. The pinhole was set at maximum, resulting in an optical section thickness of ~24 µm. FRET measurements were performed and analyzed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Norris et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shuhaibar et al., 2015</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Gail Mandel (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Eric Espiner (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work illustrates the use of a sensor for cGMP production, in a new intact preparation of mouse bone growth, to show in real time measurements that the NPR2 guanylyl cyclase is part of the FGF pathway for impairing bone growth. Prior studies of NPR2 GC activity have been confined to extracts from cell lines, and while mutations in both proteins cause forms of human dwarfism, whether the two proteins represent parallel or interdependent pathways is not known.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviews are explicit for concerns raised by the reviewers, and all three full reviews are attached for your consideration.

Mutations in both proteins cause forms of human dwarfism. However, whether the two proteins represent parallel or interdependent pathways is not known. Here, authors test whether NPR2 is in the FGF3R pathway in the physiological context of mouse bone growth. Using a new and elegant ex vivo preparation of intact tibia from mice expressing a form of NPR2 that cannot be dephosphorylated, authors show that bones are longer in these mice compared to WT mice. Then, by monitoring NPR2 guanylyl cyclase activity, in the intact growth plates, they show that FGF-dependent decreases in bone growth involve FGF-induced dephosphorylation of NPR2, with resulting decreases in cGMP in the growth plate chondrocytes. Thus, part of the mechanism by which FGF signaling inhibits bone elongation is through decreasing NPR2 activity. Of note, the intact system, in combination with the sensor, allow for rapid manipulation of the growth milieu as well as quantitating, in real time, changes in the signaling pathway. Its use here should elevate interest in using it for cGMP measurements in many other physiological contexts in addition to bone growth. Thus, the work will appeal to a wide range of developmental scientists, outside of those having a particular interest in bone growth.</p><p>I have one major concern that authors should consider addressing in a revised manuscript. While the authors point out that mutations in NPR2 result in a human form of dwarfism, the effects on bone length that they see in the mouse with the NPR2 phospho mimic mutant (~8-14%) are perhaps smaller than one might expect if the mouse model recapitulates the human condition. Authors should clarify in the Discussion their interpretation of the mouse bone length phenotype, observed in this study, with regard to the human phenotype resulting from the NPR2 mutation. They do have a nice discussion relating CNP levels and rescue of FGFR3 achondroplasia, but I could not easily relate their mouse results with the patient NPR2 dwarfism phenotype (the acromesomelic dysplasia Maroteaux type dwarfism) mentioned in the Introduction. Otherwise, with the exception of a couple of things noted below, the paper is well written for a broad audience and the data is very clearly presented.</p><p>The second sentence in the Abstract is very confusing with &quot;NPR2 cannot be dephosphorylated&quot; and then &quot;is opposed when NPR2 is dephosphorylated. In Results, the use of the word intrinsic to describe the muscle effects is a bit confusing/awkward. For example, the title in the Results section: <italic>Npr2<sup>7E/7E</sup></italic> mice have longer bones due to an intrinsic effect on bone, doesn't seem quite right. I know what they mean, but not sure this is the best way to present it. Might &quot;direct effect of phosphorylation&quot; be better?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>.

The evidence for this is based on i) mitigated inhibition of FGF induced long bone growth in mice with genetic modifications in the CNP receptor preventing dephosphorylation and ii) novel imaging techniques, used ex vivo in intact tissues, showing concordant changes in cGMP within growth plate chondrocytes depending on the phosphorylated state of nprb induced by FGF activity.</p><p>General Comments. While not surprising in view of their recent report in Cell Signaling, the findings are important new observations that make significant contributions to our understanding of the molecular events underpinning the interplay of two important pathways regulating mammalian long bone growth. The hypotheses are clearly stated and logically pursued in the experimental approach. The methods, genetic models and analyses all appear to be valid, as are the interpretation of the findings.</p><p>Specific comments.</p><p>1) In the Introduction, the authors appear to extrapolate findings from NO induced cGMP effects on bone density (JBMR 2017) to similar effects induced by CNP activation of cGMP (Calcif Tiss Int 2012). However the report of Kondo et al. relates to increased bone turnover-not increased bone density. To date, there is no convincing evidence that CNP promotes bone density per se.</p><p>2) Introduction, third paragraph. The authors refer to mice lacking FGFR3 having longer bones: they should also cite a similar phenotype in humans with FGFR3 LOF (Makrythanasis Human Mut 2014).</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> legend should specify the age of the mice tibia (presumably new born, 0-2 days as stated in the Materials and methods).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In humans and mice, the short bone phenotype caused by activating mutations in FGFR3 resembles that seen with loss-of-function mutations in NPR2 (or its ligand CNP), and pharmacological doses of hydrolysis-resistant CNP in humans or over-expression of CNP in transgenic mice largely corrects the mutant FGFR3 phenotype. Activation of NPR2 requires both receptor phosphorylation (on seven S/T residues) and binding of CNP; FGF treatment of chondroblastic cells causes NPR2 de-phosphorylation and reversible inhibition of CNP-induced NPR2 activation (as described in an accompanying manuscript by the authors). In the present study, the authors want to test the hypothesis that FGF signaling decreases NPR2 activity by dephosphorylating the receptor in vivo, using existing mice with ubiquitous expression of a cGMP-sensitive FRET sensor and mice carrying a phospho-mimetic mutant NPR2(7E).</p><p>Consistent with previous data in mice and humans with activating NPR2 mutations, the authors find that the NPR3(7E) mice have longer bones than wild type mice, and tibiae from mutant mice cultured in the presence of CNP grow faster than tibiae from wild type mice. These data suggest either increased basal guanylate cyclase activity of the mutant receptor, or enhanced sensitivity to CNP. Unfortunately, tibial growth in the absence of CNP was not evaluated.</p><p>The authors demonstrate the feasibility of measuring CNP-induced cGMP generation in intact growth plates in bones isolated from cGMP sensor mice, thereby expanding the number of live tissues in which cGMP generation can be monitored in real time. It appears that the basal CFP/YFP emission ratio in the absence of CNP varies between growth plate preparations (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), but may not accurately reflect basal cGMP tissue concentrations – this should be discussed. CNP treatment results in a robust FRET change that is larger in mutant compared to wild type growth plates, and pre-treatment with FGF reduces cGMP accumulation in wild type, but not mutant growth plates. The authors conclude that &quot;FGF signaling reduces cGMP production by dephosphorylating NPR2 in the growth plate.&quot; However, there is no data presented (or cited) to correlate NPR2 phosphorylation with GC activity. The 7E substitutions may or may not alter receptor conformation and function the same way phosphorylation does (this should be discussed in light of data shown in the accompanying manuscript).</p><p>No difference in basal cGMP concentrations could be detected between mutant and wild type growth plates, but the assay may not be suitable to detect small changes in basal cGMP concentrations. Therefore, one cannot conclude that NPR2(7E) chondrocytes in vivo have higher cGMP concentrations compared to wild type chondrocytes (as stated at the end of the Results) – but one can speculate that this may be the case given the bone overgrowth phenotype of NPR2(7E) mice. Does treatment with FGF (or phosphatase inhibitors) decrease the CFP/YFP ratio in wild type growth plates in the absence of CNP?</p><p>Overall, experiments were carefully executed and clearly described, but not all conclusions are supported by the data shown. For some of the conclusions, the biochemical properties of the mutant receptor need to be discussed and contrasted to the wild type receptor (e.g., basal and maximal activity, Ka for CNP, Km for GTP, mostly published). The most novel aspect of the study is the measurement of CNP-induced cGMP concentrations in growth plates, opening the door to assessing the effects of other hormones on cyclic nucleotides. However, the data presented are sparse – there are only two figures and the illustration of the FRET method. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> could be even shorter (e.g. lengths of tail and body, vertebrae, femurs and tibiae do not need to be shown in separate graphs), and the explanatory schemata of NPR2 phosphorylation/ activity are redundant between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, and 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> could be eliminated).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31343.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviews are explicit for concerns raised by the reviewers, and all three full reviews are attached for your consideration.

In the absence of CNP, FGF does not significantly decrease basal cGMP. Furthermore, since these basal values are only 1-2% ofthose measured by ELISA in the presence of CNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), they do not affect our use of cGi500 to measure CNP-dependent cGMP production with and without FGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to this point, if feasible, an independent experiment supporting the idea that preventing dephosphorylation prevents the FGF effect in the absence of CNP, such as use of a phosphatase inhibitor, would strengthen the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We added experiments to test the effect of the PPP family phosphatase inhibitor cantharidin on the FGF-induced decrease in cGMP production (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).
