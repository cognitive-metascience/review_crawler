Human RNR requires two subunits for activity, the α subunit contains the active site, and the β subunit houses the radical cofactor. Here, we present a 3.3-Å resolution structure by cryo-electron microscopy (EM) of a dATP-inhibited state of human RNR. This structure, which was determined in the presence of substrate CDP and allosteric regulators ATP and dATP, has three α<sub>2</sub> units arranged in an α<sub>6</sub> ring. At near-atomic resolution, these data provide insight into the molecular basis for CDP recognition by allosteric specificity effectors dATP/ATP. Additionally, we present lower-resolution EM structures of human α<sub>6</sub> in the presence of both the anticancer drug clofarabine triphosphate and β<sub>2</sub>. Together, these structures support a model for RNR inhibition in which β<sub>2</sub> is excluded from binding in a radical transfer competent position when α exists as a stable hexamer.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31502.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells often need to make more DNA, for example when they are about to divide or need to repair their genetic information. The building blocks of DNA – also called deoxyribonucleotides – are created through a series of biochemical reactions. Among the enzymes that accomplish these reactions, ribonucleotide reductases (or RNRs, for short) perform a key irreversible step.</p><p>One prominent class of RNR contains two basic units, named alpha and beta. The active form of these RNRs is made up of a pair of alpha units (α<sub>2</sub>), which associates with a pair of beta units (β<sub>2</sub>) to create an α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub> structure. α<sub>2</sub> captures molecules called ribonucleotides and, with the help of β<sub>2</sub>, converts them to deoxyribonucleotides that after futher processing will be used to create DNA.</p><p>As RNR produces deoxyribonucleotides, levels of DNA building blocks in the cell rise. To avoid overstocking the cell, RNR contains an ‘off switch’ that is triggered when levels of one of the DNA building blocks, dATP, is high enough to occupy a particular site on the alpha unit. Binding of dATP to this site results in three pairs of alpha units getting together to form a stable ring of six units (called α<sub>6</sub>). How the formation of this stable α<sub>6</sub> ring actually turns off RNR was an open question.</p><p>Here, Brignole, Tsai et al. use a microscopy method called cryo-EM to reveal the three-dimensional structure of the inactive human RNR almost down to the level of individual atoms. When the alpha pairs form an α<sub>6</sub> ring, the hole in the center of this circle is smaller than β<sub>2</sub>, keeping β<sub>2</sub> away from α<sub>2</sub>. This inaccessibility leads to RNR being switched off.</p><p>If RNR is inactive, DNA synthesis is impaired and cells cannot divide. In turn, controlling whether or not cells proliferate is key to fighting diseases like cancer (where ‘rogue’ cells keep replicating) or bacterial infections. Certain cancer treatments already target RNR, and create the inactive α<sub>6</sub> ring structure. In addition, in bacteria, the inactive form of RNR is different from the human one and forms an α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>4</sub> ring,rather than an α<sub>6</sub> ring. Understanding the structure of the human inactive RNR could help scientists to find both new anticancer and antibacterial drugs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single-particle electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>protein structure</kwd><kwd>chemotherapeutic target</kwd><kwd>nucleic acid metabolism</kwd><kwd>radical mechanism</kwd><kwd>allosteric regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drennan</surname><given-names>Catherine L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Project (R01),GM67167</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Asturias</surname><given-names>Francisco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Project (R01),GM29595</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stubbe</surname><given-names>JoAnne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cryo-electron microscopy structures of human ribonucleotide reductase reveal molecular details of substrate selection and allosteric inhibition through assembly of its large subunit into a ring that excludes its small subunit.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), an essential enzyme in all organisms, catalyzes the reduction of ribonucleotides into deoxyribonucleotide precursors for replication and repair of DNA. Because RNR is vital for cell proliferation and genome maintenance, drugs that target human RNR are used against some of the most aggressive and challenging to treat cancers, including refractory lymphoblastic leukemia, metastatic ovarian and pancreatic cancers, and melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Aye et al., 2015</xref>). Human RNR is a class Ia RNR, represented by eukaryotes and some prokaryotes that includes the well-studied homologs from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cervisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cotruvo and Stubbe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brignole et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hofer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Minnihan et al., 2013b</xref>). In the class Ia RNRs two homodimeric subunits work together to reduce diphosphate forms of all four canonical ribonucleotides (NDPs) to their deoxyribonucleotide counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von Döbeln and Reichard, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brignole et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hofer et al., 2012</xref>).

Additionally, the C-termini of α<sub>2</sub> and β<sub>2</sub> have not been detected in the available crystal structures, due to flexibility essential to their function. The unstructured C-terminal β<sub>2</sub> tail interacts with a specific binding site on α<sub>2</sub> and participates in inter-subunit RT. The α<sub>2</sub> C-terminus emanates from a strand in the active site bearing two redox active residues on the RT pathway (Tyr737 and Tyr738 in human α, equivalent to Tyr730 and Tyr731 in <italic>E. coli</italic> α), which becomes disordered shortly following these Tyr residues, preventing direct observation of a pair of Cys residues that are required for shuttling reducing equivalents to the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>).</p><p>A species-specific combination of allosteric, transcriptional, post-translational, and subcellular locational controls regulates RNR activity to maintain appropriate concentrations and proportions of deoxyribonucleotides and ensures fidelity of DNA synthesis and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hofer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guarino et al., 2014</xref>). Allosteric regulation depends on two nucleotide-binding sites in α<sub>2</sub> that, through modulation of α<sub>2</sub> conformation and subunit oligomerization, tune activity and substrate specificity, as described below.</p><p>The allosteric binding site that regulates substrate preference is located at the α-dimerization interface on one face of a conserved structural element, called loop 2, whose opposite face makes contacts with the substrate base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). dATP binding to this effector site results in a preference for CDP and UDP reduction; TTP for GDP reduction; and dGTP for ADP reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brown and Reichard, 1969b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von Döbeln and Reichard, 1976</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Recent crystal structures of <italic>E. coli</italic> RNR with all four specificity effector-substrate pairs (dATP-CDP, dATP-UDP, TTP-GDP, and dGTP-ADP) reveal the molecular basis of specificity regulation in this archetypal class Ia RNR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zimanyi et al., 2016</xref>). Although the rules of allosteric regulation of specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) appear to be conserved, whether the molecular features of specificity regulation are the same in eukaryotic RNRs remains an open question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahmad et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zimanyi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Overall RNR activity can also be allosterically regulated. For class Ia RNRs, dATP binding to the cone domain at the N-terminus of α<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>) has an inhibitory effect, whereas ATP binding reverses this inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brown and Reichard, 1969b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rofougaran et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rofougaran et al., 2008</xref>). In the prototypical system from <italic>E. coli</italic>, binding of the allosteric inhibitor dATP within the cone domain results in an α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>4</sub> ring-shaped structure that holds the α<sub>2</sub> and β<sub>2</sub> subunits in a configuration incompatible with RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ando et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zimanyi et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

In particular, with dATP bound to the activity effector site in α, the cone domain forms an interface with β, leading to α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>4</sub> ring formation. ATP restores activity by displacing dATP in the activity effector site in the cone domain, which disrupts the α-β interface of the α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>4</sub> ring, and further pushes the equilibrium toward the α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub> complex. The molecular basis by which dATP promotes α-β interface formation and ATP disrupts it has not been established. Long-distance radical transfer between α and β is illustrated by red arrows. (<bold>B</bold>) The molecular basis of allosteric regulation of activity in human class Ia RNR (see text in Discussion). Briefly, α<sub>2</sub> forms α<sub>6</sub> in the presence of both ATP and dATP. The stability of the hexamer formed determines whether the enzyme is active when β<sub>2</sub> is added. dATP-induced hexamers are stable and inactive whereas ATP-induced hexamers are unstable and activated by β<sub>2</sub> addition.

Support for the idea that ‘stable’ α<sub>6</sub> rings correspond to an inhibited form of human RNR comes from studies with clofarabine (ClF), an adenosine analog used for cancer treatment, and related analogs cladrabine and fludarabine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Aye and Stubbe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aye et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wisitpitthaya et al., 2016</xref>). In those studies, human RNR treated with CIF diphosphate (ClFDP) or triphosphate (ClFTP) lead to inactive enzyme and the formation of extremely stable ‘persistent’ α<sub>6</sub> rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Aye and Stubbe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aye et al., 2012</xref>). Structural information about α<sub>6</sub> rings has been limited to a 9-Å resolution crystal structure of human α obtained in the presence of dATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ando et al., 2016</xref>), a 6.6-Å resolution crystal structure of yeast α with dATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fairman et al., 2011</xref>), and a 28-Å resolution EM structure dATP-induced α<sub>6</sub> from yeast in the presence of β<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fairman et al., 2011</xref>). These low-resolution structures were sufficient to establish the overall α<sub>6</sub> subunit arrangement, but failed to reveal the molecular basis for inactivity of the α<sub>6</sub> ring. Here, we use state-of-the-art cryo-EM to determine the structure of human RNR α<sub>6</sub> at the near-atomic resolution of 3.3 Å and probe the mechanisms of allosteric regulation of activity and specificity for the human class Ia RNR enzyme.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optimal conditions for cryo-EM were established empirically using negative stain EM</title><p>Human α forms ring-like particles composed of three α-dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) upon addition of 0.05 mM dATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>) as seen previously in the low-resolution crystal structures of human and yeast α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fairman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ando et al., 2016</xref>) and in human RNR in the presence of ClFDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aye et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). These α<sub>6</sub> rings formed with dATP alone showed some structural flexibility. α<sub>6</sub> rings were also the predominant form observed following incubation of α with 1 mM ATP, but some particles were incomplete or partially open rings, indicating that the subunit contacts are tenuous, consistent with the proposition that the rings formed in the presence of ATP are not stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Increasing ATP concentration to 3 mM resulted in an increase in the proportion of dissociated rings and free α-dimers. At 10 mM ATP we observed fewer α<sub>6</sub> rings and a filamentous form of α is now apparent. Analysis of the filamentous oligomers showed that they are composed of α<sub>2</sub> units chained together end-to-end, often only three units in length. With TTP, the dimeric α<sub>2</sub> form is present exclusively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) as seen in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thelander et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reichard et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rofougaran et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Aye and Stubbe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fairman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scott et al., 2001</xref>). Finally, we examined α in the presence of 0.05 mM dATP and 3 mM ATP, a combination expected to be physiological relevant. In dividing cells where RNR is actively producing deoxynucleotides, the dATP concentration is approximately 0.024 mM and the ATP concentration is approximately 3 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Traut, 1994</xref>), thus the combination of 0.05 mM dATP and 3 mM ATP is expected to mimic cellular effector concentrations under which this higher dATP concentration inhibits RNR. To verify that 0.05 mM dATP inhibits human RNR even in the presence of 3 mM ATP, enzyme assays were performed, which showed inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Under negative stain EM, this combination of effectors (0.05 mM dATP and 3 mM ATP) yielded data sets in which α<sub>6</sub> rings are preponderant and could be combined into a well-defined 3D structure with D3 point group symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Given that this combination of effectors provided the most structurally homogeneous preparation of α<sub>6</sub> rings, we used it for the high-resolution cryo-EM analysis. It is unfortunate that structural stability is so sensitive to nucleotide identity and concentration, since these constraints limit the ability to determine high-resolution structures of the human RNR with all combinations of substrate and effectors.

This observation was first made for the <italic>E. coli</italic> RNR enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zimanyi et al., 2016</xref>), and we now find the same molecular mechanism of substrate specificity in play with the human enzyme.</p><p>CDP density is clearly observed in the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Additionally, Arg293 on loop 2 (Arg298 in <italic>E. coli</italic>) reaches over the cytosine base to hydrogen bond with the phosphates, providing both a stacking interaction with the base and a positive-counter charge to the negatively charged substrate phosphates.

Substrate specificity regulation is particularly intriguing -- how does the binding of dATP or ATP to the allosteric specificity site 15 Å away from the active site increase the preference of the active site for a pyrimidine substrate whereas TTP and dGTP binding promote purine substrates? Although the rules of regulation are conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and the locations of the substrate and effector binding sites are conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>), it has not been clear, even for prokaryotic versus eukaryotic class Ia RNRs, if the molecular mechanisms that afford the ‘rules’ will be the same. In part, the issue has been that obtaining structural data to visualize the molecular basis of allosteric specificity regulation has been nontrivial. To date, there are only a handful of structures of RNRs that have clear density for the loop responsible for the allosteric communication (loop 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zimanyi et al., 2016</xref>), which has led to conflicting mechanistic proposals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahmad et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zimanyi et al., 2016</xref>). The near-atomic resolution structure presented here provides the first visualization of RNR structure from a eukaryotic RNR that has a well-ordered loop 2. Using our structure, which has CDP bound in the active site, we can investigate whether the molecular mechanism for pyrimidine substrate preference is conserved between human RNR and the well-studied <italic>E. coli</italic> enzyme, resolving a controversy as well as providing key insight into this captivating form of allosteric regulation. The molecular basis for allosteric regulation of activity has been similarly enigmatic. Prior to this study, we knew that human RNR forms an α<sub>6</sub> state in the presence of allosteric activity effectors ATP and dATP, but it was not clear why the stable dATP-induced α<sub>6</sub> state was inactive. Here our 3.3-Å resolution cryo-EM structure of the human RNR enzyme in a dATP-inhibited α<sub>6</sub> state has considerably surpassed the resolution of a previous 9-Å resolution crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ando et al., 2016</xref>) and has allowed us to interrogate the molecular basis of dATP-associated inactivity for human RNR. We also use these data, along with lower resolution EM structures of human RNR α<sub>6</sub> rings in the presence of the anticancer drug CIFTP and the radical storage β<sub>2</sub> subunit, to consider the implications of these findings for anticancer therapies.</p><p>Our near-atomic resolution structure of human α<sub>6</sub> is the first structure of the human enzyme with the CDP/dATP substrate/effector pair bound. As mentioned above, it also represents one of the few RNR structures with a well-ordered loop 2, the region of the structure responsible for communication between the specificity effector and its cognate substrate. The conformation of loop 2 observed between the base of the dATP specificity effector and the base of the CDP substrate indicates that communication of CDP binding preference from the specificity effector-binding site is conserved with <italic>E. coli</italic> α<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In both systems, backbone atoms of this loop ‘read out’ the adenine base and position Gln288 into the active site to recognize the cytosine of CDP. With the CDP appropriately bound, Arg293 seals the active site for radical chemistry. A previously solved structure of human α<sub>2</sub> with dATP bound in the specificity site, but without substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fairman et al., 2011</xref>), shows Gln288 positioned for pyrimidine recognition (CDP or UDP), but in the absence of substrate, Arg293 is disordered and the C-terminal portion of loop 2 has not yet adopted the conformation that would fully stabilize the substrate-effector pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Importantly, a crystal structure of yeast α<sub>2</sub> with ATP analog AMPPNP and CDP bound exhibits a conformation unlike that seen in the human or <italic>E. coli</italic> structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Substantial differences between yeast and <italic>E. coli</italic> substrate-effector bound RNR structures have been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahmad et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zimanyi et al., 2016</xref>) and opposite roles for the conserved Gln of loop 2 have been proposed. For <italic>E. coli</italic>, it is believed that the positioning of the Gln side chain into the active site promotes CDP/UDP binding through hydrogen bonding while hindering ADP/GDP binding due to steric bulk. However, for yeast, it has been proposed the Gln side chain points into the active site to increase (not decrease) the affinity of ADP. Thus, one goal of this work was to evaluate whether eukaryotic RNRs, such as human and yeast, use Gln and loop 2 differently from their prokaryotic counterparts. In other words, we wished to establish the conformation of loop 2 and Gln for the CDP-dATP substrate-effector pair in the human enzyme and compare it to yeast and <italic>E. coli</italic>. As described above, we find that the human RNR communicates CDP preference in an identical fashion as <italic>E. coli</italic>. Therefore, whether or not the yeast enzyme does employ Gln differently, it is not the case that all eukaryotic RNRs will be different from prokaryotic RNRs. Notably, with the addition of this CDP-dATP bound structure, there are now six RNR structures for which loop 2 is well ordered. Four are from the <italic>E. coli</italic> class Ia RNR (CDP-dATP, UDP-dATP, GDP-TTP, and ADP-dGTP, listed as substrate-specificity effector pair) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zimanyi et al., 2016</xref>), one from <italic>Thermatoga maritima</italic> class II RNR (GDP-TTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Larsson et al., 2004</xref>), and this one for human class Ia RNR (CDP-dATP). It was previously reported that the two GDP-TTP structures are highly similar despite being from different RNR species and classes. Taken together with these results, we postulate that the molecular mechanism of allosteric specificity regulation will be conserved among class I and II RNRs; that structural differences observed to date are more likely due to crystal disorder/lattice contacts rather than real variations in mechanism. Single particle cryo-EM, a technique for which lattice contacts are not an issue, thus provides valuable insight about how an unrestrained regulatory feature, such as loop 2, responds to substrate/effector binding. Moving forward, we suspect that cryo-EM will be increasingly used to investigate allosteric regulation.</p><p>Whereas our results support a conserved mechanism for allosteric regulation of specificity among class Ia RNRs from different species, they argue against conservation of the mechanism for allosteric activity regulation. For the human enzyme in the presence of dATP, we see no evidence of <italic>E. coli-</italic>like α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>4</sub> structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) nor do we see anything that resembles the α<sub>4</sub> oligomeric state that was recently reported for dATP-inhibited <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> RNR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johansson et al., 2016</xref>). Instead, we observe α<sub>6</sub> and some α<sub>6</sub>β<sub>2</sub>. In agreement with quantitative studies of human RNR by SAXS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ando et al., 2016</xref>), EM analysis shows that α<sub>6</sub> rings form in the presence of both dATP and ATP, or ClFTP, and that addition of β<sub>2</sub> does not disrupt these stable rings. Additionally, our EM data show that β<sub>2</sub> can sit in multiple positions around the outside of the α<sub>6</sub> ring, but appears unable to penetrate into the inside of the ring structure where it could initiate chemistry on α<sub>2</sub>. Thus, instead of ‘holding β<sub>2</sub> at arm’s length’ to prevent RT in the presence of dATP as in <italic>E. coli</italic> RNR, the human enzyme holds α<sub>2</sub> subunits together in a circle in the presence of dATP to exclude β<sub>2</sub> from accessing α<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The cryo-EM structure furthermore offers an explanation for β<sub>2</sub> exclusion from the inside of the α<sub>6</sub> ring. We find that β<sub>2</sub> access is impaired by the 60-Å constriction at the surface of the α<sub>6</sub> ring and by the disordered C-terminal tails of α that extend into the ring. Also, the ability of β<sub>2</sub> to assume a catalytically relevant position with respect to α is restricted by the cone domains at the α<sub>2</sub>-α<sub>2</sub> interface and the three-helix insertion motif of adjacent α<sub>2</sub> subunits. In short, when the ring is stable and cannot expand, β<sub>2</sub> cannot fit and assume a catalytically relevant position. Thus, the weak association between the cone domains in the presence of ATP should allow β<sub>2</sub> to further destabilize the α<sub>6</sub> ring by inserting itself into the central opening to form an active complex with α<sub>2</sub>. In contrast, tight association of the cone domains in the presence of dATP would preclude productive β<sub>2</sub> interaction with α<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>These structural results also offer insight into inhibition of RNR by the diphosphate and triphosphate forms of the therapeutics clofarabine (ClFDP and ClFTP), cladribine (ClADP and ClATP), and fludarabine (FlUTP) that are known to impart α hexamers with enhanced stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Aye and Stubbe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aye et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wisitpitthaya et al., 2016</xref>). Given that the well-studied RNR inhibitors gemcitabine-diphosphate and hydroxyurea are known to target the active site on α and the tyrosyl radical on β<sub>2</sub>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van der Donk et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Offenbacher et al., 2014</xref>), the possibility that some RNR inhibitors might act by targeting the allosteric activity site on α was intriguing to investigate. ClF and ClA are cytotoxic in a cell line expressing wild-type α, whereas a cell line expressing an α mutation in its allosteric activity site (Asp57Asn) is resistant to the drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wisitpitthaya et al., 2016</xref>), consistent with the allosteric activity site being targeted by these molecules. From our data, we can now rationalize that molecules that stabilize the hexamer by binding to the cone domain will inhibit human RNR by impairing the ability of β<sub>2</sub> to access α. Thus, designing inhibitors to bind to the allosteric site in the cone domain appears to represent a new and attractive method for inhibiting human RNR in vivo.</p><p>In summary, advances of cryo-EM methodology have allowed us to obtain a near-atomic resolution structure that has provided remarkable insight into the allosteric regulation of the human RNR enzyme. Although detailed structural information about the active α-β RNR complexes is still an important missing piece to the puzzle, our understanding of RNR inactive states has advanced substantially with views of beautiful yet distinct ring structures.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>5-<sup>3</sup>H]-CDP was obtained from ViTrax. hTrx1 and hTrxR1 were isolated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ando et al., 2016</xref>). </p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>RNR expression, purification, and activity assays</title><p>His<sub>6</sub>-tagged forms of human α and β were expressed from plasmid pET-28a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2007</xref>) in <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL21(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) and purified by Co<sup>2+</sup>-affinity chromatography as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Aye and Stubbe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ando et al., 2016</xref>). α typically has a specific activity of 600 ~ 850 nmol dCDP/min/mg and reconstituted β has a specific activity of 2000 ~ 2400 nmol dCDP/min/mg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). α is stored in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 15 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM DTT, 5% glycerol at 8.4 mg/mL (92 μM) for all cryo-EM experiments.

In the first stage, the cryo-EM image data were divided into two non-overlapping subsets and orientation parameters for each subset were independently refined starting from an ~25 Å initial reference, which was calculated <italic>ab initio</italic> through stochastic hill climbing refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elmlund et al., 2013</xref>) starting from a set of ~10,000 images to which random Euler angle values were assigned, thereby eliminating any possibility of reference bias. At each iteration, low-pass filtering for the partial volumes was set to the frequency corresponding to the FSC = 0.5 value between two quasi-independent partial maps. This initial stage was followed by local orientation parameter optimization with template volume amplitude adjustment. Amplitude correction factors were determined using the rotationally averaged power spectrum computed for an initial pseudoatomic α<sub>6</sub> model generated by fitting crystal structure of human α (PDB: 3HNF chain B) into a lower resolution EM map. Local resolution was computed using the local resolution calculation function implemented in SPARX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4-6"><title>Model refinement</title><p>Coordinates from the crystal structure of human α (PDB: 3HNF) were docked into the EM reconstruction with UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goddard et al., 2007</xref>).

Although at 3.3-Å resolution ATP and dATP are difficult to distinguish, dATP appeared to be the better fit and is expected to have a higher affinity for both sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brown and Reichard, 1969b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reichard et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kashlan and Cooperman, 2003</xref>).

Final rounds of model building and refinement were done with COOT and phenix.real_space_refine version 1.11.1-dev-2650 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>). In real space refinement, resolution was set to 3.0 Å, electron scattering table was selected, NCS constraints for the six α subunits were automatically detected and refined, secondary structure hydrogen bonds were relaxed to 0.4 sigma, and secondary structure restraints were manually defined by comparison with existing crystal structures of human, yeast, and <italic>E. coli</italic> α and with secondary structure restraints that were determined automatically by PHENIX. Definitions for CDP and dATP from the CCP4 monomers library were modified to restrain ideal phosphate dihedral angles and specify alternate conformations for sugar pucker (C2′-endo/C3′-exo and C2′-exo/C3′-endo). Phosphates of dATP were modeled with an octahedrally coordinated Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion to three water molecules, restrained to ideal distances (2.1 Å) and angles (90°).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers (one of whom was Werner Kühlbrandt), and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor and the Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper presents the 3.3 Å cryo-EM structure of human ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) in dATP, CDP bound forms as well as, in a lower resolution structure, with the inhibitor CIFTP, as well as with the β subunit. This is an important study, because of the fundamental importance of RNR in DNA metabolism, and the fact that human RNR is a potential anti-cancer target. In addition, the enzyme is regulated by complex allosteric control, with two kinds of allosteric sites, one governing specificity and one governing activity. The allosteric control involves switching between different quaternary assemblies, and some aspects of this mechanism are different between the <italic>E. coli</italic> enzyme (particularly well studied) and the human enzyme (less well studied). X-ray structures are available for the <italic>E. coli</italic> homolog and for dimeric forms of the α and β subunits of human RNR, but so far there is no high-resolution structure of the hexameric human enzyme, which is relevant for allosteric regulation. At an estimated molecular mass of around 500 kDa, the hexamer of human RNR is an ideal target for structure determination by cryo-EM, and the present work substantially improves upon the low resolution reconstructions available previously. The structures confirm proposed models for the hexamer organization and reveal more resolved information of the cone domain interactions in the hexamer. The structure also confirms suggested models for how substrate should bind in the active site of mammalian enzymes.</p><p>The EM map appears to be of a very high quality. The final resolution of 3.3 Å is excellent, considering the pixel size (1.3 Å) and number of particles used (44,000 out of 150,000), and bearing in mind that cryo-EM maps are clearer and better than x-ray maps at the same nominal resolution. This is due to the quality of structure factor phases, which are determined directly.</p><p>Major concerns to address:</p><p>1) Given the power of cryoEM to resolve this complex with various substrates and effectors bound, it is surprising that the authors describe only one substrate/effector pair. The paper would be strengthened if the results were expanded to a complete set of cognate effector substrate pairs. If this has not been done, the revised manuscript should describe why this is the case. Note that we are not asking for the initiation of new experimental work at this stage, but if additional data are available then they would strengthen the paper. In any case, discussion of this point should be provided in the revised manuscript.</p><p>2) In the paper, as written, it is difficult for a non-specialist reader to discern what specifically is the advance reported in the paper, given the lower-resolution reconstruction of the hexameric α-subunit structure reported previously. There is some discussion of this in the concluding section of the paper, but the paper would be strengthened by bringing to the front a discussion of what is not known, and what conceptual advances are to be expected of the present work, beyond improving the resolution.</p><p>Please note the other important points to address, shown below. Many of these points concern the clarity of the manuscript and the accessibility to a non-specialist reader.</p><p>1) The paper is written in such a way that it is quite difficult for a non-specialist to appreciate the complex allosteric regulation of this enzyme, and to put the work in the context of previous results. The two kinds of allosteric sites (which are referred to throughout the paper) should be clearly explained, and the expectations as to which of these sites would be occupied (or not) in the hexameric structure should be discussed. The impact of the figures would be improved by accompanying schematic diagrams.</p><p>2) A schematic diagram should be provided that shows the allosteric modulators, and how they alter oligomeric states. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> shows specificity and activity effectors without explaining what they are.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows a complicated feedback network in which different nucleotides affect the activity (and specificity?) of the enzyme. With the improved description of the enzyme, this diagram should be related to the known structural features (see the major concern noted above, which asks why the information on different effectors and substrates is limited).</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, an equilibrium between different oligomeric states is shown, but without explanation of how and why ATP shifts this equilibrium.</p><p>5) Why was a mixture of dATP and ATP used to prepare the cryoEM sample?

The logic of the sample preparation should be explained.</p><p>6) It would be interesting to know by how much the map resolution improved when 6-fold averaging was applied.</p><p>7) Additional figures showing densities of residues in important regions should be provided, such as the cone interactions and dATP interaction, as well as the loop 2 conformation and substrate coordination.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31502.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major concerns to address:</p><p>1) Given the power of cryoEM to resolve this complex with various substrates and effectors bound, it is surprising that the authors describe only one substrate/effector pair.

However, those experiments, if possible by this approach, will require more complicated mixtures of nucleotides and we have not worked out the appropriate conditions for those structural studies.</p><p>To explain more fully, the dATP/ATP/CDP combination that we used in this study was empirically determined over the course of many years to provide stabilized, rigid alpha6 rings. dATP/ATP are unique among allosteric effectors of RNR in their ability to form alpha6 rings while simultaneously serving as the specificity effector for the substrate CDP. The other nucleotide effectors, TTP or dGTP, that specify GDP or ADP substrate preferences, do not stabilize the large, symmetric alpha6 rings (see Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Ando et al., 2017), preferentially form alpha2 (150 kDa), and would make resolving loop2 and bound nucleotides by cryo-EM a substantial challenge. To obtain structures with TTP/GDP or dGTP/ADP substrate/effector pairs, in the context of an alpha6 ring, could require a carefully tuned combination with dATP and/or ATP effector at concentrations and where TTP or dGTP effectors are not displaced at the specificity site. Defining conditions that would allow us to achieve structures of these states would benefit from a deeper understanding of binding affinities of individual and combinations of nucleotides that remains to be done.</p><p>We now have much more information in the text about how we established the appropriate ratios of nucleotides for this high resolution work and explain the difficulties in obtaining structures with the other nucleotide substrates and effectors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the paper, as written, it is difficult for a non-specialist reader to discern what specifically is the advance reported in the paper, given the lower-resolution reconstruction of the hexameric α-subunit structure reported previously.

The reviewers are correct that the advances are more substantial than just an improvement in resolution, albeit a dramatic improvement.
