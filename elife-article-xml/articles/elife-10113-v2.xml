distinct conformations as they move into and out of microtubules. How this conformational cycle contributes to microtubule growing, shrinking, and switching remains unknown. Here, we report that a buried mutation in αβ-tubulin yields microtubules with dramatically reduced shrinking rate and catastrophe frequency. The mutation causes these effects by suppressing a conformational change that normally occurs in response to GTP hydrolysis in the lattice, without detectably changing the conformation of unpolymerized αβ-tubulin. Thus, the mutation weakens the coupling between the conformational and GTPase cycles of αβ-tubulin. By showing that the mutation predominantly affects post-GTPase conformational and dynamic properties of microtubules, our data reveal that the strength of the allosteric response to GDP in the lattice dictates the frequency of catastrophe and the severity of rapid shrinking.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10113.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10113.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10113.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Protein filaments called microtubules help move cargo around inside cells. Chromosomes, which contain the cell’s genetic blueprints, are the microtubule’s most precious cargo. Before a cell divides, microtubules grow from the ends of the dividing cell towards the middle, where they attach to the chromosomes that are lined up along the centerline. Then the microtubules shrink and drag the chromosomes back to the opposite ends of the cell. This allows each of the new cells to get one copy of each chromosome.</p><p>When the microtubules are growing, a molecule called guanosine triphosphate (or GTP) is attached to the proteins at the end of the filament. This acts like a cap and protects the microtubule from shrinking. Later a chemical reaction converts GTP into GDP (short for guanosine diphosphate). Without the protective GTP cap, the microtubule quickly shrinks. At the same time, the proteins that make up the microtubule also change shape. In the microtubule, the proteins adopt a straight shape when GTP is attached. The proteins favor a different shape in the microtubule when GDP is attached. However, it is unclear if or how these shape changes contribute to how a microtubule grows or shrinks.</p><p>Geyer et al. now show how this shape shifting can influence microtubule shrinking, by first identifying a mutation in yeast microtubule proteins that cause the proteins to remain straight even when GDP is attached. Next, powerful microscopes were used to make time-lapse videos of the mutated microtubules. This allowed Geyer et al. to observe how the mutated microtubules behaved and compare this to the behavior of normal microtubules.</p><p>The experiments revealed that the mutated microtubules were less likely to begin shrinking than typical microtubules. The mutated microtubules also shrunk more slowly. These findings indicate that the shape changes control the speed of shrinking and frequency of entering the shrinking phase. These new details about the control of microtubule growth and shrinkage may help scientists studying how cell division happens in both healthy and cancerous cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10113.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10113.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>tubulin</kwd><kwd>dynamics</kwd><kwd>conformation</kwd><kwd>allostery</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM-098543</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rice</surname><given-names>Luke M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1054947</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rice</surname><given-names>Luke M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014177758</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geyer</surname><given-names>Elisabeth A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM008297</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geyer</surname><given-names>Elisabeth A</given-names></name><name><surname>Piedra</surname><given-names>Felipe-Andres</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A buried mutation in αβ-tubulin reveals an allosteric response to GDP in the lattice that dictates microtubule catastrophe and shrinking.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microtubules are dynamic polymers of αβ-tubulin that undergo GTPase-dependent switching between phases of growing and rapid shrinking (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Desai and Mitchison, 1997</xref>). Microtubule growing and shrinking rates, and switching frequencies, are necessary for proper function, highly regulated by cellular factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Howard and Hyman, 2003</xref>), and targeted by widely used anti-mitotic anticancer drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jordan and Wilson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amos, 2011</xref>). αβ-tubulin also undergoes a conformational cycle during polymerization and depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mandelkow et al., 1991a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chrétien et al., 1995</xref>) Unpolymerized αβ-tubulin adopts a 'curved' conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ravelli et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rice et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buey et al., 2006</xref>) that is not compatible with the 'straight' microtubule lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nogales et al., 1998</xref>). In the body of the microtubule, αβ-tubulin can adopt distinct ‘expanded’ or ‘compacted’ straight conformations depending on nucleotide state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alushin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hyman et al., 1995</xref>). Partially straightened conformations of αβ-tubulin are thought to occur as polymerization intermediates on the microtubule end.</p><p>Recent studies have begun to reveal how microtubule regulatory proteins take advantage of these different conformations. In one well-characterized example, end-binding proteins in the EB1 family have been shown to mark the plus-end cap of microtubules by binding preferentially to the ‘expanded’, GTP-like conformation of αβ-tubulin that only occurs near the end of the growing microtubule lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maurer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zanic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alushin et al., 2014</xref>). Another recent example of selective interactions with specific conformations of αβ-tubulin comes from work in our laboratory showing that TOG domains from the microtubule polymerase Stu2p bind preferentially to the curved conformation of αβ-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ayaz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2014</xref>), and that this preference of TOG domains for curved αβ-tubulin is probably what allows the polymerase to localize to the growing tip of the microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ayaz et al., 2014</xref>). These and numerous studies of other regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Desai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gigant et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peters et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alushin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bechstedt et al., 2014</xref>) contribute to the emerging view that selective binding to distinct conformations of αβ-tubulin represents a common and important strategy for recognizing and controlling microtubules.</p><p>How the αβ-tubulin conformational cycle contributes to microtubule dynamics is less understood. Indeed, even though structural rearrangements in αβ-tubulin have long been known to occur during and after microtubule incorporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mandelkow et al., 1991b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chrétien et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hyman et al., 1995</xref>), actually showing that these rearrangements contribute to and are required for the dynamic properties of microtubules remains challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rice et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang and Nogales, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jánosi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Molodtsov et al., 2005</xref>). For example, GTP-bound αβ-tubulin ‘straightens’ during the formation of longitudinal and lateral lattice contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rice et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nawrotek et al., 2011</xref>), but how (or even if) the energetic cost of these assembly-dependent conformational changes affects polymerization dynamics remains debated. A similar argument can be made about the αβ-tubulin conformational changes that occur as a consequence of GTP hydrolysis deeper in the microtubule lattice. One reason these questions are still debated is that to date in vitro microtubule dynamics have only been measured for a small number of αβ-tubulin mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gupta et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dougherty et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sage et al., 1995</xref>), and it has not yet been possible to link altered dynamics to a change in the αβ-tubulin conformational cycle.</p><p>In the present study we sought to discover how multiple αβ-tubulin conformations affect microtubule dynamics by identifying mutations that selectively perturb some aspect of the conformational cycle. We reasoned that mutating buried residues with different packing environments in the curved and straight conformations might provide a way to perturb the conformational cycle. We focused on helix H7 because it is an element that is positioned differently in the ‘curved’ (unpolymerized) and ‘straight’ (polymerized) conformations of αβ-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nogales et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ravelli et al., 2004</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and it may act as a structural relay connecting the ‘top’ and ‘bottom’ of the tubulin subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amos, 2004</xref>). The equivalent helix in α-tubulin was also recently observed to move in response to GTP hydrolysis in the lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alushin et al., 2014</xref>). We chose to study the T238A mutation in β-tubulin because this sidechain resides on helix H7 and is buried in the core of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and because prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thomas et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Machin et al., 1995</xref>) showed that the β:T238A phenotype was consistent with hyperstable microtubules. The molecular mechanism by which the β:T238A mutation affects microtubule dynamics is unknown, in part because the polymerization dynamics of β:T238A αβ-tubulin have not been studied in vivo or in vitro. Our studies now reveal that the β:T238A mutation affects microtubule dynamics by dramatically reducing the frequency of catastrophe and the rate of shrinking, and that the mutation affects microtubule structure by attenuating post-GTPase conformational changes in the lattice. The effects of the mutation are reminiscent of the way the microtubule stabilizing drug taxol affects microtubule structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alushin et al., 2014</xref>). By showing that the β:T238A mutation weakens the coupling between the conformational and nucleotide cycles, our results demonstrate that catastrophe can occur despite diminished post-GTPase conformational changes in the microtubule lattice, and that the strength of the allosteric response to GDP dictates the rate of microtubule shrinking and the frequency of microtubule catastrophe.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10113.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>αβ-tubulin containing a buried mutation in β-tubulin gives hyperstable microtubules in vivo and in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Superposition of polymerized (‘straight’, green, PDB 1JFF) and unpolymerized (‘curved’, blue, PDB 4FFB) conformations of β-tubulin.

We were unable to measure mutant and wild-type microtubule dynamics at equivalent concentrations, because β:T238A αβ-tubulin showed abundant spontaneous nucleation at the higher concentrations where we measured wild-type, and wild-type αβ-tubulin does not elongate measurably at the low concentrations where we were able to measure β:T238A dynamics without excessive nucleation. Mutant and wild-type microtubules nevertheless show similar concentration-dependent elongation rates: fitting lines to mutant and wild-type data reveals that the x-intercepts of the two datasets (0.12 and 0.033 µM for wild-type and β:T238A, respectively) differ by a factor of ∼3.5 and that the difference in slope (29.6 and 25.5 µm/hr/µM for wild-type and β:T238A, respectively) is not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Because the x-intercept and slope respectively relate to the apparent affinity and association rate constant for elongation, our data indicate that the mutation has little effect on the apparent biochemistry of microtubule elongation. Consistent with this biochemical similarity, negative stain electron microscopy revealed that mutant and wild-type microtubules show similar structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In striking contrast to the shared elongation behavior, after catastrophe β:T238A microtubules shrink roughly hundredfold more slowly than wild-type (1.1 µm/min for β:T238A compared to 96 µm/min for wild-type, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, bottom). Thus, the mutation significantly strengthens the lattice contacts that dictate the rate of microtubule shrinking. Finally, β:T238A microtubules also undergo catastrophe much less frequently than wild-type. The lower catastrophe frequency we observed is especially notable when considering that in these assays the T238A microtubules were growing much slower than wild-type because of the ∼threefold lower concentration of αβ-tubulin used for the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, top).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mutant-induced changes in polymerization dynamics do not result from defective GTPase activity</title><p>The β:T238A mutation stimulated spontaneous nucleation and reduced the frequency of catastrophe and the rate of shrinking, all without substantially affecting elongation. It seemed possible that a defective GTPase cycle might explain these observations. We reasoned that if the increased spontaneous nucleation of the β:T238A mutant resulted from slower/defective GTPase activity, then both mutant and wild-type should nucleate with similar efficiency when GTP hydrolysis cannot occur. We initially attempted to use GMPCPP, the hydrolysis-resistant nucleotide of choice for vertebrate microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hyman et al., 1992</xref>), but GMPCPP did not support elongation of yeast microtubules in our dynamics assays. Yeast microtubules polymerized readily in the presence of GTPγS, however, indicating that GTPγS better mimics GTP for yeast microtubules. We observed that even in the presence of GTPγS, wild-type microtubules show substantially less nucleation than T238A microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Thus, the abundant nucleation from the mutant cannot be ascribed to a defect in GTPase activity. Instead, the mutation must be affecting some other property that limits spontaneous nucleation in wild-type αβ-tubulin.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10113.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>T238A αβ-tubulin undergoes spontaneous nucleation more readily than WT, even in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, GTPγS.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fluorescent images of crosslinked microtubules from spontaneous nucleation reactions.

We allowed wild-type and β:T238A αβ-tubulin to spontaneously polymerize at 1 or 2 µM concentration (within the range of concentrations tested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) in the presence of <sup>32</sup>P-GTP. We harvested the microtubules by centrifugation, denatured them to release bound nucleotides, and analyzed the nucleotide content at the exchangeable site using thin layer chromatography (TLC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). We probed for a GTPase defect using α-labeled nucleotide to measure the amounts of GTP and GDP in microtubules, and for a phosphate release defect using γ-labeled nucleotide to measure the amounts of GTP and Pi in microtubules. To avoid possible complications that might arise from the very different catastrophe frequencies and shrinking rates, we initially performed these assays under ‘catastrophe free’ and slow shrinking conditions by using (unlabeled) GTPγS to support assembly. These experiments revealed that wild-type and mutant microtubules contain similarly low amounts of GTP (2–4% of total exchangeable nucleotide) and Pi (fewer than 3% of exchangeable sites) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). When we performed these assays using (unlabeled) GTP to support microtubule assembly, β:T238A microtubules contained similarly low amounts of GTP and Pi as we observed with GTPγS but wild-type microtubules appeared to contain a substantially greater amount (∼50%) of GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Yeast microtubules have previously been reported to contain more GTP than vertebrate microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dougherty et al., 1998</xref>). In control experiments (not shown) we confirmed that vertebrate microtubules contain very little GTP and that individual heterodimers were not pelleting. Because we observed very fast shrinking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), little <sup>32</sup>P-GTP in microtubules grown with GTPγS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and normal plus-end recognition by an EB1 family protein (see below), it seems unlikely that wild-type yeast microtubules contain substantial amounts of GTP. The GTP containing material in our assay might instead reflect oligomers that form more readily for yeast αβ-tubulin. Whatever the mechanism, these experiments demonstrate that β:T238A αβ-tubulin remains competent to hydrolyze GTP, and that the altered nucleation and shrinking behavior cannot be ascribed to an accumulation of GTP or GDP.Pi that might result from a defect in assembly-dependent GTPase activity or phosphate release. Some other, nonenzymatic mechanism must therefore account for the observed changes in polymerization dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The buried T238A mutation in β-tubulin does not detectably ‘straighten’ unoligomerized αβ-tubulin</title><p>Unoligomerized GTP-bound αβ-tubulin adopts a curved conformation that is not compatible with the straight microtubule lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nawrotek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pecqueur et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ayaz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2014</xref>). It seemed possible that the β:T238A mutation might stabilize microtubules by shifting the conformational preference of unpolymerized αβ-tubulin to favor a straight(er) conformation that is more compatible with the microtubule lattice. We used quantitative TOG binding assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ayaz et al., 2014</xref>) to determine if the β:T238A mutation changed the ‘curvature’ of unpolymerized αβ-tubulin. The rationale for this approach is based on the fact that TOG domains bind tightly to curved αβ-tubulin but very weakly to straight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ayaz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2014</xref> ). Accordingly, β:T238A αβ-tubulin should bind less tightly to a TOG domain if the β:T238A mutation appreciably changes the conformation of αβ-tubulin, for example by straightening it. TOG1 and TOG2, two different TOG domains from the yeast microtubule regulatory factor Stu2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang and Huffaker, 1997</xref>), show very similar affinity (within a factor of two) for unpolymerized T238A αβ-tubulin as they do for wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In energetic terms, this modest difference in affinity is roughly equivalent to one hydrogen bond. While we cannot state that the mutant and wild-type αβ-tubulin adopt identical conformations, their very similar TOG binding properties indicate that any differences in conformation must be small. Thus, we conclude that the β:T238A mutation does not significantly change the conformation of unpolymerized αβ-tubulin.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10113.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The buried β:T238A does not appreciably straighten unpolymerized αβ-tubulin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon schematics illustrating that TOG domains (blue) bind tightly to curved αβ-tubulin (pink and green; left) but weakly to straight αβ-tubulin (right).

We therefore infer that like other EB1 proteins on vertebrate microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zanic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maurer et al., 2011</xref>), Bim1 discriminates between GTP and GDP forms of the yeast microtubule lattice (presumably, expanded and compacted). In marked contrast to its behavior on wild-type microtubules, at 50 nM concentration Bim1-GFP coated the entire length of ‘dynamic’ β:T238A microtubules with cap-like intensity. At lower concentrations (5 nM), the Bim1-GFP coat on the body of β:T238A microtubules is slightly weaker than at the cap but still substantially more intense than on wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This stronger coating reflects tighter Bim1 binding to mutant microtubules, and it occurs in spite of the fact that the mutant microtubules contain very little GTP or GDP.Pi in the exchangeable site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, the β:T238A mutation attenuates the conformational response to GTP hydrolysis in the microtubule lattice.

After fortuitously discovering that isolated TOG domains from the microtubule polymerase Stu2p stimulate the depolymerization of stabilized microtubules in a dose-dependent way, it seemed that TOG domains might provide an alternative way to probe the conformation of αβ-tubulin on the microtubule end. In light of the fact these TOG domains bind preferentially to the curved conformation of αβ-tubulin, we reasoned that the underlying cause of this induced depolymerization was TOG-mediated stabilization of the curved and faster dissociating conformation of αβ-tubulin on the microtubule end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

It is not consistent with a mechanism in which the rate-limiting step is some kind of slow αβ-tubulin conformational change.

Differences in the amount of curved αβ-tubulin at wild-type and mutant microtubule ends could explain the observed differences in TOG-induced shrinking. In principle there might be other mechanisms that strengthen association without affecting the propensity to be curved on the microtubule end. However, while such ‘curvature invariant’ mechanisms in αβ-tubulin might explain the slow post-catastrophe shrinking of the mutant, the conformation-selective nature of TOG:tubulin interactions means that this alternative view is not easily reconciled with the observed differences in TOG-induced depolymerization. Thus, a mutant-induced change in the propensity to become/remain straight on the microtubule end is the simplest way to explain both the slower post-catastrophe shrinking and weaker TOG-induced depolymerization for the mutant.

The different responses of yeast and vertebrate microtubules to GMPCPP, and the lack of high-resolution structures for wild-type or mutant yeast microtubules, make it difficult to know the specific conformations involved and how they relate to the nucleotide cycle. However, the stronger binding of Bim1 to GDP-containing β:T238A microtubules indicates that the mutant microtubule lattice retains more GTP-like character than does wild-type. This observation about αβ-tubulin in the body of the microtubule cannot by itself explain the slow shrinking, however, because the rate of shrinking is determined by the properties of incompletely surrounded terminal subunits, on which EB1 does not report. Indeed, understanding how different lattice structures relate to dynamic properties of microtubules remains a significant challenge. Our experiments with TOG domains indirectly probed the conformation of terminal subunits and showed that the β:T238A mutation reduces the propensity of terminal αβ-tubulins to be curved. Thus, the slow shrinking and lower frequency of catastrophe in the mutant most likely result from the attenuated allosteric response to GDP; this in turn results in a straighter and more strongly associated GTP-like conformation on the microtubule end, despite having GDP at the longitudinal interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p>It is remarkable that the majority of the mutation-induced effects are confined to post-GTPase conformational changes in the lattice. Not observing significant effects on elongation is somewhat surprising, because it had been anticipated that the conformational changes required to enter the lattice would contribute to polymerization dynamics by opposing incorporation into the lattice. The lack of substantial change in the observed concentration-dependence of elongation rates could indicate that the β:T238A mutations do not affect the propensity for αβ-tubulin to ‘straighten’ on a GTP lattice. However, this is not consistent with increased spontaneous nucleation of β:T238A αβ-tubulin in the presence of GTPγS, which indicated that the mutation did affect conformational transitions that occur in/on a GTP lattice. It could be that we did not observe substantial effects on elongation because the energetics of curved to straight transitions on the microtubule end are not rate-contributing for elongation, perhaps because these transitions occur subsequent to end binding.</p><p>The significant mutant-induced structural changes in the lattice were not accompanied by equivalent changes in the conformation of unoligomerized αβ-tubulin. The differential response to the mutation inside and outside of microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>) is consistent with the view that the curved conformation represents the ‘ground state’ of αβ-tubulin independent of nucleotide state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rice et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nawrotek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pecqueur et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ayaz et al., 2012</xref>), that the nucleotide acts across the longitudinal interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rice et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nawrotek et al., 2011</xref>), and that nucleotide-dependent interactions with the microtubule lattice are what drive αβ-tubulin conformational transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rice et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nawrotek et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, the changes we observed can largely be explained by an impaired allosteric response to GDP in the lattice. It will be interesting to discover in future work if other mutations in β-tubulin can straighten unpolymerized αβ-tubulin or modulate the allosteric response(s) to nucleotide in the lattice, and to determine if mutations in α-tubulin can yield similar effects.</p><p>In summary, we showed that buried mutations of or near β:T238 alter the allosteric response to GDP in the microtubule lattice, with dramatic consequences for catastrophe frequency and shrinking rate. By describing microtubules with identical interface composition that nevertheless undergo strikingly different polymerization dynamics, our data demonstrate that allostery in the lattice dictates functionally important aspects of microtubule polymerization dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Based on the central role of allostery in controlling the frequency of catastrophe and the rate of shrinking, we speculate that cooperative conformational linkage in the lattice amplifies the individual response to nucleotide. Together, the allosteric response to GDP and the intrinsic bias of αβ-tubulin toward the curved conformation elevate and separate the threshold concentrations for persistent elongation and for spontaneous nucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), and underlie the fast shrinking rate that makes catastrophe more decisive. These allosteric contributions to microtubule dynamics make microtubules more amenable to regulation by cellular factors that enhance elongation, trigger catastrophe, and promote nucleation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Plasmids to express TOG1, TOG2 and wild-type yeast αβ-tubulin were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ayaz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2014</xref>).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor), a guest Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes the characterization of a T238A mutation in beta-tubulin of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. In mutant cells, the microtubules are highly stabilized, and the purified mutant tubulin forms microtubules that depolymerize very slowly. The authors also determine that subsequent to polymerization, GTP is however hydrolyzed by mutant tubulin more efficiently than in microtubules polymerized from wild type tubulin. Surprisingly, EB1 decoration is not restricted to the microtubule end, suggesting that the conformational change in response to GTP hydrolysis in this mutant is different from that in normal microtubules. Similar behavior is observed for another mutation in helix 7 of beta-tubulin, consistent with prior reports (e.g. Alushin et al, 2014) that this helix is involved in the conformational changes in tubulin following hydrolysis of GTP. This is the first thorough in vitro characterization of a mutation in tubulin that uncouples GTPase cycle reactions from a conformational transition.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Although the majority of reviewers found this study very interesting and significant, some concerns were raised regarding the mechanistic insight, the way the manuscript presents its major conclusions and some technical issues of the assays as presented. These issues need to be addressed and are listed below.</p><p>Specific points of major criticism:</p><p>I) Presentation of conclusions: In its generality the novelty of the observed uncoupling of GTPase transitions and allosteric conformational changes appeared somewhat exaggerated given that drugs like taxol are well known to cause such uncoupling; this should be acknowledged and the conclusions stated more precisely. At times observations were not clearly separated from interpretations (TOG binding–conformational changes); more precise language is encouraged throughout. At times relevant literature was not acknowledged: high GTP content in yeast tubulin: Dougherty et al, Biochemistry 37, 1998, p. 10861; importance of the H7 helix for microtubule stability: Amos, Org Biomol Chem 2, 2004, p. 2153.</p><p>II) Technical quality/support of conclusions by the data: Several technical concerns have been identified that require additional experiments:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> – TOG binding curves. The quality of the assay was not considered sufficient (large errors, saturation not reached) to support the strong statement that the mutant does not change TOG binding, leading to the interpretation that it does not change the conformation of unpolymerised tubulin. Additional data points need to be collected to bring the errors down to support such a strong statement convincingly.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> – Bim1 end tracking: More example of images or kymographs of Bim1 end tracking on wildtype and mutant microtubules should be shown to demonstrate how 'typical' behavior looks like under the conditions used. Bim1 binding to mutant microtubules is only shown for one Bim1 concentration. Therefore, it remains unclear if simply the overall affinity of Bim1 for microtubule binding is increased or if indeed the relative accumulation at microtubule ends compared to the lattice is reduced/is now absent (as the authors conclude). Experiments with different Bim1 concentrations are needed to distinguish between these two possibilities (effect on overall affinity versus end binding selectivity).</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> – depolymerization of mutant microtubules by TOG: Technical concerns regarding the assay conditions have been raised. It was considered possible that the strong depolymerization activity of TOG could maybe be a consequence of artefacts due to singlet oxygen generation by ReAsH in the absence of reducing agents/strong oxygen scavenging system. The possibility of such effects should be excluded experimentally (changing overall fluorescence excitation conditions, adding oxygen scavengers, or changing fluorophore).</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> – dependence of growth velocities on tubulin concentration: the data for mutant versus wildtype microtubules have been collected in very different tubulin concentration regimes (due to the strong nucleation of mutant tubulin). So the strong conclusion that this dependence is identical for both types of microtubules relies on how reliably the individual curves can be extrapolated into the other regime/how big the errors of the fits are. These errors should be examined in more detail. Ideally, an attempt should be made to collect data points for wildtype microtubules close to its critical concentration using a recently published method (Wieczorek et al., Nat Cell Biol 17, 2015, p. 907).</p><p>5) One reviewer felt strongly that simple negative stain EM should be performed to demonstrate that the microtubule structure appears normal for mutant microtubules. Abnormalities not visible by fluorescence microscopy can then be excluded. This would set the standard for other future studies with mutant tubulins.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A mutation uncouples the tubulin conformational and GTPase cycles, revealing allosteric control of microtubule dynamics&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor) and a guest Reviewing editor. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below.</p><p>Most major points of criticism have been addressed satisfactorily by additional experiments and the presentation has been improved. At several instances however the clarity of presentation would still profit from further improvement and one essential control experiment is missing:</p><p>I) Missing control experiment:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: The new data clearly strengthen the manuscript. The schemes and the language used here continue to suggest that the GTPgS lattice is identical to the mutant lattice. However, the new data demonstrate that there is a difference between the mutant GDP microtubule body and the GTP end. This may well indicate that there may also be a difference between the mutant GDP body and the GTPgS body (GTPgS being potentially more similar to the end than to the mutant body). A control experiment with 5 nM Bim1 on GTPgS microtubules is missing.

These issues need to be addressed and are listed below.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate that the reviewers found our work to be interesting and significant. In brief we have tuned and tightened the language throughout, and we have added new data and/or panels to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, and 5. The revised manuscript is stronger and clearer, and substantively addresses all of the concerns articulated in the decision letter.</p><p><italic>Specific points of major criticism: I) Presentation of conclusions: In its generality the novelty of the observed uncoupling of GTPase transitions and allosteric conformational changes appeared somewhat exaggerated given that drugs like taxol are well known to cause such uncoupling; this should be acknowledged and the conclusions stated more precisely. At times observations were not clearly separated from interpretations (TOG binding–conformational changes); more precise language is encouraged throughout. At times relevant literature was not acknowledged: high GTP content in yeast tubulin: Dougherty et al, Biochemistry 37, 1998, p. 10861; importance of the H7 helix for microtubule stability: Amos, Org Biomol Chem 2, 2004, p. 2153.</italic> </p><p>We completely agree that small molecules such as taxol are already known to uncouple the GTPase and conformational cycles, and we did not intend to appear to lay claim to having discovered this for the first time. We have changed the Abstract, Introduction, Results, and Discussion sections to be clearer and more precise about what is different and novel in our work.</p><p>We have also added the suggested citations and also tightened the language throughout.</p><p><italic>II) Technical quality/support of conclusions by the data: Several technical concerns have been identified that require additional experiments: 1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> – TOG binding curves. The quality of the assay was not considered sufficient (large errors, saturation not reached) to support the strong statement that the mutant does not change TOG binding, leading to the interpretation that it does not change the conformation of unpolymerised tubulin. Additional data points need to be collected to bring the errors down to support such a strong statement convincingly.</italic> </p><p>We have collected additional data points for the TOG2 titration, which slightly increased the fitted affinity and slightly decreased its error range. Lack of saturation was not a factor. A simple thought experiment will illuminate why these data are sufficient to support an argument that the mutation does not lead to substantial change in αβ−tubulin curvature. Based on our measurements, TOG domains bind approximately 2-fold tighter to β:T238A αβ-tubulin than they do to wild-type. A 2-fold difference in binding constant is equivalent to about 0.7 kT of binding energy – this is a similar order of magnitude as one hydrogen bond, and therefore hard to square with a substantial conformational rearrangement in the mutant. We can also estimate the order of magnitude change in binding affinity we might expect for curved vs straight αβ-tubulin. ~100 nM affinity corresponds to about 16 kT of total binding energy. TOG domains contact both α- and β- tubulin when binding to curved αβ-tubulin, but in straight αβ-tubulin TOG domains cannot maintain both contacts simultaneously. Making a simplifying assumption that about half of the binding energy (8 kT) will be lost for the straight conformation would correspond to ~3000-fold weaker binding, an estimate that is consistent with the fact that we have not observed significant binding of TOGs to microtubules or detectable binding to αβ-tubulin by a ‘half-site’ TOG1 mutant (R200A). Thus, the fitted affinities and their associated errors are not consistent with the idea that there is a substantial mutation-induced change in TOG binding affinity, and this in turn supports our claim that the conformation of the mutant cannot be very different than that of the wild-type. We feel that this is especially so given that we readily detected a change in Bim1 binding affinity for the body of mutant microtubules, and that we also observed a nearly two order of magnitude change in depolymerization rate, all with only small detectable changes in the apparent biochemistry of elongation.</p><p>In the original submission, we had tried to be careful throughout the manuscript to state that the mutant did not detectably change the conformation of unpolymerized αβ-tubulin. In the revised manuscript we have maintained the use of qualifiers to indicate the lack of complete certainty (which would likely require structures of mutant and wild-type αβ- tubulin, and more) while also re-working the discussion surrounding these data to include some of the arguments from the prior paragraph. We appreciate the chance to clarify these issues.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> – Bim1 end tracking: More example of images or kymographs of Bim1 end tracking on wildtype and mutant microtubules should be shown to demonstrate how 'typical' behavior looks like under the conditions used.</italic> </p><p>We have now included more images of Bim1 end tracking on wild-type and mutant microtubules (4 for each condition as opposed to 1 previously; we also added two new conditions, see below).</p><p><italic>Bim1 binding to mutant microtubules is only shown for one Bim1 concentration. Therefore, it remains unclear if simply the overall affinity of Bim1 for microtubule binding is increased or if indeed the relative accumulation at microtubule ends compared to the lattice is reduced/is now absent (as the authors conclude). Experiments with different Bim1 concentrations are needed to distinguish between these two possibilities (effect on overall affinity versus end binding selectivity).</italic> </p><p>This comment raises interesting ideas about the microtubule cap. We have performed additional experiments in response to it. In our initial submission the Bim1 binding clearly showed that the body of mutant microtubules presents higher-affinity Bim1 binding sites than does the body of wild-type microtubules. This comment asks us to determine if the same is true in the cap region. New experiments using 5 nM Bim1 (10-fold lower concentration than in the original submission) show that (i) the Bim1 intensity in the cap is comparable for mutant and wild-type microtubules, suggesting that wild-type and mutant caps present Bim1 binding sites of comparable affinity, (ii) the Bim1 intensity on the body of mutant microtubules is significantly higher than on the body of wild-type microtubules, consistent with our proposal that αβ-tubulin adopts a more expanded conformation in β:T238A microtubules, and (iii) we see ‘comets’ on the end of mutant microtubules, indicating that Bim1 binds more tightly to the ends of mutant microtubules than to the body.</p><p>Our bottom-line conclusion that β:T238A αβ-tubulin adopts a more expanded, GTP-like conformation in a GDP lattice remains unchanged. However, by showing that Bim1 binds to mutant microtubule caps more tightly than to mutant microtubule bodies, the new data now make it very clear that the mutation does not completely override the nucleotide effect. We have modified the Discussion to reflect these new findings, including substituting ‘suppress’ for more absolute words like ‘eliminate’. In our view these new data and associated discussion strengthen the manuscript, and we are grateful for the push to do these experiments.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> – depolymerization of mutant microtubules by TOG: Technical concerns regarding the assay conditions have been raised. It was considered possible that the strong depolymerization activity of TOG could maybe be a consequence of artefacts due to singlet oxygen generation by ReAsH in the absence of reducing agents/strong oxygen scavenging system. The possibility of such effects should be excluded experimentally (changing overall fluorescence excitation conditions, adding oxygen scavengers, or changing fluorophore).</italic> </p><p>The assays reported in our initial submission did in fact include a strong oxygen scavenging system (Glucose oxidase + catalase), but we can see how this might have been overlooked because we lumped them into the phrase ‘antifade reagents’. We now mention these reagents explicitly, and we also performed two kinds of control experiments to rule out the possibility of a non-specific origin of the effects we observed. First, we monitored the rate of TOG-induced shrinking using differential interference contrast microscopy at two different TOG concentrations and without any fluorescent labels. These experiments gave microtubule shrinking rates consistent with what we initially reported. Second, using the ReAsH labeled microtubules, we performed experiments using a TOG domain containing a mutation that greatly reduces tubulinbinding affinity. These experiments revealed greatly reduced rates of TOG-induced shrinking. These new data have been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>. Together, they rule out the possibility that the TOG-induced depolymerization was an artifact.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> – dependence of growth velocities on tubulin concentration: the data for mutant versus wildtype microtubules have been collected in very different tubulin concentration regimes (due to the strong nucleation of mutant tubulin). So the strong conclusion that this dependence is identical for both types of microtubules relies on how reliably the individual curves can be extrapolated into the other regime/how big the errors of the fits are. These errors should be examined in more detail. Ideally, an attempt should be made to collect data points for wildtype microtubules close to its critical concentration using a recently published method (Wieczorek et al., Nat Cell Biol 17, 2015, p. 907).</italic> </p><p>We had examined the fitting errors but somehow managed to not include this in the manuscript. We have now corrected this oversight by including the fitting errors and by discussing them when we are comparing the slopes and intercepts of the two fitted lines. To minimize the ‘distance’ of extrapolation, we also obtained an additional data point for wild-type αβ-tubulin using the Wieczorek/Brouhard method. We apologize for not including and discussing fitting errors in our initial submission.</p><p><italic>5) One reviewer felt strongly that simple negative stain EM should be performed to demonstrate that the microtubule structure appears normal for mutant microtubules. Abnormalities not visible by fluorescence microscopy can then be excluded. This would set the standard for other future studies with mutant tubulins.</italic></p><p>We have now included negative stain EM images showing that wild-type and β:T238A microtubules display similar structure.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>I) Missing control experiment: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: The new data clearly strengthen the manuscript. The schemes and the language used here continue to suggest that the GTPgS lattice is identical to the mutant lattice. However, the new data demonstrate that there is a difference between the mutant GDP microtubule body and the GTP end. This may well indicate that there may also be a difference between the mutant GDP body and the GTPgS body (GTPgS being potentially more similar to the end than to the mutant body). A control experiment with 5 nM Bim1 on GTPgS microtubules is missing. The result of this experiment might require the authors to modify the scheme and adopt a more differentiated view about the microtubule lattice conformations of wt, mutant and GTPgS microtubules.</italic> </p><p>We had chosen to focus on the differential conformational response to GDP, so we did not perceive the 5 nM Bim1 on GTPgS microtubules as a missing control because GTPgS microtubules have uniform nucleotide state. We now show those data in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and they document the expected result that Bim1 coats the body of GTPgS microtubules with similar intensity as it does the tip. To avoid conveying an impression that the mutant lattice is identical to a GTP/GTPgS lattice, we have made changes to the language throughout the paper (see also our response to the next point).</p><p><italic>II) Presentation: 1) Abstract and text: The language of the authors continues to imply complete uncoupling between GTPase reaction and conformational changes, although the new Bim1 data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> demonstrate that there is clearly a conformational change in the mutant in response to GTPase, however at a reduced level as compared to wild type.

For the same reason, the claim made in the Abstract that &quot;post-GTPase conformational changes are not strictly required for catastrophe&quot; does not appear to be supported by the new data and it is recommended to adjust language.</italic> </p><p>In the revised text we submitted we had inserted a number of qualifying statements in an effort to not portray the ‘uncoupling’ in a black and white manner. We have now done even more of that, adopting phrasing that is closer to the biochemical finding (e.g. stronger Bim1 binding, GTP-lattice-like character) in order to avoid too many statements about specific conformations (expanded/compacted). We also modified the ‘strictly required’ sentence in the Abstract, which we should have done the first time around. Thanks for catching that, and apologies for missing it.</p><p> <italic>2) Yeast strains: The genotypes of the strains used for the tubulin productions and live cell microscopy experiments should be stated (Methods, Legends and/or Table).</italic> </p><p>Strain genotypes have been added as a separate section in the Methods.</p><p> <italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: The number of observed events used for the quantifications does not appear to be stated.

Some of the interpretations might need refinement.</italic></p><p>Two factors make it difficult to draw direct comparisons between our results and the three lattice structures recently described by Eva Nogales and colleagues. First, we don’t yet have high-resolution structures for wild-type or mutant yeast microtubules, so we can’t know exactly which conformations are involved. Second, yeast microtubules assemble readily using GTPgS but less so with GMPCPP, whereas the opposite is true for vertebrate microtubules – GTPgS may therefore be promoting different states for the two kinds of microtubules. These factors limit our ability to make detailed structural interpretations, and as mentioned above we have made changes to our language to try to make this clear. Nevertheless, the different Bim1 binding properties of wild-type and mutant microtubules provide strong support for the idea that the mutant retains significant GTP-lattice-like character in a GDP lattice. Encouraging more explanation around these ideas was a good suggestion, and we have added a few sentences along the lines of the above to the end of the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article> </article>
