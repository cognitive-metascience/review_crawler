Electron microscopy studies further reveal high levels of transcytosis in brain endothelium early in development that are suppressed later. The timing of this suppression of transcytosis coincides with the establishment of BBB function. Finally, we demonstrate a key mammalian BBB regulator Mfsd2a, which inhibits transcytosis, plays a conserved role in zebrafish, as <italic>mfsd2aa</italic> mutants display increased BBB permeability due to increased transcytosis. Our findings indicate a conserved developmental program of barrier acquisition between zebrafish and mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>blood-brain barrier</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd><kwd>cerebral vasculature</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Brown</surname><given-names>Natasha M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006592</institution-id><institution>Fidelity Biosciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gu</surname><given-names>Chenghua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Institutes of Health Director's Pioneer Award DP1 NS092473</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gu</surname><given-names>Chenghua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006691</institution-id><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Mahoney Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Brown</surname><given-names>Natasha M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The zebrafish has been established as a genetic and molecular model for the blood-brain barrier.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Blood vessels in the vertebrate brain are composed of a single layer of endothelial cells that possess distinct functional properties that allow the passage of necessary nutrients yet prevent unwanted entry of specific toxins and pathogens into the brain. This specialized endothelial layer forms the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and restricts the passage of substances between the blood and the brain parenchyma via two primary mechanisms: 1) specialized tight junction complexes between apposed endothelial cells to prevent intercellular transit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reese and Karnovsky, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brightman and Reese, 1969</xref>) and 2) suppressing vesicular trafficking or transcytosis to prevent transcellular transit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ben-Zvi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andreone et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chow and Gu, 2017</xref>). BBB selectivity is further refined with the expression of substrate-specific transporters that dynamically regulate the influx of necessary nutrients and efflux of metabolic waste products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sanchez-Covarrubias et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Umans et al., 2017</xref>). While the BBB is comprised of endothelial cells, the surrounding perivascular cells including pericytes and astroglial cells, play a critical role in forming and maintaining barrier properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Janzer and Raff, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Armulik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daneman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Collectively, endothelial cells and the surrounding perivascular cells form the neurovascular unit.</p><p>As the simplest genetic model organism with an endothelial BBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jeong et al., 2008</xref>), zebrafish offer a powerful tool to study the cellular and molecular properties of the vertebrate BBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vanhollebeke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Umans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O'Brown et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Quiñonez-Silvero et al., 2019</xref>). Zebrafish have served as a great model system to study vascular biology due to their large clutch size, rapid and external development, and transparency for in vivo whole organism live-imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lawson and Weinstein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Santoro et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Armer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Herbert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Phng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Geudens et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Herbert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wilkinson and van Eeden, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vanhollebeke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Matsuoka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ulrich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Venero Galanternik et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stratman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Geudens et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, with the advent of CRISPR-Cas9 technology, zebrafish provide an efficient genetic toolkit for targeted mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hwang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gagnon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ablain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Varshney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albadri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hogan and Schulte-Merker, 2017</xref>). However, the subcellular and molecular mechanisms governing the formation and maintenance of the zebrafish BBB are only beginning to be characterized. Expanding our understanding of the zebrafish BBB can thus reveal the mechanistic similarities between the zebrafish and mammalian BBB to further evaluate the position of zebrafish as a model organism for studying the BBB.</p><p>Barrier properties of brain endothelial cells are induced by extrinsic signals from other cells in the surrounding microenvironment during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stewart and Wiley, 1981</xref>). In rodents, the BBB becomes functionally sealed in a spatiotemporal gradient, with the hindbrain and midbrain barriers becoming functional before the cortical barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daneman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ben-Zvi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sohet et al., 2015</xref>). Within the cortex, barrier function is acquired along a ventral-lateral to dorsal-medial gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ben-Zvi et al., 2014</xref>). In the zebrafish, existing studies have disagreed over the timing of zebrafish barrier formation, with some suggesting that BBB maturation occurs concurrently with angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jeong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Umans et al., 2017</xref>) and others providing a wide range beginning at 3 dpf and extending to 10 dpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fleming et al., 2013</xref>). These conflicting reports may be due to regional developmental gradients of barrier acquisition, differences in definitions of BBB development, which range from functional tracer restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jeong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fleming et al., 2013</xref>) to gene expression of BBB-specific selective transporters, such as <italic>glut1b</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Umans et al., 2017</xref>), or variations in the experimental approaches used to assess BBB permeability such as the molecular weight and properties of tracers and circulation time. Therefore, we aim to resolve some of these discrepancies through detailed regional and subcellular characterizations of functional barrier acquisition in zebrafish.</p><p>Recent work in the mammalian blood-retinal barrier has indicated that the suppression of transcytosis governs functional barrier development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chow and Gu, 2017</xref>). Interestingly, endothelial cells at the leaky neonatal angiogenic front possess functional tight junction complexes halting the intercellular passage of the tracer protein Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) at the so-called ‘kissing points’. In contrast, these endothelial cells exhibit high levels of HRP-filled vesicles compared to functionally sealed proximal vessels. Moreover, these areas of elevated vesicular trafficking continue to correspond with barrier permeability at the angiogenic front until the barrier seals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chow and Gu, 2017</xref>). Work in the mouse BBB has also demonstrated the importance of suppressing transcytosis in determining barrier permeability. Mice lacking the major facilitator super family domain containing 2a (Mfsd2a) lipid transporter exhibit increased levels of caveolae vesicles in CNS endothelial cells, resulting in increased barrier permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ben-Zvi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Andreone et al., 2017</xref>). Whether this suppression of transcytosis also determines BBB function in zebrafish remains unknown.</p><p>Here in zebrafish, we find a spatiotemporal gradient of barrier acquisition, and capture the dynamics of BBB leakage as it matures during development using time lapse live imaging. We further find a conserved role for transcytosis suppression in determining barrier function, both during normal development and in <italic>mfsd2aa</italic> mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Posterior-anterior gradient of zebrafish BBB development</title><p>To determine when and how the zebrafish BBB becomes functional in different brain regions, we performed intracardiac injections of fluorescently conjugated tracers (1 kDa NHS and 10 kDa Dextran) simultaneously at different developmental stages and imaged live fish after 1 hr of tracer circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). NHS is widely used to assess mouse BBB permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sohet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chow and Gu, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O'Brown et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, NHS has been used successfully to assess junctional defects in occludin- and claudin-deficient animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Furuse et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nitta et al., 2003</xref>), and was previously shown to be restricted within the adult zebrafish cerebral vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jeong et al., 2008</xref>). We used a combination of different molecular weight tracers to tease apart potential avenues of leakage, as tight junctional defects result specifically in the leakage of low-molecular-weight tracers 1 kDa and below into the brain parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nitta et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Campbell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sohet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yanagida et al., 2017</xref>). To assess BBB permeability, we measured tracer fluorescence intensity in the brain parenchyma and normalized to circulating levels of each tracer, that is to the fluorescence intensity of tracer within brain blood vessels, to account for between fish variation in tracer injections or circulation (details in the Materials and methods section). At 3 dpf, we observed the presence of both NHS and Dextran throughout the brain parenchyma (average of 8.5 ± 0.3 Tracer Intensity in the midbrain and average of 7.4 ± 0.4 NHS and 5.5 ± 0.6 Dextran Intensity in the hindbrain; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These leakage assays revealed that the injected tracers were able to permeate into the brain parenchyma, suggesting that the BBB was not functionally sealed. In addition to the use of exogenous injected fluorescent tracers, we also assayed BBB permeability with an endogenous transgenic serum DBP-EGFP fusion protein (Tg(<italic>l-fabp:DBP-EGFP</italic>)) to account for injection artifacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xie et al., 2010</xref>). At 3 dpf, we observed similar leakage patterns with the transgenic serum protein as we did with the injected tracers (average of 8.9 ± 0.8 DBP-EGFP Intensity in the midbrain and average of 6.1 ± 0.4 DBP-EGFP Intensity in the hindbrain; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). At 4 dpf, we observed a significant decrease in tracer intensity in the hindbrain (average of 4.1 ± 0.2 NHS Intensity, 3.9 ± 0.4 Dextran Intensity and 4.0 ± 0.4 DBP-EGFP Intensity; p&lt;0.0001, p=0.0115 and p=0.0034 compared to 3 dpf for NHS, Dextran and DBP-EGFP by two-way ANOVA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, the midbrain barrier remains leaky (average of 7.6 ± 0.5 NHS Intensity, 7.5 ± 0.8 Dextran Intensity and 6.8 ± 0.9 DBP-EGFP Intensity; p=0.66, p=0.89 and p=0.079 compared to 3 dpf for NHS, Dextran and DBP-EGFP by two-way ANOVA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). At 5 dpf, the midbrain parenchymal tracer intensities are dramatically reduced (average of 3.3 ± 0.3 NHS Intensity, 3.6 ± 0.2 Dextran Intensity and 3.2 ± 0.3 DBP-EGFP Intensity; p&lt;0.0001, two-way ANOVA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>) and no significant changes were observed in the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). No significant change was observed in midbrain tracer uptake from 5 to 6 dpf or from 5 to 10 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>), indicating that the midbrain barrier becomes sealed at 5 dpf. Of note, all three tracers showed nearly indistinguishable patterns of uptake, with similar parenchymal tracer intensity levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that the leakage is not due to tight junctional defects but may rather be due to an increase in vesicular trafficking.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47326.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The midbrain BBB becomes functional at 5 dpf.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of the tracer leakage assay.

A key advantage of zebrafish is the ability to examine biological processes in vivo in real-time, providing us with the unique opportunity to observe the process of functional barrier maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To examine the developmental dynamics of barrier leakage, we injected larvae at 3 dpf with fluorescently labeled 10 kDa Dextran and performed time lapse live imaging for 1 hr following injection, with time 0 being an average of 8 min post-injection. We observed a gradual and diffuse increase in extravascular Dextran intensity over time within the brain parenchyma (slope of 0.13 intensity/minute; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, C and E</xref>).

Two min later, this same sprout released a second bolus of Dextran on the opposite side (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—Video 2</xref>).

While this particular fish displayed three of these bursting events, defined as parenchymal Dextran intensity increasing to luminal levels in less than 1 min, only two of the other five measured 3 dpf fish displayed any bursts within the hour post tracer injection, one from a sprouting tip cell and one from a stable vessel, further indicating the infrequency of these large bursts. Cumulatively, this time lapse data revealed two discrete types of leakage occurring during this early developmental stage: steady and diffuse Dextran leakage into the parenchyma that makes up the vast majority of observed leakage and rare large bursts of leakage.</p><p>When we performed these same time lapse experiments at 5 dpf, we observed significantly less overall tracer accumulation in the brain parenchyma over the course of the hour in addition to reduced rates of tracer accumulation (slope of 6.833e-6 intensity/sec; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video3">Figure 2—Video 3</xref>; p&lt;0.001, Mann-Whitney test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, D and E</xref>). Furthermore, 5 dpf fish never exhibited bursts of tracer leakage as observed at 3 dpf. These data suggest that at early stages, most tracer leakage occurs broadly through vessel walls via unrestricted transcytosis with an occasional transient rupture to endothelial integrity that leads to these large bursts of leakage. Once tracer is leaked into the intercellular space of the parenchyma it can be taken up by select parenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

All the blood vessels analyzed had a maximal diameter of 5 µm to enrich for capillaries and small veins. At 3 dpf, we found blood vessels in direct contact with neurons and pericytes, with the pericytes sharing the endothelial basement membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), as in the mammalian neurovascular unit. During this leaky developmental stage, the endothelial basement membrane was filled with the electron-dense gold nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>; turquoise arrowheads) with an average gold intensity of 1.29 ± 0.07 (luminal gold intensity normalized to 1.0; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), further demonstrating that the BBB is functionally immature at 3 dpf. To decipher how the gold nanoparticles traverse from the lumen to the basement membrane, we first looked at the tight junctions to see if the nanoparticles passed between apposed endothelial cells. We consistently observed that the nanoparticles were halted at the ‘kissing points’ between endothelial cells, indicating that tight junctions were functional prior to formation of a functional BBB (49/49 functional tight junctions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; green arrowhead). The presence of functional tight junctions at this stage is in agreement with the previously reported expression of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and Claudin-5 in cerebral blood vessels at 3 dpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jeong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xie et al., 2010</xref>).

Finally, to determine whether this increased permeability was due to increased transcytosis as in <italic>Mfsd2a</italic> knockout mice, we measured vesicular density in capillaries with luminal diameters less than 5 µm from adult mutant and wild-type siblings using TEM. The <italic>mfsd2aa</italic> mutant blood vessels appeared morphologically normal by TEM, composed of a thin single layer of endothelial cells in close contact with pericytes, as observed in their wild-type siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>).

We provide some of the first data on the dynamics of immature barrier leakage during early development and of barrier leakage seen in a genetic mutant fish at the time when the BBB should be functionally mature. At 3 dpf, we observed two types of leakage, the gradual overall increase in the parenchyma and rare transient bursts, both from a migrating sprout and established blood vessels. We attribute some of the gradual diffuse increase in parenchymal tracer uptake to the high levels of vesicular trafficking observed in our TEM analyses in which the endothelial basement membrane became filled with gold nanoparticles. Time lapse analysis of <italic>mfsd2aa</italic> mutants revealed similar diffuse tracer leakage levels and rates to that observed in the leaky 3 dpf larvae. Since <italic>mfsd2aa</italic> mutant fish have normal angiogenesis but elevated endothelial transcytosis levels, the Dextran leakage at 5 dpf, when their siblings have a functional BBB, provides a direct measure of the in vivo rates and mode of BBB leakage due to unsuppressed transcytosis. The rarer bursts of leakage, on the other hand, could be due to fleeting tight junctional ruptures between neighboring endothelial cells rather than increased vesicular trafficking. As these events were extremely scarce during our time lapse imaging, it would be nearly impossible to capture these potential junctional breaches by TEM to confirm this hypothesis. However, with continuing advances in the resolution of fluorescence microscopy, we could use zebrafish to resolve whether these two types of leakage, gradual and bursting, proceed through the same or different subcellular routes into the brain parenchyma, either paracellularly or transcellularly.</p><p>While the BBB constitutes the largest interface for blood-brain exchange in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nag and Begley, 2005</xref>), and represents the most well-studied cellular barrier, it is not the only brain barrier. The blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier is created by the polarized epithelial cells of the choroid plexus (CP) that projects directly into the brain ventricle and creates a barrier between the fenestrated capillaries of the CP and the CSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wolburg and Paulus, 2010</xref>). During development, these CP epithelial cells become selectively less permissive by expressing tight junction proteins, including Claudin-5 and Occludin, and nutrient transporters, including Mrp1, Mdr1 and Oat3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Henson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Leeuwen et al., 2018</xref>). In zebrafish, this blood-CSF barrier has been shown to become completely impermeable by 4 dpf to various molecular weight tracers including 3 kDa fluorescein, 10 kDa and 40 kDa Dextrans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Henson et al., 2014</xref>). However, while CP epithelial cells are initially permeable to 3 kDa fluorescein and 10 kDa Dextran at 2 dpf, they never allow the passage of the larger 40 kDa Dextran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Henson et al., 2014</xref>). Since we saw comparable BBB permeability for all tracers used during the developmental time course, including the 80 kDa DBP-EGFP serum transgene, this strongly suggests that the tracers entered the brain predominantly through leaky BBB vessels rather than through an immature blood-CSF barrier. The avascular arachnoid epithelium directly beneath the dura that completely ensheaths the CNS acts as a third barrier between the extracellular fluids of the CNS and the rest of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 2006</xref>). Previous HRP tracer injections have shown that the zebrafish arachnoid barrier matures after 9 dpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jeong et al., 2008</xref>). Since we did not observe any differences in tracer impermeability between 5 and 10 dpf, when the arachnoid barrier is still leaky, this suggests that the immature arachnoid barrier does not significantly contribute to the observed tracer extravasation into the brain earlier in development. Finally, the similarities between the observed amounts and dynamics of leakage in 3 dpf immature brains and <italic>mfsd2aa</italic> mutant brains at 5 dpf, which contain BBB-specific endothelial transcytosis defects, further suggests that the observed tracer leakage at 3 dpf is predominantly arising through the BBB. Taken together, while alternative routes for tracer entry into the brain exist, including an immature blood-CSF or arachnoid barrier, our methods allowed us to specifically evaluate BBB functionality, and other routes are not significantly contributing to the tracer leakage we observed in the larval brain.</p><p>Among the various clathrin-independent transcytotic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tuma and Hubbard, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sandvig et al., 2018</xref>), caveolae are particularly abundant in vascular endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frank et al., 2003</xref>).

Furthermore, the suppression of caveolae-mediated transcytosis regulates the development and function of both the mouse blood-retinal barrier and the BBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Andreone et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chow and Gu, 2017</xref>). Taken together, this suggests that the increased transcytosis during early larval stages is most likely caveolae-mediated. Interestingly, the linear profile of Dextran uptake in the midbrain at 3 dpf closely resembles the caveolae-mediated uptake of a fluorescently conjugated aminopeptidase P (APP) antibody in the mouse lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oh et al., 2007</xref>). While similarly linear, the scale is on the order of minutes in the larval zebrafish brain versus seconds in the mouse lung. This discrepancy in timing is most likely due to the large difference in the vesicular densities between the immature BBB endothelium (average of 2 vesicles/µm<sup>2</sup>) and the continuous endothelium of peripheral tissues, which ranges from 30 to 98 vesicles/µm<sup>2</sup> on the luminal membrane of diaphragm and myocardial endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Simionescu et al., 1974</xref>). Since loss of caveolin 1 (<italic>Cav1</italic>) is sufficient to precociously seal the mouse blood-retinal barrier at the angiogenic front (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chow and Gu, 2017</xref>), it would be interesting in future work to examine whether zebrafish <italic>cav1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cao et al., 2016</xref>), which are viable as homozygotes, also exhibit an earlier onset of BBB maturation.</p><p>BBB permeability is tightly regulated by endothelial cell interactions with pericytes and astroglial cells. For the first time, we visualized their locations under TEM in zebrafish throughout barrier development. Pericytes have been shown to be essential for establishing the mammalian BBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Armulik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daneman et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, pericyte-deficient notch3<sup>fh332</sup> fish display increased BBB permeability in a tight junction independent manner like pericyte-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Our TEM data show that zebrafish pericytes are in close contact with brain endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), even at the earliest stage examined (3 dpf; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and are embedded within the endothelial basement membrane as in mammals. Our subcellular localization data is in line with a growing body of evidence for the conserved role and molecular profile of pericytes in the zebrafish BBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ando et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vanlandewijck et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ando et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Taken together this study provides a thorough characterization of the development of the zebrafish BBB, highlighting regional differences in timing of functional maturation and capturing the dynamics of the immature BBB. Furthermore, our developmental TEM series demonstrates the role of vesicular trafficking in regulating zebrafish BBB function during development. We have also shown that this down-regulation of vesicular trafficking is necessary for functional BBB formation, as <italic>mfsd2aa</italic> mutants display increased barrier permeability due to unsuppressed transcytosis. Finally, our time lapse imaging of <italic>mfsd2aa</italic> mutants provides the first direct measure of tracer permeability in vivo that results from increased transcytosis. We hope that this work will serve as a launching pad for future studies using zebrafish to understand the molecular regulators of BBB development and homeostasis in vertebrates.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish strains and maintenance</title><p>Zebrafish were maintained at 28.5°C following standard protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Westerfield, 1993</xref>).

A 1200EX electron microscope (JOEL) equipped with a 2 k CCD digital camera (AMT) was used for all TEM studies. Images were visualized and quantified using ImageJ (NIH) and Adobe Photoshop.

For static images, parenchymal fluorescent tracer intensity was measured using ImageJ in the entire regional parenchyma outside of the vasculature in 30 µm thick maximum intensity projections of the larval brains.

These parenchymal tracer intensity values were then normalized to the tracer intensity within the vasculature to account for differential amounts of circulating tracer. For time lapse imaging, Dextran intensity was measured in 6 parenchymal regions of average intensity projections of the time lapse videos and averaged as a single value per fish.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a guest Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Benoit Vanhollebeke (Reviewer #1); Michael R Taylor (Reviewer #2); Kelly Monk (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All of the reviewers thought that the work was of potential interest, but that there were a number of major concerns that need to be addressed.</p><p>Based on the discussion the reviewers specific points included that: &quot;there were several concerns from all reviewers regarding interpretation of data and terminology that should be addressed both in the major and minor comments&quot; and &quot;a more careful job with the analysis of the new mutants they have generated is required.&quot; Furthermore, all reviewers agreed that counting cells with tracer as a proxy for BBB leakage was concerning as this could be a neural intrinsic feature and BBB-independent process, and that the dynamic range of this assay remains unclear as changing the molar amounts of tracer does not lead to changes in cell counts.</p><p>The authors should address each of the concerns raised by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This study by Brown et al. investigates BBB maturation in zebrafish larvae combining time-lapse confocal imaging of tracer extravasation, genetics and electron microscopy. By using different tracers, the authors assess the time-point at which developmental BBB maturity is reached in a spatiotemporal fashion. The decrease in leakage in the midbrain at 5 days post fertilization was further explored by TEM and shown to correlate with a decrease in intracellular transcytosis. The sealing of the blood brain barrier, correlating with a decrease in transcytosis, was further explored by studying the conserved function of Mfsd2a in this process.</p><p>The paper is of interest as it further documents the similarities between the zebrafish and the mammalian BBB structures. The TEM studies, combined with <italic>mfsd2aa</italic> mutants convincingly show that transcytosis suppression contributes to BBB maturation in zebrafish, as it does in the mouse.</p><p>The authors convincingly report two apparently independent tracer accumulation modes in the zebrafish larval brain. The first one, previously observed by other investigators, results in diffuse tracer accumulation across the parenchyma, follows near-linear kinetics and, in the context of this study, has been analyzed in the midbrain after at 3 and 5 dpf. The other mode is interesting as so far unreported and results in focal tracer accumulation secondary to perivascular &quot;bursts&quot; that can be captured by time-lapse confocal microscopy.</p><p>The authors propose that the steady and diffuse accumulation is secondary to transcytosis across the immature BBB endothelium and is controlled developmentally in the midbrain by <italic>mfsd2aa</italic>, while the other would result from sporadic vessel instability and uptake through what are referred to as &quot;parenchymal cells&quot;. The number of such tracer-filled cells is then quantified as a proxy for tracer leakage across the BBB to infer both BBB closure and asses genetic mutants.</p><p>While overall interesting and timely, some of the leakage assay methodology central to the message of this manuscript might suffer from technical caveats that could be addressed before publication.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>First. While the confocal time-lapse microscopy evidence is strong enough to support the idea that the perivascular bursts are secondary to leakage through the BBB endothelium, there is no direct evidence that the more distant focal accumulation, as well as the disuse accumulation throughout the parenchyma, results from leakage through the immature BBB. When dyes are injected in the zebrafish cardiovascular system, they can reach the brain parenchyma through multiple routes, with only one of them being the BBB. Jeong et al., 2008 reported that several mesencephalic vessels (that are not intraneural BBB vessels) are leaky at 3 dpf. These vessels are therefore a likely alternative tracer entry point to the nearby midbrain. Similarly, upon intracardial injection, tracers of any kind accumulate in the CSF within ventricular spaces, and could therefore reach the brain through the ependymal cell layer. The poorly characterized meningeal barriers (arachnoid, pia mater, glia limitans) constitute yet another portal to the brain. Of note, these latter were shown to close at much later stages (after 9 dpf) by Jeong et al., 2008. Therefore, tracer accumulation in the larval zebrafish brain does not necessarily imply leakage through the BBB. Of note, this challenge is particularly acute due the small size of the larval zebrafish brain, that in contrast to the mammalian structures, poorly allows for anatomical leakage inferences. Admittedly, addressing this issue experimentally is challenging and well beyond the scope of what can be achieved at the revision step of this particular study. In this reviewer's opinion, these anatomical considerations should however be carefully discussed by the authors as they impact directly several of the main conclusions of the manuscript.</p><p>Overall, we recommend rephrasing the manuscript in order to:</p><p>i) shift away from a BBB-centric view and give more space to the anatomical complexity of the multiple brain barriers. We would for instance suggest rephrasing the first section heading from (&quot;P-A gradient of zebrafish BBB development&quot; to &quot;P-A gradient of zebrafish brain barriers development&quot;).</p><p>ii) Importantly, avoid any firm causality inferences between BBB phenotypes (like the presence or absence of vesicular transport) and at distance tracer accumulation. For instance, in the Abstract the sentence &quot;Electron microscopy studies further reveal that this steady accumulation results from high levels of transcytosis that are eventually suppressed, sealing the BBB&quot; should be rephrased or removed. Of note, this is not to say that the authors shouldn't discuss on the developmental correlation of transcytosis suppression and reduced tracer accumulation in the Discussion section. Similarly, the HRP leakage in the adult <italic>mfsd2aa</italic> mutants are convincing.</p><p>Second. While this reviewer agrees that it seems reasonable that the focal tracer accumulation indeed reflects intracellular accumulation in &quot;scavenger &quot; parenchymal cells, the authors fail to present evidence to support this claim. When considering carefully the Videos 1 and 2, tracer extravasation and &quot;cellular&quot; accumulation appear as a synchronous and perhaps unique process, which is puzzling. Moreover, the still images and the video recording these sporadic bursts do not allow discriminating with the alternative scenario of focal accumulation in extracellular spaces, or labelling of apoptotic cells or cell debris. As the authors use these &quot;cells&quot; as a &quot;proxy of tracer leakage&quot;, this requires clarification. We suggest approaching this question by confocal imaging with counterstained nuclei and cell membranes.</p><p>Third. The authors propose a model in which unrestricted transcytosis triggers diffuse tracer accumulation, a process negatively regulated by <italic>mfsd2aa</italic> and quantified in WT animals in Figure 2E. Surprisingly, in <italic>mfsd2aa</italic> mutants, quantification of this mode of leakage was not performed. This is essential to support the model and should be performed.</p><p>Fourth. Instead, &quot;parenchymal cells&quot; were monitored (see comment #2). We were not convinced that monitoring the number of &quot;cells&quot; is predictive to leakage extent. It would only be so if (i) the total number of cells is high, stable during development and unaltered in genetic mutants and if (ii) the amount of substrate tracer is limiting so that the more tracer reaches the parenchyma, the more cells are detectable. None of these conditions seem established in light of the data presented. For instance, as the nature of the presumed cells is unknown, their total number (labeled or not) cannot be established and therefore different time points and genetic conditions cannot be compared (Figure 1D, Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Figure 4C, Figure 4—figure supplement 2, 3). How can the authors rule out that the total number of this presumptive cell type is not merely increased in <italic>mfsd2aa</italic> mutants? According to previous reports <italic>mfsd2aa</italic> is widely expressed throughout the zebrafish embryonic and larval brain. Similarly, how can the authors exclude that the number of these cells drops over time in the midbrain? Instead of counting &quot;cells&quot;, the mean intensity of the &quot;cells&quot; could be analyzed (alternatively, asses the parenchymal leak, see third comment). If transcytosis (or more broadly tracer leakage) is increased, the anticipated result is an increase in the average fluorescence intensity of cell-associated label (rather than an increase in the actual number of cells).</p><p>Assessing the number of cells as a readout for transcytosis seems moreover also puzzling from cellular standpoints. Indeed, at least some of these &quot;cells&quot; were shown to be filled secondary to sudden rupture of endothelial integrity (Figure 2E) and therefore would not be a faithful readout for transcytosis upregulation. Final sentence in subsection “Posterior-Anterior Gradient of Zebrafish BBB Development” are unclear in that respect as well. We would agree with the authors that tight junctional defects would likely exhibit size-selective leakage properties (although that remains to be shown in zebrafish). Consequently, the observed labelling of the &quot;parenchymal cells&quot; with tracers of all tested sizes suggest an alternative leakage mode is at play (if we assume this is secondary to BBB defects, see above).

Given the genetic tractability of zebrafish, the unparalleled ability to perform in vivo imaging, and the amenability to small molecule screens, zebrafish is an ideal vertebrate model system for BBB study. Previous work raised a controversy as to whether the BBB forms in zebrafish by 3 days of age (Jeong et al., 2008; Umans et al., 2017) or between 3-10 days of age (Fleming et al., 2013). It is critically important to resolve this controversy and to define how the BBB forms in zebrafish to set the stage for future mechanistic, genetic, and drug discovery studies. For example, one can imagine small molecule screens in zebrafish larvae to find compounds that selectively open the BBB for therapeutic drug delivery. Without fully understanding how the BBB forms in zebrafish, however, these studies cannot be performed. O'Brown et al. begin to tackle this important problem by thoroughly characterizing BBB formation in zebrafish between 3-6 days of age. Using tracer injections, live imaging, and electron microscopy, they show that the hindbrain BBB is closed by 3 days, whereas the midbrain closes between 3-5 days. This developmental gradient is similar to mouse. Given that the lipid transporter Mfsd2a is required for proper BBB formation in mammals, O'Brown and colleagues also generate and analyze new mfsd2a zebrafish mutants. Mutant analysis indicates that the function of Mfsd2a is conserved from zebrafish to mammals.</p><p>There are some minor experimental additions that could be performed to strengthen the study's conclusions and impact.</p><p>1) Given that antibodies to mark tight junctions exist that work in zebrafish, it would be useful to add this analysis to the time course of BBB formation.</p><p>2) Given the controversy surrounding the timing of BBB closure in zebrafish, it is important to extend the time course to 10 days to be consistent with the Fleming et al. study. Additionally, the hindbrain at 3 days shows ~2 cells/embryo taking up tracer whereas the authors consider the midbrain BBB closed at 5-6 days with ~8 cells/larva taking up tracer. Thus, it is important to test if the number of cells taking up tracer further reduces with time.</p><p>3) The standard in the field is to rescue a new mutant with wild-type gene product to control for off-target CRISPR/Cas9 effects. Similarly, qPCR for <italic>mfsd2aa</italic> and <italic>mfsd2ab</italic> are important controls for the new mutants, especially since phenotypes were not observed in <italic>mfsd2ab</italic> mutants.</p><p>4) Not performing in vivo imaging of the <italic>mfsd2aa</italic> mutants seems like a missed opportunity. Such investigation could also reveal if both types of leakage observed in the time course are affected in <italic>mfsd2aa</italic> mutants. The analysis presented in Figure 2E would also be helpful to show for the mutants.</p><p>Overall this is an important descriptive study for both zebrafish development and BBB fields that will be foundational for future work in many laboratories.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47326.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should address each of the concerns raised by the reviewers.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Overall, we recommend rephrasing the manuscript in order to:</p><p>i) shift away from a BBB-centric view and give more space to the anatomical complexity of the multiple brain barriers. We would for instance suggest rephrasing the first section heading from (&quot;P-A gradient of zebrafish BBB development&quot; to &quot;P-A gradient of zebrafish brain barriers development&quot;).</p><p>ii) Importantly, avoid any firm causality inferences between BBB phenotypes (like the presence or absence of vesicular transport) and at distance tracer accumulation. For instance, in the Abstract the sentence &quot;Electron microscopy studies further reveal that this steady accumulation results from high levels of transcytosis that are eventually suppressed, sealing the BBB&quot; should be rephrased or removed. Of note, this is not to say that the authors shouldn't discuss on the developmental correlation of transcytosis suppression and reduced tracer accumulation in the Discussion section. Similarly, the HRP leakage in the adult mfsd2aa mutants are convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his thoughtful remarks. We closely examined the literature about alternative routes into the brain during development and have added a paragraph to the discussion talking about the other brain barriers, their developmental timing and restrictiveness during development, as well as potential contribution to the leakage during early development. Based on this thorough literature review and our cumulative findings, we conclude that Figure 1 is mostly representing BBB leakage as discussed in subsection “Conserved Role of <italic>Mfsd2a</italic> in Determining BBB Function” as well as in the Discussion section. Overall, we have tempered our interpretations of the causality of tracer leakage between different experiments throughout the manuscript. For example, we have altered the referred to sentence in the Abstract to “Electron microscopy studies further reveal high levels of transcytosis in brain endothelium early in development that are suppressed later. The timing of this suppression of transcytosis coincides with the establishment of BBB function.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second. While this reviewer agrees that it seems reasonable that the focal tracer accumulation indeed reflects intracellular accumulation in &quot;scavenger &quot; parenchymal cells, the authors fail to present evidence to support this claim. When considering carefully the Videos 1 and 2, tracer extravasation and &quot;cellular&quot; accumulation appear as a synchronous and perhaps unique process, which is puzzling. Moreover, the still images and the video recording these sporadic bursts do not allow discriminating with the alternative scenario of focal accumulation in extracellular spaces, or labelling of apoptotic cells or cell debris. As the authors use these &quot;cells&quot; as a &quot;proxy of tracer leakage&quot;, this requires clarification. We suggest approaching this question by confocal imaging with counterstained nuclei and cell membranes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer, and also reviewer 2, that the “scavenger” parenchymal cells should be better characterized. In order to address these concerns, we have performed these same tracer leakage assays in membrane labelled fish and have observed both the diffuse accumulation in the extracellular spaces and the cellular accumulation within cell membranes and have included this data as a supplement (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). In addition, we have also performed these tracer leakage assays in nuclear labelled transgenic fish and have observed co-localization between the injected Dextran and the nuclear signal, further supporting that the injected tracers can be taken up by “scavenger” parenchymal cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third. The authors propose a model in which unrestricted transcytosis triggers diffuse tracer accumulation, a process negatively regulated by mfsd2aa and quantified in WT animals in Figure 2E. Surprisingly, in mfsd2aa mutants, quantification of this mode of leakage was not performed. This is essential to support the model and should be performed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and wholeheartedly agree that this is a crucial experiment to support the notion of increased transcytosis altering BBB leakage. We have performed the suggested time lapse leakage assays in <italic>mfsd2aa</italic> mutant and heterozygote control fish to observe the dynamics of leakage in a system with BBB-specific increased transcytosis. We observed similar diffuse leakage into the brain parenchyma in <italic>mfsd2aa</italic> mutants like we did at 3 dpf (Figure 6), both with similar overall levels and rates of leakage into the brain parenchyma.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fourth. Instead, &quot;parenchymal cells&quot; were monitored (see comment #2). We were not convinced that monitoring the number of &quot;cells&quot; is predictive to leakage extent. It would only be so if (i) the total number of cells is high, stable during development and unaltered in genetic mutants and if (ii) the amount of substrate tracer is limiting so that the more tracer reaches the parenchyma, the more cells are detectable. None of these conditions seem established in light of the data presented. For instance, as the nature of the presumed cells is unknown, their total number (labeled or not) cannot be established and therefore different time points and genetic conditions cannot be compared (Figure 1D, Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Figure 4C, Figure 4—figure supplement 2, 3). How can the authors rule out that the total number of this presumptive cell type is not merely increased in mfsd2aa mutants? According to previous reports mfsd2aa is widely expressed throughout the zebrafish embryonic and larval brain. Similarly, how can the authors exclude that the number of these cells drops over time in the midbrain? Instead of counting &quot;cells&quot;, the mean intensity of the &quot;cells&quot; could be analyzed (alternatively, asses the parenchymal leak, see third comment). If transcytosis (or more broadly tracer leakage) is increased, the anticipated result is an increase in the average fluorescence intensity of cell-associated label (rather than an increase in the actual number of cells).</p><p>Assessing the number of cells as a readout for transcytosis seems moreover also puzzling from cellular standpoints. Indeed, at least some of these &quot;cells&quot; were shown to be filled secondary to sudden rupture of endothelial integrity (Figure 2E) and therefore would not be a faithful readout for transcytosis upregulation. Final sentence in subsection “Posterior-Anterior Gradient of Zebrafish BBB Development” are unclear in that respect as well. We would agree with the authors that tight junctional defects would likely exhibit size-selective leakage properties (although that remains to be shown in zebrafish). Consequently, the observed labelling of the &quot;parenchymal cells&quot; with tracers of all tested sizes suggest an alternative leakage mode is at play (if we assume this is secondary to BBB defects, see above). It does however not discriminate vessel rupture from transcytosis. So in absence of vessel rupture quantification in mfsd2aa mutants versus WT, interpretation of the cell counts is ambiguous.</p></disp-quote><p>We truly thank this reviewer (and reviewer 2) for this comment and we have now analyzed the data in an alternative way as shown in Figure 1 and described in the Materials and methods section. We now measure the overall tracer intensity in the brain parenchyma normalized to tracer intensity within circulation, as we had previously done for the time lapse imaging, to quantify leakage across developmental stages and mutant lines. Interestingly, this analysis revealed high tracer permeability throughout the larval brain at 3 dpf, whereas our previous cell counting method showed the hindbrain barrier had been sealed at this time point based the lack of “scavenger” cells in the hindbrain. This difference could be due to the sensitivity of two quantification methods or the lack of these particular scavenger cells in the hindbrain. However, this has not altered our overall assessment of a posterior to anterior gradient of barrier sealing, as at 4 dpf, we observed a sealed hindbrain barrier but a leaky midbrain barrier and at 5 dpf, everything appeared sealed. The combination of both methods for leakage quantification strengthened this study.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) This reviewer believes that the title of this manuscript overstates the conclusions of the study.
