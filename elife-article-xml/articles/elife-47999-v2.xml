pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47999.001</object-id><p>The PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway is a small RNA-based immune system that controls the expression of transposons and maintains genome integrity in animal gonads. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, piRNA-guided silencing is achieved, in part, via co-transcriptional repression of transposons by Piwi. This depends on Panoramix (Panx); however, precisely how an RNA binding event silences transcription remains to be determined. Here we show that Nuclear Export Factor 2 (Nxf2) and its co-factor, Nxt1, form a complex with Panx and are required for co-transcriptional silencing of transposons in somatic and germline cells of the ovary. Tethering of Nxf2 or Nxt1 to RNA results in silencing of target loci and the concomitant accumulation of repressive chromatin marks. Nxf2 and Panx proteins are mutually required for proper localization and stability. We mapped the protein domains crucial for the Nxf2/Panx complex formation and show that the amino-terminal portion of Panx is sufficient to induce transcriptional silencing.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47999.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>For an organism to form and grow correctly, it must rely on the genetic information it has received from its parents. DNA, however, is full of elements called transposons that can disrupt this information by moving around the genome and inserting themselves into genes. Changes caused by these invading elements can lead to devastating effects, such as cancer and cell death. To shield their DNA from harm, organisms have evolved regulatory machineries to recognize and correct alterations that may be damaging.</p><p>One way cells can protect their DNA is by silencing disruptive transposons using small molecules known as piRNAs. These protective molecules detect transposons as soon as they are active and recruit other proteins to switch them off. However, questions still remain about how specific proteins recruited by piRNAs are involved in this process. In flies, a protein called Panoramix (Panx) is known to trigger transposon silencing, but how it does this is still unclear.</p><p>Now, Fabry, Ciabrelli, Munafò et al. set out to investigate how Panx silences active transposons in the ovaries of flies and whether other proteins are involved. Like so many other proteins, Panx was found not to work alone but to form a complex with two other proteins, called Nxf2 and Nxt1. The experiments showed that all three components of the complex, named PICTS, are critical for transposon control in flies, but Panx is the engine that drives the machine.</p><p>Panx and Nxf2 were found to stabilize each other, and together with co-factor Nxt1 place a mark on the genome at the point where the transposon emerges, effectively switching it off. Notably, although Nxf2 and Nxt1 are part of a family of proteins that export molecules from the nucleus, both these factors appear to have been repurposed to silence transposable elements within the genome.</p><p>This work expands our understanding of how cells employ regulatory machineries, like the PICTS complex, to guard against disruptive genetic changes. These mechanisms are often conserved throughout evolution, and the findings presented here may help identify ways to counteract harmful changes caused by transposons in other organisms, including humans. However, more work would be required to deepen our knowledge of how these processes work.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>piRNA pathway</kwd><kwd>transcriptional gene silencing</kwd><kwd>transposon control</kwd><kwd>nuclear export factor</kwd><kwd>PIWI proteins</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator award 110161/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hannon</surname><given-names>Gregory J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hannon</surname><given-names>Gregory J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Long-Term Fellowship ALTF 1015-2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ciabrelli</surname><given-names>Filippo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001645</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Munafò</surname><given-names>Marzia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A member of the Drosophila Nuclear Export Factor (Nxf) family, Nxf2, forms part of the piRNA-dependent co-transcriptional silencing complex and is essential for transposon repression in fly ovaries.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The piRNA pathway is a small RNA-based immune system that represses transposable elements in animal gonadal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Czech et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ozata et al., 2019</xref>). At the core of this pathway are PIWI-clade Argonaute proteins that are guided by 23-30nt piRNA partners to silence transposon targets via two main mechanisms. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> Aubergine and Argonaute 3 enforce post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) via direct cleavage of transposon mRNAs in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brennecke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gunawardane et al., 2007</xref>). Piwi, in contrast, operates in the nucleus where it instructs the co-transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) of transposon insertions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brennecke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klenov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sienski et al., 2012</xref>). Mutations that compromise TGS result in severe loss of transposon control, despite normal piRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dönertas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Le Thomas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muerdter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ohtani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rozhkov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sienski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sienski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Piwi, in complex with piRNAs, detects nascent transposon RNAs arising from active insertions and directs the silencing of these loci. Target silencing is achieved via recruitment of histone modifying enzymes that deposit repressive chromatin marks, mainly trimethylation of Lysine 9 on Histone 3 (H3K9me3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iwasaki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klenov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Le Thomas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rozhkov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sienski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang and Elgin, 2011</xref>). Panoramix (Panx) is a key TGS effector, acting downstream of Piwi at the interface between the piRNA pathway and the general chromatin silencing machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sienski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). Strikingly, RNA-mediated recruitment of Panx, but not Piwi, to a locus is sufficient to trigger its epigenetic silencing, thus placing Panx at a critical node of the TGS mechanism. Downstream of Panx, the concerted action of dLsd1/Su(var)3–3 and Eggless/dSETDB1 erases H3K4me2 and concomitantly deposits H3K9me3, followed by chromatin compaction via Heterochromatin Protein 1a (HP1a/Su(var)205) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Czech et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iwasaki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rangan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sienski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang and Elgin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). Precisely how Panx recruits these histone modifying enzymes and what other factors participate in this process remains an outstanding question.</p><p>Here we show that Panx coopts elements of the nuclear RNA export machinery to trigger transcriptional silencing. Panx is part of a complex that also contains Nuclear Export Factor 2 (Nxf2) and Nxt1/p15. Panx and Nxf2 are interdependent for their protein stability. <italic>nxf2</italic> mutants show strong de-repression of Piwi-regulated transposons and severe loss of H3K9me3 at affected loci, similarly to <italic>panx</italic> mutants. We find that the amino-terminus of Panx delivers the critical silencing signal, as it is necessary and sufficient to trigger the deposition of repressive chromatin marks if tethered to a reporter construct, while its carboxyl-terminal region is involved in the interaction with Nxf2. Nxf2 is closely related to the mRNA export factor Nxf1, which also interacts and functions with Nxt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fribourg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herold et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herold et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, our findings reveal that the evolution of transposon defense mechanisms involved exaptation of the nuclear RNA export machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Nxf2 is a TGS factor that interacts with Panx</title><p>To identify proteins associated with Panx, we immunoprecipitated a GFP-Panx fusion protein expressed from its endogenous promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Handler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) from ovary lysates and identified co-purifying proteins by quantitative mass spectrometry.

Nxf2 contains all domains present in the family defined by Nxf1, namely an amino-terminal region (NTR), an RNA-binding domain (RBD), leucine-rich repeats (LRR), the NTF2-like domain (NTF2) and a Ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herold et al., 2001</xref>). While the NTR, LRRs and RBD are typically involved in cargo binding, the NTF2 and UBA domains mediate binding to the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC) and are required for Nxf1-mediated RNA export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braun et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fribourg et al., 2001</xref>). Nxt1, also known as p15, is a co-factor of Nxf1 responsible for interaction with the NPC, specifically through the NTF2-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fribourg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lévesque et al., 2001</xref>).

Both Nxf2 and Nxt1 were previously identified in screens for piRNA-guided silencing in somatic and germline cells, and their depletion resulted in female sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Czech et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Handler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muerdter et al., 2013</xref>).

Piwi depletion resulted in the accumulation of H3K4me2 at these loci and spreading of the mark, indicative of active transcription, beyond the transposon into downstream regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D,F</xref>), similar to earlier reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dönertas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klenov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sienski et al., 2012</xref>).

Removing the carboxy-terminal half of Panx (Panx-∆C) yielded a protein that remained nuclear, while co-expressed Nxf2 remained largely cytoplasmic, and these proteins no longer formed a complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). When expressed alone in S2 cells, Nxf2 remained predominantly cytoplasmic (ZsGreen-HA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting that interaction with Panx is necessary for nuclear localization of Nxf2. Panx-∆N, in contrast, retained the ability to interact with Nxf2 but failed to localize to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>).

Nxf2-∆NPC failed to co-purify with Panx, and this was accompanied by an increased cytoplasmic protein localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). In contrast, deleting the cargo-binding region of Nxf2 had less impact on its co-purification with Panx or the nuclear localization of either protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). This mutant was able to interact with Panx-∆N but not Panx-∆C, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Mutants of Nxf2, which had individual domains removed, uniformly failed to rescue <italic>nxf2</italic> knockdown in OSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>), yet all but Nxf2-∆UBA still co-purified with full-length Panx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>). We also generated point mutants within the UBA domain, altering 2–4 highly conserved amino acids at a time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref> right). UBA mutant #1, showed a phenotype similar to the domain deletion with reduced binding to Panx, increased cytoplasmic localization, and failure to rescue loss of Nxf2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E–F</xref>). Thus, the interaction of Nxf2 and Panx relies on an intact UBA domain and requires the carboxy-terminal portion of Panx.</p><p>The NTF2-like fold was previously shown to mediate the interaction of NXF proteins with Nxt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herold et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kerkow et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Suyama et al., 2000</xref>).

Our sensor construct carried 8 LacO sites upstream of the <italic>D. sim.</italic> ubiquitin promoter, which drives the expression of HA-ZsGreen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). While tethering of LacI-Piwi did not affect sensor expression, LacI-Panx resulted in robust reductions in both RNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sienski et al., 2015</xref>). LacI-Nxf2 also silenced the reporter, reducing both mRNA and protein output, albeit to a lesser extent than LacI-Panx tethering. Surprisingly, LacI-Nxt1 was unable to silence the sensor construct. Repression by tethered Panx or Nxf2 resulted in a striking decrease in H3K4me2 marks over the transcribed parts (i.e. promoter and ZsGreen coding region), while the remainder of the reporter showed low read coverage and little difference in the prevalence of the mark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Conversely, H3K9me3 increased upon repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Of note, the entire reporter sequence (except a small gap around the LacO site and the 3' UTR where the mappability is poor) was prominently decorated with H3K9me3, suggesting spreading of this chromatin mark following initial silencing.</p><p>The data presented above identified functional elements within Nxf2 and Panx that are required for proper localization, interaction, and Piwi-dependent transcriptional gene silencing. We next examined the ability of Panx and Nxf2 mutants to silence our artificial DNA reporters, thus bypassing Piwi-piRNA dependent target recognition. Neither LacI-Nxf2-∆Cargo nor LacI-Panx-∆N, which were predicted to interact with their full-length partner in OSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>), were able to repress the sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Yet, LacI-Panx-∆C, which could not interact with Nxf2, substantially reduced RNA and protein expression from the sensor, with its effects as robust as upon DNA tethering of LacI-HP1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). This suggests that the amino-terminal part of Panx is necessary and sufficient to enforce silencing of an artificial reporter independent of its interaction with Nxf2.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our data identify Nxf2 and Nxt1 as critical mediators of co-transcriptional gene silencing, acting in concert with Panx to repress loci in response to Piwi-piRNA target engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). The emerging model for piRNA-dependent silencing implies that target recognition by Piwi is necessary to recruit the PICTS complex onto the appropriate nascent RNA targets. Difficulties in detecting stable interactions between Piwi and PICTS components in vivo may arise from a requirement for Piwi target engagement to licence it for recruitment of silencing complexes, as has been suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sienski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). The same mechanism may underlie the difficulties experienced in observing Piwi on its target loci by ChIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marinov et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We find that Panx and Nxf2 are interdependent for their protein stability and proper subcellular localization, underscoring the fact that correct assembly of the PICTS complex is essential for TGS, while the silencing capacity, per se, resides in Panx. Of note, previous work reported a partial destabilization of Nxf2 in cells depleted of Nxt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herold et al., 2001</xref>), potentially extending the interdependency to all three proteins. RIP-seq experiments from unperturbed cells found transposon RNAs enriched only with Panx, as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sienski et al., 2015</xref>), but not with Nxf2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>), possibly due to low substrate availability combined with an insensitive assay. These results are consistent with another recent report that did not detect transposon enrichment in Nxf2 CLIP-seq from wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batki et al., 2019</xref>). However, two other studies identified transposon mRNA association with Nxf2 in CLIP-seq experiments upon depletion of the previously described TGS factor, Mael (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>), or by using a stable cell line and depletion of endogenous Nxf2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murano et al., 2019</xref>). Considered together, these data suggest that Nxf2 might be important for stabilizing the binding of Panx to nascent RNAs. However, precisely how Nxf2 executes this function remains to be fully elucidated. Of note, Murano and colleagues find that Panx interacts with Nxf2, Piwi, Mael and Arx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murano et al., 2019</xref>), which could imply that other TGS factors come into contact with the PICTS complex, although the relationship between these factors and PICTS requires further investigation.</p><p>Mutational analyses suggest that Panx and Nxf2 must normally bind Nxt1 to carry out transposon repression. Direct recruitment of any of the PICTS complex components to RNA reporters results in robust chromatin silencing. Upon tethering to DNA, however, Panx induces potent TGS, whereas Nxf2 leads to less prominent effects and Nxt1 shows no silencing capability in our assays. Interestingly, recruitment of the amino-terminal part of Panx alone is necessary and sufficient to induce reporter repression, pinpointing this domain of Panx as harboring the silencing effector function. Future investigations will be crucial to uncover the molecular mechanism by which the Panx amino terminus instructs the downstream chromatin silencing machinery.</p><p>Our work, and that of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>) indicates that piRNA-guided co-transcriptional silencing of transposons has coopted several components of the RNA export machinery, namely Nxf2 and Nxt1. Of the four NXF proteins present in flies, only two have thus far been characterized. Interestingly, while Nxf1, acting along with Nxt1, is crucial for canonical mRNA export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braun et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fribourg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herold et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wilkie et al., 2001</xref>), Nxf2 has been coopted by the piRNA pathway and functions in co-transcriptional gene silencing. Nxf3, which also is required for transposon repression in germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Czech et al., 2013</xref>), is emerging as being critical for the export of piRNA precursors generated from dual-strand clusters in the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">ElMaghraby et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kneuss et al., 2019</xref>. The role of Nxf4, whose expression is testis-specific, is yet to be established. This remarkable functional diversity of NXF family members correlates with tissue-specific expression patterns, and seems conserved in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2001</xref>). However, deciphering how each achieves substrate specificity will be critical to understanding how these homologs can be exclusively dedicated to different targets and confer different fates upon the RNAs that they bind.</p><p>Importantly, the fate of the nascent transcript that is detected by Piwi and instructed by PICTS for silencing remains unclear. One hypothesis is that instead of being exported, these targets undergo degradation by the nuclear exosome. Such mechanism would be contrary to yeast, where the TREX complex subunit Mlo3 was shown to oppose siRNA-mediated heterochromatin formation at gene loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yu et al., 2018</xref>), and suggests that different lineages have evolved different silencing mechanisms. In any case, it is possible that a single transcript from a locus that is marked for silencing might pose a lesser threat than an unsilenced locus and, therefore, not be capable of exerting evolutionary pressure for the detemination of its fate.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks and handling</title><p>All flies were kept at 25°C.

Crosslinking was stopped by adding 225 mM glycine followed by incubation for 5 min on a rotating wheel. The homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min at 4,000 g at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded, and the nuclear pellet was washed twice in 1 ml A1 buffer and once in 1 ml of A2 buffer (140 mM NaCl, 15 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mM sodium butyrate and complete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail) at 4°C. Nuclei were then resuspended in 100 μl A2 buffer with 1% SDS and 0.5% N-laurosylsarcosine and incubated for 2 hr at 4°C with agitation at 1,500 rpm. Chromatin was sonicated using a Bioruptor Pico (Diagenode #B01060010) for 16 cycles of 30 s on/30 s off. Sheared chromatin size peaked at 150 bp. After sonication and 5 min high-speed centrifugation at 4°C, fragmented chromatin was recovered in the supernatant and the final volume was raised to 1 ml in A2 buffer with 0.1% SDS. 50 µl of the diluted samples were used as DNA input control, in a final volume of 200 µl of A2 buffer with 0.1% SDS. Chromatin for IP was precleared by addition of 15 µl of Protein A/G Magnetic Beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) suspension followed by overnight incubation at 4°C. Beads were removed by centrifugation, and anti-H3K9me3 (Active Motif #39161) antibody was added (1:200 dilution) to 5 µg of chromatin and incubated for 4 hr at 4°C on a rotating wheel. 50 µl of Protein A/G Magnetic Beads were added, and incubation was continued overnight at 4°C. Antibody-protein complexes were washed 4 times in A3 (A2 +0.05% SDS) buffer and twice in 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris (pH 8) buffer for 5 min at 4°C on a rotating wheel. Chromatin was eluted from the beads in 200 μl of 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 50 mM Tris (pH 8) for 30 min with agitation at 1,500 rpm and then reverse-crosslinked overnight at 65°C, together with the input DNA. IP and input samples were treated with 2 µl of Proteinase K (Thermo Fisher Scientific #EO0491) for 3 hr at 56°C. DNA was purified using the MinElute PCR purification Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to manufacturer’s instructions, and resuspended in 30 μl water. Recovered DNA was quantified with Qubit 4 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and analysed with Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 High Sensitivity DNA Chip (Agilent). DNA libraries were prepared with NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB), according to manufacturer’s instructions. DNA libraries were quantified with KAPA Library Quantification Kit for Illumina (Kapa Biosystems) and deep-sequenced with Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Illumina).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>ChIP-seq from OSCs</title><p>For ChIP from OSCs we adapted a protocol by Schmidt and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>). In short, 10 × 10<sup>6</sup> OSCs were crosslinked in 1% formaldehyde for 10 min. Crosslinking was quenched by addition of glycine solution, followed by three washes in ice-cold PBS. Crosslinked cells were either snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C or processed immediately. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml buffer LB1 (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Igepal CA-630, 0.25% Triton-X 100, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]) and incubated on ice for 10 min while inverting several times. Cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 2,000 g at 4°C. Supernatant was discarded and pellet resuspended in 1 ml LB2 10 mM Tris-HCL pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 M EGTA, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail). Cells were incubated on ice for 5 min and centrifuged again. Isolated nuclei were resuspended in 300 µl sonication buffer LB3 (10 mM Tris-HCL pH 8, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.1% Na-Deoxycholate, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail) and transferred in 1.5 ml Bioruptor Microtubes (Diagenode). Chromatin was sonicated using a Bioruptor Pico (Diagenode) for 16 cycles of 30 s on/30 s off. Sheared chromatin size peaked at 150 bp.

In short, the first and last base of each 50 bp read were removed using fastx trimmer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/">http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/</ext-link>). RIP-seq reads were first aligned against rRNAs and mapped reads discarded. High-quality reads were aligned to the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> genome release 6 (dm6) downloaded from Flybase using STAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>). For transposon-wide analysis, genome multi-mapping reads were randomly assigned to one location using option '--outFilterMultimapNmax 1000 --outMultimapperOrder Random' and non-mapping reads were removed. Alignment files were then converted back to fastq format with samtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2009</xref>) and re-aligned to the transposon consensus sequences allowing multi-mappers that were assigned to a random position. Generated bam alignment files were indexed using samtools index. For genome-wide analyses, multi-mapping reads were removed to ensure unique locations of reads. Normalization was achieved by calculating rpm (reads per million) using the deepTools2 bamCoverage function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ramírez et al., 2016</xref>) with 10 bp bin sizes. The scaling factor for transposon mapping reads was calculated from reads that aligned to transposon consensus sequences relative to genome aligned reads. Reads mapping to genes were counted with htseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anders et al., 2015</xref>) and transposon derived reads were calculated using a custom script (available with this article as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref>). Metaplots flanking euchromatic insertion sites and transposon coverage plots were calculated by deepTools2 with bin sizes of 10 bp and 50 bp, respectively. Stranded RNA libraries were trimmed, aligned and indexed as described above. Alignment files were split in sense and antisense reads using samtools view. Normalization of the split alignment files as well as feature counting was performed as described above. For transposon expression analysis only sense reads were considered. Differential expression analysis was performed using a custom build R script (available with this article as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode2">Source code 2</xref>). Adapters from raw small RNA fastq files were clipped with fastx_clipper (adapter sequence <named-content content-type="sequence">AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA</named-content>) keeping only reads with at least 23 bp length. Then the first and last four bases were trimmed using seqtk (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/lh3/seqtk">https://github.com/lh3/seqtk</ext-link>). Alignment and normalization were performed as described above. Only high-quality small RNA reads with a length between 23 and 29 bp were used for further analysis of piRNA profiles. piRNA distribution was calculated and plotted in R.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;piRNA-guided co-transcriptional silencing coopts nuclear export factors&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers acknowledge your discovery of a new factor (Nxf2) that is an effector of transposon silencing: piRNA biogenesis is not affected, but silencing of transposons that depend on the piRNA pathway is affected. Moreover, Nxf2 (in complex with Nxt1) interacts with a previously reported effector Panx. Finally, assuming that somehow the Piwi complex recruits Panx and Nxf2 to the target locus, some evidence is proposed to show that the N-term of Panx is needed to recruit the silencing machinery, while the C-term of Panx interacts with Nxf2, which is proposed to be holding on to the nascent RNA. Hence, Panx alone is not sufficient for silencing – Nxf2 is needed too.</p><p>The reviewers also raise some questions:</p><p>1) What is the direct link between the piRNA-Piwi complex and Panx, which was expected from your previous work (Yu et al., 2015) and from another study from the Brennecke lab (Sienski et al., 2015)?

Similar results were obtained by the Brennecke lab using antibodies against endogenous Piwi and Panx from nuclear OSC lysates (Sienski et al., 2015). Indeed, we, as well as Batki et al., were unable to detect significant enrichment of Piwi in either Panx or Nxf2 IP-mass spectrometry experiments (Batki et al: from nuclear OSC lysates; our study: total lysates from ovaries), though the Siomi group did see Piwi in their mass spectrometry of bands selected based upon their size from a Panx immunoprecipitate (Murano et al., 2019, Figure 1A).</p><p>We believe that these outcomes are likely due to the interaction between Piwi and downstream factors being transient, only occurring when Piwi engages a target RNA from a de-repressed transposon. It has been proposed by many in the field that target engagement licenses Piwi for recruitment of a highly potent silencing machinery. According to this prevalent model, and bearing in mind that several of these factors independently induce silencing when tethered artificially to the RNA, one might expect that only a small fraction of Piwi would interact with Panx or Nxf2 under normal circumstances.</p><p>We certainly were aware that Batki and colleagues find binding of Piwi to Panx in coIP experiments. However, this interaction becomes visible upon analysis of a substantially greater amount of protein than used for their other IPs (400X, see Figure 1B in Batki et al., 2019).</p><p>Upon careful examination of our respective coIP experiment reported in this manuscript (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D), we were indeed able to detect a faint band corresponding to Piwi in co-immunoprecipitates with 3xFLAG-tagged Nxf2, Panx, and Nxt1 but not with ZsGreen. This band is more obvious with increased contrast (see updated Figure 1—figure supplement 1D), thus our results are indeed consistent with our previous studies and those of others, and with at least the hypothesis that it is target-engaged Piwi with which these proteins form a complex. We have updated the original image and changed the corresponding paragraphs in the Results and Discussion sections of the manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Thoroughly discuss the relevant bioRxiv papers dealing with Nxf2, including that there are other interpretations possible.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a paragraph to the Discussion of our manuscript highlighting relevant findings in the other <italic>bioRxiv</italic> papers.</p><p>One of the seemingly contradictory results is the RNA-binding activity of Nxf2. Despite considerable efforts, we were not able to identify robust binding of transposon transcripts to Nxf2 in a wild-type context (Figure 4—figure supplement 1F). Similarly, the updated manuscript version (see <italic>bioRxiv</italic> updates) from Batki and colleagues does not report any RIP- or CLIP-seq data for Nxf2, instead only shows the ability of Nxf2’s first unit to bind RNA in vitro.</p><p>Zhao et al. find that Nxf2 binds to transposon transcripts in Nxf2-HALO knock-in cells depleted of the piRNA factor Maelstrom (Mael), but not in unperturbed cells. Since Mael depletion causes strong transposon up-regulation, this has the potential to provide more substrate for the PICTS complex, therefore allowing capture of Nxf2-RNA interaction.</p><p>Murano et al. report binding of Nxf2 to transposon transcripts when using a stable line expressing myc-tagged Nxf2 coupled to knockdown of the endogenous protein. The authors compare all their Nxf2-CLIP data to a “size-matched input”. We have not attempted Nxf2-CLIP with this type of comparison.</p><p>Negative outcomes are obviously difficult to interpret, but we feel that our failure to detect enrichment of transposon transcripts in Nxf2-RIP could be due to differences in experimental protocols. We would like to highlight that we were able to reproduce the interaction of transposon transcripts with Panx by RIP-seq experiments (see Figure 4—figure supplement 1F), as reported (Sienski et al., 2015).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Discuss other known effectors such as Maelstrom, GTSF1 etc. and put this in the context of what we already know.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a paragraph to the Discussion of our manuscript highlighting the other known TGS factors.</p><p>Murano et al. find that Panx interacts with Nxf2, Piwi, Mael and Arx (Murano et al., 2019, Supplementary Figure 1C). They furthermore show that myc-Nxf2 binds to Panx, Piwi, Nxt1 and Mael, but not Arx (Murano et al., 2019, Supplementary Figure 6C), which could mean that Mael and Arx do come into contact with the PICTS complex. However, the authors themselves do not discuss these findings (i.e. interaction with Mael) nor investigate this further. The other studies do not report such interaction (neither by coIP nor by IP-MS experiments), therefore further work will be necessary to understand the relationship between Mael, Arx and PICTS. We do not detect Piwi in our mass spectrometry experiment, so it is unlikely that we could detect the even less abundant Piwi interactor, Arx. We believe that our results along with the studies from the Brennecke, Siomi and Yu labs build a foundation for further examination and characterization of the hierarchy and composition of the piRNA-directed co-transcriptional silencing machinery.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Discuss the relationship between your results and those in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, showing that the nuclear mRNA export factor Mlo3 (human ALY/REF) opposes siRNA-mediated heterochromatin formation at mRNA genes (Yu et al., 2018).
