Establishment and maintenance of cell polarity are under the control of a set of polarity proteins highly conserved through metazoans. This network of proteins, some of which are PAR proteins, is set up through regulations involving recruitment or repulsion(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Assémat et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goldstein and Macara, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Laprise and Tepass, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nelson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rodriguez-Boulan and Macara, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">St Johnston and Ahringer, 2010</xref>). The precise localisation of these polarity complexes defines plasma membrane domains with specific functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rodriguez-Boulan and Macara, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">St Johnston and Ahringer, 2010</xref>). Accordingly, the polarity complexes are essential for establishment of neural growth cone polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yu et al., 2006</xref>), apico-basal epithelial polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuchinke et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nance et al., 2003</xref>), or antero-posterior polarity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cox et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tomancak et al., 2000</xref>) and <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kemphues, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Two major polarity modules control establishment and maintenance of cell polarity: one module composed of PAR3 (also named Bazooka [BAZ] in <italic>Drosophila</italic>), PAR6, and aPKC proteins, and a second module composed of PAR1, LGL, and SLMB proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goldstein and Macara, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rodriguez-Boulan and Macara, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">St Johnston and Ahringer, 2010</xref>). Localisation of these two modules is mutually exclusive and mainly involves interplay between physical interactions and phosphorylations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coopman and Djiane, 2016</xref>). aPKC phosphorylates PAR1 to exclude it from the PAR3 cortical domain. Conversely, PAR3 is phosphorylated by the kinase PAR1, recognised by the 14.3.3 proteins and excluded from the PAR1 cortical domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benton and St Johnston, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morais-de-Sá et al., 2010</xref>). PAR3 is also maintained at the plasma membrane through physical interactions with membrane lipids, phosphoinositides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krahn et al., 2010a</xref>). We reported in particular that PI(4,5)P2 (phosphatidyl inositol 4,5 diphosphate) controls PAR3 apical targeting in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Claret et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, the cytoskeleton seems to be important for proper localisation of PAR3, and it is noteworthy that the apical actin network is required to position PAR3 apically as well as microtubules (MTs) via dynein-dependent transport in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harris and Peifer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McKinley and Harris, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes, PAR3, at the anterior cortical domain, and PAR1, at the posterior, specify the polarity axes by controlling the MT organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cox et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doerflinger et al., 2003</xref>), and thus the localisation of determinants such as <italic>bicoid</italic>, <italic>oskar</italic>, and <italic>gurken</italic> mRNAs, crucial for subsequent future embryo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">St Johnston, 2005</xref>). Generating mutually exclusive cortical domains is especially important for polarisation of this large single-cell system. However, throughout oogenesis, the asymmetric localisation of PAR proteins is dynamic and PAR1 and PAR3 domains are not always mutually exclusive. During early oogenesis, localisation of PAR3 and PAR1 is independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huynh et al., 2001</xref>), while at mid-oogenesis (stage 7–8), PAR3 and PAR1 overlap at the posterior plasma membrane. Both show mutually exclusive localisations at stage 9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doerflinger et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>During stages 8–10, which correspond to the critical period for localisation of the polarity axes determinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Steinhauer and Kalderon, 2006</xref>), the oocyte undergoes a rapid threefold size increase while subcellular localisation of PAR modules has to remain strictly conserved. Although the mutual antagonism between PAR3/aPKC/PAR6 and PAR1/LGL/SLMB modules plays an important role in setting up PAR3 restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morais-de-Sá et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tian and Deng, 2008</xref>), the molecular mechanisms involved in these processes remain elusive and may not be sufficient to sustain PAR3 asymmetry. Indeed, computer modelling has highlighted that mutual antagonism between the two complexes is not enough to maintain asymmetry between the polarity determinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fletcher et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, the fate of PAR3, once phosphorylated by PAR1, and how it is redirected from the posterior to the anterior cortex is unknown. PAR3 could diffuse laterally in contact with plasma membrane until it reaches the anterior, or it could be dispersed from the posterior membrane in the cytoplasm as has been suggested for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McKinley and Harris, 2012</xref>) and then recycled. Our previous findings have highlighted the role of the PIP5Kinase Skittles (SKTL) and its product PI(4,5)P2 in PAR3 localisation in oocytes and epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Claret et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gervais et al., 2008</xref>). PI(4,5)P2, among other functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zimmermann et al., 2005</xref>), is crucial to recruit the endocytic machinery at the plasma membrane during the first step of endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Compagnon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Posor et al., 2015</xref>). We hypothesise that SKTL, by controlling endocytosis and/or vesicular trafficking could regulate indirectly PAR3 localisation.</p><p>Here, with use of quantitative analysis, we examined the precise evolution of PAR3 distribution during stages 8–10 of oogenesis. We show that PAR3 is excluded from the posterior cortex much later than establishment of PAR1 to the posterior and that actin cytoskeleton and endocytosis are important for this process. Subsequently, MTs and dynein motor are required for PAR3 transport to the anterior plasma membrane. This transport is connected with vesicular trafficking, cytoplasmic PAR3 being associated with PI(4,5)P2-enriched endosomes. We provide evidence of physical interactions between PAR3, SKTL, and the dynein light intermediate chain DLIC, which could explain transport of PAR3 by dynein directly on vesicles. Finally, we found that IKK-related kinase, IKKε in the correct localisation of PAR3. Knockdown of IKKε leads to an accumulation of PAR3 near the minus ends of MTs. Altogether our results point to a connection between membrane trafficking and dynein-mediated transport to sustain PAR3 asymmetry in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocyte.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fine tuning of PAR3 distribution along the anterior posterior axis</title><p>To characterise the evolution of PAR3 distribution during oocyte development, we developed a quantification method to monitor the precise variation of PAR3 distribution along the plasma membrane during late oogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The oocyte plasma membrane was therefore subdivided into three regions: the anterior plasma membrane (APM), which corresponds to the membrane in contact with the nurse cells, the posterior plasma membrane (PPM), which corresponds to the posterior domain of the oocyte where PAR1 and Staufen are localised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>), and the lateral plasma membrane (LPM), which corresponds to the plasma membrane between the two previous regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The APM domain corresponds to juxtaposition of oocyte and nurse cell plasma membranes. Therefore, for each oocyte individually, we quantified the mean fluorescent intensity of oocyte adjacent nurse cells. We then removed, from the anterior signal, the mean fluorescent intensity of the nurse cell plasma membrane to precisely quantify the signal coming only from the APM of this oocyte. Afterwards, the intensity profile along the plasma membranes, as well as the global intensity by plasma membrane and cytoplasm domains, were compiled and the signal density was analysed (see Materials and methods for details).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40212.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dynamic PAR3 distribution along the oocyte anterior posterior axis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Description of the quantification Fiji Macro. After selecting three points in the oocyte (yellow stars) and delimitation of oocyte perimeter, the macro allows us to obtain different data about protein repartition in oocytes: the intensity profile of the plasma membrane (magenta); the mean fluorescent intensity and the length of each of the plasma membrane domainsare automatically generated (anterior/APM in red; lateral/LPM in green; posterior/PPM in blue) and the mean signal intensity inside the cytoplasm (cyan).

Thereafter, to avoid fluctuations associated with membrane growth during oogenesis or with experimental procedures, we normalised the raw data to the total amount of PAR3 signal in each oocyte and related to the membrane length (cf. materiel and methods, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). With these density results, although we cannot compare the quantities between different stages, we can follow the evolution of asymmetry in a stage. As expected, PAR3 density is highest at the oocyte APM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). However, PAR3 density repartition presents a striking dynamic in both PPM and LPM. At stage 8 and early stage 9 (stage 9A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), PAR3 is denser at the PPM than at the LPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, green arrows). Then at late stage 9 (stage 9B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), PAR3 is progressively excluded from the PPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, red arrows). These changes in PAR3 distribution reflect establishment of two distinct plasma membrane domains and are highlighted by the asymmetric ratio of PAR3 measured by the anterior to posterior density ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The beginning of PAR3 posterior exclusion in the middle of stage 9 correlates with the localisation switch of other factors such as Staufen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>) toward the posterior pole of the oocyte and correlated to the MT network reorganisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Januschke et al., 2006</xref>). This result is surprising as PAR1 is assumed to exclude PAR3 from the plasma membrane, yet PAR1 is already localised at the posterior pole from at least stage 7, long before PAR3 exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doerflinger et al., 2010</xref>). This may indicate that other processes participate in the disappearance of PAR3 from the PPM and the LPM. As the LPM appeared to follow the PPM comportment, thereafter we focused on APM accumulation and on PPM exclusion, two mechanisms important for establishment of antero-posterior polarity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Posterior exclusion and anterior accumulation are two PAR3 localisation processes that can be decoupled/separated</title><p>To understand how PAR3 is excluded from the posterior domain and enriched at the anterior domain in the oocyte, we investigated further cytoskeleton involvement in this process. With latrunculin drug treatment, PAR3 is still predominantly at the APM as under control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, its posterior exclusion, which normally occurs at stage 9B, is not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating that the actin network is required for PAR3 posterior exclusion. We next addressed the potential MT requirement for PAR3 antero/posterior distribution in the oocyte. In the presence of colchicin, a drug that depolymerises MT, PAR3-polarised distribution along the antero/posterior axis is lost and tends toward isotropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Compared to control, PAR3 APM localisation is strongly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, PAR3 is still excluded from the PPM although to a lesser extent than the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). This confirms the importance of MTs in PAR3-polarised localisation, except at the posterior region where exclusion is still present. Hence it appears that in the oocyte, posterior exclusion and anterior accumulation can be uncoupled. We also note that both MT and actin disassembly increase cytoplasmic accumulation of PAR3 in dotted structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We verified that these dotted structures are also detected in the absence of PAR3 overexpression with a PAR3-Protein trap strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Januschke and Gonzalez, 2010</xref>). In this condition, we can observe some dotted structures in the oocyte cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Furthermore, when microtubules are depolymerised by colchicin, PAR3 accumulates in numerous dotted structures in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40212.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cytoskeleton involvement in PAR3 polarity.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Role of cytoskeleton on PAR3 distribution. Flies are nourished with latrunculin (cyan) for 48 h, colchicin (yellow) for 24 h, or only yeast paste (control).

In the absence of SKTL (sktl<sup>2.3</sup>/sktl<sup>∆5</sup>), PAR3 is accumulates more at the PPM than at the APM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, D and E</xref>). Conversely, when SKTL is overexpressed (OE), PAR3 is more excluded from the PPM than under control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, D and E</xref>). Thus, SKTL seems to have a preponderant function to exclude PAR3 from the PPM and to increase PAR3 density at the APM. To monitor whether SKTL kinase activity is required for this process, we performed the same experiment with a kinase dead form, SKTL<sup>DNRQ</sup> whose mutation in mammalian homolog leads to a dominant negative effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coppolino et al., 2002</xref>). In such a case, SKTL<sup>DNRQ</sup> overexpression does not enhance PAR3 exclusion from the PPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D and E</xref>). PAR3 distribution along the anterior posterior axis tends to be isotropic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). We can conclude that SKTL kinase activity, hence the production of PI(4,5)P2, is essential to regulate PAR3 distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>SKTL can bypass PAR1-dependent posterior exclusion</title><p>Upon phosphorylation, PAR1 excludes PAR3 from the posterior domain of the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benton and St Johnston, 2003</xref>).

Thus, PAR1 through its role in PAR3 phosphorylation is required to exclude PAR3 from the PPM. As SKTL also controls the posterior exclusion of PAR3, we combined the knockdown of PAR1, which normally presents no PAR3 exclusion, with the overexpression of SKTL, which increases the exclusion. In this case, we observed that SKTL can still exclude PAR3 even in the absence of PAR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

In oocytes (stage 8–10), the MT network forms a gradient following the antero/posterior axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Januschke et al., 2006</xref>). As MTs are more abundant and more nucleated (minus ends) at the anterior pole of oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khuc Trong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parton et al., 2011</xref>), dynein, as a minus end directed motor, could be necessary for PAR3 accumulation at the APM.

Thus, we investigated whether the two processes were connected. We monitored PAR3 dynamics in the oocyte through fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of PAR3-GFP. As a substantial proportion of the PAR3 that accumulates at the anterior part of the oocyte could come from synthesis and subsequent transport from the nurse cells through the ring canals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doerflinger et al., 2010</xref>), we wanted to dissociate this PAR3 arrival from the potential relocalisation of PAR3 in the oocyte from the posterior.

We then followed evolution of PAR3-GFP fluorescence both at the APM and at the PPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).

Our results suggest that PAR3 is transported in association with MTs and recycling endosome vesicles to the APM. Interestingly, in the proteomic screen for SKTL partners, we also identified the IKKε/IK2 kinase. IKKε has been shown to regulate RAB11-associated cargo transport with dynein in developing bristles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Otani et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, IKKε phosphorylates a RAB11 cofactor, NUF, to release the cargo from the dynein motor at the MT minus end. Interestingly, in oocytes, IKKε is specifically enriched at the APM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dubin-Bar et al., 2008</xref>). We then monitored whether IKKε is required for PAR3 polarised distribution.

The first step occurs at the middle of stage 9 and is responsible for PAR3 exclusion from the PPM. It involves PAR1, the actin cytoskeleton, PI(4,5)P2 and RAB5-dependent endocytosis. The second step relates to PAR3 accumulation at the oocyte anterior side. It brings into play MT-associated transport with the minus end directed motor, dynein in association with vesicular trafficking. Both steps rely on PAR3 interactions with PI(4,5)P2 endosomal vesicles.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40212.049</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Speculative model of PAR3 localisation regulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes, PAR3 asymmetrical localisation proceeds in at least two steps. The first step (<bold>C</bold>) occurs at the posterior plasma membrane and leads to the PAR3 exclusion starting from stage 9B. This step implicates PAR3 phosphorylation by PAR1 (<bold>C2</bold>) and RAB5-dependent endocytosis (<bold>C1</bold>). PIP5K, SKTL, and its product PI(4,5)P2 (orange) are crucial for this process, as well as the actin cytoskeleton (blue gradient). As PIP(4,5)P2 is critical for the endocytosis onset but also for actin cytoskeleton regulation, the link between all these protagonists remains hypothetical. Furthermore, as the polarised localisation of PAR1 depends on actin, we cannot exclude a role for PAR1 on endocytosis directly or indirectly by PAR3 phosphorylation. The second step (<bold>B</bold>) takes place at the anterior cortex where PAR3 has to be strongly enriched. Dynein-dependent transport brings PAR3 to the MT minus ends likely with recycling endosomal cargo (RE). Then PAR3 cargo would be released from the dynein through an IKKε-dependent process. However, how PAR3 reaches the cortex is unknown. PI(4,5)P2 is also important for the PAR3 endosomal sorting and we can speculate that an association with vesicles is required for anterior cortex targeting. Finally, while we have shown that the posterior fraction of PAR3 provides, through MTs, the anterior pool of PAR3, the neo-synthesized fraction of PAR3 from the nurse cell could also contribute to the anterior pool. As the MT network presents only a slight bias of minus end directed transport in the oocyte, it is thus possible that PAR3 is transported step by step along the lateral cortex before reaching the anterior membrane.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40212-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The precise role of the actin cytoskeleton in exclusion of PAR3 from the PPMremains to be clarified. An attractive hypothesis is that the posterior actin network could act on PAR3 removal from the plasma membrane, possibly by direct regulation of the endocytosis process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C1</xref>). In support of this, a connection between actin and a specific Oskar-dependent endocytosis pathway has already been highlighted at the oocyte posterior pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanaka and Nakamura, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vanzo and Ephrussi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vazquez-Pianzola et al., 2014</xref>). However, the actin requirement could also be connected with the role of actin in PAR1 posterior localisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doerflinger et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, in the presence of latrunculin, PAR1 is not focused on the PPM but its localisation become isotropic. Consequently, posterior PAR3 would be less phosphorylated by PAR1 and so less excluded.</p><p>How is the posterior to anterior redistribution of PAR3 achieved in the oocyte? Recent analyses on MT-associated transport of mRNA particles in the oocyte have shown that the MT network is polarised with a slight bias for MT plus ends towards the posterior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Trovisco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zimyanin et al., 2008</xref>). As PAR3 is associated with the MT minus end directed dynein motor, this MT polarity bias could be used to relocate PAR3 associated with vesicles towards the APM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). However, this anterior redistribution is unlikely to be direct because of the weak MT polarisation bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khuc Trong et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, it may involve intermediate re-localisation steps along the LPM before being redirected toward the APM, which is in accordance with the observed PAR3 distribution.</p><p>In the last few decades, the mutual inhibitions of PAR1 and PAR3 have been well studied at a functional level, and the molecular mechanism relies on some direct or indirect phosphorylations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C2</xref>). However, the fate of PAR3 after phosphorylation by PAR1 at the posterior is unknown. PAR3 does not seem to be degraded in a SLMB/E3 ubiquitin ligase-dependent manner at the PPM, unlike aPKC or PAR6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morais-de-Sá et al., 2014</xref>). Using the FRAP approach, we have shown that posterior fractions of PAR3 proteins contribute after re-localisation through a MT-dependent process to the anterior pool of PAR3. It is important to mention that this anterior fraction of PAR3 coming from the posterior of the oocyte is likely to be minor compared to the anterior pool of PAR3, which comes directly from the nurse cells.</p><p>Our results indicate here that PAR3 and PAR1 coexist at the PPM until stage 9A, indicating that the relations between them both are more complex and that an additional process may be required to exclude PAR3 from the PPM. Starting from stage 9B, PAR1 excludes PAR3 from the PPM but has little effect on PAR3 anterior accumulation. However, the strict exclusion of PAR3 on this small posterior domain is sufficient to obtain an important anterior/posterior asymmetry.</p><p>PAR3 is a cytoplasmic protein, but here we show that it is often found in association with membranes, the plasma membrane or endocytic membrane (early/recycling endosome). Interestingly, in mammalian epithelial cells PAR3 associates with exocyst components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed and Macara, 2017</xref>). This association is present in the oocyte, but is also observed in nurse cells, particularly at the front of the ring canals where PAR3 accumulates in PI(4,5)P2 and RAB-positive compartments. How is PAR3, a cytosolic protein, transported with endocytic membranes? PAR3 could be associated to a cargo bound to vesicles, which would then be transported to the anterior. In parallel, PAR3 could also control its own association with the vesicles. Indeed, PAR3 interacts with SKTL, which, in return, produces PI(4,5)P2 that stabilises PAR3 to the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Claret et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krahn et al., 2010b</xref>). This further points to the importance of SKTL in PAR3 APM accumulation and PPM exclusion. As PI(4,5)P2 is a well-known regulator of the first steps of endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Posor et al., 2015</xref>), we hypothesise that SKTL acts on PAR3 PPM exclusion by regulating the formation of vesicles required for future PAR3 anterior targeting. Our results also provide evidence for a role of PI(4,5)P2/SKTL in recycling endosome sorting. PI(4,5)P2 has been described as present both at the cell surface and on the distal portions of the tubular endosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2001</xref>). PI(4,5)P2 is required for the recruitment to the membrane of many proteins involved in vesicle formation, fusion, and actin polymerisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Posor et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that PI(4,5)P2 and SKTL are important on membranes, including those of recycling endosomes, for the budding and the sorting of specific elements of PAR3.</p><p>Here, we show that IKKε participates in establishment of PAR3 asymmetry in the oocyte. Upon IKKε knockdown, PAR3 accumulates with aPKC on RAB11 positive-vesicle aggregates, suggesting that PAR3 transport at the MT minus ends is arrested. In polarised bristles, IKKε was previously shown to take the RAB11 endocytic vesicles down to the MT minus ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Otani et al., 2011</xref>). The mechanism could be similar in oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). In IKKε knockdown, vesicle aggregates accumulate at the MT minus ends with dynein subunit DLIC. This accumulation depends on MTs, but also on PIP(4,5)P2/SKTL. These vesicles enriched for PI(4,5)P2, SKTL and able to nucleate actin present common characteristics with the anterior plasma membrane. They could constitute a pre-built platform in the cytoplasm before being targeted to the appropriate position at the plasma membrane. This idea of a preformed platform has already been suggested in the tracheal system, where PAR3 associates with recycling endosomes containing E-cadherin during adherens junction rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Le Droguen et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, during de novo apical lumen formation in MDCK cells and in human pluripotent stem cells, there is an accumulation of apical components in RAB11 positive-vesicles that are subsequently delivered to the apical plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Overeem et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Taniguchi et al., 2017</xref>). The first sign of apical domain formation in these cells is the relocation of the polarity protein PAR3.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fiji macro and quantification methods</title><p>To quantify membrane and cytoplasm repartition of proteins in oocytes, we developed a macro on Fiji (cf. Oocyte Analysis macro). In each oocyte, we selected three points (two on both sides of the anterior membrane and one in the middle of the posterior membrane). Four sections of its plasma membrane were then automatically generated (anterior; lateral 1; lateral 2; posterior) independently of the oocyte stage (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> for details). After delimitation of the plasma membrane with the plot profile tool, we obtained its intensity profile. After delimitation of each plasma membrane domain with the polygon tool, we obtained the mean fluorescent intensity and the length of these domains. The anterior signal corresponds to the signal from the APM of the oocyte and the signal from the plasma membrane of the neighbouring nurse cells. Therefore, for each oocyte individually, we quantified the mean fluorescent intensity of a simple and a double plasma membrane of adjacent nurse cells. We then removed, from the anterior signal, the mean fluorescent intensity of the nurse cell plasma membrane to precisely quantify the signal coming only from the APM of this oocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1-Figure supplement 3C</xref>). Finally, after delimitation of the cytoplasm, we obtained its mean signal intensity. For each oocyte individually, the measured intensity signals were normalised in two steps. First, all the raw quantities (grey level intensity) were divided by the total intensity in the oocyte (APM + PPM + LPM + cytoplasm). Second, the plasma membrane values were expressed in density, that is the length of the corresponding membranes that divides them (see intermediate quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This process was performed on each oocyte individually, and then the results were pooled by genotypes and/or conditions and/or developmental stages. In our representation of the density, only the plasma membrane domains are indicated and not the cytoplasm. So the density of the different cortical zones does not add up to 1. The quantity corresponds to the grey level intensity measured on the image. The density represents the same values divided by the length of corresponding membranes. Between stage 9A and a stage 10, the oocyte plasma membrane overgrows. The density shows how PAR3 are concentrated at the membrane by avoiding the oocyte and plasma membrane size variation. The posterior exclusion ratio is the ratio of LPM density on PPM density. The asymmetry ratio is the ratio of APM density on PPM density.</p><p>To quantify the colocalisation of PAR3 with other proteins, the Coloc two plugin (Fiji) was used. Oocytes (between 7 and 13) of several females per genotype were analysed; the cytoplasmic contour was delimited and the quantification was performed only for one plan in this zone. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PC) or the Manders overlap coefficient (MOC) was determined in single confocal images. The PC value ranges from −1 (no correlation) to +1 (complete correlation), with values in between indicating different degrees of partial correlation. The negative control was provided by quantifying Pearson’s coefficient for the same images, but after rotation of one by 90 degrees, a condition in which only random colocalisation is observed. The MOC measures the fraction of PAR3 signal overlapping with red signal and vice versa.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>Mutant <italic>sktl<sup>2.3</sup></italic> has been described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gervais et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>sktl<sup>∆5</sup></italic> in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hassan et al., 1998</xref>), and <italic>par-1<sup>w3</sup></italic> and <italic>par-1<sup>6323</sup></italic> in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shulman et al., 2000</xref>).

The sequence AttB used by the phiC31 integrase was inserted into the vector pPMW. The constructions were then integrated by transgenesis into the AttP2 site on chromosome III (BestGene).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Co-immunoprecipitation and western blot</title><p>Ovary extracts were obtained from wild type and DLIC-GFP transgenic flies by dissecting ovaries (20 flies per genotype) into PBS. Ovaries were placed on ice with lysis buffer (10 mM Tris/Cl pH7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 0.5 mM EDTA; 0.5% NP-40 with Complete Protease Inhibitor cocktail, Roche) and mechanically homogenised using micro pestles in matching tubes. S2-(DGRC (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_TZ72">CVCL_TZ72</ext-link>)) cell lysates were obtained after freeze-thaw lysis of cells transfected with GFP-SKTL with PAR3-HA. Ovaries and cells lysates were then spun at 16000 g for 10 min at 4°C. Using Chromotek standard procedures, the supernatant was collected and GFP-SKTL, PAR3-GFP, or DLIC-GFP were precipitated with 15 µL GFP-Trap_MA (Chromotek) magnetic beads for 2 h at 4°C with rotation. Input and bound fractions were analysed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting, using NuPage, 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Life technology). DLIC was detected using 1:5000 guinea pig anti-DLIC C-ter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Satoh et al., 2008</xref>), PAR3-HA using rabbit 1:5000 Anti-HA (GenWay), PAR3 using 1:500 rabbit anti-PAR3 N-ter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wodarz et al., 1999</xref>), PAR1 using 1:100 rabbit anti-PAR1 (Rb96, J. McDonald), GFP using 1:1000 mouse anti-GFP (Roche), or 1:5000 rabbit anti-GFP, Tubulin using 1:1000 mouse anti-tub (DM1A sigma). For the immunoprecipitation controls, we used PDI-GFP in fly extracts and GFP-SNAP (a kind gift from M. Sanial) in S2 cells extracts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Proteomic SKTL partner screen</title><p>S2 cells (S2-DGRC (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_TZ72">CVCL_TZ72</ext-link>) were transfected with SKTL-GFP vector or not (control) and harvested 3 days later. Protein extraction and immunoprecipitation were performed using Chromotek standard procedures. After trypsin digestion, the samples were analysed by a LTQ Velos Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Among the potential partners identified, we focused on two proteins: DLIC (one peptide identified not present in the control: SGSPGTGGPGGAGNPAGPGR score 80) and IKKε (two peptides identified not present in the control: VMQQQQQEVMAVMR and LLAIEEDQEGR, score 24).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>FRAP experiment</title><p>Egg chambers were dissected in Schneider’s Insect Medium supplemented with 13% FBS, 0.34 U/ml insulin. Egg chambers were cultured in a 150-µm-deep micro chamber filled with the same medium and sealed on one side with a 0.17 μm coverslip matching the characteristics of the facing objective lens, and a membrane permeable to oxygen on the other side. Imaging was carried out with spinning disk confocal (Axio Observer Z1 (Zeiss), Spinning Head CSU-X1, Camera sCMOS PRIME 95 (photometrics)) using a Plan-Apochromat 40×/1.25 oil objective lens. For each egg chamber, six prebleach images were taken. Then, the region of interest (ROI) corresponding to nurse cells and oocyte APM was scanned 25 times with the appropriate laser line at full laser power (473 nm) to photobleach GFP fluorescence. Fluorescence recovery into the ROI was monitored immediately after the bleach by time-lapse imaging at low-intensity illumination. Time-lapse recordings were processed with Fiji. The FRAP efficiency was controlled with the entire thickness of the sample.</p><p>The same experiment was realized on egg chambers treated with colcemid. The egg chambers were incubated for 30 min in Schneider medium, 2% FBS, 0.2 U/ml insulin with 0.82 µM of colcemid, before the onset of the FRAP experiment, and the egg chambers stayed in this medium during the fluorescence recovery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Endocytosis assay</title><p>To confirm the effect of RAB5DN expression on endocytosis, we performed an endocytosis assay using the lipophilic dye FM4-64 (Molecular probes). This dye partitions into membranes where it becomes fluorescent and can be internalised in the cell by endocytosis.</p><p>Egg chambers were dissected in Schneider’s Insect Medium supplemented with 20% FBS, 10 μg/ml of juvenile hormone, and 0.2 U/ml insulin. Next, they were incubated in the dark with the same medium +20 μM FM4-64 for 45 min at 25°C and then rinsed two times and washed for 15 min at 4°C in medium without FM4-64. The oocytes were immediately observed by confocal microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analysed using the Mann-Whitney test and were represented by box plot (with Tukey variation) thanks to Graphpad Prism 6.

These polarity proteins, and their mutual antagonism are critical to polarity establishment in a number of cell types and a variety of organisms. This is a highly significant topic and an understanding of this mechanism will be of interest to a wide audience.</p><p>The main focus of this paper is the mechanism by which Par3 is enriched along the anterior cortex of the oocyte and excluded from the posterior pole. Initial studies suggested that posterior exclusion was predominantly via Par1-mediated phosphorylation of Par3. The authors convincingly show that although this mechanism is important in stage 10 egg chambers, additional factors are also at play. The authors further suggest that Dynein, microtubules and endocytic trafficking are responsible for targeting Par3 to the anterior cortex. This latter point, however, is not convincingly supported by the data presented. In general, there are some very interesting findings in this paper. However, there are also major deficits in interpretation of results and in the controls that are used. Ideally, these issues would be fixed prior to publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors conclude that Par3 interacts with Dlic. The interaction is very hard to appreciate from the data that is presented. The enrichment of the Par3 bands in the &quot;+&quot; lane is barely above background. Secondly, why are there four bands corresponding to Par3? Are these degradation products or splice isoforms? According to FlyBase, the four isoforms of Par3 have sizes of 157, 163, 161 and 159 kD. That is not what we see here. The most prominent band appears to be around 55kD. The Par3-HA band that is shown in Figure 4G is around 250kD.</p><p>Figure 3. Par3-GFP is found to accumulate in small vesicles that are positive for π (4,5)P2. This appears convincing. However, the authors go on to state that these same vesicles are also positive for Rab5 and Rab11. The localization of Rab5 and Rab11 to these vesicles is not nearly as convincing. The authors have done a good job of quantifying the localization of Par3 along the membrane. It would be good to also quantify the co-localization of Rab5 and Rab11 with these Par3-GFP vesicles (for instance using a Pearson's coefficient analysis).</p><p>The connection between SKTL activity and Par3 localization is convincing. The authors then go on to state that protein interaction partners of SKTL were identified using purification and mass spectrometry. However, the data for this mass spec experiment is not shown. How many peptides of Par3 were found in the SKTL pellet in comparison to the control? The authors then go on to validate this interaction. For this experiment, they used S2 cells. What was the rationale for using S2 cells? All of the rest of the experiments were performed in the ovary. Does this interaction occur in ovarian lysates? An additional point about experimental setup. The negative control for this experiment appears to be &quot;no antibody&quot;. A better negative control would be to use cells or extracts expressing GFP alone.</p><p>The authors conclude that IKKε regulates transport of recycling endosomes in the oocyte. Although this is possible, the data that is presented do not provide proof of this. What is shown is that depletion of IKKε results in abnormal actin structures at the anterior of the oocyte that also contain Rab11. The images presented are from fixed samples that are stained with antibody. The authors suggest that these vesicles are formed due to blocking of an unloading step. While this is certainly possible, the data only addresses localization.</p><p>The authors suggest that when the anterior (high)-posterior (low) distribution of Par3 is altered, oocyte polarity is affected and the oocyte nucleus is mis-localized. However, from Figure 2 it appears that Latrunculin treatment affects this Par3 AP distribution to a greater extent than Colchicin treatment. Yet, the oocyte nucleus is localized under Latrunculin conditions but delocalized under Colchicin treatment conditions. This does not seem consistent.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this study, Julie and coworkers quantify the plasma membrane distribution of Par3 in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocyte as it matures. During this process, Par3 becomes excluded from the posterior (PPM) and accumulates at the anterior plasma membrane (APM). In addition to the well-known effects of Par1, the authors report that exclusion from the PPM depends on Rab5 and PIP2-dependent endocytosis. They also argue that microtubules and dynein are required for transport to the APM, where it is unloaded through an IKK-related kinase. Interestingly, they show that Par3 can bind to Sktl, a PI4P5-kinase.</p><p>This is an interesting study and the careful quantification of Par3 localization is a useful approach. However, I found the work overall to be rather diffuse and the interpretations were highly over-stated. At a general level, it is not clear to me how the authors know that Par3 is in fact being transported from the PPM to the APM – each event (loss from the PPM and accumulation at the APM) could be independent of one another, and this possibility is not excluded in this study. Indeed, there does not seem to be any net gain of Par3 at the APM from stages 8 – 10 (Figure 1). Par3 association with membranes is highly dynamic, through a process likely controlled by phospho-inositide binding, oligomerization, and phosphorylation. It might diffuse through the cytoplasm and simply bind to any membrane with high levels of PIP2. In addition, new Par3 protein could be delivered from the nurse cells.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The studies of the role of actin and microtubules are rather superficial – for instance the actin data are based only on latrunculin treatment, and the authors assume, based only on the similar phenotype induced by loss of Par1 or expression of a non-phosphorylatable Par3, that the actin network is mediating the effects of Par1 on Par3. This is not a valid conclusion – the same phenotype could be generated through 2 independent mechanisms.</p><p>2) Figure 2J (co-IP of Par3 with DLIC-GFP) is not convincing. The negative control lane input is lower than the positive. Also, a better negative control is needed (another GFP fusion protein); the DLIC-GFP input needs to be shown; and some evidence that the indicated bands actually represent Par3 needs to be provided. And in Figure 2—figure supplement 2B an input control is needed.</p><p>3) Figure 3. The authors claim that Par3 particles are associated with PIP2-containing membranes and that Par3 is removed from the PPM by endocytosis on Rab5/PIP2 endosomes, but in Figure 3, most of the Par3 in cytoplasmic spots is NOT associated with Rab5 OR PIP2; and the single Rab5+ vesicle is much larger than any of the PIP2 positive spots. Overall, these data do not agree with the stated hypothesis. The staining for Rab5 and Rab11 is also very diffuse – it would be better to use FP-tagged Rabs for this type of experiment.</p><p>4) In Figure 3—figure supplement 1, how do we know the antibodies are specific? – the HRS antibody does not seem to detect vesicles.; and the syntaxin16 antibody decorates the plasma membrane but no detectable trans-Golgi.</p><p>5) The interaction between SKTL and Par3 is based only on over-expressed proteins. The blot needs the GFP-SKTl input and a better (GFP fusion) negative control. Also, I could not find data to support the contention that Par3 forms a tripartite complex with SKTL and PIP2, as is stated in subsection “SKTL and PAR3 act in synergy to form vesicular platforms”. The authors also suggest that Par3 could regulate SKTL activity, and that this would provide a positive feedback loop, but again without any supporting evidence.</p><p>6) In Figure 5 it looks as though the mutant SKTL is expressed at lower levels than the WT. Could this, rather than loss of kinase activity, explain the lower GFP-Par3 in cytoplasmic spots? The colocalization with Rab5 and 11 is not convincing. Moreover, it looks as though the aAPM has disintegrated – is this not an issue with interpretation of the data?</p><p>7) Finally, I think it is premature to conclude much from the IKK-eta data – clearly knockdown generates some kind of cytoplasmic inclusion in the oocytes, that accumulate actin and Rab11, but it’s not clear what they are; and since Par3-GFP is still strongly accumulated all over the plasma membrane, including the APM (Figure 6A – I), I don't think that it is clear that IKKe is necessary for unloading it from microtubules.</p><p>8) In general, the authors seem to interpret their data as if Par3 is an integral membrane protein that is being endocytosed and transported by the microtubule machinery, but of course it is not – it is a peripheral protein that associates with negatively-charged phospholipids in a highly dynamic way and is presumably able to diffuse through the cytoplasm between vesicles and plasma membrane.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Jouette and colleagues have examined mechanisms that position the polarity protein Baz/Par-3 in a well-established model of cell polarization, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocyte. They examine a number of mechanisms involved in the cortical removal, sub-cellular trafficking and intracellular compartment release of Baz. The trafficking of Baz through the cytosol is poorly understood, and the results of this paper make significant advances in elucidating this process. However, major concerns should be addressed.</p><p>Major concerns</p><p>1) All of the Baz distributions are determined with an over-expressed Baz construct. Thus, it is unclear how relevant identified mechanisms are for endogenous levels of the protein. The newly identified mechanisms should be additionally evaluated with probes for endogenous Baz (using either Baz antibodies or an available Baz-GFP gene trap line).</p><p>2) Connections between the mechanisms that remove Baz from the cortex are unclear. Possible connections should be investigated with the tools already used to determine if the mechanisms are independent or interdependent.</p><p>2.1) Abnormal Baz accumulations arise along the later cortex with dynein RNAi. Are these accumulations dependent on cortical removal steps mediated by Par-1, PIP2 or Rab5? Perturbations of these proteins in pair-wise combinations could reveal dependent or independent cortical removal mechanisms.</p><p>2.2) Skittles overexpression is shown to increase the removal of Baz from the posterior domain. Does this removal require Par-1 or Rab-5? Again, combining the Skittles overexpression with the Par-1 RNAi or the Rab5DN could address how interdependent the removal mechanisms are.</p><p>3) Since Baz becomes isotropic around the cortex with IKK-epsilon knock down, does IKK-epsilon also play a role in the removal of Baz from the posterior cortex? If IKK-epsilon only promoted delivery to the anterior cortex, then removal from the posterior would still be expected. Some assessment of IKK-epsilon's direct or indirect role at the posterior would be expected within the overall context of the paper.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Dynein-mediated transport and membrane trafficking control PAR3 polarised distribution&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript (an earlier version of which which has been previously reviewed by <italic>eLife</italic> but is now being treated as a new submission rather than a resubmission) provides evidence for a pathway that polarizes the distribution of Baz (Par-3) across the <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocyte, an important model of cell polarity. The model is an interesting and, if fully supported by the data, would be appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, there are significant concerns that would need to be addressed before it could be accepted.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Generally, the quality of the biochemical evidence is not as strong as it should be. For example, in Figure 7E and F, the IPs of GFP-SKTL testing for pull-down of PAR3 and DLIC, the control was no addition of GFP antibody. Since addition of antibodies can increase non-specific binding, the better control is to IP an irrelevant GFP protein with the GFP antibody (as done in Figure 7D). Especially when the protein interaction they are trying to show is weak, good controls are required.</p><p>Even in 7D, which does have an appropriate control, the co-IP is pretty weak. This does not invalidate it, but it should be acknowledged in the text.</p><p>In the earlier version it was unclear that the 250kD band that was observed on western blots actually corresponded to Par3. The authors have used RNAi strains to address this point and the conclusion is a bit more convincing. It is still hard to fully appreciate, though. For instance, in Figure 7—figure supplement 2, a strain over-expressing Par3-GFP using the UAS-Gal4 driver is used. These embryos should be expressing a relatively high level of Par-GFP. In the total fraction from these embryos the most prominent band is around 100kD when probed with a Par3 antibody. However, this band is hard to detect with the GFP antibody. In fact, it is hard to see any bands in the GFP blot. Next, the sample was immunoprecipitated. It is unclear from the legend which antibody (Par3 or GFP) was used in the IP. In the immunoprecipitated fractions, the most prominent band is the 250kD band. The band is reduced in the strain expressing Par3 RNAi but it is not clear how it can be detected so prominently in the IP fraction when the same isoform is a minor species at best in the total fraction. Is the IP antibody somehow specifically precipitating an oligomeric form? The experiment with the endogenously expressed BAC-based Par3-GFP construct is more convincing.</p><p>2) Another major issue is the over-reliance on overexpressed Par3. Key results should be repeated to look at endogenous Par3 expression. For example, are the Par3-positive cytoplasmic particles, and effects on these particles, observed when Par3 is expressed by its own regulatory regions? Without this additional data, there is a risk that the effects they report are artifacts of overexpression.</p><p>3) The results using a dominant negative rab5 should be confirmed with an shRNA construct (available from Bloomington). There is a risk that the DN might produce off target effects.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40212.057</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers.

We provide a new blot presented in the Figure 7. In the course of those new experiments, as our previous PAR3 antibody made in rat was ran out, we have used a different PAR3 antibody produced in rabbit and kindly provided by A. Wodarz. We still observed several bands between 250 and 115 kDA. We can see that one of these bands (250kDa) immunoprecipitates with DLIC and this immunoprecipitation is reproducible. We have verified that this band corresponds to PAR3 and not to a non-specific protein. For this extend, we used a <italic>Drosophila</italic> line that produces PAR3-GFP at an endogenous level, and we revealed, after western blot on ovarian extracts, PAR3 with PAR3 antibody or with a GFP antibody. To better visualize PAR3, we have also realised an IP with the same extracts. The &gt;250 kDa band is detected by PAR3 and GFP antibodies, indicating that the 250kDa band is really PAR3 (Figure 7—figure supplement 2). Furthermore, we have also validated the specificity of PAR3 antibody by monitoring PAR3 knockdown after RNAi. (Figure 7—figure supplement 2). The abnormal weight of PAR3 could be explained by the presence of a dimeric form of PAR3, the oligomerisation of PAR3 being already described (Benton and St Johnston, 2003; Dickinson et al., 2017; Kullmann and Krahn, 2018). Moreover, high molecular weight bands are also shown in several papers without explanations (Krahn et al., 2010; Krahn et al., 2009).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 3. Par3-GFP is found to accumulate in small vesicles that are positive for π (4,5)P2. This appears convincing. However, the authors go on to state that these same vesicles are also positive for Rab5 and Rab11. The localization of Rab5 and Rab11 to these vesicles is not nearly as convincing. The authors have done a good job of quantifying the localization of Par3 along the membrane. It would be good to also quantify the co-localization of Rab5 and Rab11 with these Par3-GFP vesicles (for instance using a Pearson's coefficient analysis).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have quantified the colocalisation of PAR3 with PI(4,5)P2, RAB5 and RAB11 vesicles. The Pearson’s coefficient was obtained by using the FiJi Macro Coloc2 on our images. The negative control was provided by quantifying colocalisation for the same images, but after rotation of one by 90 degrees, a condition in which only random colocalisation is observed. The results are now presented in the manuscript Figure 5A. As indicated in the text, the PAR3 particles do not colocalise with the endoplasmic reticulum (KDEL), the Golgi apparatus (SYX16) or late endosomes (HRS). However, they colocalise with PI(4,5)P2 and RAB5 enriched compartments and to a lesser extent with RAB11 enriched compartments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The connection between SKTL activity and Par3 localization is convincing. The authors then go on to state that protein interaction partners of SKTL were identified using purification and mass spectrometry. However, the data for this mass spec experiment is not shown. How many peptides of Par3 were found in the SKTL pellet in comparison to the control? The authors then go on to validate this interaction. For this experiment, they used S2 cells.

An additional point about experimental setup. The negative control for this experiment appears to be &quot;no antibody&quot;. A better negative control would be to use cells or extracts expressing GFP alone.</p></disp-quote><p>We feel that the reviewer has misinterpreted our results. We have performed a proteomic screen to identify some SKTL partners but we do not found PAR3. We have found DLIC and IKKε amongst others. However, as suggested by the reviewer, we have added for DLIC and IKKε the mass spec data in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>“DLIC: SGSPGTGGPGGAGNPAGPGR score 80.</p><p>IKKε: VMQQQQQEVMAVMR and LLAIEEDQEGR score 24.</p><p>The mass spectrometry experiment has been performed by using S2 cells extract. We agree with the reviewer that this experiment would be more informative if we had been able to use ovarian extract. The expression of GFP-SKTL is particularly deleterious in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocyte and we cannot perform the immunoprecipitation (IP) with SKTL overexpressed extract. We tried to immunoprecipitate a GFP-SKTL form produced at endogenous level in a CRISPR transgenic line without success. Moreover, the SKTL antibody is not good enough to use it. Therefore, we used S2 cells to realize this mass spectrometry experiment. However, to validate the interaction between PAR3 and DLIC, we performed the IP with ovarian extracts.</p><p>These peptides are not present in control.”</p><p>Concerning the negative control of this experiment, we have realized two different types of control. As suggested by the reviewer, we have tested the IP with another GFP transgene (PDI-GFP) and have observed no co-IP of PAR3 or DLIC. But we have also performed the co-IP on the same extract with or without anti-GFP antibody. We had chosen to show this last control because if we overexpressed one of these proteins, we can modify the migration profile of others. For example, PAR3 expression modifies the migration profile of DLIC and conversely (variation of postraductional modifications or change in isoforms ratio). We feel that it can be hazardous to compare two wells in which the protein contents are very different. In the case of DLIC/PAR3 IP (Figure 7D), we show now the IP of DLIC-GFP and in control the IP of PDI-GFP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors conclude that IKKε regulates transport of recycling endosomes in the oocyte. Although this is possible, the data that is presented do not provide proof of this. What is shown is that depletion of IKKε results in abnormal actin structures at the anterior of the oocyte that also contain Rab11. The images presented are from fixed samples that are stained with antibody. The authors suggest that these vesicles are formed due to blocking of an unloading step. While this is certainly possible, the data only addresses localization.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this experiment is indicative, but is not sufficient to support a strong conclusion. Our conclusions on recycling endosome transport are built upon confocal analysis on fixed issues and not through live imaging analysis. The published data concerning IKKε functions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> bristles report that IKKε regulates the localisation of RAB11 and Dynein along with the rapid shuttling of recycling endosomes (Otani et al., 2015; Otani et al., 2011). The activation of IKKε by a local phosphorylation and, the spNF interaction with IKKε and dynein are conserved between bristle and oocyte in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Amsalem et al., 2013; Otani et al., 2015). With our results, we can conclude that microtubules are important to the accumulation of RAB11 positive-vesicles near the microtubules minus ends as it has been reported in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> bristles. But we cannot conclude to a direct transport of endosomes on microtubules; we can only indicate that our, like the others suggest this point. So as requested by the reviewer we have modified this point in the Results section of the new version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors suggest that when the anterior (high)-posterior (low) distribution of Par3 is altered, oocyte polarity is affected and the oocyte nucleus is mis-localized. However, from Figure 2 it appears that Latrunculin treatment affects this Par3 AP distribution to a greater extent than Colchicin treatment. Yet, the oocyte nucleus is localized under Latrunculin conditions but delocalized under Colchicin treatment conditions. This does not seem consistent.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important point. Indeed, what seems important to maintain a correct polarity within the oocyte (with the nucleus positioning as readout), is the PAR3 asymmetry between the anterior and posterior rather than the posterior exclusion of PAR3 stricto senso. For example, in presence of latrunculin, the posterior exclusion of PAR3 is affected but its anterior accumulation a very little. Thus, the ratio between anterior and posterior remains high, and the nucleus is well located. However, in presence of colchicin, the posterior exclusion is always observable but there is no/weak anterior accumulation. So, the ant/post ratio is weak and the nucleus is mispositionned. In the Figure 2, the ant/post ratio (asymmetry ratio) is not indicated and we propose to add this to Figure 2 in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this study, Julie and coworkers quantify the plasma membrane distribution of Par3 in the Drosophila oocyte as it matures. During this process, Par3 becomes excluded from the posterior (PPM) and accumulates at the anterior plasma membrane (APM). In addition to the well-known effects of Par1, the authors report that exclusion from the PPM depends on Rab5 and PIP2-dependent endocytosis. They also argue that microtubules and dynein are required for transport to the APM, where it is unloaded through an IKK-related kinase. Interestingly, they show that Par3 can bind to Sktl, a PI4P5-kinase.</p><p>This is an interesting study and the careful quantification of Par3 localization is a useful approach. However, I found the work overall to be rather diffuse and the interpretations were highly over-stated. At a general level, it is not clear to me how the authors know that Par3 is in fact being transported from the PPM to the APM – each event (loss from the PPM and accumulation at the APM) could be independent of one another, and this possibility is not excluded in this study. Indeed, there does not seem to be any net gain of Par3 at the APM from stages 8 – 10 (Figure 1). Par3 association with membranes is highly dynamic, through a process likely controlled by phospho-inositide binding, oligomerization, and phosphorylation. It might diffuse through the cytoplasm and simply bind to any membrane with high levels of PIP2. In addition, new Par3 protein could be delivered from the nurse cells.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises two very important points concerning PAR3 localisation mechanism.</p><p>The first point concerns the posterior PAR3 accumulation and the origin of its accumulation. Currently we present the PAR3 quantification, normalised to the total amount of signal in the oocyte and related to the membrane length (density). This representation avoids some fluctuations associated to the membrane growth during oogenesis or to experimental procedures but also allows us to compare different genotypes. Thus, in our graphs, we can follow the evolution of asymmetry, but we cannot compare the quantity between different stages. To respond to the reviewer, we have added a new graph with the raw data of PAR3 quantity (grey levels) in oocyte (Figure 1D). We have also presented in sup data an intermediate step of the quantification in which PAR3 density are shown without normalisation (Figure 1—figure supplement 2).</p><p>So, we can observe a strong enrichment of PAR3 at the APM from stage 8 to 10. We can also observe the posterior exclusion of PAR3, at a lower level because of the small size of the posterior domain compared to the anterior domain. The PAR3 APM accumulation can arise in part from the oocyte but also from the nurse cells that transcript PAR3. There is no PAR3 transcription in oocyte, so the contribution of oocyte to the APM accumulation can be only associated with a relocalisation of PAR3 protein. In order to identify the oocyte contribution to the PAR3 anterior accumulation, we performed FRAP experiments on GFP-PAR3 expressed in the oocyte and the nurse cells at stage 9. We suppressed the GFP-PAR3 fluorescence at the APM and in all the nurse cells. Next, we followed the fluorescence recovery to the APM before the recurrence of GFP-PAR3 in the nurse cells due to neosynthesis. We can observe the recovery of the APM signal, which is correlated with a posterior fluorescence decrease. This new result is presented in Figure 8. It suggests that among the fraction of PAR3 accumulated at the APM at least a part of it corresponds to PAR3 already present in oocyte. This process depends on microtubules because if the same experiment is performed in presence of colcemid, the level of recovery is severely affected.</p><p>The second point raised by the reviewer concerns the surprising association of PAR3 with membrane. The localisation of PAR3 at the right place does not necessarily require association with membranes. PAR3 could simply diffuse in the cytoplasm. In this work, we do not demonstrate that a membrane association is important to the targeting of PAR3 to the APM. However, we show that i) PAR3 colocalises with PI(4.5)P2 enriched vesicles and that the PI5K SKTL is crucial to the polarised localisation of PAR3, ii) the vesicular trafficking is also important to this localisation and iii) the kinase IKKε which is previously shown implicated in the recycling endosome release of the dynein motor, strongly modifies the PAR3 polarity. Thus, it seems that PAR3 has close links with the vesicular trafficking. We cannot exclude the possibility that PAR3 associates with all PI(4,5)P2 enriched membranes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The studies of the role of actin and microtubules are rather superficial – for instance the actin data are based only on latrunculin treatment, and the authors assume, based only on the similar phenotype induced by loss of Par1 or expression of a non-phosphorylatable Par3, that the actin network is mediating the effects of Par1 on Par3. This is not a valid conclusion – the same phenotype could be generated through 2 independent mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>Actin plays a role in the PAR3 distribution control. But we do not know by which mechanism. The actin cytoskeleton controls the polarised localisation of PAR1 (Doerflinger et al., 2006) but also regulate the endocytosis trafficking (Mooren et al., 2012). The two being important for the localisation of PAR3, we cannot conclude on a direct or indirect role of actin on PAR3. This point has been removed from the result section and is addressed only in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2J (co-IP of Par3 with DLIC-GFP) is not convincing. The negative control lane input is lower than the positive. Also, a better negative control is needed (another GFP fusion protein); the DLIC-GFP input needs to be shown; and some evidence that the indicated bands actually represent Par3 needs to be provided. And in Figure 2—figure supplement 2B an input control is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have reiterated several times the IP experience of DLICGFP to validate the interaction between DLIC and Par3. We provide a new blot presented in the Figure 8. In the course of those new experiments, as our previous PAR3 antibody made in rat was ran out, we have used a different PAR3 antibody produced in rabbit and kindly provided by A. Wodarz.</p><p>Concerning the negative control of this experiment, we have realized two different types of control. As suggested by the reviewer, we have tested the IP with another GFP transgene (PDI-GFP) and have observed no co-IP of PAR3 or DLIC. But we have also performed the co-IP on the same extract with or without anti-GFP antibody. We have chosen to show this last control because if we overexpressed one of these proteins, we can modify the migration profile of others. For example, PAR3 expression modifies the migration profile of DLIC and conversely (variation of postraductional modifications or change in isoforms ratio). In this case, it can be hazardous to compare two wells in which the protein contents are very different. In the case of DLIC/PAR3 IP (Figure 7D), we show now the IP of DLIC-GFP and in control the IP of PDI-GFP.</p><p>Although this PAR3 antibody is published, we have further addressed its specificity on PAR3. We have used a <italic>Drosophila</italic> strain that express PAR3-GFP on its own promoter and in absence of endogenous PAR3: BAC PAR3GFP = P[w+, FRT9-2]18E, f, PAR3[815.8], P{CaryP, PB[BAC PAR3- sfGFP2]attP18} (Besson et al., 2015). We have compared the PAR3 protein profile revealed with anti-PAR3 antibody or with anti-GFP antibody. Furthermore, we have also validated the specificity of this antibody by monitoring PAR3 knockdown after RNAi.</p><p>This new result is presented in Figure 7—figure supplement 2. As requested by the reviewer we added an input control (using α-tubulin) in Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 3. The authors claim that Par3 particles are associated with PIP2-containing membranes and that Par3 is removed from the PPM by endocytosis on Rab5/PIP2 endosomes, but in Figure 3, most of the Par3 in cytoplasmic spots is NOT associated with Rab5 OR PIP2; and the single Rab5+ vesicle is much larger than any of the PIP2 positive spots. Overall, these data do not agree with the stated hypothesis. The staining for Rab5 and Rab11 is also very diffuse – it would be better to use FP-tagged Rabs for this type of experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified the amount of PAR3 that colocalises with PIP2 and RAB5 positive particles (by using Manders coefficient / Coloc2 plugin in Fiji). We observed that around 50% of PAR3 co localise with PI(4,5)P2 and 50% co localise with RAB5. We do not know if it is the same 50%. We show in this study that RAB5 is as crucial to the posterior exclusion of PAR3 than the PI5Kinase SKTL. The endocytosis seems important to the exclusion however, we cannot conclude on a direct association of PAR3 with the budding vesicle or on a later association with RAB5 positive vesicles. We have added these news results in the Results section.</p><p>The RAB proteins have been tagged with YFP at their endogenous chromosomal loci (Dunst et al., 2015). Like described by Dunst et al., the fluorescence of RAB proteins is very weak in the oocyte and in order to observe it, we must use an anti-GFP antibody to enhance the detection. Unfortunately, this would prevent us from performing a colocalisation with PARGFP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 3—figure supplement 1, how do we know the antibodies are specific? – the HRS antibody does not seem to detect vesicles.; and the syntaxin16 antibody decorates the plasma membrane but no detectable trans-Golgi.</p></disp-quote><p>The antibody anti-HRS and anti-syntaxin16 were now well referenced in the Materials and methods section. The anti-HRS antibody is a gift of H. Bellen and was published in “Hrs Regulates Endosome Membrane Invagination and Tyrosine Kinase Receptor Signaling in <italic>Drosophila”</italic> by (Lloyd et al., 2002). This antibody detects very well the vesicles in follicular cells but there are clearly less vesicles in the oocyte.</p><p>The anti-syntaxin16 stained Golgi and lysosome compartments (Akbar et al., 2009). From the stage 9, Golgi begins to accumulate in the subcortical region (Lee and Cooley, 2007). Nevertheless, now we show a magnification on cytoplasm where we can observe some vesicles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The interaction between SKTL and Par3 is based only on over-expressed proteins. The blot needs the GFP-SKTl input and a better (GFP fusion) negative control. Also, I could not find data to support the contention that Par3 forms a tripartite complex with SKTL and PIP2, as is stated in subsection “SKTL and PAR3 act in synergy to form vesicular platforms”. The authors also suggest that Par3 could regulate SKTL activity, and that this would provide a positive feedback loop, but again without any supporting evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the input of the samples, and a control with a GFP alone, rather than a control without anti-GFP.</p><p>Concerning the second point, indeed we had no evidence of a tripartite complex. We quantified the colocalisation of PAR3 with PI(4,5)P2 or SKTL (Menders coefficient). Around 50% of PAR3 colocalise with PI(4,5)P2 or SKTL. Since we performed a colocalisation of PAR3, SKTL and PI(4,5)P2 and the result is presented in Figure 3G.</p><p>Finally, we have suppressed the positive feedback loop hypothesis of the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 5 it looks as though the mutant SKTL is expressed at lower levels than the WT. Could this, rather than loss of kinase activity, explain the lower GFP-Par3 in cytoplasmic spots? The colocalization with Rab5 and 11 is not convincing. Moreover, it looks as though the aAPM has disintegrated – is this not an issue with interpretation of the data?</p></disp-quote><p>The Myc-SKTL and Myc-SKTL<sup>DNRQ</sup> transgenes are inserted at the same site in the genome thanks to phiC31 integrase system (chromosome 3L, position 68A4). The expression of these two transgenes are thus of the same level. We have performed a western blot on ovary extracts and quantified with α-tubulin as loading control.</p><p>The results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40212.052</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Our results show that the mutant form is more stable than wild type.</title><p>Thus, the absences of effect of DNRQ form cannot be explain by protein instability.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40212-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>In order to clarify the results concerning the colocalisations, we have quantified the colocalisation of PAR3 with RAB5 and RAB11 vesicles. The Pearson’s coefficient was obtained by using the FiJi Macro Coloc2 on our images. The negative control was provided by quantifying colocalisation for the same images, but after rotation of one by 90 degrees, a condition in which only random colocalisation is observed. The results are now presented in the manuscript Figure 6A. We have also added, in the result part, the quantification of PAR3 that colocalises with RAB5 or RAB11 (Manders ‘s coefficient).</p><p>We agree with the reviewer on the difficulties to visualise the APM in Figure 5G. It is just because the plasma membrane is refolded and appears in XY plan. For clarity, this image has been removed with this new version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Finally, I think it is premature to conclude much from the IKK-eta data – clearly knockdown generates some kind of cytoplasmic inclusion in the oocytes, that accumulate actin and Rab11, but it’s not clear what they are; and since Par3-GFP is still strongly accumulated all over the plasma membrane, including the APM (Figure 6A – I), I don't think that it is clear that IKKe is necessary for unloading it from microtubules.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reorganised the text concerning IKKe in the result section, we have simplified the conclusion and remove the interpretations. From our results, we can conclude that <italic>ikke</italic> knockdown leads to the accumulation of (PI,4,5)P2 et RAB11 enriched vesicles at the MT minus end and that the PI(4,5)P2 and microtubules are required to this accumulation.</p><p>Moreover, PAR distribution is strongly affected by this knockdown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In general, the authors seem to interpret their data as if Par3 is an integral membrane protein that is being endocytosed and transported by the microtubule machinery, but of course it is not – it is a peripheral protein that associates with negatively-charged phospholipids in a highly dynamic way and is presumably able to diffuse through the cytoplasm between vesicles and plasma membrane.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewer and we have modified the Discussion section:</p><p>“Although PAR3 does not need a priori an association with membrane to be transported, we found it very frequently close to endocytic membranes. PAR3 on the endosome could be a passenger of the vesicles, which are then transported to the anterior. In parallel, PAR3 could also control its own association with vesicles. Indeed, we hypothesize PAR3 could recruit SKTL that in return produces PI(4,5)P2 that stabilises PAR3 to the membrane and recruits the vesicle budding machinery.” We do not exclude that PAR3 associates with vesicles by simple electrostatic interactions without going by endocytosis. However, the formation of the endocytosis vesicles seems to be important to the final distribution of PAR3.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Jouette and colleagues have examined mechanisms that position the polarity protein Baz/Par-3 in a well-established model of cell polarization, the Drosophila oocyte. They examine a number of mechanisms involved in the cortical removal, sub-cellular trafficking and intracellular compartment release of Baz. The trafficking of Baz through the cytosol is poorly understood, and the results of this paper make significant advances in elucidating this process. However, major concerns should be addressed.</p><p>Major concerns</p><p>1) All of the Baz distributions are determined with an over-expressed Baz construct. Thus, it is unclear how relevant identified mechanisms are for endogenous levels of the protein. The newly identified mechanisms should be additionally evaluated with probes for endogenous Baz (using either Baz antibodies or an available Baz-GFP gene trap line).</p></disp-quote><p>To identify and to characterize the PAR3 regulation mechanism, firstly we have used a <italic>Drosophila</italic> strain that expresses PAR3-GFP on its own promoter and in absence of endogenous PAR3: BAC PAR3GFP = P[w+, FRT9-2]18E, f, baz[815.8], P{CaryP, PB[BAC Baz- sfGFP2]attP18} (Besson et al., 2015). The level of expression is clearly weaker than with UAS PAR3-GFP expression. We have not used thereafter this strain during this study because of the ubiquitous expression of PAR3. Indeed, the accumulation of PAR3 at the apex of somatic follicular cells around the oocyte masks the potential localisation of PAR3 at the plasma membrane of oocyte, the two membranes being very close. For the same raison, we did not employ PAR3-GFP trap line. Then, the use of antibody is not so easy in oocyte. The follicular cells layer is a natural barrier that prevents the antibody penetration. To stain PAR3, we must permeabilize the membrane with 0,3% Triton X-100 detergent, and the final staining is not enough reproducible to precise quantification.</p><p>To clarify this interesting point, we have added images of these experiments in the Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, and precise in the text why we do not continue with these transgenic lines.</p><p>In this study, we have used a UAS PAR3-GFP line, expressed with a line in which GAL4 is expressed under the control of maternal α tubulin promoter. Thus, in this condition, PAR3 is expressed only in germline cells and not in follicular cells. We have verified that PAR3GFP expression did not induce phenotype like nucleus mispositioning and we have controlled that the mechanisms described here was always saturable by a PAR3 expression increase. We agree with the reviewer that our conditions are not the best, but it is the one that we can use to answer to this precise question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Connections between the mechanisms that remove Baz from the cortex are unclear. Possible connections should be investigated with the tools already used to determine if the mechanisms are independent or interdependent.</p><p>2.1) Abnormal Baz accumulations arise along the later cortex with dynein RNAi. Are these accumulations dependent on cortical removal steps mediated by Par-1, PIP2 or Rab5? Perturbations of these proteins in pair-wise combinations could reveal dependent or independent cortical removal mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we tried to combine the perturbations induced by these proteins on PAR3 localisation despite the genetic association difficulties.</p><p>First of all, to test whether PAR3 accumulation along the lateral cortex observed in <italic>dhc64c</italic> knockdown was dependent on PAR1, we expressed PAR3-GFP with RNAi PAR1 and RNAi DHC64c. The combined expression of these transgenes strongly affects the morphology and the development of the egg chamber. As it can be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>), the oocyte in the egg chamber present an abnormal small size compared to the nurse cells. Moreover, this phenotype is also observed and seems stronger, when PAR3AA (a form non phosphorylable by PAR1) is overexpressed in <italic>dhc64c</italic> knock-down context. These kinds of phenotypes are usually related to a defect in the growth of the oocyte due to a transport failure from the nurse cells to the oocyte. Unfortunately, these interactions make it difficult to quantify PAR3 polarity during oogenesis and it is therefore difficult to conclude about the interdependence between these mechanisms.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40212.053</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40212-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><p>We also tried to test the interdependence between DHC64c and SKTL, or RAB5. Sadly, the expression of RNAi DHC64c with either RAB5 DN (Dominant Negative) or in context <italic>sktl</italic> mutant, disorganise the structure of the egg chamber making the quantification impossible. To test the involvement of endocytosis in these processes, we also used the drug dynasore, which is an inhibitor of dynamin and thus of the endocytosis vesicle scission. However, this drug is associated with pleiotropic phenotypes in the oocyte and we were not able to answer this point to the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.2) Skittles overexpression is shown to increase the removal of Baz from the posterior domain. Does this removal require Par-1 or Rab-5? Again, combining the Skittles overexpression with the Par-1 RNAi or the Rab5DN could address how interdependent the removal mechanisms are.</p></disp-quote><p>We also tried to address the interdependence between SKTL and PAR1 or RAB5 for PAR3 posterior exclusion.</p><p>Firstly, we combined the expression of SKTL (UAS-myc-SKTL) with PAR1 knockdown (UAS RNAi PAR1) and we observed a genetic interaction between them concerning PAR3 posterior exclusion. We showed that SKTL overexpression is always able to exclude PAR3 of the posterior in PAR1 RNAi knockdown. The same observation was realised by using PAR3 AA mutant form (non phosphorylable by PAR1). This new data is presented Figure 4.</p><p>To observe the interdependence between SKTL and RAB5, we expressed PAR3-GFP with Myc-SKTL and RAB5DN (Dominant Negative). However, as illustrated in the image below, the expression of all these proteins induces precocious oogenesis defects.

If IKK-epsilon only promoted delivery to the anterior cortex, then removal from the posterior would still be expected. Some assessment of IKK-epsilon's direct or indirect role at the posterior would be expected within the overall context of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>The kinase IKKε has a role probably more complex that the one described in this work. It seems for example, to have a slight effect on PAR1 posterior localisation. Therefore, we have chosen to focus on the already described phenotype of IKKε, the ectopic accumulation of RAB11 cargo at the microtubule minus ends (Otani et al., 2011).</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This manuscript (an earlier version of which which has been previously reviewed by eLife but is now being treated as a new submission rather than a resubmission) provides evidence for a pathway that polarizes the distribution of Baz (Par-3) across the Drosophila oocyte, an important model of cell polarity. The model is an interesting and, if fully supported by the data, would be appropriate for publication in eLife. However, there are significant concerns that would need to be addressed before it could be accepted.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Generally, the quality of the biochemical evidence is not as strong as it should be. For example, in Figure 7E and F, the IPs of GFP-SKTL testing for pull-down of PAR3 and DLIC, the control was no addition of GFP antibody. Since addition of antibodies can increase non-specific binding, the better control is to IP an irrelevant GFP protein with the GFP antibody (as done in Figure 7D). Especially when the protein interaction they are trying to show is weak, good controls are required.</p></disp-quote><p>The immunoprecipitation experiment was reiterated with another GFP-protein in control (GFP-SNAP). The GFP-SNAP protein does not precipitate PAR3 or DLIC. The new IP blot is presented in Figure 7E and the charge control has been added in Figure 7—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Even in 7D, which does have an appropriate control, the co-IP is pretty weak. This does not invalidate it, but it should be acknowledged in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>This precision has been added in subsection “DLIC, PAR3 and SKTL are interacting partners”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the earlier version it was unclear that the 250kD band that was observed on western blots actually corresponded to Par3. The authors have used RNAi strains to address this point and the conclusion is a bit more convincing. It is still hard to fully appreciate, though. For instance, in Figure 7—figure supplement 2, a strain over-expressing Par3-GFP using the UAS-Gal4 driver is used. These embryos should be expressing a relatively high level of Par-GFP. In the total fraction from these embryos the most prominent band is around 100kD when probed with a Par3 antibody. However, this band is hard to detect with the GFP antibody. In fact, it is hard to see any bands in the GFP blot. Next, the sample was immunoprecipitated. It is unclear from the legend which antibody (Par3 or GFP) was used in the IP. In the immunoprecipitated fractions, the most prominent band is the 250kD band. The band is reduced in the strain expressing Par3 RNAi but it is not clear how it can be detected so prominently in the IP fraction when the same isoform is a minor species at best in the total fraction. Is the IP antibody somehow specifically precipitating an oligomeric form? The experiment with the endogenously expressed BAC-based Par3-GFP construct is more convincing.</p><p>2) Another major issue is the over-reliance on overexpressed Par3. Key results should be repeated to look at endogenous Par3 expression. For example, are the Par3-positive cytoplasmic particles, and effects on these particles, observed when Par3 is expressed by its own regulatory regions? Without this additional data, there is a risk that the effects they report are artifacts of overexpression.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this issue, we have used a <italic>Drosophila</italic> strain, PAR3-Trap, in which a GFP is inserted in frame in PAR3 (Januschke and Gonzales, 2010). We have added in a new figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 2) the illustration of PAR3 trap line that shows the presence of dotted structure in the oocyte cytoplasm. This observation was realized on previtellogenic stage because the accumulation of autofluorescent vitellus masks the presence of these structures thereafter. Furthermore, we have assayed the microtubule requirement for the cytoplasmic transport of these structures. We performed a colchicin treatment on PAR3 trap egg chambers. We then observed that PAR3 accumulates in numerous dotted structures in the cytoplasm, as observed previously with the PAR3-GFP overexpression in presence of colchicin. The expression of PAR3GFP in the follicular cells with this strain precludes the analysis of PAR3-GFP at the oocyte plasma membrane. These new results are presented in the Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The results using a dominant negative rab5 should be confirmed with an shRNA construct (available from Bloomington). There is a risk that the DN might produce off target effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified PAR3 distribution in a RAB5 RNAi context. Among the twodrosophila transgenic lines available in Bloomington stock center, the BL34832 stock affects most strongly endocytosis during oogenesis according defect in yolk uptake (Compagnon et al., 2009). RAB5 RNAi alters PAR3 distribution in the same manner that RAB5 dominant negative but a little less strongly. This new result is present in Figure 5.</p></body></sub-article></article>
