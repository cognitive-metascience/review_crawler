We use <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic> plants silenced in mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 (irMPK4) – with low water-use efficiency (WUE) – to study the scale at which water-use traits alter intraspecific population yields. In the field and glasshouse, we observed overyielding in populations with low percentages of irMPK4 plants, unrelated to water-use phenotypes. Paired-plant experiments excluded the occurrence of overyielding effects at the neighbor scale. Experimentally altering field arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal associations by silencing the Sym-pathway gene <italic>NaCCaMK</italic> did not affect reproductive overyielding, implicating an effect independent of belowground AMF interactions. Additionally, micro-grafting experiments revealed dependence on shoot-expressed <italic>MPK4</italic> for <italic>N. attenuata</italic> to vary its yield per neighbor presence. We find that variation in a single gene, <italic>MPK4</italic>, is responsible for population overyielding through a mechanism, independent of irMPK4’s WUE phenotype, at the aboveground, population scale.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Whether on farmland or in a forest, plants do not grow in isolation. Plants compete with their neighbors over limited space and resources, and individual plants respond to this competition in different ways by changing how much they grow and how they use resources. The efficiency with which crop plants use water, for example, is one trait that is dramatically influenced by neighboring plants and is of increasing concern given the warming climate.</p><p>Understanding the effects of interactions between individual plants in a population as a whole is complicated, especially in natural plant communities where neighbors are often from different species. For this reason, McGale et al. took a different approach and looked at neighbors that were all from the same species and differed only in the activity of a single gene. The species in question was coyote tobacco, a plant that is native to western North America.</p><p>McGale et al. used genetic engineering to silence a gene called <italic>MPK4</italic>, which was known from previous studies to have the effect of reducing water-use efficiency. Some of these ‘water-inefficient’ plants were then grown in mixed populations with plants that had normal levels of <italic>MPK4</italic>. In experiments conducted both in a glasshouse and at a field station in the Utah desert, McGale et al. found that populations with a low percentage of the <italic>MPK4</italic>-silenced plants were actually more productive than ‘monocultures’ that were all one type or the other.</p><p>Further analysis showed that the increase in productivity did not depend on the different soil nutrient or water use of the different populations, or even the density of the plants in the populations. Pairs of plants grown in single pots essentially ruled out any interactions between immediate neighbors being responsible for the increased productivity, suggesting that that effect must instead emerge at the level of the population.</p><p>Perhaps unexpectedly, McGale et al. also found that the <italic>MPK4</italic>-silenced plants and control plants did not actually differ in how they used water when grown in the field (previous studies had all been conducted in glasshouses), indicating that this trait also could not explain the observed population-level effect. Finally, experiments that involved grafting the shoots of one plant onto the roots of another suggested that the effect most likely comes from the aboveground parts of the plant.</p><p>Ecologists have previously noted that more diverse populations typically have higher productivity. This new finding that a small percentage of slightly different plants in an otherwise uniform population can increase overall productivity will likely to be of special interest to researchers looking to boost the efficiency of agricultural ecosystems. Also, since <italic>MPK4</italic> is highly conserved, and thus likely to be found in many plant species, this could be an interesting trait with which to study the interactions of natural plant communities.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitogen-activated protein kinase 4</kwd><kwd>field</kwd><kwd>scale</kwd><kwd>water-use efficiency</kwd><kwd><italic>N. attenuata</italic></kwd><kwd>arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McGale</surname><given-names>Erica</given-names></name><name><surname>Valim</surname><given-names>Henrique</given-names></name><name><surname>Mittal</surname><given-names>Deepika</given-names></name><name><surname>Morales Jimenez</surname><given-names>Jesús</given-names></name><name><surname>Halitschke</surname><given-names>Rayko</given-names></name><name><surname>Schuman</surname><given-names>Meredith C</given-names></name><name><surname>Baldwin</surname><given-names>Ian T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Advanced Grant 293926</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Valim</surname><given-names>Henrique</given-names></name><name><surname>Schuman</surname><given-names>Meredith C</given-names></name><name><surname>Baldwin</surname><given-names>Ian T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>iDiv</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McGale</surname><given-names>Erica</given-names></name><name><surname>Valim</surname><given-names>Henrique</given-names></name><name><surname>Schuman</surname><given-names>Meredith C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Variation in the gene NaMPK4 in plant populations increases reproductive yield, an effect which appears to be independent of soil water availability, neighbor-scale interactions and associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plant trait diversity is known to increase the productivity and stability of plant populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cardinale et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Isbell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Isbell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Loreau and de Mazancourt, 2013</xref>). These effects may be produced from single gene variation among individuals: previously, wheat populations comprising of two lines varied only in their resistance to powdery mildew through single-gene modifications outperformed monoculture populations, even when the monocultures were comprised of resistant individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zeller et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, forward genetics research recently identified a genetic locus associated with this diversity-productivity relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wuest and Niklaus, 2018</xref>). However, establishing the mechanism that confers population productivity from a single genetic basis is difficult due to the complexity of plant population experiments. When individuals varying in traits or in loci of interest are planted in pairs, it is possible to conclude that their responses are due to the neighbor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gibson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Harper, 1977</xref>). When planted in populations, however, it is unclear whether a plant responds only to properties of its direct neighbors or of the entire population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gibson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Radosevich, 1987</xref>). The scale, or the hierarchical level in biological organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen and Starr, 1982</xref>), at which diversity-productivity effects are constrained has not yet been determined, despite their importance in the study of complex population interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schneider, 2001</xref>). Here, we define and investigate two spatial scales within populations that can be responsible for changes in total yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>): the neighbor scale, where responding individuals (RIs) are constrained to change their growth and yield (quantified in biomass and fitness correlates, that is flowers and seed capsules) only in response to direct neighbors that differ in trait expression (divergent plants); and the population scale, where RIs can respond to the total composition of divergent plants in the entire population, creating a change in total population yield in direct proportion to RI abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crawford and Rudgers, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hughes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Smith and Knapp, 2003</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genetically divergent plants can alter population yields through plant neighbor responses generated at neighbor or population scales.</title><p>Genetic variation within a population can change population growth and yield by altering individuals’ outputs either in localized areas within populations (neighbor scale) or across all plants of a population (population scale). At the neighbor scale (black), a divergent individual (dark green) may elicit responses only in immediate neighbors (responding individuals, RIs). RIs’ responses at either spatial scale may include changes in growth and yield, which can cumulatively change a population’s growth and yield (red).

However, the scale at which this occurs (neighbor or population) remains unknown. WUE naturally varies among individuals, both within and among species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderegg, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Donovan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Heschel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tortosa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yoo et al., 2009</xref>) and intraspecific variation in WUE traits can be as great as interspecific variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Messier et al., 2010</xref>). Yield effects resulting from intraspecific WUE trait variation are of considerable agricultural interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dutra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sreeman et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, WUE traits of some trees species alter the photosynthetic parameters and survival of neighboring trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bunce et al., 1977</xref>), suggesting potential neighbor-scale responses that can dramatically influence the yield of populations. However, studies have not pursued how WUE trait variation cause either population-scale or neighbor-scale responses that are responsible for changes in population growth and yield due to the complications that emerge in studying variations in WUE phenotypes.</p><p>To adequately study the scale at which RIs respond to variation in WUE of neighbors, one needs to anticipate several factors that would confound the analysis. WUE is calculated as the ratio of carbon assimilation to transpirational water loss, and WUE phenotypes typically result from altered stomatal function that increases plant transpiration. As the frequency of plants with low WUE (high transpiration) increases in a population, the availability of soil water to the population is known to decrease proportionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zea-Cabrera et al., 2006</xref>). RIs may change their growth and yield in response to differences in soil water availability, rather than to the abundance of low-WUE plants in a population. Therefore, controlling for soil water availability independently of the frequency of plants with different WUE traits is essential for the analysis. The ecological relevance of variation in WUE traits is best evaluated in field populations, but standardizing water availability across populations in the field is rarely possible and thus combining inferences from field and glasshouse experiments, where soil water availability can be controlled using gravimetrically controlled watering, provides a useful way forward. Plants that vary in WUE as a result of single-gene manipulations greatly facilitate investigations into the scales at which yield responses are realized in populations. Here, we use isogenic plants, silenced in the expression of a single gene that profoundly influences stomatal behavior, to explore the scale at which WUE variation influences population yields.</p><p>Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are part of a conserved signaling cascade essential in eukaryotes. The downstream targets of this phosphorylation cascade, such as transcription factors, enable specific plant responses through changes in plant growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Xu and Zhang, 2015</xref>). Mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 (MPK4) in <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic> and its homologues, MPK12 in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and MPK4/MPK4L in <italic>N. tabacum,</italic> have been implicated in responses to herbivore damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gomi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hettenhausen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yanagawa et al., 2016</xref>), bacterial inoculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hettenhausen et al., 2012</xref>), changes in exogenous and endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) and hydrogen peroxide levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Des Marais et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hettenhausen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jammes et al., 2009</xref>), vapor pressure deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Des Marais et al., 2014</xref>) and ozone levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gomi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yanagawa et al., 2016</xref>). Most of these responses involve the regulation of stomatal structure and function: silencing <italic>NaMPK4</italic> or <italic>NtMPK4/L</italic> by RNA interference (Na-irMPK4 and Nt-MPK4/L-IR, respectively) or knocking out <italic>AtMPK12</italic> (At-<italic>mpk12</italic>) results in plants with larger stomata and stomatal apertures, and varying disruptions in stomatal closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Des Marais et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gomi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hettenhausen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Marten et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yanagawa et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The alteration of stomatal phenotypes by <italic>MPK4/12</italic> expression strongly influences WUE. Na-irMPK4, Nt-MPK4/L-IR and At-<italic>mpk12</italic> all have increased transpiration rates which can be attributed to increased stomatal conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Des Marais et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gomi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hettenhausen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yanagawa et al., 2016</xref>). For Na-irMPK4 and At-<italic>mpk12</italic>, this increase in transpiration rates has been shown to dwarf the associated increases in assimilation rates, resulting in low WUE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Des Marais et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hettenhausen et al., 2012</xref>). However, previous glasshouse studies that tested whether the presence of <italic>MPK4/12-</italic>derived WUE phenotypes results in individual growth and yield effects in paired-plant-in-a-pot interactions did not control for soil water availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Des Marais et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hettenhausen et al., 2012</xref>). To our knowledge, no study has investigated whether variation in the abundance of a low WUE trait, generated from the silencing of a single gene, affects population yield; similarly unstudied is the scale at which this might occur. Here, we conduct such a study using experimental <italic>N. attenuata</italic> populations in both the glasshouse and field.</p><p>The wild tobacco <italic>N. attenuata</italic> grows in xeric habitats in the western United States, where water limitation and WUE are selective factors throughout the growing season. <italic>N. attenuata</italic> typically grows in genetically diverse populations, in near-monocultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldwin and Morse, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baldwin et al., 1994</xref>), and is known to respond differently when paired with genetically varied intraspecific neighbors: a <italic>N. attenuata</italic> accession collected in Utah (UT) sharing a pot with an accession collected in Arizona (AZ) produces significantly smaller stalks than when sharing a pot with another UT plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Glawe et al., 2003</xref>). <italic>N. attenuata</italic> plants also naturally interact with AMF in the field, establishing networks of connected plants that have the potential to significantly change individuals’ responses to neighbors or populations (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Oelmüller, 2019</xref>). AMF are known to change soil water availability and transport among individuals in populations based on each individual’s ability to interact with AMF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Egerton-Warburton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Reynolds et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, AMF have been shown to significantly affect plant-plant interactions in populations, as they can transfer nutrients, defense signals and allelopathic chemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ferlian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gorzelak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Song et al., 2019</xref>). Manipulating the ability of a population to interact through an AMF network can provide a means of dramatically altering belowground interactions and narrow the potential causes of population yield changes due to within- (or between-) species plant diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Calcium and calmodulin-dependent kinase (CCaMK) is required for successful plant symbiosis with AMF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lévy et al., 2004</xref>), and the abrogation of <italic>CCaMK</italic> expression provides a valuable tool to disconnect plants from AMF networks in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Groten et al., 2015</xref>). Field plantations of transgenic <italic>N. attenuata</italic> crossed with <italic>CCaMK</italic>-deficient transgenic lines (irCCaMK) in the plant’s native habitat, the Great Basin Desert, allow for the study of population growth and yield effects resulting from trait variation, as well as the scales and tissues in which this variation occurs. Here, we use a single gene manipulation to create variation in WUE in the background of irCCaMK lines to separate the effects of AMF-mediated interactions in our analysis of the spatial scales at which variation in WUE traits influence population yields.</p><p>We investigated the spatial scales at which variation in abundance of low WUE <italic>N. attenuata</italic> plants, generated by the abrogation of <italic>MPK4</italic> expression, change total population growth and yield. We used a previously characterized irMPK4 line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hettenhausen et al., 2012</xref>) and varied the percentages of this line in field populations with empty-vector (EV) control plants, both crossed with either irCCaMK and EV lines, to manipulate connectivity to the AMF network. We observed increased yields, referred to as overyielding, in populations with low percentages of <italic>MPK4-</italic>deficient plants (‘low-irMPK4’), due primarily to increases in EV plant yield. To exclude soil water availability effects, we grew homozygous irMPK4 and EV lines in glasshouse populations under equal water availability and again observed overyielding in low-irMPK4 populations due to increases in EV yield. We further tested responses at the neighbor scale by growing mono- and mixed-genotype pairs of EV and irMPK4 under conditions of equal water availability and found no changes in growth or yield between pair types. We analyzed the yield of individuals with different configurations of immediate neighbor genotypes in our glasshouse populations, but these also did not explain changes in individual yields. From these results, we conclude that neighbor-scale responses are unlikely to be responsible for the overyielding phenomena. In the glasshouse, changes in EV plants’ photosynthetic parameters did not explain the yield increases in low-irMPK4 populations and importantly, EV and irMPK4 plants did not differ in their WUE phenotypes in field populations. Therefore we inferred that irMPK4’s WUE phenotype was not responsible for the observed overyielding at the population scale. In neighbor absence-presence paired tests, we observed that EV plants change their growth and yield when planted with or without a neighbor, while interestingly, irMPK4 plants do not. In similar experiments with EV shoots micro-grafted to irMPK4 roots, <italic>MPK4</italic> expression in the shoot could remediate this effect, demonstrating a shoot-localized role for <italic>MPK4</italic> in <italic>N. attenuata’s</italic> ability to alter yield in the presence of a neighbor. Additionally, manipulating field population’s AMF connectivity did not change observed reproductive overyielding, denoting a lack of belowground influence on this effect. From these results, we suggest a novel function of shoot <italic>MPK4</italic> in mediating <italic>N. attenuata</italic>’s yield response to neighbors, unrelated to WUE, which in low-irMPK4 populations may result in reproductive overyielding.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>irMPK4 x irCCaMK crosses are silenced in <italic>MPK4</italic> and abrogated in AMF associations</title><p><italic>N. attenuata</italic> plants silenced in the expression of <italic>MPK4</italic> (irMPK4) have a low water-use efficiency (WUE) phenotype in comparison to empty-vector (EV) control plants in the glasshouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Therefore, in the glasshouse population experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), we analyzed growth and fitness measurements of centrally located EV individuals with four direct neighbors. In 0% irMPK4 populations, all four neighbors were EV plants, in 17% irMPK4 populations, two were EV and two were irMPK4 plants, and in 50% and 83% irMPK4 populations, all four were irMPK4 plants.

However, 50% irMPK4 populations did not show overyielding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–M</xref>), likely because irMPK4 plants simultaneously had significantly smaller rosettes, water contents, and yields compared with 100% irMPK4 monocultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Importantly, EV plants grown in 50% and 83% irMPK4 populations, with the same irMPK4 direct neighbor configuration, did not show consistent changes in growth and yield compared to monocultures.

This occurs when plants respond to neighbors which are divergent in WUE with changes in growth and reproductive yield. However, the scale within a population’s hierarchical organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen and Starr, 1982</xref>) at which this phenomenon occurs is not yet known: yield changes in responding individuals (RIs) may be triggered only in immediate neighbors (neighbor scale; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) or in individuals across a population (population scale). Additionally, interactions may occur at these scales above- or belowground. Our analyses revealed that low abundances of irMPK4 plants intermixed with EV plants result in higher yields for <italic>N. attenuata</italic> populations, both in the glasshouse and the field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This overyielding effect was not caused by differences in soil water availability, which was controlled for in the glasshouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–M</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), nor irMPK4’s WUE phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which was not different from the WUE of EV plants in the field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, we find that yield-increasing responses in low-irMPK4 populations likely occurred aboveground, at the population scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>).</p><p>Given that manipulating mixing proportions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Weiner, 1980</xref>) and total density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">He et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Stachová et al., 2013</xref>) are known to change overyielding results in substitutive experiments, it was important to consider that our glasshouse populations (12 plants, 5 cm apart) differed in plant density from our field populations (four plants, 10 cm apart). However, given that the overyielding results were consistent between the glasshouse and field, we infer that in our case the overyielding observed in mixtures with low proportions of irMPK4 was not due to differences in total plant density of mixtures.</p><p>Based on previous neighbor-effect studies using low-WUE phenotypes, we initially hypothesized that the neighbor scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, black arrow) would be critical for producing individual changes in yield. For example, in a paired-plant competition experiment, an <italic>A. thaliana</italic> CVI mutant (low WUE) produced more seeds than L<italic>er</italic> (high WUE) when both were planted with a control neighbor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Campitelli et al., 2016</xref>). When extrapolated to a population level, this result could predict a neighbor-scale change on population yield. Specifically, if one plant in each paired interaction were an RI, changes in populations yields would primarily occur when abundant RIs exist in the population in close proximity to few differentiated plants (i.e. populations with low percentages of well-spread differentiated individuals), creating many paired interactions without reducing RI numbers. Alternatively, if both plants were RIs, changed yields would be observed in populations with the either the highest abundance of interaction fronts between the two genotypes if the responses were in the same direction, or the lowest if they were in opposite directions. However, these possibilities rely on the assumption that a yield response is observed in response to trait variation in pairs. We therefore tested this pre-condition with EV and irMPK4 plants planted in monoculture and mixed culture pairs. Despite previously observed changes in neighbor responses to plants altered in their WUE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Campitelli et al., 2016</xref>), we did not see differences in any growth or yield parameters in mixed EV and irMPK4 pairs in comparison to monoculture pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>This discrepancy may be due to the difference between our methods and those of the earlier study: we controlled for water availability in our glasshouse experiments, to exclude that differences in water availability are driving the observed responses. Plants with low WUE can change the soil water availability in certain microenvironments and thus responses of neighbors due to the decreasing water table (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zea-Cabrera et al., 2006</xref>). However, we did not observe differences in soil moisture among field populations with different irMPK4 abundances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Even an additional watering treatment on a section of the field plot did not cause differentiated rates of drying-down among the different population types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). We directly tested the influence of water availability in the glasshouse by controlling for soil water availability among populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–M</xref>). We hypothesized that, with equalized soil water availability, we would not observe the overyielding response in low-irMPK4 populations. Interestingly, we again observed overyielding in low-irMPK4 glasshouse populations and therefore inferred the effect to be independent of soil water availability. Additionally, since controlling for soil water availability seemed to manipulate immediate neighbor plant interactions (i.e. differences between our results and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Campitelli et al., 2016</xref>), the overyielding in controlled water glasshouse populations suggested that the effect was likely not mediated at the neighbor scale.</p><p>Paired-plant-in-a-pot experiments have only limited potential to study neighbor-scale interactions in population as individuals can only be observed in 0%, 50% and 100% irMPK4 mixtures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However, the growth and yield responses of plants at the neighbor scale could also depend on the identities of several immediate neighbors, or different percentages of immediate neighbors. Therefore, using a glasshouse population experiment, we compared the growth and yield of EV plants among a range of immediate irMPK4 neighbors (0 irMPK4 in 0% irMPK4 populations, 2 in 17% populations, and 4 in both 50% and 83% populations). We did not observe a correlation between the growth and yield of EV plants and the number of immediate irMPK4 neighbor plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). Based on these results and the lack of yield effects from our paired-pot experiments, we reject the hypothesis that the overyielding effects occurred at the neighbor scale, which suggest that the responses resulting in the observed population overyielding likely appear at the population scale.</p><p>At the population scale, we initially investigated known mechanisms through which individual plants could affect the yield generation of other individuals in the population, independent of changes in soil water availability. Trees with differing WUE influence photosynthetic parameters of neighboring trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bunce et al., 1977</xref>) and altered photosynthetic parameters of plants, including WUE, have been shown to cause significant yield changes in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hatfield and Dold, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">South et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we examined the photosynthetic parameters of plants in the field and glasshouse populations. In the field, EV and irMPK4 plants did not differ in their photosynthetic parameters, including WUE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In the glasshouse populations, irMPK4 showed a decreased WUE phenotype, but the photosynthetic parameters of EV and irMPK4 individuals in low-irMPK4 populations were not different from those in their respective monocultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). From these results, we infer that the population-scale factor responsible for the low-irMPK4 population overyielding is independent not only of WUE, but also of the other previously observed photosynthetic phenotypes of irMPK4 plants, such as higher stomatal conductance, transpiration, and photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hettenhausen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hettenhausen et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>Other factors that could cause the observed population-scale overyielding in low-irMPK4 populations include niche complementarity and the exchange of chemical signals. Hydrological niche partitioning could explain the increased population yield through a more diverse, and therefore more efficient, use of local water resources, either spatially or temporally (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barry et al., 2019</xref>). In these instances, complementary plants may vary in above- or belowground water use through differences in water loss (e.g. transpiration, WUE; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Silvertown et al., 2015</xref>) or water acquisition (e.g. through root spatial distribution, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dimitrakopoulos and Schmid, 2004</xref>). However, the lack of differences in the WUE of irMPK4 plants and in the soil moisture among the different populations in the field, where overyielding effects were strongest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>), renders hydrological niche partitioning an unlikely explanation.</p><p>Even so, other types of complementarity could have occurred, for example through one neighbor type ameliorating the habitat of its neighbors. This typically occurs through abiotic means (i.e. changes in water or nutrient access; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bertness and Callaway, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wright et al., 2017</xref>) but again, the field results showed no differences in soil moisture or nutrient content among the soils of different population types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>). However, the habitat could also be improved biotically: it is known that the presence of divergent individuals in a population that are resistant to a particular plant disease can reduce the spread of the disease, therefore allowing control plants in the population to produce more yield than when in monoculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schmid, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zeller et al., 2012</xref>). Although irMPK4 plants were shown to be more susceptible to the bacterial pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv <italic>tomato</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hettenhausen et al., 2012</xref>), having the presence of susceptible individuals could still confer benefits to a population by serving as disease sinks (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Keesing et al., 2006</xref>). Alternatively, aboveground spatial complementarity could have occurred, where irMPK4 plants’ smaller size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hettenhausen et al., 2012</xref>) may have led to less competition for aerial space with EV plants, leading to their increased growth and population yield benefits (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lorentzen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Williams et al., 2017</xref>). Although possible biotic factors could not be tested in the glasshouse, the role of spatial complementarity could be evaluated through a better understanding of the neighbor responses of EV and irMPK4 plants.</p><p>The response of a plant to a neighbor is commonly evaluated through comparisons of the plant’s growth and yield when planted alone and when planted in a pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Díaz-Sierra et al., 2017</xref>). We therefore included single plants in our paired plant experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Interestingly, EV plants were the only individuals that responded with decreases in growth and yield to the presence of a neighbor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Although the yield in paired-plant experiments cannot be directly compared to the yield of EV plants in various population types, it suggests that EV plants are RIs: they change their growth and yield in response to neighbors, unlike irMPK4 plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). It is conceivable that EV plants could benefit from only certain percentages of irMPK4 plant neighbors to cause an emergent effect at the population scale if irMPK4’s consistent yield with or without a neighbor indicated a non-competitive response, though this cannot be distinguished in this study. However, complementarity effects would generally be expected to be strongest in equal mixtures, decreasing the likelihood of this possibility.</p><p>Volatiles can accumulate differently in the headspaces of various plant populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schuman et al., 2015</xref>) and have been shown to be a mechanism by which plants detect and respond to potentially competitive neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Engelberth and Engelberth, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ninkovic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pierik et al., 2013</xref>). irMPK4 and EV plants are known to emit distinct volatile profiles in response to herbivory: irMPK4 plants release 5x higher levels of <italic>trans</italic>-α-bergamotene than EV plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hettenhausen et al., 2012</xref>). As irMPK4 plants are inhibited in stomatal closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hettenhausen et al., 2012</xref>), they may continuously release a volatile or volatile blend that causes a population-scale effect only at a certain concentration (e.g. one that is generated in low-irMPK4 populations). This effect may be caused by a direct response of RIs, or might occur through interactions of the plant with various trophic levels, of which the latter has been observed to be volatile-mediated under field conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Joo et al., 2018</xref>). In <italic>N. attenuata,</italic> a population yield effect was previously shown to be affected by single gene variation through a tri-trophic interaction: plants silenced in one component of the jasmonic-acid defense pathway (i.e. defense-deficient plants) intermixed with wild-type controls increased the susceptibility of entire populations to a generalist herbivore, which then reduced total canopy damage by a successive specialist herbivore, and increased wild-type yield in mixed versus monoculture populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>NaMPK4</italic> is known to silence part of a jasmonic acid defense pathway; the uninhibited pathway in irMPK4 plants reduces the mass of a specialist caterpillar feeding on this line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hettenhausen et al., 2013</xref>). This reduction of mass is often associated with higher mortality in young larvae due to disrupted feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cambron et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">McGale et al., 2018</xref>), which could then reduce the presence of this specialist herbivore in the population, therefore decreasing canopy damage, and increasing the yield of control plants. Different volatiles released from irMPK4 plants could enhance this sort of effect (i.e. increase oviposition of this herbivore on irMPK4 plants due to increased attractive volatile emissions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kessler et al., 2008</xref>) or otherwise might facilitate alternate multi-trophic interactions.</p><p>Belowground, root exudates can accumulate in populations and provide information for plants about their neighbors’ identity and performance, which may result in plant growth responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Semchenko et al., 2018</xref>). Root exudates can also promote certain microbial community in the rhizosphere that can confer benefits to the entire population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berg and Smalla, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fincheira and Quiroz, 2018</xref>). However, irMPK4 root exudates have not yet been characterized. Further research on the chemical profiles and multi-trophic interactions of irMPK4 and EV plants in field populations is needed to identify potential above- or belowground factors which could cause responses at the population scale, but perhaps first narrowing the effect to either the above- or belowground scale would be helpful to study these potential mechanisms.</p><p>We sought to distinguish the influence of the above- or belowground scale on the observed overyielding by experimentally altering arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) associations in field populations with varied amounts of <italic>MPK4</italic>-deficient plants. Although AMF associations have a strong impact on plants’ access to soil water and nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Egerton-Warburton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Reynolds et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yang et al., 2013</xref>), as well as on belowground plant-plant interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ferlian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gorzelak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Song et al., 2019</xref>), we consistently observed reproductive overyielding in low-irMPK4 populations regardless of the AMF association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The lack of change in the reproductive overyielding pattern supports further attention to aboveground tissues for mechanistic determination, although it does not exclude other belowground interactions as potential causative factors.</p><p>To investigate the tissue dependence of the EV and irMPK4 plant neighbor responses we had previously studied in our paired experiment, we again used a single versus paired experimental set-up with grafted plants. The grafting experiment revealed that <italic>MPK4</italic> transcript accumulation, or an MPK4-dependent downstream factor, is required in aboveground tissues for <italic>N. attenuata</italic> plants to be able to change their yield in response to neighbor presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6E</xref>). Additionally, the presence of <italic>MPK4</italic> transcripts in the shoot alone is sufficient to facilitate the yield-altering neighbor response, specifically in reproductive correlate production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). This tissue-specific role of <italic>MPK4</italic> abundance in the shoot could be important in the mediation of reproductive overyielding in populations, but would need to be tested in a population experiment. Because the RNAi silencing signals travel from shoots to roots in <italic>N. attenuata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fragoso et al., 2011</xref>), we were unable to investigate the function of shoot-only <italic>MPK4</italic> knockdowns. The use of plants with mutant or natural alleles of <italic>MPK4</italic> or homologs, such as those identified <italic>in A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Des Marais et al., 2014</xref>), would allow for the analysis of reciprocal <italic>mpk12/wt</italic> and <italic>wt/mpk12</italic> grafts. Together with a metabolic characterization (e.g. volatiles) and evaluations of multi-trophic interactions, these grafting experiments could identify the mechanisms mediating the observed population scale overyielding.</p><p>The results of our study are consistent with the well-established phenomenon that divergent individuals in a community can increase community productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chapin III, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chapin, et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crutsinger, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hooper et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Naeem et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schulze and Mooney, 1994</xref>) and advance our understanding by identifying the spatial scale (neighbors vs. population, above vs. belowground) at which this yield response occurs. Additionally, we identify a single gene, <italic>MPK4,</italic> which when silenced in low abundances in a population, is responsible for population overyielding. By excluding neighbor-scale effects and controlling resource availability, we demonstrate that <italic>MPK4</italic> influences population yield through RIs at the population scale independent of water availability, but further experiments are needed to identify the specific mechanisms mediating this effect. This work contributes to our understanding of how populations may become more productive as a result of greater genetic and functional diversity and suggests that experiments exploring the scales at which these effects occur can identify novel means to increase the productivity of agronomic monocultures.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>N. attenuata</italic>)</td><td valign="top">A-04-266-3</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bubner et al., 2006</xref> DOI:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00299-005-0111-4">10.1007/s00299-005-0111-4</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Empty vector control</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>N. attenuata</italic>)</td><td valign="top">A-7–163</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hettenhausen et al., 2012</xref> DOI:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1086/342519">10.1086/342519</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Stably silenced in <italic>MPK4</italic> via RNAi</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>N. attenuata</italic>)</td><td valign="top">A-09-1212-1-4</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Groten et al., 2015</xref> DOI:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1111/pce.12561">10.1111/pce.12561</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Stably silenced in <italic>CCaMK</italic> via RNAi</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software</td><td valign="top">R version 3.4.2</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">R Development Core Team, 2017</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software</td><td valign="top">RStudio version 1.0.153</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rstudio Team, 2016</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material and constructs</title><p>Characterization of the empty-vector (EV) <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic> control line (pSOL3NC, line number A-04-266-3) is described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bubner et al.

ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To allow larger growth and thus accentuate growth differences in plants in the grafted pair experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), the water supply was raised to 5 days (WM = 5*mean(WL<sub>-1</sub>, WL<sub>-2</sub>) + DP), bringing soil moisture percentages up to 20–30%. The higher soil moisture did not affect the differences in photosynthetic parameters of EV and irMPK4 homografts compared to those reported for the homozygous EV and irMPK4 plants in the paired experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B</xref>). There was no significant correlation between the amount of water added in our watering regimes and the amount of water lost (demonstrated two times during watering regime of the grafted experiment, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Leaf turgor and potential effects of controlled watering on diurnal rhythms</title><p>Yara ZIM-probes were placed on 2–3 replicates of EV or irMPK4 plants in all glasshouse population types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). The probes consist of two magnets clipped onto both sides of a leaf, of which the lower magnet includes a pressure sensor. All probes are initialized at a clamping pressure between 10 and 30 kPa on a turgescent leaf. The probes allow continuous measurement of leaf turgor pressure throughout an experiment, and we present 48 hr of continuous monitoring from 00:00 December 4th to 00:00 December 7th (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8</xref>).</p><p>Absolute pressure values could not be compared quantitatively; in contrast to previously reported measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zimmermann et al., 2008</xref>) our recordings initialized at different clamping pressures. A comparison of three replicates of irMPK4 in 100% irMPK4 populations showed that variation in peak-trough amplitudes within one genotype/population type (irMPK4 in 100% irMPK4 populations; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8C</xref>) exceeds variation between EV and irMPK4 in all other populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8A–B</xref>). Therefore, we compared the time of day at which changes in turgor pressure values occurred. For all EV and irMPK4 plants in all population types, the diurnal turgor pressure changes (peaks and troughs) do not occur at different times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8A–B</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, we observed if our genotypes experience differential diurnal dry-downs or unexpected drought events that may not be captured by our daily pot weighing and watering for our controlled water treatment. This may be reflected in ‘noisier’ curves (increased oscillations within the peaks or troughs of the diurnal leaf turgor changes) or inverted leaf turgor pressure curves around noon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Martínez-Gimeno et al., 2017</xref>), however, we did not observe any of these qualities across our measured plants. We therefore inferred that our controlled watering treatment was not causing unknown diurnal drying differences among individuals in our glasshouse population types and proceeded with applying it to all glasshouse experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Gas exchange measurements and water-use efficiency calculations</title><p>Gas exchange measurements including photosynthesis and transpiration rates, and stomatal conductance (via calculation), were performed using a LI-COR 6400XT infrared gas analyzer (Lincoln, NE), both in the field and the glasshouse between 12:00 and 14:00 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>The LI-6400XT was combined with a Leaf Chamber Fluorometer in the glasshouse to additionally obtain chlorophyll fluorescence measurements after 6 hr of dark adaptation (lights off at 22:00, measurements from 4:00 to 6:00; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

F<sub>v</sub> was calculated from F<sub>m</sub> minus F<sub>0</sub> (F<sub>0</sub> being the base level of fluorescence emitted without the saturating pulse). F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> represents the maximum quantum yield of PII, which was used as a measure of photosynthesis limitations unrelated to stomata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Signarbieux and Feller, 2011</xref>).

effect may require a particular mixing ratio of the involved genotypes and thus cannot be achieved by stacking the gene variants into a single genotype or pairing genotypes simply at neighborhood scale. The authors of this study used sophisticated experiments to chase the phenotypic differences between the two genotypes causing the population-level overyielding. Interestingly, the most obvious phenotypic difference in water-use efficiency was not the cause, leaving above-ground resource partitioning or chemical signaling as most likely alternatives.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Determining the scale at which variation in WUE traits changes population yields&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Bernhard Schmid as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Hardtke as Senior Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The strength of you manuscript is the use of very promising tools to analyze a within-species diversity effect mechanistically down to the effects of a single genetic difference between members of a population. The weakness is the ecological setting of the work as detailed in the reviews below. This aspect could be improved by setting a different frame, but we also feel it would need different or additional experiments. All reviewers found your manuscript very difficult to understand, and I think some of the comments reflect this, for example those about statistics in the third review. It is possible that some of these comments are not entirely correct, but then it is very difficult to find out how you did the actual statistical analysis. I'm sorry for the negative result of this long review process. But I still hope that the reviews are helpful and that you continue to use your excellent tools and understanding of plant interactions at the molecular and chemical level to analyze population-level and community-level processes that have been described quite phenomenologically by ecologists.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting yet somewhat complicated manuscript. The interesting question is whether plant populations can show <italic>emergen</italic>t features that a single individual cannot express. For example, a mixture of varieties resistant to different mildew strains may lead to the population being protected from infection even when each variety grown by itself would be infected. Obviously, it would not be possible to stack all resistant genes into a single variety because of excessive fitness costs, but at the population level a solution is possible by mixing the different varieties. Another example would be that a deep-rooting variety could provide water to a shallow-rooting variety by hydraulic lift during drought and reciprocal benefits at other times. Mechanisms of how emergent features can be created by diversity have been discussed at large in the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning literature, but their molecular basis has almost never been assessed, except in a recent paper by Wuest and Niklaus (Nature Ecology and Evolution 2018).</p><p>In the present paper it is a mixture of <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic> genotypes with (EV) or without (irMPK4)-in simplified words-the ability to control water loss via their stomates that leads to an emergent feature at the population level, namely an increased population performance. The first idea is of course that the greater water uptake of irMPK4 would affect the water uptake at population level, but this possibility could be excluded using a watering regime that compensated for the water-wasting behaviour of this genotype. Thus, in the end we are left with a similar situation as in many biodiversity experiments: there are clear effects of <italic>overyielding</italic> in diverse populations or communities, but we cannot identify the mechanisms. Nevertheless, this paper offers a new view and approach in several ways (single gene difference between individuals, maintenance of constant water level, exclusion of mycorrhizae by using plants with irCCaMK background, micro-grafting of individuals), which can inform further research into diversity effects as well as how individuals within a population of a single species may show correlative or <italic>coordinated</italic> behaviour to produce emergent population-level features.</p><p>The authors focus in my view perhaps too much on a comparison between neighbor interactions and effects at neighborhood scale and population-level responses. This originates from the hypothesis that it could be chemical signals that are exchanged between individuals that lead to the observed phenomena. However, other, perhaps more phenomenological mechanisms would be conceivable and would typically be considered in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research. These include resource complementarity or interactions with other organisms, including soil microbes. Basically, the question is why a few individuals that have lost the ability to control their stomates can increase population performance. I would recommend to consider it this way, i.e. EV plants are responsive and can for example increase their performance if planted individually instead of in pairs, as expected by the law of constant final yield, whereas irMPK4 plants are less responsive and cannot fully compensate for the reduced density when grown as individuals (see your Figure 5, cf. Stoll et al., PRSLB 2002, https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2002.2137).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript presents the results of a large multistage project in which plant performance was studied at variable organizational scales in populations of <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic> comprising variable proportions of low-WUE individuals. The results of a field experiment and two greenhouse experiments suggest that the presence of a low proportion of low WUE individuals may increase population-level performance. The study touches on very interesting and rather neglected aspects of population-level consequences of variability in stress vulnerability and adaptions, and as such it is both timely and important. While many aspects of the work, especially those related to the verification of mutant functionality, seem to have been executed meticulously, the experimental design and collected data raise serious doubts about the interpretation and significance of the findings.</p><p>1) Water availability: studying the functional implications of the presence of low-WUE individuals calls for experiments in which water availability is deliberately varied, controlled and monitored. Such a design would contrast high-water conditions where the presence of low-WUE individuals would be expected to cause little population-level effects and low-water conditions under which the presence of such plants would be expected to trigger significant population-level effects. While the authors tried to create differential water treatments in the field experiment, this attempt did not succeed. Moreover, in the two greenhouse experiments differential water availability was not even attempted and instead the authors provided constant water supply by applying frequent water supplements. Besides missing the above-mentioned aspect of differential water availability, this protocol might or might not have sufficiently homogenized water availability for the plants. Even if soil water content seemed to have been equalized by the daily supplementation, soil and plants surely underwent daily cycles of diurnal drying (more so in populations with larger proportions of low WUE plants), which could have had important effects on plant drought perception, responses and population effects. Overcoming this problem could have been achieved by running at least two (high vs. low) water treatments that would be continuously sustained with high precision and temporal resolution (minutes, not whole days) and soil water content should have been monitored using non-destructive methods, e.g. TDR, to account for high-res variability in water availability. Accordingly, while the findings of these experiments are legitimate, their interpretation could be different. Specifically, it can be hypothesized that the observed population-level responses to the presence of low proportions of low-WUE plants was triggered by the slightly reduced water availability in those treatments (rendered by these plants) and not necessarily by any non-resource signaling or cuing. Teasing apart the resource availability and non-resource information alternatives would require additional treatments and much tighter monitoring of soil water (see above).</p><p>2) Neighbor- vs. population-level effects: based on careful analyses of the response of individuals located at variable distances from the irMPK4 plants, the authors claim that the population-level effects of the presence of low proportion irMPK4 plants could not be attributed to local interactions between immediate neighbors; however, given that a) the effect is most likely done via root-root interactions and b) the precise position of the roots in such micro populations is not known, the reported results could be hypothesized to have been caused by the very commonly observed aggregation of more active roots near the pot's boundary/wall, where most root interaction took place. Accordingly, the seemingly counter-intuitive 'scale-skipping' phenomenon could be trivially attributed to a technical artifact rather than to an ecologically meaningful phenomenon.</p><p>3) Abrogation of AMF associations: the hypothesis that mycorrhizal networks could play an important functional role in the priming of neighboring plants to various stresses has been supported in other cases and could have been interesting in the context of the present project. It is thus not clear why the authors chose to eliminate this aspect from the study.</p><p>4) Fitness effects: while proxies of fitness typically, and for very good reasons, serve as golden evidence in ecological studies, attention should be given to the fact that the harvests and fitness surveys were conducted at ca. day 50 and before plants had the opportunity to finish their natural life cycle (typically 90 d). Given that the presence of a low proportion of low-WUE plants could have slightly reduced water availability, the observed differences could be attributed to accelerated reproduction, which is rather common in plans responding mild stresses or signals and cues of imminent stresses (see e.g. https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erw272).</p><p>5) Shoot involvement in MPK4-deficiency: the demonstration of the importance of the shoots in mediating the functionality of MPK4-deficiency is very nice but not directly related to the main questions dealt with in the study. Given the vastness of the manuscript, it seems that this finding could be reported elsewhere.</p><p>6) Data analyses and presentation: a) Analysis of a large proportion of the results could have been better done using ANCOVAs, accounting for individual data, not merely treatment means.</p><p>b) The graphs are extremely cumbersome, complex and hard to follow.

The authors calculate mean traits for each genotype in each treatment, and then calculate the predicted summed traits from genotype means and genotype numbers. This, and the PAT of a specific MPRK4 proportion treatment divided by the EV PAT (=PT) is used to conclude that there was an increase in yield at low proportions of MPK4. However, the summed traits could actually be measured directly. Shouldn't PAT somehow be compared to the observed traits? Was there an increase in total trait values when it was measured, rather than when it was predicted from genotype means? The authors never explain why they used PATs, or what more can be gleaned from this analyses vs. doing an analysis on measured values.</p><p>It furthermore is not clear to me if the population trends have any statistical significance. They are based on mostly non-significant differences in PATs from Figure 3, but the PT results are discussed as if they were significant. What is the statistical basis for this?</p><p>My larger criticism concerns the framing of this study, and in particular the structure of the Abstract and Introduction. For example, both discuss the importance of signals and neighbor perception as the only factors relevant for population performance. I am not debating that signals can be important in some cases, but for a manuscript that could make a contribution to the functional diversity literature this focus seems quite strange. Similarly, I found the Introduction to lack relevant references, particularly on the first page.</p><p>I highlight a few problematic passages below:</p><p>Abstract: 'Functional variation' of what? I would expect this to refer to diversity effects mediated by functional differences among species, but the paper is about trait differences in genotypes within species. Are intraspecific functional diversity effects equally well understood/reported? This statement needs to be clearer and more specific.</p><p>Abstract: It is unclear why signalling should be this important. Functional trait diversity is assumed to cause increased population yield by better niche partitioning or emergent properties of a system, which does not have to rely on plant-plant signalling. The assumption that signalling and perception would be involved in trait diversity-mediated yield effects needs to be introduced and justified better.</p><p>'this occurred at the population scale' – I have trouble imagining what this means. Could this be put more explicitly, e.g., 'while individual plants or plant pairs did not differ significantly, effects became apparent at the population scale'?</p><p>I do not understand the sentence 'higher levels in biological hierarchies set boundaries for the function of traits at lower levels in the hierarchy', and the meaning of the sentence does not become clearer from the following sentences.</p><p>Introduction, first paragraph: The hierarchical argument is weakened by the vague definitions of population and community. Do I interpret the author's definition of population correctly as 'the individuals of the same species that potentially interact within a geographical area'? Is the community then the full assemblage of all species in that same area, or does it refer to still only one species, but at a larger geographic scale? It seems the authors only ever discuss single-species communities, but this should be clearly defined.</p><p>Introduction, first paragraph: Proposed by whom?</p><p>The statement 'signals […] can originate from water-use trait variation' suggests that the signals are known and understood. However, without reading the individual cited examples, the authors appear to cite studies that show an effect of WUE variability in populations on population yield. If this is the case, this is no evidence for the involvement of signals. A signal has a clear definition, meaning the intentional transfer of information. If there is evidence for this, the authors should explain this evidence; if there is not, they should not use the term signal.</p><p>Introduction, third paragraph: I would expect a plant's yield to respond to its own soil water availability first, yet this sentence suggests that this a potential secondary mechanism, after the more important effect of sensing WUE in other plants. This seems counterintuitive.</p><p>Introduction, sixth paragraph: It seems impossible to conclude from this example that <italic>N. attenuata</italic> responds differently do genetically different neighbors. Perhaps the AZ plants have a faster growth or are better competitors and leave fewer resources for UT plants, in which case the result has nothing to do with UT's ability to perceive the similarity of its neighbor. A single comparison such as this one is heavily confounding genetic differences and all other differences between plants.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Determining the scale at which variation in water-use traits and AMF associations change population yields&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

However, considerable experience and data indicate that diversity at genotypic and phenotypic levels can enhance productivity and stability. This manuscript shows that diversity associated with silencing of MPK4, enhances yield (called overyielding) in. a population in which there is a low percentage of irMPK4 plants. They authors provide data showing that the overyielding effect is not the result of interactions of near neighbors but rather emerges at a population level. Given that, the final part of the manuscript investigates communication among plants. First, they introduce genetically a second mutation, silencing <italic>NaCCaMK</italic>, which blocks symbiotic association with AM fungi. Nonetheless, overyielding persists, indicating that inter-plant communication does not occur via AMF connections below-ground. Finally, they perform shoot-root grafting experiments and show that the ability for a plant to respond to its neighbors requires MPK4 expression in shoots, but not in roots, strongly implicating above-ground communication in the response.&quot;</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Summary of reviewer 1:</p><p>“This is a resubmission of a very challenging paper. Challenging because of its high originality and innovative methods, but also challenging because of its narrative. While the first was already impressing the reviewers of the original submission the second was so difficult initially that reviewers felt somewhat lost. This resubmitted version is now much clearer, even though the added results of mycorrhizal treatments have increased the complexity. I think with a further clarification of the narrative this will become a very important paper.</p><p>The problem with the current narrative is already visible in the title: &quot;Determining the scale at which variation in water-use traits and AMF associations change population yields&quot;. I would change this to: &quot;Determining the scale at which variation in a single gene changes population yields&quot;. The second title identifies the major novelty of this paper. The old title relates to a hypothesis that was carefully dismantled by the authors, namely that the reason for the single-gene diversity effect on population yield was due to its effect on water use. The story starts with two observations: 1) &quot;overyielding&quot; of mixtures as compared with monocultures, due to a single gene for a MAP kinase and 2) phenotypic effects of the presence vs. absence of this gene on plant water-use efficiency (WUE). This leads to the obvious hypothesis that 1) could be due to 2). However, in the end the story turns out not to support the hypothesis and the reader is left in suspense as to which other phenotypic effects of the gene could be responsible for 1).</p><p>There are some indications in the manuscript of how the suspense could be reduced, but the main revisions should be aimed at improving this aspect of the paper (including a better final sentence in the Abstract). First, it is already mentioned in the Introduction that a gene that affects MAPKs can have multiple phenotypes, changed WUE only being one of those and here thoroughly tested and excluded as cause of overyielding. Second, in the Discussion it is mentioned that other factors causing overyielding could range from niche complementarity to the exchange of chemical signals. But the discussion then still comes back to below-ground mechanisms whereas I think it would be better to focus on potential above-ground mechanisms and a more in-depth &quot;speculation&quot; of how these could work.”</p><p>Reviewer 2 finds the second part of the paper difficult to follow, because one could look in different ways at the difference between the performance of a plant grown in a pair vs. alone. This requires careful explanation, as suggested by this reviewer:</p><p>&quot;I find the revised manuscript by McGale et al. has been improved considerably, and both the new Introduction and figures make this complex story more approachable. In particular the first half of experiments are very well set up conceptually now, and the sequence of results makes intuitive sense. Unfortunately, I find this is not maintained throughout the manuscript, and for some of the later experiments I do not follow the conclusions that the authors draw from them.</p><p>The central observation of the study is that in populations of empty-vector (EV) control plants and low-water use efficiency (irMPK4) plants, a low proportion of irMPK4 plants causes population overyielding. The authors then carry out a series of experiments to identify potential mechanisms explaining this overyielding. Through population experiments in the field and greenhouse, they demonstrate that overyielding is caused by an increased performance of EV plants, apparently at no cost to irMPK4 plants. While this increase is not significant at the individual plant level it seems nonetheless fairly apparent in Figure 3—figure supplement 2, and the cumulative effect on all EV plants results in a significant population increase, demonstrated in Figure 3. Interestingly, the authors did not find an effect of overyielding when EV plants were grown with a single irMPK4 neighbour, leading the authors to conclude that overyielding is a population-scale process.</p><p>However, there seems to be a logical disconnect between the population results on overyielding, and the experiments evaluating MPK4 in the paired design. In the paired design, the authors demonstrate that irMPK4 plants all have the same (lower) biomass and fitness correlates, regardless of whether they are grown individually or in pairs with EV or irMPK4 plants, while EV plants have better performance when growing alone. The authors conclude that this means MPK4 is required for the <italic>N. attenuata</italic> growth and yield response (subsection “MPK4 is necessary for <italic>N. attenuata’s</italic> growth and yield responses to neighbors”).</p><p>I have two issues with this conclusion. First, it seems to me this conclusion does not match the data: I would think if MPK4 were involved in a growth/yield response to neighbours, the irMPK4 plants should all have the same high biomass/yield of EV plants grown alone. Instead, the data suggests to me that irMPK4 plants are impaired in growth, making them unable to benefit from reduced competition when growing alone.</p><p>Second, I find it difficult to connect these results and those of the grafting experiment to the observed overyielding. The results demonstrate that MPK4 expressed in shoot allows plant to benefit from growing alone, while abrogation of MPK4 in the shoot 'impairs' plant fitness and reduces it to the level of competing plants. However, the authors clearly demonstrate that overyielding was achieved by plants increasing growth/yield while surrounded by many neighbours – the MPK4 effect on plants growing alone thus does not seem relevant for explaining overyielding.</p><p>I assume these issues could simply be resolved by a more careful transition between the two experimental parts, and by a more extensive explanation of the deductive reasoning used here. I would think this may benefit many of the future readers of this study.&quot;</p><p>Reviewer 3 has general points that are also indicated in the summary above:</p><p>&quot;I have two major concerns:</p><p>1) The title is misleading because the AMF associations or lack thereof did not affect population yields. Second, I think it may be premature to argue that the WUE phenotypic consequences of irMPK4 are responsible-see next point.</p><p>2) irMPK4 results in reduced water use efficiency (WUE), but it is not at all clear that the overyielding observed here is associated with the WUE aspects of loss of MPK4. Indeed, do not the rewatering experiments in which they add to each pot the amount of water predicted to be lost each day not argue against (or at least fail to support) a role for WUE? The authors argue that altered WUE may be responsible because the rate of water loss from the soil around the irMPK4 plants will be more rapid than around wild type MPK4+ plants, which is certainly true. It is equally true that many changes may be associated with very early stages of drought, probably like those encountered by the irMPK4 plants in these experiments. However, it is important to remember that MAP kinase cascades can signal through multiple disparate downstream targets to influence a broad array of phenotypes. The effect of irMPK4 in overyielding may be unrelated to its effect on WUE.&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53517.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration. What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The strength of you manuscript is the use of very promising tools to analyze a within-species diversity effect mechanistically down to the effects of a single genetic difference between members of a population. The weakness is the ecological setting of the work as detailed in the reviews below. This aspect could be improved by setting a different frame, but we also feel it would need different or additional experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with these concerns and have addressed the two weaknesses as follows: first, the data has now been visualized and contextualized in consideration to the ecological literature as suggested by the reviewers and the Editor. Second, we include additional data pertaining to our analysis of the influence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) networks on the yields of our field populations (Figure 5C; Figure 7). We think that this adds to the strength of the manuscript as an additional tool to identify the scale at which trait diversity causes population overyielding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All reviewers found your manuscript very difficult to understand, and I think some of the comments reflect this, for example those about statistics in the third review.</p></disp-quote><p>We have substantially improved the visualization of our overyielding results by using de Wit diagrams (suggested by reviewer #1; applied in Figures 3, 4, 7). This significantly reduced the number of new abbreviations that were needed and allowed us to rely on established terminology. We acknowledge that the descriptions of the statistical analyses were not sufficient and have added additional information in our statistical tables as well as in our Materials and methods section. We hope that both these changes help to clarify our results and statistics, and that the rigor of the work can be more readily appreciated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] Mechanisms of how emergent features can be created by diversity have been discussed at large in the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning literature, but their molecular basis has almost never been assessed, except in a recent paper by Wuest and Niklaus (Nature Ecology and Evolution 2018).</p></disp-quote><p>We found this remark very insightful and included this and similar references in the first paragraph of our Introduction. Particularly, we found that there have been several instances where forward genetics methods have shown a particular locus or chromosomal region as potentially driving observed biodiversity-productivity relationships and that they have not been tested further. This may be due to the complexity of population experiments and uncertainty regarding the scale at which to test the function of these loci and observe their potential effects. We believe that citing this literature has helped to highlight the need for work determining the effects of</p><p>certain gene-trait alterations at different scales within populations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors focus in my view perhaps too much on a comparison between neighbor interactions and effects at neighborhood scale and population-level responses. This originates from the hypothesis that it could be chemical signals that are exchanged between individuals that lead to the observed phenomena. However, other, perhaps more phenomenological mechanisms would be conceivable and would typically be considered in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research. These include resource complementarity or interactions with other organisms, including soil microbes. Basically, the question is why a few individuals that have lost the ability to control their stomates can increase population performance.</p></disp-quote><p>We considered this point carefully in light of the observation that we interpreted the results, specifically in relation to chemical signals, without discussing alternative hypotheses and have removed this unwarranted early emphasis on chemical signals (Figure 1; Abstract, Introduction, Discussion). Instead, we use new experimental data from populations connected to AMF networks to continue our line of inquiry in identifying the scale at which overyielding responses may occur. We emphasize in the Discussion that this work is essential to determine mechanism through which MPK4 acts at the above-ground population scale to result in population reproductive overyielding, whether this can be attributed to specific chemical signals, or to other plant-plant interaction phenomena such as complementation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) Water availability: studying the functional implications of the presence of low-WUE individuals calls for experiments in which water availability is deliberately varied, controlled and monitored. Such a design would contrast high-water conditions where the presence of low-WUE individuals would be expected to cause little population-level effects and low-water conditions under which the presence of such plants would be expected to trigger significant population-level effects. While the authors tried to create differential water treatments in the field experiment, this attempt did not succeed. Moreover, in the two greenhouse experiments differential water availability was not even attempted and instead the authors provided constant water supply by applying frequent water supplements.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that controlling for soil water availability is the best means of studying the functional implications of the presence of low WUE individuals in populations, however, we disagree that this requires contrasting conditions of low- to high-water availability, especially if these two conditions do not represent alternative selective regimes for plants in nature. The field results demonstrate that soil moisture in the natural habitat of <italic>N. attenuata</italic> decreases throughout the field season (Figure 3—figure supplement 4), where high water availability is only relevant at earlier developmental stages of the plant and low water availability at later stages. This is commonly the case in the Great Basin Desert where the majority of the annual precipitation falls in the winter, before the start of the growing season. This decrease did not appear to vary by microenvironment within our populations and did not depend on a period of withheld irrigation (Figure 3—figure supplement 4). In our glasshouse experiments, we considered the ecological importance of the changes in water availability across developmental stages, and now include a description in Materials and methods of our strategies to vary glasshouse water availability in an ecologically relevant manner. In short, we began experiments with a period of high soil moisture for establishment, transitioned to soil moisture percentages that were similar to those in the field for the developmental transitions into bolting and anthesis, and then withheld water for natural and equal dry-downs across pots in the glasshouse at the end of each experiment. This regime of controlled decreases in water availability transitions the populations into producing ripe seed capsules due to the scarcity of soil water, mimicking the natural drydown that occurs in nature, which stimulates capsule ripening regardless of plant age after anthesis (Zavala and Baldwin, 2004 and references within). A dry-down through our controlled watering technique is visually demonstrated in Figure 4 using our paired experiment to emphasize the use of this method that ensures that all pots synchronously reach 0g of available water. We describe this method in greater detail in our unpublished results (McGale and Valim et al) in which the benefits of this approach in attributing plant responses to equal changes in water variability are highlighted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Besides missing the above-mentioned aspect of differential water availability, this protocol might or might not have sufficiently homogenized water availability for the plants. Even if soil water content seemed to have been equalized by the daily supplementation, soil and plants surely underwent daily cycles of diurnal drying (more so in populations with larger proportions of low WUE plants), which could have had important effects on plant drought perception, responses and population effects. Overcoming this problem could have been achieved by running at least two (high vs. low) water treatments that would be continuously sustained with high precision and temporal resolution (minutes, not whole days) and soil water content should have been monitored using non-destructive methods, e.g. TDR, to account for high-res variability in water availability.</p></disp-quote><p>We homogenized water availability for the plants (see above response and our additional reference), and did not find that different cycles of diurnal drying or potential drought perception or responses occurred between the two genotypes in differing population types. This was demonstrated through the use of Yara- Zim leaf turgor pressure probes, which were attached to the leaves of EV and irMPK4 plants in the populations and provided continuous recordings throughout the experiment. We now include these data in Figure 3—figure supplement 8 and a detailed interpretation of the graphs in our Materials and methods section. These data from individual plants are consistent with the inferences from the controlled water experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Accordingly, while the findings of these experiments are legitimate, their interpretation could be different. Specifically, it can be hypothesized that the observed population-level responses to the presence of low proportions of low-WUE plants was triggered by the slightly reduced water availability in those treatments (rendered by these plants) and not necessarily by any non-resource signaling or cuing. Teasing apart the resource availability and non-resource information alternatives would require additional treatments and much tighter monitoring of soil water (see above).</p></disp-quote><p>In the glasshouse experiments, we found that the grams of water used by a particular pot could be linearly predicted; equal soil water availability was consistently achieved across all pots after a 24-hour drying period (e.g. troughs in Figure 4B) when pots were provided with exactly the amount that they would use in one day (e.g. peaks in Figure 4B). Pots which used more water (i.e. with more irMPK4 plants) received more grams of water at watering events (peaks in Figure 4B). From these greater amounts of water, pots with a greater proportion of irMPK4 plants would have a steeper decline in water availability throughout the day. This would mean that populations with higher frequency of low-WUE plants would surpass low frequency low-WUE plant populations in depleting water availability throughout the day and therefore they would have equal- or lower-water availability for a longer period. This could preferentially trigger growth responses in those populations, as stated by reviewer #2. We did not observe overyielding in these high frequency populations, nor did we observe unequal water availability in any pot type at the end of each 24-hour cycle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Neighbor- vs. population-level effects: based on careful analyses of the response of individuals located at variable distances from the irMPK4 plants, the authors claim that the population-level effects of the presence of low proportion irMPK4 plants could not be attributed to local interactions between immediate neighbors; however, given that a) the effect is most likely done via root-root interactions and b) the precise position of the roots in such micro populations is not known, the reported results could be hypothesized to have been caused by the very commonly observed aggregation of more active roots near the pot's boundary/wall, where most root interaction took place. Accordingly, the seemingly counter-intuitive 'scale-skipping' phenomenon could be trivially attributed to a technical artifact rather than to an ecologically meaningful phenomenon.</p></disp-quote><p>The experiments with grafted plants having depleted MPK4 expression only in roots, which responded in a manner similar to that of the EV control plants, indicated that shoot MPK4 expression, not root expression, is responsible for the phenotypes attributed to irMPK4. These data do not eliminate the possibility of root interactions contributing to the phenomena that we observe but do indicate that shoot phenotypes and above-ground interactions are more important for the differences introduced by MPK4 silencing. The new data presented in Figure 7 and accompanying conclusions are consistent with the grafting results and have redirected the discussion to considerations of above-ground interactions rather than below-ground phenomena in the field or the glasshouse.</p><p>We removed the discussion of pot-side effects as we could not find strong references to support that these would significantly change the interactions of plants in population (see response to reviewer #1). Additionally, the consistency of the overyielding in the glasshouse with that in the field, without pot side effects and with fewer direct neighbor interactions, lead us to infer that direct root contact influenced by pot-side interactions is not likely the main driver of the observed overyielding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Abrogation of AMF associations: the hypothesis that mycorrhizal networks could play an important functional role in the priming of neighboring plants to various stresses has been supported in other cases and could have been interesting in the context of the present project.

Similarly, I found the Introduction to lack relevant references, particularly on the first page.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #3 for these comments and for the highlighted passages included in the review. We re-wrote the Introduction to address these comments, and also removed the emphasis on chemical signals, rather than other ecological mechanisms that could have produced our results (see response to reviewer #1). We introduce and discuss a variety of mechanisms that could contribute to the observed overyielding effects. Additionally, we focused the novelty of our manuscript at determining the scale at which these effects occur and on setting a foundation for exploring a variety of discussed mechanisms (see response to reviewer #1). We included many additional references, particularly in the Introduction, and hope that this helps to situate the work appropriately in the context of functional diversity literature.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Summary of reviewer 1:</p><p>“This is a resubmission of a very challenging paper. Challenging because of its high originality and innovative methods, but also challenging because of its narrative. While the first was already impressing the reviewers of the original submission the second was so difficult initially that reviewers felt somewhat lost. This resubmitted version is now much clearer, even though the added results of mycorrhizal treatments have increased the complexity. I think with a further clarification of the narrative this will become a very important paper.</p><p>The problem with the current narrative is already visible in the title: &quot;Determining the scale at which variation in water-use traits and AMF associations change population yields&quot;. I would change this to: &quot;Determining the scale at which variation in a single gene changes population yields&quot;. The second title identifies the major novelty of this paper. The old title relates to a hypothesis that was carefully dismantled by the authors, namely that the reason for the single-gene diversity effect on population yield was due to its effect on water use.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewers 1 and 3 (please see reviewer #3 comments 1 and 2) regarding the misleading nature of our previous title and the demonstration of WUE- and AMF-independent population yield effects. We have addressed this directly by changing the title to &quot;Determining the scale at which variation in a single gene changes population yields&quot;in order for it to accurately reflect the content of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The story starts with two observations: 1) &quot;overyielding&quot; of mixtures as compared with monocultures, due to a single gene for a MAP kinase and 2) phenotypic effects of the presence vs. absence of this gene on plant water-use efficiency (WUE). This leads to the obvious hypothesis that 1) could be due to 2). However, in the end the story turns out not to support the hypothesis and the reader is left in suspense as to which other phenotypic effects of the gene could be responsible for 1).</p><p>There are some indications in the manuscript of how the suspense could be reduced, but the main revisions should be aimed at improving this aspect of the paper (including a better final sentence in the Abstract).</p></disp-quote><p>In accordance with the title change, we agree that the Abstract needed to be revised in order to accurately reflect the progressive dissection of the overyielding effect through the experimental narrative of the manuscript. We have changed several sentences, including the last one, in hope of clarifying the sequential experimental steps in the dissection of the source of the observed overyielding response: first, that the effect results from the single-gene manipulation, and not from water-use phenotypes; second, that it occurs at the population scale; and third, that it likely specifically occurs above-ground.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>First, it is already mentioned in the Introduction that a gene that affects MAPKs can have multiple phenotypes, changed WUE only being one of those and here thoroughly tested and excluded as cause of overyielding. Second, in the Discussion it is mentioned that other factors causing overyielding could range from niche complementarity to the exchange of chemical signals. But the discussion then still comes back to below-ground mechanisms whereas I think it would be better to focus on potential above-ground mechanisms and a more in-depth &quot;speculation&quot; of how these could work.”</p></disp-quote><p>Incorporating this advice from reviewer #1 was valuable to improve the thoroughness of our Discussion. We have now included more in-depth speculations on the extended mechanisms that could manifest in neighbor- versus population-scale effects (Discussion, third paragraph, as well as bolstered our speculation on potential above-ground mechanisms, including adding several new paragraphs (Discussion, seventh to tenth paragraphs).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2 finds the second part of the paper difficult to follow, because one could look in different ways at the difference between the performance of a plant grown in a pair vs. alone. This requires careful explanation, as suggested by this reviewer:</p><p>&quot;I find the revised manuscript by McGale et al. has been improved considerably, and both the new Introduction and figures make this complex story more approachable. In particular the first half of experiments are very well set up conceptually now, and the sequence of results makes intuitive sense. Unfortunately, I find this is not maintained throughout the manuscript, and for some of the later experiments I do not follow the conclusions that the authors draw from them.</p><p>The central observation of the study is that in populations of empty-vector (EV) control plants and low-water use efficiency (irMPK4) plants, a low proportion of irMPK4 plants causes population overyielding. The authors then carry out a series of experiments to identify potential mechanisms explaining this overyielding. Through population experiments in the field and greenhouse, they demonstrate that overyielding is caused by an increased performance of EV plants, apparently at no cost to irMPK4 plants. While this increase is not significant at the individual plant level it seems nonetheless fairly apparent in Figure 3—figure supplement 2, and the cumulative effect on all EV plants results in a significant population increase, demonstrated in Figure 3. Interestingly, the authors did not find an effect of overyielding when EV plants were grown with a single irMPK4 neighbour, leading the authors to conclude that overyielding is a population-scale process.</p><p>However, there seems to be a logical disconnect between the population results on overyielding, and the experiments evaluating MPK4 in the paired design. In the paired design, the authors demonstrate that irMPK4 plants all have the same (lower) biomass and fitness correlates, regardless of whether they are grown individually or in pairs with EV or irMPK4 plants, while EV plants have better performance when growing alone. The authors conclude that this means MPK4 is required for the <italic>N. attenuata</italic> growth and yield response (subsection “MPK4 is necessary for <italic>N. attenuata</italic>’s growth and yield responses to neighbors”).</p><p>I have two issues with this conclusion. First, it seems to me this conclusion does not match the data: I would think if MPK4 were involved in a growth/yield response to neighbours, the irMPK4 plants should all have the same high biomass/yield of EV plants grown alone. Instead, the data suggests to me that irMPK4 plants are impaired in growth, making them unable to benefit from reduced competition when growing alone.</p><p>Second, I find it difficult to connect these results and those of the grafting experiment to the observed overyielding. The results demonstrate that MPK4 expressed in shoot allows plant to benefit from growing alone, while abrogation of MPK4 in the shoot 'impairs' plant fitness and reduces it to the level of competing plants. However, the authors clearly demonstrate that overyielding was achieved by plants increasing growth/yield while surrounded by many neighbours – the MPK4 effect on plants growing alone thus does not seem relevant for explaining overyielding.</p><p>I assume these issues could simply be resolved by a more careful transition between the two experimental parts, and by a more extensive explanation of the deductive reasoning used here. I would think this may benefit many of the future readers of this study.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We found these suggestions from reviewer 2 essential in improving the logical continuity of the manuscript. We extensively edited the Discussion in order to distinguish between the two main methods that we used: first, comparisons among individuals across population types; and second, analyses of the neighbor responses of individual genotypes in order to infer (although, not test directly) how these might potentially result in emergent overyielding effects at the population scale. The latter was tested using comparisons of individuals planted alone or in pairs, versus individuals planted in varying population types. The observations of reviewer 2 are completely correct: the data at first seems contradictory, as EV plants in single and paired plantings (i.e. in the absence or presence of a neighbor) reveal that EV reduces yield in the presence of a neighbor (EV or irMPK4), but in populations with varying irMPK4 percentages, overyielding occurs in comparison to EV monocultures. However, these results emerge from two different methods that do not necessarily produce results that are mutually exclusive. The former result includes a density test that is not present in experiments comparing individuals across pairs or populations with a consistent number of individuals. It is entirely possible that in our 12-plant monocultures, EV has reduced yield in comparison to a single plant in the 7.5L population pots. EV’s density-related yield reduction (i.e. with increasing numbers of neighbors) may be attenuated by different interaction scenarios with irMPK4 plants (i.e. with increasing neighbor “quality”), leading to overyielding in comparison to EV in monocultures, but not necessarily in comparison to a single EV. We use comparisons with the single EV in a subset of our paired experiments to evaluate the neighbor response profiles of EV and irMPK4 in order to nucleate our speculations about the possible mechanisms responsible for the overyielding, but we fully agree that direct comparisons are not warranted. We see now that our previous descriptions implied that these neighbor response profiling experiments were directly explaining overyielding, and have carefully corrected these statements. We have also recognized that the transitions between the two methods were at best, telegraphic, in our previous Discussion, so this section has been embellished.</p><p>Reviewer 2 brings to light a good point regarding our discussion of <italic>MPK4</italic> as a requirement for <italic>N. attenuata’s</italic> response to neighbors. Our tests, as well as previous studies, show that irMPK4 grows smaller than EV. In our previous discussion, we inferred that the lack of a difference in irMPK4’s growth with or without a neighbor demonstrates that irMPK4 does not respond to neighbors. In fact, we are not able to distinguish between a lack of response to neighbors and an impaired growth phenotype that does not allow irMPK4 (or shoot-<italic>MPK4</italic>-deficient) plants to benefit from the absence of a neighbor, as stated by reviewer 2. We have addressed this in our discussion by using more precise language to what we have observed: irMPK4 plants’ growth and reproductive yield does not change in the presence of a neighbor, while EV plants’ does. Although we cannot specifically dissect the mechanism of this differential response, we still believe it to be a significant finding from which we can infer (but not directly test) how <italic>MPK4</italic> plays a role in <italic>N. attenuata’s</italic> neighbor responses. We have made the description and discussion of this result more precise throughout the manuscript, and have congruently elaborated on our related inferences in the Discussion.</p><p>We also agree that the purpose of our paired grafting experiment was not well motivated in the Discussion. This experiment is now motivated as an exploration of the above- or below-ground spatial scales at which population-scale effects may have occurred. The paired grafting experiment was a neighbor absence or presence test with the intent to identify the tissues specifically involved in <italic>N. attenuata’s</italic> ability to respond to a neighbor. Reviewer 2 noted correctly that our previous Discussion implied that the grafted pair results directly explained overyielding results. This has been corrected and overall we have attempted to better align results with inferences. We believe that these changes clarify the main novel findings of the manuscript, and point to potential future steps that could directly explore the relationship between <italic>MPK4</italic> abundanceand population overyielding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 3 has general points that are also indicated in the summary above:</p><p>&quot;I have two major concerns:</p><p>1) The title is misleading because the AMF associations or lack thereof did not affect population yields. Second, I think it may be premature to argue that the WUE phenotypic consequences of irMPK4 are responsible-see next point.</p><p>2) irMPK4 results in reduced water use efficiency (WUE), but it is not at all clear that the overyielding observed here is associated with the WUE aspects of loss of MPK4. Indeed, do not the rewatering experiments in which they add to each pot the amount of water predicted to be lost each day not argue against (or at least fail to support) a role for WUE? The authors argue that altered WUE may be responsible because the rate of water loss from the soil around the irMPK4 plants will be more rapid than around wild type MPK4+ plants, which is certainly true. It is equally true that many changes may be associated with very early stages of drought, probably like those encountered by the irMPK4 plants in these experiments. However, it is important to remember that MAP kinase cascades can signal through multiple disparate downstream targets to influence a broad array of phenotypes. The effect of irMPK4 in overyielding may be unrelated to its effect on WUE.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our first response to Essential revisions above.</p></body></sub-article></article>
