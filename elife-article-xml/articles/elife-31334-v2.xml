In this study, we show endothelial lipase (LIPG) is aberrantly overexpressed in basal-like TNBCs. We demonstrate that LIPG is required for <italic>in vivo</italic> tumorigenicity and metastasis of TNBC cells. LIPG possesses a lipase-dependent function that supports cancer cell proliferation and a lipase-independent function that promotes invasiveness, stemness and basal/epithelial-mesenchymal transition features of TNBC. Mechanistically, LIPG executes its oncogenic function through its involvement in interferon-related DTX3L-ISG15 signaling, which regulates protein function and stability by ISGylation. We show that DTX3L, an E3-ubiquitin ligase, is required for maintaining LIPG protein levels in TNBC cells by inhibiting proteasome-mediated LIPG degradation. Inactivation of LIPG impairs DTX3L-ISG15 signaling, indicating the existence of DTX3L-LIPG-ISG15 signaling. We further reveal LIPG-ISG15 signaling is lipase-independent. We demonstrate that DTX3L-LIPG-ISG15 signaling is essential for malignancies of TNBC cells. Targeting this pathway provides a novel strategy for basal-like TNBC therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Basal-like TNBC</kwd><kwd>endothelial lipase</kwd><kwd>LIPG</kwd><kwd>DTX3L</kwd><kwd>ISG15</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006636</institution-id><institution>University of Maryland, Baltimore County</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SOP1841-IQB2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Weiliang</given-names></name><name><surname>Kane</surname><given-names>Maureen A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA157779A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Qun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA163820A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Qun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>LIPG, a lipoprotein lipase, executes its oncogenic function in human basal-like triple-negative breast cancer through its functional involvement in DTX3L-ISG15 signaling, an interferon-related pathway that regulates protein functionality by ISGylation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease and has been classified into several molecular subtypes, including basal-like, HER2-positive, and luminal breast cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Perou et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sørlie et al., 2001</xref>). The majority of diagnosed basal-like breast cancer is triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is characterized by its lack of estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and HER2 receptors, and contributes to the lack of targeted therapies for basal-like breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rakha et al., 2009</xref>). Basal-like TNBC is highly aggressive, with poor clinical outcomes due to its high tumor grade, increased rate of proliferation and metastasis, and frequent recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sørlie et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sorlie et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badve et al., 2011</xref>). Basal-like TNBC is highly associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lehmann et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, basal-like TNBCs are enriched for poorly differentiated cancer stem cells (CSCs) with the CD24-CD44+ phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Honeth et al., 2008</xref>). These EMT and CSC features contribute to aggressiveness, metastasis and chemoresistance of basal-like TNBC. Nevertheless, what pathological factors confer these features on basal-like TNBC remain largely unknown.</p><p>Cancer cells are known to manifest metabolic dysregulation (e.g. the Warburg Effect) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koppenol et al., 2011</xref>). In addition to deregulation of carbohydrate metabolism, dysregulation of lipid uptake, synthesis and metabolism has been found in various types of cancer and some of these alterations have been shown to be crucial for tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Santos and Schulze, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baumann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beloribi-Djefaflia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Slebe et al., 2016</xref>). Lipoprotein lipases belong to the triglyceride (TG) lipase gene family and play a crucial role in the metabolism and cellular uptake of plasma lipoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McCoy et al., 2002</xref>). Lipoprotein lipases enzymatically digest lipoproteins to liberate their lipid contents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McCoy et al., 2002</xref>). The released lipid precursors can be taken up by the cell for incorporation into lipid synthesis or lipid metabolism to generate energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Slebe et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, lipoprotein lipases promote the binding and cellular uptake of lipoproteins in an enzyme-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Strauss et al., 2002</xref>). Aberrant lipoprotein lipase expression has been reported to contribute to lipid dysregulation in several types of cancer and promote tumorigenesis by supplying cancer cells with lipid precursors, a high-energy fuel for cancer cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nielsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Slebe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cadenas et al., 2012</xref>). However, whether and how lipoprotein lipase dysregulation impacts on other malignant features (e.g. invasiveness, stemness, EMT) remain uncharacterized.</p><p>The interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) encodes an interferon (IFN)-inducible, ubiquitin-like protein. In cells, ISG15 is conjugated to an array of proteins (a process called ISGylation) functionally implicated in various cellular processes, encompassing IFN-induced immune responses and the modulation of cellular protein turnover (e.g. Ubiquitin/26S Proteasome Pathway) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Desai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hermann and Bogunovic, 2017</xref>). Growing studies show that ISG15 expression and protein ISGylation are dysregulated in numerous types of cancer and play a crucial role in tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sgorbissa and Brancolini, 2012</xref>). For example, aberrant overexpression of ISG15 has been shown to promote breast cancer cell invasion and tumorigenicity by disrupting cytoskeletal architecture, promoting cellular motility and enhancing the oncogenic function of Ki-Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hadjivasiliou, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burks et al., 2014</xref>). Elevated ISG15 expression has been reported in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with co-inactivation of both tumor suppressor genes p53 and ARF and is required for tumorigenic phenotypes exhibited in transformed MEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Forys et al., 2014</xref>). Given that TNBCs frequently displayed defects in both p53 and ARF and over half of TNBCs overexpressed ISG15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Forys et al., 2014</xref>), these findings suggest the potential role of ISG15 in TNBC development and progression.</p><p>Deltex (DTX)−3-like E3 ubiquitin ligase (DTX3L/BBAP) gains attention due to its roles in immune responses, DNA damage signaling and tumorigenesis. IFN-β and IFN-γ have been shown to induce DTX3L expression, suggesting its physiological involvement in IFN inflammatory signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Juszczynski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2015b</xref>). Moreover, DTX3L regulates DNA damage repair by promoting the recruitment of BRCA1 and 53BP1 to DNA damage sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yan et al., 2013</xref>). DTX3L has been recently linked to cancer due to its role in promoting metastasis of melanoma via activation of the FAK/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thang et al., 2015</xref>). DTX3L is reported to positively regulate the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), including ISG15, through mono-ubiquitination of a subset of histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2015b</xref>). Given the increasing importance of both DTX3L and ISG15 in tumorigenic regulation, the DTX3L-ISG15 regulatory axis may play a pivotal role in cancer development and progression, and deserves further study in TNBC.</p><p>In this study, we have found that compared to other breast cancer subtypes, basal-like TNBCs preferentially overexpress endothelial lipase (LIPG), a member of the TG lipase gene family. Our studies further show that LIPG overexpression promotes the development and metastasis of basal-like TNBC through its functional involvement in the oncogenic DTX3L-ISG15 signaling pathway. Moreover, our findings show that LIPG possesses both lipase-dependent and lipase-independent functions to promote the different aspects of basal-like TNBC malignancy. Our findings provide novel insights into the oncogenic role of LIPG in breast cancer and its functional link to IFN-related signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LIPG is preferentially overexpressed in basal-like TNBCs</title><p>To explore the roles of lipoprotein lipases in breast cancer, we performed <italic>in silico</italic> gene expression analysis of lipoprotein lipases, including lipoprotein lipase (<italic>LPL</italic>), hepatic lipase C (<italic>LIPC</italic>) and endothelial lipase G (<italic>LIPG</italic>), in breast cancer using the Oncomine cancer gene expression database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.oncomine.org">https://www.oncomine.org</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rhodes et al., 2007</xref>).

Interestingly, overexpression of LIPG<sup>S149A</sup> was highly effective to induce an approximately seven-fold increase in migration of MCF7 cells, which was stronger than the five-fold increase caused by wild-type LIPG overexpression (p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This finding indicates that the lipase function of LIPG is not required for LIPG to promote MCF7 migration. With regard to the impact of LIPG<sup>S149A</sup> overexpression on CSCs, we conducted primary and secondary CSC sphere formation assays. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, LIPG<sup>S149A</sup> was competent to enhance primary and secondary CSC sphere formation of MCF7 in spite of the fact that CSC spheres were smaller compared with those from control MCF7-CTRL cells. The extent of this CSC enhancement was similar to that of MCF7-LIPG. Nevertheless, wild-type LIPG overexpression led to the formation of larger CSC spheres, which was in contrast to smaller CSC spheres formed from MCF7-LIPG<sup>S149A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These findings suggest that although the effect of LIPG on the sphere formation (self-renewal) ability of CSCs is largely independent of its lipase activity, this metabolic lipase function is required for LIPG to promote the CSC proliferation rate, resulting in increased sphere sizes. Moreover, flow cytometric analysis showed that LIPG<sup>S149A</sup> was proficient in increasing the CD24-/CD44+ CSC population in MCF7 cells and its increased extent was greater than that of MCF7-LIPG (15.06 ± 0.75% of MCF7-LIPG<sup>S149A</sup> vs. 10.77 ± 1.19% of MCF7-LIPG, p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

Given that the sphere result is the combined outcome of both self-renewal and the proliferation rate of CSCs, some of the formed CSC spheres from MCF7-LIPG<sup>S149A</sup> were too small (&lt;50 μm) to be counted due to low sphere cell proliferation and they were excluded from the sphere count. This caused the discrepancy between the results of CSC sphere and CD24/CD44 profiling analyses.</p><p>To determine the impact of LIPG<sup>S149A</sup> on basal/EMT features of breast cancer cells, we examined expression of basal/EMT genes in MCF7- LIPG<sup>S149A</sup> compared with MCF7-CTRL and MCF7-LIPG using flow cytometry, qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence analyses.

Metastatic tumor foci were counted according to HE and IHC staining results.

Surprisingly, among upregulated proteins (the fold ≥2.0) we identified in MCF7-LIPG cells, 15 out of them are encoded by interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Eight ISGs (<italic>B2M</italic>, <italic>IFITM2</italic>, <italic>ISG15</italic>, <italic>MVP</italic>, <italic>NEDD4</italic>, <italic>S100A8</italic>, <italic>S100A9</italic>, <italic>UBE2L6</italic>) belong to IFN type I and II, five ISGs (<italic>AGR2</italic>, <italic>EIF2B2</italic>, <italic>JARID2</italic>, <italic>S100A7</italic>, <italic>TTC21A</italic>) are specific to IFN type I, and two ISGs (<italic>AKR1C2</italic>, <italic>CTSD</italic>) are specific to IFN type II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Among these upregulated ISG proteins, ISG15 and UBE2L6/UBCH8 were of interest. ISG15 has been shown to be involved in some subtypes of breast cancer, including TNBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hadjivasiliou, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burks et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Forys et al., 2014</xref>), and UBE2L6/UBCH8, a ubiquitin conjugating E2 enzyme, has been reported to mediate ISG15 conjugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhao et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that ISG15 mediates the oncogenic function of LIPG. To test this hypothesis, we first examined whether ISG15 expression is LIPG-dependent. From qRT-PCR and western blot analyses, we found that knockdown of endogenous LIPG in MCF10DCIS and MDA-MB-468 downregulated the mRNA and protein expression of ISG15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Furthermore, ectopic expression of LIPG in MCF7, MCF10DCIS and MDA-MB-468 led to the induction of ISG15 mRNA and protein expression, which was abolished by concurrent LIPG siRNA knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). We noticed that a basal level of ISG15 protein expression was detectable in parental MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), suggesting that there is a LIPG-independent mechanism for sustaining ISG15 expression in LIPG-deficient luminal breast cancer cells. Interestingly, ISG15 expression became reliant on LIPG in MCF7-LIPG cells, suggesting that LIPG overexpression might have reprogrammed MCF7 cells and rendered ISG15 expression dependent on LIPG. Moreover, the catalytically inactive mutant of LIPG (LIPG<sup>S149A</sup>) was capable of upregulating ISG15 expression in MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), suggesting that the lipase activity of LIPG is dispensable for the LIPG-ISG15 signaling axis.

ISG15 knockdown in both cell lines by this siRNA was confirmed by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). We observed that ISG15 knockdown had no impact on LIPG protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that there is no feedback regulation occurring in the LIPG-ISG15 axis. The knockdown studies showed that loss of ISG15 moderately impaired cell growth and CSC sphere formation of MCF10DCIS and MDA-MB-468, but substantially inhibited migration and invasion of both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E, F, G and H</xref>). These data indicate that the invasiveness of MCF10DCIS and MDA-MB-468 highly relies on ISG15 function. Consistently, ISG15-knockdown MCF10DCIS cells manifested a significantly decreased basal feature, indicated by a dramatic increase in the percentage of EpCAM+ cells in ISG15-knockdown MCF10DCIS (from 31.93 ± 6.53% of the control to 60.66 ± 5.78%, p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Moreover, qRT-PCR studies showed that ISG15 depletion in MCF10DCIS cells profoundly downregulated expression of multiple EMT programming genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). In line with the qRT-PCR data, immunofluorescent analysis showed that ISG15 knockdown led to a reduction in EMT features of TNBC cells, characterized by E-cadherin upregulation in MCF10DCIS and vimentin downregulation in both MCF10DCIS and MDA-MB-468 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Given that LIPG overexpression in MCF7 cells induced expression of IFN signature genes, including ISG15, we tested whether IFN signaling regulators are involved in modulating LIPG expression in TNBC cells. Among these known regulators, DTX3L drew our interest as it activates expression of ISG15 and other IFN-responsive genes by regulating the mono-ubiquitination of histones and has been found to function as an oncogenic factor in metastasis of melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2015b</xref>).

Surprisingly, DTX3L knockdown by either siRNA resulted in dramatic downregulation of LIPG protein expression in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). To determine whether the DTX3L-dependent expression of LIPG is regulated at the mRNA level, we performed qRT-PCR experiments on these siRNA-transfected cell samples. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, DTX3L knockdown only led to approximately 25% and 40% decreases in LIPG mRNA levels of MCF10DCIS and MDA-MB-468 cells, respectively. Since the modest decrease of LIPG mRNA levels caused by DTX3L deficiency could not completely account for the dramatic change in LIPG protein levels, we next tested whether DTX3L regulates LIPG protein stability. We examined LIPG protein levels in control and DTX3L-knockdown MDA-MB-468 cells treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide in a time course experiment. The result showed that DTX3L-knockdown cells displayed a shorter LIPG protein half-life (approximate 1 hr) compared to control cells with a longer LIPG half-life (approximate 4 hr) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), indicating that loss of DTX3L significantly decreased LIPG protein stability. To decipher whether this observed event was attributable to enhanced degradation of LIPG protein, we treated DTX3L siRNA-transfected cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. MG-132 treatment restored approximately 75% and 60% of control LIPG protein levels in DTX3L-knockdown MCF10DCIS and MDA-MB-468 cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).

Differential expression of DTX3L was not significant among different molecular subtypes of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that DTX3L may play a role in other breast cancer subtypes in addition to its role in basal-like TNBC. To determine whether DTX3L expression is positively associated with LIPG expression in TNBC, IHC studies were performed on nine cases of TNBC. Some representative IHC staining pictures are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>. After H-scoring of IHC staining data, we found that DTX3L protein staining was positively correlated with LIPG protein staining (p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). DTX3L mRNA levels were also positively associated with ISG15 mRNA levels (p&lt;0.001) according to <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of BLBC cases (n = 45) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). These findings suggest the existence of the DTX3L-LIPG-ISG15 signaling pathway in human basal-like TNBC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The oncogenic DTX3L-LIPG-ISG15 signaling axis is implicated in promoting basal-like TNBC development</title><p>To reveal the functional role of DTX3L in basal-like TNBC, we first conducted DTX3L knockdown studies on MCF10DCIS cells.

To address this question, we examined the impact of knocking down either LIPG or ISG15 in DTX3L-overexpressing MDA-MB-468 cells. Exogenous DTX3L overexpression promoted invasion, CSC sphere formation and expression of stem-cell and EMT genes, whereas DTX3L knockdown completely abolished these phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G, H and I</xref>), demonstrating that these observed events were DTX3L-specific. LIPG knockdown also effectively abolished all of these DTX3L-overexpression phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G, H and I</xref>), indicating that LIPG mediates the enhancing effect of DTX3L on invasiveness, stemness and basal/EMT features of MDA-MB-468 cells. Moreover, ISG15 knockdown suppressed DTX3L-overexpression-promoted invasion more significantly than its inhibitory effect on CSC sphere formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G and H</xref>). These results corroborated the gene expression data which showed that ISG15 knockdown inhibited DTX3L-mediated expression of EMT genes more potently than it suppressed the elevated expression of stem-cell genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). Xenograft studies further demonstrated that similar to DTX3L knockdown, knockdown of either LIPG or ISG15 completely abolished the DTX3L overexpression-enhanced growth of MDA-MB-468 xenograft tumors and also significantly inhibited tumor development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>). These <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies suggest that the DTX3L-LIPG-ISG15 signaling axis is pivotal for the development of basal-like TNBC.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have identified that LIPG is aberrantly overexpressed in a subset of basal-like TNBCs. We have further demonstrated that LIPG is crucial for malignant characteristics of LIPG-expressing TNBC cells, including invasiveness, stemness, basal/EMT features, <italic>in vivo</italic> tumorigenicity and <italic>in vivo</italic> metastasis. Moreover, LIPG is required for maintaining basal/EMT and tumorigenic phenotypes of the basal-like TNBC line MCF10DCIS, which forms basal-like ductal carcinoma <italic>in situ</italic> (DCIS) <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miller et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2008</xref>). Given that basal-like DCIS has been considered to be the precursor of invasive TNBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bryan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thike et al., 2013</xref>), our studies suggest that LIPG may play an oncogenic role in the progression from basal-like DCIS to invasive TNBC.</p><p>Although it has been proposed that the phospholipase activity of LIPG and its function in importing lipid precursor species into cells are involved in promoting breast cancer cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Slebe et al., 2016</xref>), the exact role of LIPG in breast cancer remains largely unknown. By studying the catalytically inactive mutant of LIPG, we for the first time have revealed that LIPG possess both lipase-dependent and lipase-independent functions in breast cancer cells. Our studies show that the lipase function of LIPG is implicated in supporting cell growth and promoting cell proliferation rate. In contrast, the lipase-independent function is required for LIPG to enhance invasiveness, stemness and basal/EMT features of breast cancer cells. This natural design of dual functional roles for LIPG is necessary as cell proliferation is not always coupled with the EMT and active in cancer stem cells. For example, TGFβ signaling has been known to activate the EMT and induce growth suppression in a parallel manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsuji et al., 2008</xref>), and cancer stem cells can undergo dormancy during metastasis and chemoresistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elshamy and Duhé, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giancotti, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pinto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sosa et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, these two identified functional aspects of LIPG allow cancer cells to have more plasticity in regulating cell proliferation, stemness and EMT. It would be important in the future to reveal how cancer cells separately regulate enzymatic and non-enzymatic functions of LIPG during their tumorigenesis, metastasis and chemoresistance.</p><p>Mechanistically, we have found that LIPG executes its oncogenic function in basal-like TNBC cells through its involvement in the DTX3L-ISG15 pathway, known for mediating IFN signaling. This finding for the first time links the function of a lipase to a pathway relevant in immune response and cancer development. We have characterized the functional relationship between these three genes and defined the DTX3L-LIPG-ISG15 signaling axis in basal-like TNBC cells. Moreover, our novel finding indicates that DTX3L is required to sustain LIPG expression in basal-like TNBC cells mainly through its protection of LIPG from proteasome-mediated protein degradation. We do not yet understand how DTX3L executes this protective function to maintain LIPG protein levels in TNBC cells. However, it has been shown that DTX3L is involved in the immunoproteasome pathway to degrade viral 3C proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2015b</xref>). Therefore, there is a possibility that DTX3L protects LIPG protein levels via degrading some cellular proteases involved in LIPG protein degradation. Future study is necessary to address this possibility. From the study of a catalytically inactive LIPG mutant, we have revealed that the LIPG induces ISG15 expression in a non-enzymatic manner. This finding suggests that the non-enzymatic function of LIPG is implicated in the DTX3L-LIPG-ISG15 signaling pathway. Several cellular enzymes (e.g. histone H3 K36 demethylase KDM4A, caspase-8, and lysyl oxidase) have been reported to possess both enzymatic and non-enzymatic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trackman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colmenares et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Henry and Martin, 2017</xref>). Most of these identified non-enzymatic functions are mediated by protein-protein interactions. These discoveries raise a possibility that the non-enzymatic function of LIPG is mediated by its interacting proteins. Due to the critical role of the DTX3L-LIPG-ISG15 axis in tumorigenicity of basal-like TNBC cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and the essential role of LIPG in TNBC metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic>, future studies are needed to address several important questions raised by our findings. What remains unclear is how the non-enzymatic role of LIPG can be engaged in IFN signaling and regulate expression of ISGs, how the DTX3L-LIPG-ISG15 axis regulates the malignancies of basal-like TNBC and what other factors are involved, and what pathological mechanisms cause LIPG mRNA overexpression in basal-like TNBC.</p><p>To our surprise, LIPG overexpression in MCF7 cells increased expression of many ISGs related to type I and II IFN responses. This finding suggests that LIPG is involved in IFN signaling in breast cancer cells by enhancing expression of ISGs. It will be important in the future to reveal whether LIPG participates in IFN responses in immune cells and other cell types. It has been shown that LIPG expression can be induced by immune cytokines (e.g. IL-6), agonists (e.g. polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) and transcription factors (e.g. NFκB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kempe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yasuda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badellino et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Robert et al., 2013</xref>). However, the biological roles of LIPG in these immune responses remain unclear. Our studies have shown that DTX3L, a ubiquitin E3 ligase essential for IFN-stimulated expression of ISGs, is required for protecting LIPG protein from proteasome-mediated degradation in breast cancer cells. Given that IFNs can induce DTX3L expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Juszczynski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2015b</xref>), IFNs may enhance LIPG expression in cancer cells through their stimulating effects on DTX3L expression. This potential connection is relevant as IFN-β has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for increased tumorigenicity in a transformed mouse embryonic fibroblast line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Forys et al., 2014</xref>). Because this tumorigenic cell model has defects in both p53 and ARF, it is akin to TNBC, which frequently manifests co-inactivation of both tumor suppressor genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Forys et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, knockdown of STAT1, an important mediator of IFN signaling, impaired growth of TNBC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Forys et al., 2014</xref>). These findings suggest that IFN signaling may play a critical role in TNBC development. Although activation of the IFN signature is generally thought to be tumor-suppressive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Snell et al., 2017</xref>), our and other studies suggest that IFN-related signaling pathways function as double-edged swords in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Forys et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Snell et al., 2017</xref>). Our finding of DTX3L-dependent regulation of LIPG expression may have important implications to tumor-microenvironmental interactions occurring in TNBCs through secreted immune cytokines like IFNs.</p><p>Our finding that LIPG is preferentially overexpressed in basal-like TNBCs is inconsistent with the previous finding by Slebe et al., which shows that LIPG is generally overexpressed in all subtypes of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Slebe et al., 2016</xref>). This discrepancy is likely due to variations in the use of the LIPG antibody, cell line models, breast cancer datasets, etc. The most obvious difference is that their antibody only detected cleaved 40 kDa LIPG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Slebe et al., 2016</xref>). Contrary to their result, our antibody detected both 68 kDa and 40 kDa LIPG proteins, consistent with other reported findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edmondson et al., 2009</xref>). Our studies showed that 68 kDa glycosylated LIPG is the predominant form in breast cancer cells. Our findings from studying LIPG protein expression in breast cancer tissues and cell lines are consistent with the results from <italic>in silico</italic> analyses of public breast cancer datasets from the Oncomine database.</p><p>In conclusion, our studies highlight the importance of the DTX3L-LIPG-ISG15 signaling pathway in the tumorigenesis and metastasis of basal-like TNBC and the potential to target this signaling axis for therapy of basal-like TNBC expressing LIPG. Moreover, these novel findings suggest a new view that a lipoprotein lipase can influence protein functionality in a non-enzymatic manner via its impact on expression of ISG15, a ubiquitin-like protein involved in regulating protein function and stability by ISGylation. We predict that the regulation of DTX3L-ISG15 signaling may be different between LIPG-proficient and LIPG-deficient cancer cells. Understanding of signaling alterations between these two scenarios would propel the identification of effective therapeutic targets for TNBC therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (human)</td><td>LIPG</td><td>National Center for Biotechnology Information (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9388">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9388</ext-link>)</td><td>Gene ID: 9388;

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Charles Sawyers (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Ralph DeBerardinis (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>These authors studied the role of lipoprotein lipases in breast cancer and identify endothelial lipase (LIPG) as being over-expressed in basal-like triple negative breast cancers and cell lines. Many of the aggressive features of these cells, including proliferation, propensity to form spheroids, migration/invasion, expression of genes related to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor growth in mice, require LIPG expression. The authors use proteomics to demonstrate that many of the proteins induced though LIPG over-expression are interferon-stimulating genes. One of these, ISG15, is then shown to execute many of LIPG's effects on the basal-like phenotype. The authors also show that LIPG levels are regulated by DTX3L via effects on protein stability. Over-expressing DTX3L is sufficient to drive an EMT-like phenotype and promote tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic>, but these effects are reversed by silencing LIPG or ISG15. The authors conclude that the DTX3L-LIPG-ISG15 signaling axis confers key aspects of the basal-like TNBC phenotype and promotes tumor growth.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should do more to strengthen the mechanistic link between LIPG and its downstream targets, particularly ISG15. This is important because the rationale for studying lipase function in TNBC in the first place was somewhat non-intuitive. Although this would not fully explain the mechanistic basis of LIPG's role in the reported pathway, one basic and essential question is whether the catalytic activity of LIPG (i.e. its metabolic function) is relevant for the regulation of ISG15. To answer this question, the authors could overexpress an allele of LIPG with a point mutation disrupting its lipase activity in MCF7 cells, then examine whether this mutant confers the same changes in gene expression, migration, etc. observed with wild-type LIPG.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> needs to include a larger panel of cell lines to better validate the conclusions about the importance of LIPG in the basal subset. For example, the panel currently only includes two cell lines with the luminal phenotype, and this is inadequate to draw any conclusions.</p><p>3) The role of the DTX3L-LIPG-ISG15 signaling pathway in stem cell and EMT phenotypes should be supported by additional evidence. For stem cell properties, the authors should assess the effect of silencing multiple components of the pathway on secondary sphere formation, which should more robustly test stem-like properties. EMT should be assessed through a more thorough evaluation of morphological changes and immunostaining/immunofluorescence of classical EMT markers like vimentin and E-cadherin.</p><p>4) As metastasis is an essential feature of TNBC aggressiveness, it would strengthen the paper considerably if LIPG silencing reduced MDA-MB-468 metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31334.043</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should do more to strengthen the mechanistic link between LIPG and its downstream targets, particularly ISG15.

As suggested, we created a MCF7 line expressing a catalytically inactive LIPG mutant protein (S149A) that has been shown to lose the lipase function (JBC, 2003, 278: 40688–40693). We conducted a series of studies of this mutant line in comparison to parental and wild-type LIPG-overexpressing MCF7 lines to examine the role of LIPG catalytic lipase activity in the basal/EMT features and cancer stem cell phenotypes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, although LIPG<sup>S149A</sup>-expressing MCF7 cells had a lower proliferation rate and formed smaller cancer stem cell spheres compared to parental and wild-type LIPG-expressing MCF7 cells, they showed increased sphere formation compared to parental MCF7 cells. Moreover, similar to wild-type LIPG, LIPG<sup>S149A</sup> was also able to promote the expression of stem cell genes and increase the CD24-CD44+ CSC population. With regard to the basal/EMT features, LIPG<sup>S149A</sup> was potent to induce expression of cytokeratin 14 (a basal/myoepithelial protein) and ZEB1 (an EMT gene), downregulate expression of E-cadherin and EpCAM (a luminal marker protein), and promote cell migration to an equivalent or greater extent when compared to wild-type LIPG. These results suggest that the lipase function of LIPG plays a significant role in promoting the cancer cell proliferation rate, but may not be essential for stemness and EMT phenotypes of cancer cells. Consistent with these findings, LIPG<sup>S149A</sup> was competent to induce the increased expression of ISG15 in MCF7 cells to a similar level as its wild-type counterpart (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These findings together suggest that LIPG possesses both enzymatic and non-enzymatic functions that regulate the different aspects of cancer malignancies. These results are stated in the &quot;Results&quot; section (see the subsection “LIPG-mediated enhancements of basal/EMT, migratory and cancer stem cell features are largely independent of its lipase catalytic activity”) and discussed in the &quot;Discussion&quot; section (see the second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> needs to include a larger panel of cell lines to better validate the conclusions about the importance of LIPG in the basal subset. For example, the panel currently only includes two cell lines with the luminal phenotype, and this is inadequate to draw any conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have included the LIPG expression data of 48 breast cancer cell lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> of the revised manuscript. This BC line cohort includes basal-like (n=20), Her2-amplified (n=15) and luminal (n=13) breast cancer cell lines. Consistent with the LIPG expression data of breast cancer tissue specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, 1B, 1C and 1D</xref>), LIPG was expressed at a higher level in TNBC/basal-like cell lines compared to HER2-amplified and luminal breast cancer cell lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The role of the DTX3L-LIPG-ISG15 signaling pathway in stem cell and EMT phenotypes should be supported by additional evidence.

EMT should be assessed through a more thorough evaluation of morphological changes and immunostaining/immunofluorescence of classical EMT markers like vimentin and E-cadherin.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, in addition to primary sphere formation data, we have included the secondary sphere formation data from multiple experiments to reveal the role of the DTX3L-LIPG-ISG15 signaling pathway in cancer stem cells (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6H</xref>, and 8H). Consistent with the primary sphere data, knockdown of either DTX3L or LIPG had a significant inhibitory effect on the secondary sphere formation of TNBC cells, whereas LIPG overexpression promoted the secondary sphere formation of MCF7 cells. Moreover, ISG15 knockdown moderately suppressed the secondary formation of TNBC cells. This result is in line with our previous conclusion according to the primary sphere data; ISG15 plays a more prominent role in the EMT than in cancer stem cells.</p><p>To strengthen the role of the DTX3L-LIPG-ISG15 signaling axis in modulating EMT phenotypes, we performed immunostaining of E-cadherin and vimentin in multiple experiments. We have included these results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4H, 4I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8E, 8F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>. Our immunostaining data have shown that the DTX3L-LIPG-ISG15 signaling axis is critical for the EMT phenotypes of TNBC cells as this pathway promotes vimentin protein expression and inhibits E-cadherin protein expression. These results are consistent with the data of EMT gene expression, flow cytometry analysis of EpCAM, migration and invasion experiments. Moreover, we observed that the DTX3L-LIPG-ISG15 signaling pathway is required for the mensenchymal morphology of MDA-MB-468 as its inactivation led to a morphological shift to an epithelial-like phenotype (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) As metastasis is an essential feature of TNBC aggressiveness, it would strengthen the paper considerably if LIPG silencing reduced MDA-MB-468 metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a tail vein injection experiment to examine the impact of LIPG knockdown on <italic>in vivo</italic> lung metastasis of MDA-MB-468 in nude mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>, LIPG knockdown completely inhibited MDA-MB-468 metastasis to the lung.

The result has been included in the revised manuscript (see the subsection “LIPG is required for the tumorigenicity and metastasis of basal-like TNBC”, the last paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
