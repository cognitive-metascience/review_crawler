identify the correct splice sites (SS) and branchsite (BS) used during splicing. E complex is the earliest spliceosome precursor in which the 5' SS and BS are defined. Definition occurs by U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) binding the 5' SS and recognition of the BS by the E complex protein (ECP) branchpoint bridging protein (BBP). We have used single molecule fluorescence to study <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> U1 and BBP interactions with RNAs. E complex is dynamic and permits frequent redefinition of the 5' SS and BS. BBP influences U1 binding at the 5' SS by promoting long-lived complex formation. ECPs facilitate U1 association with RNAs with weak 5' SS and prevent U1 accumulation on RNAs containing hyperstabilized 5' SS. The data reveal a mechanism for how U1 binds the 5' SS and suggest that E complex harnesses this mechanism to stimulate recruitment and retention of U1 on introns.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27592.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our genes contain coded instructions for making the molecules in our bodies, but this information must be extensively processed before it can be used. The instructions from each gene are first copied into a molecule called a pre-mRNA, before a process known as splicing removes certain sections to form a mature mRNA molecule. Splicing can remove different sections of the pre-mRNA to make different mRNA molecules from the same gene depending on the current needs of the cell.</p><p>Splicing is controlled by a combination of proteins and other molecules, collectively called the spliceosome. A part of the spliceosome called U1 recognizes the start of pre-mRNA sections that need to be removed, which is referred to as the five-prime splice site (or “5’ SS” for short). The attachment of U1 to such a site allows other molecules to also attach to the pre-mRNA, which eventually assemble a spliceosome. The very first steps in this process involve U1 and a set of other proteins that create what is called the “Early” or “E” complex. Although there are many molecules involved in the E complex, it was not known how they interact with each other and how this affects which splice sites are used for splicing in different cells.</p><p>Using advanced microscopy, Larson and Hoskins examined individual U1 molecules from yeast cells while the molecules formed E complexes and identified two different ways U1 can bind to five-prime splice sites. One process involved U1 attaching to pre-mRNA for a short time, whilst the other involved a longer association between U1 and pre-mRNA. Sometimes U1 could also transition between the first process and the second. The results showed that other parts of the E complex affected which process was used at different sites by affecting the type or duration of U1’s attachment.</p><p>All U1 particles use the same components to attach to splice sites in all pre-mRNAs, but the most used splice sites are not always those that are predicted to have the strongest attachments to U1. This work helps to reveal how other proteins involved in splicing influence this effect, altering U1’s ability to attach to pre-mRNAs to suit each new situation. This also allows cells to change gene splicing to fit different situations. Many genes in our bodies rely on splicing and understanding this process in detail could be the key to diagnosing and treating a range of different illnesses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>splicing</kwd><kwd>single molecule fluorescence</kwd><kwd>CoSMoS</kwd><kwd>spliceosome</kwd><kwd>snRNP</kwd><kwd>RNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM112735</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Larson</surname><given-names>Joshua Donald</given-names></name><name><surname>Hoskins</surname><given-names>Aaron A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007046</institution-id><institution>Greater Milwaukee Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Larson</surname><given-names>Joshua Donald</given-names></name><name><surname>Hoskins</surname><given-names>Aaron A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000997</institution-id><institution>Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Larson</surname><given-names>Joshua Donald</given-names></name><name><surname>Hoskins</surname><given-names>Aaron A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001395</institution-id><institution>Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Larson</surname><given-names>Joshua Donald</given-names></name><name><surname>Hoskins</surname><given-names>Aaron A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00 GM086471</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Larson</surname><given-names>Joshua Donald</given-names></name><name><surname>Hoskins</surname><given-names>Aaron A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single molecule fluorescence analysis of spliceosome E complex formation reveals how tuning of U1 binding to the 5' SS facilitates efficient capture of the snRNP by pre-mRNAs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intron removal by the spliceosome is an essential step in precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) processing during eukaryotic gene expression. The spliceosome is composed of a number of subunits including the five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (the U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNPs), each containing a U-rich small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and several snRNP-specific proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wahl et al., 2009</xref>). Spliceosomes assemble stepwise on pre-mRNAs via a partially ordered pathway to correctly identify the boundaries of the intron and carry out the splicing reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shcherbakova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wahl et al., 2009</xref>). Assembly often begins with ATP-independent binding of the U1 snRNP to the 5' splice site (5' SS) to form the spliceosome E complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Michaud and Reed, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mount et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Séraphin et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhuang and Weiner, 1986</xref>).

Ample evidence has shown that E complexes are competent intermediates for subsequent spliceosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Seraphin and Rosbash, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Séraphin et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Michaud and Reed, 1991</xref>). In yeast, the E complex has been referred to as the commitment complex (CC) since at least a subset of the complexes being formed are resistant to addition of competitor RNA and can be chased into functional spliceosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Seraphin and Rosbash, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Séraphin et al., 1988</xref>). However, both native gel analysis of CC formation and recent single molecule analysis of U1 binding dynamics showed that many U1/pre-mRNA interactions are short-lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ruby, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>). Since these experiments did not assay ECPs, it is unknown if these transient U1 binding events originated from the lack of simultaneous binding of both U1 and ECPs or if E complex itself is dynamic.</p><p>Within E complex, U1 recognizes the 5' SS by base pairing between the 5' end of the U1 snRNA and the transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mount et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Siliciano and Guthrie, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhuang and Weiner, 1986</xref>). Despite the high conservation of this region of the U1 snRNA, 5' SS can vary greatly in sequence. In yeast, most pre-mRNAs contain strong 5' SS that match the consensus, 5'-GUAUGU-3' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grate and Ares, 2002</xref>). However, there are several non-consensus 5ʹ SS that are also found in yeast introns and are predicted to make fewer base pairing interactions with U1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grate and Ares, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Qin et al., 2016</xref>). These introns may be less efficiently spliced and often function as ‘weak’ 5' SS signals for U1. In humans, 5' SS are often weak and &gt;9000 sequence variants have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roca and Krainer, 2009</xref>). How U1 uses a single snRNA to facilitate spliceosome assembly at many different 5' SS of varying strengths is not yet clear.</p><p>Genetic evidence from yeast indicates that ECPs may aid U1 in 5' SS recognition. ECPs are essential for the splicing of particular transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hossain et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Qin et al., 2016</xref>) or in the presence of certain U1 protein or snRNA mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schwer and Shuman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liao et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schwer et al., 2013</xref>). The genetic data indicate an apparent redundancy of ECPs in their ability to compensate for U1 mutations and loss of multiple interactions is often necessary to impair splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schwer and Shuman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schwer et al., 2013</xref>). Many genetic interactions between U1 and ECPs converge on both the 5' end of the snRNA and the Yhc1 protein (U1-C in humans) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schwer and Shuman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schwer et al., 2013</xref>). Crystal structures of the human U1 snRNP have revealed that U1-C abuts a portion of the snRNA/5' SS duplex, and biochemical data show that U1-C can modulate the stability of duplexes formed with weak 5ʹ SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kondo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pomeranz Krummel et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, mutations in yeast Yhc1 can either bypass the requirement for the Prp28 ATPase in U1/U6 exchange during activation or exacerbate the phenotypes of defective Prp28 mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schwer and Shuman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2001</xref>). Recently, Prp28 has also been shown to play an ATP-independent role in E complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Price et al., 2014</xref>). Together these data imply that the Yhc1/U1-C protein plays a critical role in U1’s interactions with 5ʹ SS and ECPs may modulate this function. Despite these genetic and biochemical data, key mechanistic questions of how U1 interacts with RNA remain unanswered. For example, it is not clear how snRNP proteins facilitate base pairing between the snRNA and intron or how non-U1 splicing factors strengthen or weaken U1 binding to regulate 5' SS selection.</p><p>To understand the steps involved in 5' SS recognition, it is essential to characterize the interaction kinetics between U1 and pre-mRNAs and how these dynamics are influenced by both <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors. We have used colocalization single molecule spectroscopy (CoSMoS) to observe U1 interactions with RNAs containing or lacking a consensus 5' SS as well as to monitor E complex formation between fluorescently-labeled U1, BBP, and pre-mRNAs in yeast whole cell extract (WCE). Our data reveal how dynamic E complex formation tunes U1 interactions at the 5' SS and define a pathway for efficient recruitment and retention of U1 on intron-containing transcripts.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>5' SS pairing is critical for long-lived U1 binding events</title><p>To determine how U1 binding kinetics are influenced by splice site strength, we carried out CoSMoS experiments to measure the dwell times of individual, fluorescent U1 molecules on surface-immobilized RNA substrates in WCE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

However, the lifetimes of U1 interactions on these different RNAs were not compared with one another. We carried out this kinetic analysis under conditions in which the WCE was depleted of ATP by addition of glucose, which permits U1 binding and E complex formation but not subsequent steps in spliceosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Seraphin and Rosbash, 1989</xref>). We observed frequent, transient interactions between U1 and RNAs either containing or lacking a functional 5' SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We compared these interactions using rastergrams that simultaneously depict U1 binding events occurring on multiple RNAs. In agreement with previous results, it was apparent that U1 interacted only briefly with RNAs that lacked a 5' SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) but stably associated with RNAs containing a consensus 5' SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>On both RNAs the distribution of observed dwell times was best fit using a double exponential function containing short (τ<sub>1</sub> with amplitude A<sub>1</sub>) and long (τ<sub>2</sub> with amplitude A<sub>2</sub>) kinetic parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). As expected from the rastergrams, removal of the functional 5' SS resulted in a large decrease in both τ<sub>2</sub> and its amplitude, A<sub>2</sub>, and an accompanying increase in A<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> ). However, we were surprised to observe that the overall number of binding events showed only a modest decrease on RNAs lacking a 5' SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and little change was observed in the short kinetic parameter (τ<sub>1</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Background binding resulting from fleeting association of fluorescent U1 molecules with the slide surface was rarely seen and could not account for the number of events that were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). U1 frequently colocalizes with immobilized RNAs even in the absence of a functional 5' SS.</p><p>We wondered if use of a weak 5' SS would result in U1 binding kinetics more similar to those observed with the consensus sequence or those seen when the RNA lacked a 5' SS altogether. We tested this using RNA 2 which contains the 5' SS normally found in the yeast SUS1 pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This 5' SS can form fewer potential base pairs with U1 relative to the consensus (4 vs. 6 base pairs, respectively) but permits splicing in vitro when placed into RP51A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The results were similar to those observed in the absence of a functional 5' SS with short-lived interactions occurring frequently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and predominating the distribution. Long-lived events were rare, resulting in an A<sub>2</sub> value nearly identical to that observed in the absence of a 5' SS and much lower than observed with the consensus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Ablation of the 5' end of the U1 snRNA with RNase H also resulted in nearly complete loss of the long-lived binding events and frequent short-lived interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). These data suggest that both binding lifetime as well as the relative abundances of short- and long-lived binding events are influenced by 5' SS strength and the ability to pair with the snRNA.</p><p>If eliminating or weakening the 5' SS reduces the longest-lived U1 events, we predicted that strengthening the 5' SS should do the opposite. We analyzed U1 interactions with RNAs containing a hyperstabilized 5' SS, capable of making up to 10 potential base pairs with the snRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, RNA 4). In this case, we frequently observed both short- and long-lived interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Unexpectedly, the parameters obtained from a fit of the dwell time distribution revealed only a slight increase in τ<sub>2</sub> while its amplitude (A<sub>2</sub>) and τ<sub>1</sub> remained close to what were observed with the consensus 5' SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–J</xref>). Long-lived U1 binding events seem to be much more sensitive to a loss in base pairing than an increase, while short-lived events are not solely dependent on the ability to base pair with a strong 5ʹ SS.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The RNA cap and BS facilitate U1 recruitment in the absence of a strong 5ʹ SS</title><p>Do the short-lived U1 binding events represent specific or non-specific interactions between the snRNP and RNA?

We tested this using a CoSMoS assay for BBP binding to immobilized RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). On WT RP51A (RNA 3), we observed both short- and long-lived binding of SNAP<sub>f</sub>-tagged BBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Mutation of the BS eliminated the long-lived binding events but short-lived binding remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>; RNA 10). These short-lived events could be eliminated by simultaneous mutation of both the BS and a nearby ΨBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Séraphin and Rosbash, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>; RNA 7). This suggests that a 5' SS and interactions with U1 alone cannot result in detectable BBP binding, in contrast with a previous model obtained by cross-linking in vivo that described U1-facilitated BBP recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Görnemann et al., 2005</xref>). It is possible that irreversible cross-linking may have captured interactions too transient for us to observe or interactions occurring between BBP and RNA sequences other than the BS (i.e., ΨBS). Regardless, since BBP appears to associate stably with the BS and briefly with the ΨBS, we were able to mitigate its influence on U1 by mutation of both of these sequences.</p><p>In the presence of CA, colocalization of U1 with the tethered RNAs became strongly dependent on the 5' SS when those RNAs also lacked the BS/ΨBS sequences. We no longer observed colocalization of U1 with RNAs that either lacked a functional 5' SS or contained the weak 5' SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; RNAs 5 and 6). In addition, U1 binding was near background levels after ablation of the 5' end of the snRNA and ECP mitigation, even when the RNA contained a consensus 5' SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Any remaining U1/RNA binding events occurred too quickly for us to detect in these experiments, likely with lifetimes &lt;~0.5 s. These data suggest that the 5' cap and BS sequence are responsible for recruitment of U1 on RNAs that lack 5' SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) or when the 5' SS pairing region of the snRNA has been removed. In contrast, frequent binding was still observed on RNAs containing strong 5' SS and with the intact snRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, RNAs 7 and 8, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, short-lived binding events are not non-specific - they depend on features of the RNA and likely involve interactions between U1 and ECPs bound to the transcript. When a 5' SS is present, short-lived binding events originate from both interactions between U1 and the 5' SS and interactions between U1 and ECPs. In the absence of a 5' SS or intact snRNA, U1 is recruited to RNAs primarily through interactions with ECPs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The RNA cap and BS modulate U1 binding at strong splice sites</title><p>While a strong 5' SS is sufficient for U1 recruitment, binding of U1 was significantly weakened when ECPs were mitigated (<italic>cf</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). On RNAs containing a consensus 5' SS, the long-lived parameter τ<sub>2</sub> was reduced ~3 fold and these long-lived events were much less frequent. In fact, U1 dwell times on RNAs containing a 5' SS but without ECPs were similar to those observed on RNAs lacking a 5' SS but with ECPs. This indicates that U1/ECP interactions play an important role in tuning U1 binding even at strong 5' SS and that the longest-lived U1 complexes depend on both the 5' SS and ECPs.</p><p>After ECPs were mitigated, the differences between RNAs containing a consensus or hyperstabilized 5' SS became apparent. Hyperstabilization did not change τ<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). However, both τ<sub>2</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> increased approximately 2-fold upon hyperstabilization relative to the consensus, a greater change than was observed when the ECPs were not mitigated (<italic>cf</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>, RNA 3 and 4 with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>, RNA 7 and 8). These data show that increased pairing potential between U1 and the 5ʹ SS predominantly impacts the kinetics of the long-lived binding events and ECPs mask this effect.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The BS and cap modulate U1 binding by distinct mechanisms</title><p>We next tested if the cap and BS/ΨBS independently influence U1 binding dynamics. Unexpectedly, while the lifetimes of the longest-lived U1 binding events (τ<sub>2</sub>) could be modulated by either the cap or the BS/ΨBS, this was not true of their relative abundance (A<sub>2</sub>). In the presence of CA, we observed an increase in both τ<sub>2</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> for U1 binding events on RNAs containing a BS/ΨBS compared to those that lacked these sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>; RNAs 3 and 7 + CA). In contrast, addition of CA changed τ<sub>2</sub> but not A<sub>2</sub> on RNAs that lacked the BS/ΨBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>; RNA 7 and ±CA). Similar results were also obtained using WCE prepared from strains in which the small subunit of the CBC was genetically deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Thus, addition of CA only decreases U1 lifetimes on RNAs lacking a BS/ΨBS and removal of the BS/ΨBS only decreases U1 lifetimes in the presence of CA. However, the BS/ΨBS additionally changes A<sub>2</sub> independent of the presence or absence of CA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>BBP associates with the longest-lived U1/Pre-mRNA complexes</title><p>The above results show that molecular features of the RNA other than the 5' SS can influence U1 binding. It is likely this occurs by interactions between U1 and ECPs— protein-protein contacts with CBC associated at the 5' cap and BBP/Mud2 associated at the BS. We therefore tested whether or not the longest-lived U1 events were correlated with simultaneous binding of the transcript by ECPs. CBC is very abundant in WCE and has so far proven intractable for CoSMoS studies (data not shown).

However, colocalized complexes of U1, BBP, and pre-mRNA could persist from a few seconds to several minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

The mean lifetime of U1 molecules colocalizing with BBP was significantly longer (182.3 ± 35.6 s) compared to U1 molecules binding in the absence of BBP (73.6 ± 32.2 s), while no difference was seen in a randomized control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). This supports the notion that simultaneous binding of the transcript by BBP promotes a functional change in U1 that promotes stable association and long-lived binding.</p><p>In these three-color experiments, CBC could still potentially interact with the RNA and U1 independent of BBP. When BBP was not simultaneously present with U1 on the RNA, the influence of the CBC alone likely resulted in the ~74 s mean U1 lifetime. To confirm this, we compared this value to calculated mean U1 lifetimes for interactions on RNAs under conditions in which only the CBC was allowed to bind (RNA 7; 82.6 ± 11.0 s) or when binding of both BBP and CBC was prevented (RNA 7, +CA; 27.4 ± 2.6 s) using two-color experiments and data described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Only under the former condition is the average U1 lifetime similar to what we observed in the three-color experiments in the absence of simultaneous BBP association. Thus, U1 lifetimes when BBP binding is either not observed on the RNA (three-color experiments) or not permitted due to a BS mutation (two-color experiments) are likely due to the influence of the CBC and are much longer than U1 binding in the absence of both the CBC and BBP.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>E complex forms transiently to enable 5ʹ SS and BS redefinition</title><p>These CoSMoS experiments also revealed the lifetime and dynamics of the spliceosome E complex. Consistent with the multi-exponential kinetics observed with both U1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) and BBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>), the distribution of E complex lifetimes was also best described by a function containing two exponential terms (τ<sub>1</sub> of ~20 s and τ<sub>2</sub> of ~165 s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). This indicates that multiple types of E complexes exist that contain both U1 and BBP. The longest-lived complexes that contribute to τ<sub>2</sub> may be the same as those that result in commitment and are observable by native PAGE.</p><p>We next analyzed the pathways of E complex assembly and disassembly. E complex assembly can proceed by either initial U1 or BBP binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). After E complex formation, we observed frequent redefinition of the 5' SS and BS as U1 or BBP spontaneously dissociated and another molecule subsequently bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). For example, we noted the formation of E complexes that would persist for several minutes before loss of U1 followed by rebinding of a different U1 molecule. This resulted in redefinition of the 5' SS while definition of the BS was maintained by BBP. The alternative pathway of BS redefinition was also observed as was switching between 5' SS and BS redefinition on the same pre-mRNA molecule. In both cases, analysis of fluorescence trajectories supported recruitment of only a single U1 molecule and a single BBP molecule to the vast majority of pre-mRNAs at any one time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>). This signifies that redefinition requires prior release of either U1 or BBP from the 5ʹ SS or the BS, respectively. Since ATP was not included in these experiments, these redefinition events are unlikely to require ATPase activity.</p><p>Analysis of the fates of individual E complexes revealed that the loss of either U1 or BBP was nearly equally probable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). However, pre-mRNAs that lost U1 were twice as likely to also lose BBP rather than redefine the 5' SS. In contrast, pre-mRNAs that lost BBP were nearly twice as likely to redefine the BS as they were to subsequently lose U1. This suggests that in vitro E complex formation results in different degrees of obligation to the 5' SS and BS. In sum, these experiments reveal that E complex formation is dynamic and results in little commitment to any particular 5' SS/BS pair.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Yhc1 is essential for U1 recruitment to the 5' SS</title><p>Our data support distinct short- and long-lived U1 interactions influenced by both 5' SS sequence as well as ECPs.

Two simple kinetic schemes that could account for this observation are a two-step binding pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) or independent pathways that form two, non-interconverting U1/5' SS complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). While it is difficult to completely exclude the presence of independent pathways without knowledge of the forward and backward rates occurring at each step, we favor the two-step binding mechanism since it is supported by multiple aspects of our single molecule data. First, all U1/5' SS interactions in the absence of ECPs are dependent on the 5' SS sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–F</xref>), the Yhc1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and the snRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This indicates that both short- and long-lived events are likely occurring at the site of snRNA/5' SS duplex formation. A two-step binding mechanism does not require the formation of unrelated complexes at this critical location, as would the other model. Second, stabilization or destabilization of either the short- or long-lived complexes impacts both the complex lifetime as well as amplitude. For example, increasing the number of potential base pairs at the 5' SS in the absence of ECPs results in a simultaneous increase of more than 2-fold in both τ<sub>2</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> without changing the binding event frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–F</xref>). This can be rationalized by two-step binding in which short-lived complexes are more likely to transition into long-lived complexes when additional pairing is possible, thus resulting in the decrease in A<sub>1</sub> and increase in A<sub>2</sub>. Concerted changes in lifetimes and amplitudes are not as easily compatible with independent binding pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) since the pathways are not kinetically coupled to one another. Finally, even under our most stabilizing conditions for U1 interaction, we still observe short-lived events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This is expected if formation of the short-lived complex is a necessary precursor to more stable binding.</p><p>The molecular and functional differences between the initial and stable complexes are not clear. Results with the hyperstabilized 5' SS suggest that the transition between the two will involve a change in the snRNA/5' SS pairing region, as has been previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Du et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McGrail et al., 2008</xref>). Our data do not preclude the possibility that short- or long-lived complexes may originate from altered interactions with other factors that transiently associate with U1 [for example, U2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Das et al., 2000</xref>) or allow us to determine if different complexes promote subsequent steps in splicing to different degrees. Previous work showed that longer U1 lifetimes were correlated with intron loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>). However, further experiments will be needed to determine the origin of those increased lifetimes and if they came about as a direct consequence of formation of the long-lived U1 complexes detected here. While the initial complex is short-lived, it is dependent on the presence of a strong 5' SS in the RNA. This property is distinct from the proposed U1 scanning complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McGrail et al., 2008</xref>), which is predicted to involve snRNA nucleotides other than those that pair with the 5' SS and may not recognize the 5' SS itself. It is possible that scanning occurs prior to the 5' SS dependent interactions that we observe.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The spliceosome E complex is dynamic</title><p>Our single molecule data show that U1 still interacts dynamically with RNAs even while BBP is simultaneously bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This indicates that the spliceosome E complex is readily disassembled without ATP and only a subset of complexes are stable enough to result in commitment—in agreement with previous identification of the committed and uncommitted ‘δ' complex by Ruby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ruby, 1997</xref>). Moreover, our kinetic description of E complex lifetimes characterizes its heterogeneity and reveals the presence of both short- and long-lived E complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We do not know if short-lived E complexes can transition into those that are long-lived. It is possible that E complexes of diverse stability originate from different levels of functional engagement of U1 and/or ECPs with the pre-mRNA or with one another.</p><p>One consequence of dynamic and reversible E complex formation is that it permits rapid definition and redefinition of the 5' SS and BS that are subsequently used by the spliceosome. While BBP association with the pre-mRNA stimulates stable U1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), the frequent release and rebinding of BBP while U1 remains bound suggests that U1 stabilization could be triggered by BS sequences not ultimately used by the spliceosome. Such a strategy could facilitate efficient spliceosome assembly by anchoring U1 at the 5' SS while delaying BS definition until the optimal sequence for pairing with U2 is found. This flexibility may be important for regulating splicing, particularly on long introns which may contain many potential BS sequences. In the presence of ATP, it is likely that redefinition competes with spliceosome assembly at a particular 5' SS/BS pair. Thus, modulation of both E complex and other splicing factor (e.g., U2) binding kinetics may be important to either enhance or suppress redefinition events and permit proper 5' SS and BS selection.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>U1 binding is tuned at both weak and strong splice sites</title><p>While it has often been noted that alternative splicing correlates with low complementarity between the 5' SS and the U1 snRNA, it is less clear what factors lead to discrimination between splice sites of equal strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roca et al., 2013</xref>). This discrimination could arise from <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors tuning U1 binding at particular locations to either stabilize or destabilize snRNP association. Our data indicate that yeast ECPs function in this capacity to facilitate U1 recruitment to pre-mRNAs containing weak splice sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), modulate U1 interactions occurring at consensus splice sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and destabilize U1 binding if excessive complementarity is present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Tuning of U1 interactions is thus a general feature of both weak and strong splice sites, and the lifetime of a U1/pre-mRNA complex may not be apparent from base pairing potential alone. In our experiments, we focused on substrates containing only a single 5' SS; however, it is possible that tuning may also change how two or more potential 5' SS compete with one another within a single transcript.</p><p>Extensive analysis has revealed a rich network of genetic and physical interactions between the CBC, BBP/Mud2, and both the proteins and snRNA of U1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qiu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schwer and Shuman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agarwal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schwer and Shuman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schwer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang and Rosbash, 1999</xref>). While the contribution RNA conformation plays in promoting U1 release is not yet known, the single molecule and genetic data suggest U1 tuning is occurring through physical connections between components of the E complex. The measured E complex lifetimes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) allow us to define that any such physical interactions resulting in a cross-intron bridging complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abovich and Rosbash, 1997</xref>) between U1 at the 5' SS and BBP/Mud2 at the BS are transient and likely to dissociate with a rate constant of ~0.4 min<sup>−1</sup> or greater.</p><p>Tuning U1 interactions with cognate RNAs may be critical for processes other than spliceosome assembly including those that are splicing-independent such as telescripting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berg et al., 2012</xref>). While stable association of U1 promotes assembly, failure to release U1 during spliceosome activation inhibits splicing since the U6 snRNA must also pair to the 5' SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Staley and Guthrie, 1999</xref>). A two-step model for U1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) permits a reversible change in affinity that could be used to decrease U1 stability during activation. The more weakly-bound U1 complex may then facilitate U1/U6 exchange. Kinetic data obtained with the L13F and D36A mutants of Yhc1 support this idea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These mutations bypass (L13F) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2001</xref>) or reinforce (D36A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schwer and Shuman, 2014</xref>) the need for the Prp28 ATPase to promote activation, and U1’s containing these mutations would be predicted to associate with the 5' SS less (L13F) or more (D36A) strongly than WT. Indeed, we found this prediction to be true but the effects were modulated by ECPs. Other components of the spliceosome known to interact with U1 [(e.g., Prp8; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2013</xref>)] may function similarly to tune U1 binding during later stages of splicing.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Tuning changes how transcripts compete for U1</title><p>Genetic experiments have elucidated functional redundancy between the CBC and BBP/Mud2 with respect to their ability to complement mutations in U1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qiu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schwer and Shuman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agarwal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schwer and Shuman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schwer et al., 2013</xref>). We were also able to observe some functional redundancy for these factors at the single molecule level, as both ECPs could extend U1 lifetimes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Whether or not both ECPs accomplish this by a similar mechanism is not yet clear. However, the BS exerts an additional and unexpected effect on U1 by increasing the relative abundance (A<sub>2</sub>) of long-lived complexes. We rationalize this by BBP/Mud2 bound at the BS impacting the transition between initial and stable U1 binding in the two-step model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This model could also explain differences in genetic lethality observed when snRNA mutations are combined with Mud2Δ or Cbp20 mutations, with the former more often being lethal than the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schwer et al., 2013</xref>). While BBP/Mud2 and CBC each help to anchor U1 to transcripts, their molecular influences on U1 are distinct.</p><p>One consequence of this observation is that transcripts destined for splicing (i.e., those containing introns) are more competitive for U1 compared to those which only contain 5' SS sequences or only bound by ECPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We propose that CBC initially facilitates sequence-independent U1 recruitment to transcripts, which biases U1 occupancy towards Pol II transcription products that may contain introns. Since the 5' end of the snRNA is not required for transient, ECP-dependent interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), initial recruitment may not involve pairing between the snRNP and transcript. U1 could then subsequently engage with a cognate 5' SS sequence, at which point it may or may not switch into a more stably bound conformation. If the transcript also contains a downstream BS bound by BBP/Mud2, this promotes recruitment as well as the switch to stable binding. The features of this model are consistent with in vivo data obtained in both yeast and humans which have detected splicing-independent recruitment of U1 and the influences of the CBC and BS on U1 occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Görnemann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lacadie and Rosbash, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Patel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Spiluttini et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, the two-step binding mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), in which BBP/Mud2 influences U1’s transition between initial and stable complex formation, results in a coupling of 5' SS and BS recognition. Stable U1 binding can be associated with multiple landmarks found on the transcript including the cap, 5' SS, and BS—all indicators of an intron-containing pre-mRNA.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Rapid identification of specific nucleic acid sequences is a challenge faced by many cellular RNPs including the ribosome, the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), and bacterial CRISPR machineries in addition to spliceosome snRNPs. While mechanisms of ribosome scanning remain to be elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Archer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hinnebusch, 2014</xref>), recent structural and single-molecule data indicate that both Cas9 and Argonaute share common strategies for finding particular sequences of DNA or RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chandradoss et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salomon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sternberg et al., 2014</xref>). These RNP machineries utilize ‘seed’ or PAM sequences to facilitate rapid scanning of nucleic acids in a step distinct from that of formation of extended base pairing interactions. These two-step mechanisms enable efficient target identification and likely also limit the lifetimes of non-productive interactions. Our data support a similar two-step mechanism for U1 snRNP recruitment to 5ʹ SS in which short-lived interactions give way to longer-lived complexes. Whether or not U1 also contains a ‘seed’ region that nucleates binding is not yet clear; however, the U1-C/Yhc1 protein is positioned to potentially participate in such a process. This could explain the origin of our observed kinetics as well as provide U1 an efficient means of searching for potential 5ʹ SS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Pre-mRNA preparation</title><p>Capped [<sup>32</sup>P]-labeled RP51A pre-mRNAs for in vitro splicing and trace [<sup>32</sup>P]-labeled RP51A substrates for single molecule assays were made by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-<sup>32</sup>P] UTP and G(5’)ppp(5’)G RNA cap analog (NEB).

Errors in the fit parameter were determined by bootstrapping 1000 random samples of the data and determining the standard deviation of the resultant values.<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="false" scriptlevel="1"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mfrac></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mfrac></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Magda Konarska and Beate Schwer for strains and plasmids.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Michael Marletta (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Jonathan P Staley (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes a high resolution dissection of the binding of the U1 snRNP to a 5' splice site and the impact of pre-mRNA features and splicing co-factors on this binding. To achieve this goal, the authors leverage the illuminating single-molecule approach, termed CoSMOS, in the context of yeast extract. A major conclusion is that U1 binds in two distinct states, one short-lived and one-long lived, which the authors interpret to indicate a pathway of binding in which a less stable, initial state transitions to a more stable state, a pathway that parallels two-step pathways for binding of Cas9 and Ago RNPs to nucleic acid. Further, the cap, presumably through the cab binding complex (CBC), and the branch site, through the branch site binding protein (BBP), both help recruit U1 snRNP to pre-mRNA, independent of a 5' splice site, and both can increase the stability of the more stable state; interestingly, however, the branch site but not the cap can increase the probability that the stable state forms, suggesting that the branch site promotes the transition to the stable state, in the authors' model. Interestingly, a mutation in U1-C impacts the lifetime of the less stable state, implicating a role for this protein at this presumably earlier, transient stage. Additionally, simultaneous dynamic analysis of U1 and BBP binding to pre-mRNA reveals that the 5' splice site and branch site can be redefined after initial complex formation on pre-mRNA, indicating that this &quot;commitment complex&quot;, as originally described, is not committed. This manuscript will be of interest to a broad audience, including the single molecule, nucleic acid binding, and splicing communities. Technically, there is little to criticize in this study, in which, beyond the two-state model, a number of quantitative observations come together to change, clarify, and deepen the way we view 5' splice site recognition by the U1 snRNP. Still, the reviewers have several important questions that need to be answered before publication can be considered further.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The model of weak U1 binding to 5'SS followed by strong binding is not unambiguously supported by the data. The weak and strong binding events observed in the experiments described here could arise from completely independent binding events, instead of sequential ones. Fortunately, the proposed model makes testable predictions, which the authors need to test. For example, the model predicts that varying the concentration of the U1 snRNP would impact the amplitude to τ<sub>1</sub> but not the amplitude of τ<sub>2</sub>. Of course, these experiments are performed in extract, but testing the impact of increasing U1 snRNP would be quite informative as to the relevance of the model.</p><p>2) Importantly, the functional relevance of the different states is unclear. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, it is shown that the probability of &quot;stable binding&quot; (indicated by A<sub>2</sub>) is at background levels for RNA 2, yet RNA 2 is apparently spliced as well as RNA 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>—figure – supplement 2) – at least by eye, as no quantitation is given. Perhaps the splicing of RNA 2 is less efficient or kinetically slower than RNA 3. This could be tested by quantifying and/or performing a time course of splicing, which should be done. If the splicing of RNA 2 and 3 really are indistinguishable, then more consideration needs to be given as to whether the two-state model is functionally impactful and whether the measured parameters matter for the ultimate activity of the spliceosome. For example, would the parameters matter in the context of competing 5' splice sites?</p><p>3) Different conclusions seem to result from either mutation of the branch site or observing BBP directly. Specifically, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> imply that either the CBC or BBP are sufficient to stabilize τ<sub>2</sub> (i.e., the loss of the branch site is insufficient to alter τ<sub>2</sub>). However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, BBP, presumably in the presence of CBC, correlates with longer U1 dwell times. How can these views be reconciled? Does this imply that BBP impacts U1 stability at a 5' splice site independent of the branch site? Indeed, Gornemann et al. (2005) have shown that BBP is recruited to a transcript by ChIP at the same time as the U1 snRNP after the 5' splice site has been transcribed but before the branch site has been transcribed. A simple experiment to resolve this apparent paradox would be to observe E complex formation, via U1 and BBP, on a substrate that lacks a branch site. Minimally, this discrepancy needs to be acknowledged.</p><p>4) How can the authors be certain that residual ATP is not sufficient to explain some of the dynamics? It seems critical to test this presumption by incubation of the extract with glucose/hexokinase.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27592.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The model of weak U1 binding to 5'SS followed by strong binding is not unambiguously supported by the data.

We have edited this section of the manuscript (subsection “Properties of the U1/5' SS Interaction”) to clarify our evidence for this mechanism in several important ways. First, we have included a new supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) which describes the most likely alternate mechanism (two distinct and independent binding pathways) that could account for the data. This allows us to frame our discussion of two-step binding more easily in ways that either support two-step binding or do not support independent binding events. Second, we explain in further detail the consequences of observing coupled changes in lifetimes and amplitudes (for example, increases in τ<sub>2</sub> accompanied by increases in A<sub>2</sub>). These observations are likely incompatible with independent binding since it is less clear how changing the stability of a particular complex would alter the abundance of another unless they are kinetically coupled.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment that our model makes testable predictions. However, obtaining additional kinetic parameters (such as on-rates) for U1 in cell extract is very difficult since it is not apparent how the concentration of endogenous U1 can be easily changed while keeping the overall amount of cell extract constant. Such experiments, if possible, are beyond the scope of the work presented here. While it is difficult to unambiguously prove a mechanism for any biomolecule, we believe our data support two-step binding and are less compatible with the most likely alternative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Importantly, the functional relevance of the different states is unclear. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, it is shown that the probability of &quot;stable binding&quot; (indicated by A<sub>2</sub>) is at background levels for RNA 2, yet RNA 2 is apparently spliced as well as RNA 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) – at least by eye, as no quantitation is given. Perhaps the splicing of RNA 2 is less efficient or kinetically slower than RNA 3. This could be tested by quantifying and/or performing a time course of splicing, which should be done. If the splicing of RNA 2 and 3 really are indistinguishable, then more consideration needs to be given as to whether the two-state model is functionally impactful and whether the measured parameters matter for the ultimate activity of the spliceosome. For example, would the parameters matter in the context of competing 5' splice sites?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises several interesting points. First, we have quantified the splicing of RNA 2 and RNA 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, as the reviewer suggested, and have included the data in that figure legend. The 5’SS cleavage (1<sup>st</sup> step) efficiency for RNA 2 (which contains the weak 5’ SS) is only 8% vs. 25% for RNA 3 (which contains the consensus, RP51A 5’ SS). The exon ligation (2<sup>nd</sup> step) efficiencies are 4 and 16% for RNA 2 and RNA 3, respectively. This is consistent with weaker 5’SS being spliced less efficiently in vitro and as well as with previous analysis of 5’SS mutants using a variety of assays (for example, Pikielny and Rosbash, Cell, 1985 and Seraphin and Rosbash, EMBO J., 1991). Thus, RNA 2 both binds U1 more weakly and splices less efficiently.</p><p>In terms of ultimate activity of the spliceosome, we have included new text discussing the functional relevance of U1 interactions (subsection “The Spliceosome E Complex is Dynamic”). Since the 5’ SS is recognized sequentially by multiple spliceosome components, our parameters may matter for splicing more so when U1 binding is limiting and less so under other conditions (for example, when U2/BS pairing is limiting). Finally, we previously included text describing how U1C mutants that alter dependence of the spliceosome on Prp28 activity also change our observed binding events in predicted ways (excepting the influence of ECPs), suggesting that these different states are functionally relevant for Prp28-dependent steps that occur after initial U1 binding (subsection “U1 Binding is Tuned at Both Weak and Strong Splice Sites”).</p><p>The reviewer also asks how would our parameters matter in the context of competing 5’ splice sites. This is an interesting idea, and we have included a statement in which we speculate on the significance of our results with respect to 5’SS competition (subsection “U1 Binding is Tuned at Both Weak and Strong Splice Sites”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Different conclusions seem to result from either mutation of the branch site or observing BBP directly.

Minimally, this discrepancy needs to be acknowledged.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is comparing kinetic parameters obtained from maximum likelihood fitting of the dwell times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) with an average of the observed dwell times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). For multi-exponential kinetics, these two types of analysis cannot be directly compared, and we apologize for the confusion. We wish to retain the analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> since it presents directly that co-binding of U1 and BBP results in longer U1 lifetimes.</p><p>To clarify this point, we have expanded the discussion of this data and have included comparisons with average dwell times derived from data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (subsection “BBP Associates with the Longest-Lived U1/Pre-mRNA Complexes”, last paragraph). These data confirm that the CBC alone cannot account for the extension of U1 lifetimes observed during colocalization with BBP and that the CBC was likely influencing U1 lifetimes when BBP was not bound.</p><p>The reviewer also wonders about BBP binding to a transcript in the presence of a 5’ SS but lacking a BS. We had previously included such an experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, RNA 7) and failed to observe any BBP binding in the absence of the BS and pseudo-BS, suggesting U1 alone cannot recruit BBP. This is in contrast to the model proposed by Gornemann et al. It is possible that our data and those of Gornemann et al. can be reconciled by transient binding of BBP to pseudo-BS found within the DBP2 transcript analyzed by Gornemann et al. DBP2 contains a long intron with possible pseudo-BS sequences (for example, CCCUAAC in DBP2 located near the 5’SS). Alternatively, cross-linking experiments are irreversible and may capture very short-lived or rare interactions that we are unable to observe. We have included a reference and discussion of the work of Gornemann et al. in the third paragraph of the subsection “The RNA Cap and BS Facilitate U1 Recruitment in the Absence of a Strong 5ʹ SS”.</p><p>In sum, we do not believe there is an apparent discrepancy in these data and that the additional analysis and textual modifications clarify the points addressed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) How can the authors be certain that residual ATP is not sufficient to explain some of the dynamics? It seems critical to test this presumption by incubation of the extract with glucose/hexokinase.</p></disp-quote><p>All of our experiments were carried out in the absence of ATP by simultaneously not adding ATP to the extract and using glucose to deplete endogenous ATP via the endogenous yeast hexokinase. We have tested whether or not the endogenous hexokinase was sufficient by carrying out new experiments suggested by the reviewer in which U1 and BBP lifetimes were measured after incubation of the extract with both glucose and additional, purified yeast hexokinase. Under these new conditions, U1 and BBP dynamics and lifetimes were indistinguishable from those measured using glucose-only depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary files 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">3</xref>, subsection “Single-Molecule Experiments”, first paragraph). Thus, we feel that residual ATP is unlikely to explain the observed dynamics.</p></body></sub-article></article>
