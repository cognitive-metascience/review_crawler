Features in transmembrane domains such as charged residues in ion channels are often functionally important, but could pose a challenge during cotranslational membrane insertion and folding. Our systematic proteomic approaches in both yeast and human cells revealed that the ER membrane protein complex (EMC) binds to and promotes the biogenesis of a range of multipass transmembrane proteins, with a particular enrichment for transporters. Proximity-specific ribosome profiling demonstrates that the EMC engages clients cotranslationally and immediately following clusters of TMDs enriched for charged residues. The EMC can remain associated after completion of translation, which both protects clients from premature degradation and allows recruitment of substrate-specific and general chaperones. Thus, the EMC broadly enables the biogenesis of multipass transmembrane proteins containing destabilizing features, thereby mitigating the trade-off between function and stability.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>EMC</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>transmembrane</kwd><kwd>transporter</kwd><kwd>ion channel</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weissman</surname><given-names>Jonathan S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM075061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brodsky</surname><given-names>Jeffrey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005237</institution-id><institution>Helen Hay Whitney Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shurtleff</surname><given-names>Matthew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schirle Oakdale</surname><given-names>Nicole T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007100</institution-id><institution>Sandler Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frost</surname><given-names>Adam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008925</institution-id><institution>American Asthma Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frost</surname><given-names>Adam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001706</institution-id><institution>Louis-Jeantet Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Itzhak</surname><given-names>Daniel N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005984</institution-id><institution>Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G.

Individual transmembrane domains (TMDs) of multipass proteins are cotranslationally inserted into the lipid bilayer, and this step can often be energetically costly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cymer et al., 2015</xref>). Some features of diverse transmembrane proteins present a particular challenge for their insertion into and stabilization within the ER membrane. First, the length of the TMD may not match the thickness of the lipid bilayer in the ER due to differences in membrane composition between the ER and the protein’s final destination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sharpe et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, many TMDs contain features that are destabilizing during membrane protein insertion and biosynthesis but are necessary for function. Transporters, transmembrane ATPases, and solute carriers, for example, contain polar and/or charged residues within membrane spanning domains that form aqueous channels within the plane of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tector and Hartl, 1999</xref>). Yet, during biogenesis, these charged helices enter the lipid bilayer unshielded by the remainder of the protein.</p><p>Faced with these challenges, membrane protein folding is subject to failure both in normal and disease settings. Misfolded membrane proteins underlie a host of diseases, including cystic fibrosis (due to mutations in the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator – CFTR), Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (PMP22 and Connexin 32), diabetes insipidis (Aquaporin), retinitis pigmentosa (Rhodopsin), Niemann-Pick disease (NPC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gelsthorpe et al., 2008</xref>) and others. Disease-associated mutations often cluster within transmembrane helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanders and Myers, 2004</xref>) and are biased towards missense mutations, resulting in the addition of polar or charged residues within transmembrane helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Partridge et al., 2002</xref>). The disease-associated CFTR mutations illustrate the challenges and opportunities associated with membrane protein biogenesis. Even in healthy cells under normal conditions, less than 50% of newly synthesized CFTR folds properly and traffics out of the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kopito, 1999</xref>). Small molecule enhancers of folding have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for disease-associated misfolded proteins. Indeed, the treatment for the most common form of cystic fibrosis (CFTR∆F508) employs a drug combination including a ‘folding corrector’ to allow increased ER exit and transport to the cell surface and a ‘potentiator’ to increase chloride transport activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyle et al., 2014</xref>). Understanding the full complement of machinery used by the ER to ensure membrane protein synthesis, folding and transport is a fundamental problem with clear biomedical implications.</p><p>Although the ER has machinery for stabilizing, sensing and degrading misfolded proteins, how proteins with destabilizing features within transmembrane helices are stabilized during and immediately following synthesis remains poorly understood. The ER membrane protein complex (EMC) has emerged as an intriguing player in membrane protein biogenesis in the ER. The EMC was first described in yeast as a complex of 6 co-purifying and conserved proteins (Emc1-6) with strongly correlated phenotypes in a double mutant genetic modifier map of the unfolded protein response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jonikas et al., 2009</xref>). The pattern of EMC genetic interactions strongly resembles the pattern of other factors whose loss leads to the accumulation of misfolded membrane proteins, including the overexpression of a misfolded membrane protein (Sec61-2), and these insights first suggested that the EMC may be a TMD protein chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jonikas et al., 2009</xref>). The mammalian EMC orthologues were subsequently identified in a mammalian physical interaction map of ER-associated degradation (ERAD) components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christianson et al., 2011</xref>). In vivo experiments have shown that loss of the EMC compromises synthesis, stabilization and/or trafficking of specific multipass membrane proteins in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (a Yor1 mutant which mimicked a common disease allele of CFTR, and Mrh1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Louie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bircham et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>D. melanogoster</italic> (rhodopsin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Satoh et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>C. elegans</italic> (acetylcholine receptors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Richard et al., 2013</xref>) and mice (ABCA3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tang et al., 2017</xref>), and that knockdown of an EMC component compromised biogenesis of mutant CFTR expressed in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Louie et al., 2012</xref>).

Finally, the EMC was recently shown to act as a posttranslational insertase into the ER membrane for the sterol biosynthesis enzyme, squalene synthase (SQS/FDFT1) and a subset of other tail-anchored (TA) proteins.

If direct, what is the EMC substrate range and does the EMC physically interact with clients? Lastly, at which stage(s) does the EMC act: insertion into the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guna et al., 2018</xref>), co- or post-translationally, during folding, or, finally, during ER export?</p><p>Here, we used systematic and unbiased in vivo approaches to identify client proteins and to explore the principles of EMC action with minimal perturbations in both yeast and human cells. Our studies reveal three conserved principles of EMC function: (1) The EMC interacts with and stabilizes a range of client proteins consisting, with a few exceptions, of multipass transmembrane proteins biased towards transporters. (2) The EMC can initiate client interactions cotranslationally and stabilizes newly synthesized, client proteins after initial ER targeting to prevent premature degradation. (3) The EMC can engage client proteins following clusters of TMDs, and client TMDs are enriched in uncommon transmembrane amino acids (especially charged and bulky residues). Thus, the EMC enables the biogenesis and folding of a subset of multipass membrane proteins which present challenges for the canonical membrane protein synthesis and insertion machineries and thereby expands the functional repertoire of the membrane protein proteome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The EMC physically interacts with multipass transmembrane proteins transiting the ER and substrate-specific chaperones</title><p>We initially sought to define the range of proteins that interact with the EMC in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</italic> To evaluate EMC interaction partners, we endogenously tagged EMC3 with 3xFLAG epitope at its C-terminus.

This enrichment pattern was not observed in strains with two other ER-localized BirA fusions (BirA-Ubc6-TA and BirA-Ssh1), suggesting that the EMC specifically interacts with these nascent chains shortly after synthesis of TMD clusters by the ribosome. The positional enrichment pattern observed for FKS1 and GSC2 motivated a systematic search for other nascent chains cotranslationally engaged by the EMC. To do this, we computed the ratio of total Emc5-BirA enrichment to total BirA-Ubc6-TA enrichment in a sliding window of 101 codons across all genes We then ranked genes according to the highest enrichment ratio attained anywhere in the gene. In addition to the most enriched genes (FKS1 and GSC2), we identified 51 genes that reproducibly showed localized peaks of Emc5-specific enrichment (defined as being in the top 10% of eligible genes in each of two biological replicates; see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

For this analysis, we focused on the set of EMC clients defined above and compared their enrichment to the full set of TMD containing proteins (see TMD annotation in Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jan et al., 2014</xref>), we observed that all of the ER-localized BirAs showed an initial enrichment ~60 codons after the first TMD which likely represents the recruitment of the translating message to the ER by the signal recognition particle (SRP). With the exception of the EMC clients when monitored by Emc5-BirA, this enrichment then levels off or decreases modestly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). By contrast, for Emc5-BirA, the EMC clients, but not the full set of TMDs, showed a continued increase in enrichment such that the maximum was achieved following synthesis of an additional ~100 amino acids. These results further indicate that cotranslational EMC association with clients continues after initial targeting, and generally following synthesis of clusters of TMDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>Since EMC-specific enrichment peaks followed TMD clusters, we analyzed the number and amino acid composition of TMDs in the 51 putative client proteins.

This supports the notion that depletion of EMC2 and concomitant depletion of the rest of the complex has few additional effects relative to depletion of EMC4 alone, beyond affecting the complex. The identified depleted proteins represent potential EMC client proteins that are destabilized and degraded in the absence of the EMC.

In the absence of the EMC, newly synthesized client proteins are likely extracted from the membrane for degradation by the UPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37018.011</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model for the role of the EMC in multipass transmembrane protein biogenesis.</title><p>See text for details.

First, the EMC directly interacts with and stabilizes a range of client proteins consisting primarily of multipass transmembrane proteins. Several observations support this conclusion. The EMC physically associates with multipass proteins in yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 A and B</xref>). Deletion of an EMC component and dedicated membrane protein chaperone (SOP4) results in increased interaction with several multipass membrane proteins that transit the ER, including a previously identified Sop4 substrate (Pma1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2002</xref>) and a membrane protein previously shown to require the EMC to localize to the cell surface (Mrh1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bircham et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, we show that the poorly characterized ER resident protein Ilm1 acts as a substrate-specific chaperone for Fks1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 C and D</xref>), and ILM1 deletion results in increased interactions between the EMC and Fks1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These yeast studies show that the EMC directly interacts with multipass protein clients early in biosynthesis independent of, and likely prior to, engagement by their dedicated chaperones. Multipass proteins are also selectively destabilized in human cells depleted of the EMC by CRISPRi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), further demonstrating that the biogenesis/chaperoning of multipass membrane proteins is a conserved feature of EMC function.</p><p>Second, the EMC can begin to interact cotranslationally and subsequently stabilize newly synthesized client proteins, likely preventing premature degradation by ERAD. Proximity-specific ribosome profiling in yeast revealed that a common feature of the EMC is cotranslational engagement of multipass client proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The presence of full-length multipass membrane proteins in our pulldown analyses in yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>) indicate that the EMC can engage clients cotranslationally and remain bound after completion of protein synthesis for at least a subset of client proteins. Although the EMC was recently shown to act as a TA protein insertase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guna et al., 2018</xref>), our results suggest that the EMC interacts with multipass proteins during synthesis and remains associated post-ER targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In addition, all of the EMC clients identified in yeast are dependent on SRP, a factor that cotranslationally delivers substrates to the ER surface, and are cotranslationally targeted to the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Costa et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, all of the mammalian multipass protein EMC substrates were previously found to be cotranslationally targeted to the ER by proximity-specific ribosome profiling studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jan et al., 2014</xref>). These results, however, do not exclude the possibility that the EMC acts to insert or facilitate flipping of individual helices of multipass membanes proteins following initial targeting to the ER, or that the EMC acts during the initial insertion for a subset of the newly identified client proteins. Overall, our results support a model in which the EMC can engage client proteins cotranslationally, perhaps following insertion via the translocon into the ER membrane, likely acting to stabilize folding intermediates and to forestall degradation.</p><p>Third, the EMC engages transporters and other client proteins enriched for sub-optimal residues in transmembrane helices. Our proximity-specific ribosome profiling results indicate that the EMC typically engages transporters and other membrane proteins enriched for charged residues in TMDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 B and C</xref>) following synthesis of TMD clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In addition, membrane proteins that were destabilized in human cells were also enriched for transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), and human EMC clients were enriched for charged and bulky residues in TMDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). These observed features of EMC clients are inter-related, multipass membrane proteins are more likely to have sub-optimal helices and are enriched for transporter related functions. Indeed, many transporters contain polar and charged residues within TMDs, which are necessary for solute delivery across the lipid bilayer. While our studies in HeLa cells primarily identified solute carriers and transmembrane ATPases as clients, the EMC was previously implicated in the biogenesis of cell-type specific multimeric channel proteins that also contain TMDs with charged residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Richard et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we propose that the EMC promotes the biogenesis of a wide range of human multipass client proteins by stabilizing transmembrane regions during biosynthesis and prior to completion of folding.</p><p>How does the EMC act both as a cotranslational TMD chaperone, following ER targeting, and as a post-translational insertase for a subset of TA proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guna et al., 2018</xref>)? We suggest that these phenomena reflect a common biochemical property of the EMC: the ability to interact with transmembrane helices with low hydrophobicity. This property is consistent with the previously reported role for the TMD of EMC1 in binding to and stabilizing a destabilized, ER membrane embedded SV40 virion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bagchi et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we propose that a unifying function of the EMC is to accommodate and stabilize the wide diversity of membrane spanning sequences by directly interacting with select membrane proteins with destabilizing features in TMDs. Interestingly, EMC3 may share a common ancestry with the universally conserved YidC/Oxa1/Alb3 protein family in bacteria and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anghel et al., 2017</xref>). YidC also plays a dual role in both the insertion of membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Samuelson et al., 2000</xref>) and the stabilization of membrane proteins inserted via the translocon by direct interaction with SecYEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nagamori et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Beyond its role in engaging atypical TMDs, our studies point to a broader role for the EMC as a nexus of TMD folding, which requires chaperone recruitment and protection from the ERAD machinery. The EMC is a large protein complex with significant predicted mass integral to the membrane, as well as soluble mass in the cytosol and lumen. It is counterintuitive that such mass is necessary to act solely as a transmembrane chaperone and insertase. For example, members of the YidC/Oxa1/Alb3 membrane protein family in bacteria and mitochondria act as insertases and transmembrane chaperones, but they function as smaller monomers without appended soluble domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nagamori et al., 2004</xref>). Indeed, we find that in yeast the EMC also recruits substrate-specific chaperones including Ilm1, Sop4 and Gsf2, as well as general cytoplasmic and lumenal chaperones and oxidoreductases. We propose that, in analogy to the recently described function of the Slp1-Emp65 complex for soluble lumenal ER proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>), the EMC may also hold folding intermediates in a privileged, ERAD-protected state until the recruitment of substrate-specific chaperones and/or general chaperones to complete folding and allow ER export. Thus, the EMC may compartmentalize multiple functions necessary for membrane protein biogenesis: transmembrane stabilization, recruitment of folding factors and protection of folding intermediates from recognition and degradation by the ER quality control machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>Strains BY4741 (<italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold> <italic>his3</italic>Δ1 <italic>leu2</italic>Δ0 <italic>met15</italic>Δ0 <italic>ura3</italic>Δ0) and W303 (<italic>ade2-1 leu2-3 his3-11,15 trp1-1 ura3-1 can1-100</italic>) were used as wild-type parental strains.

This process was repeated for 10,000 random subsets and the fifth and 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of the 10,000 ratios produced were recorded.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Targeted downregulation of gene expression by CRISPRi</title><p>CRISPRi HeLa cell lines were generated by transducing with pHR-SFFV-dCas9-BFP-KRAB (Addgene ID: 46911) and sorting for BFP positive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gilbert et al., 2013</xref>). EMC2 (GAGTACGCGTCCGGGCCAA), EMC4 (GTCATTTCCGCCCTGGAAAT) and negative control Gal4-4 (GAACGACTAGTTAGGCGTGTA) protospacers were cloned into a lentiviral expression plasmid expressing guides from a mouse-derived U6 promoter, BFP and puromycin (pU6-sgRNA EF1-Alpha-puro-T2A-BFP; Addgene ID: 60955). HeLa CRISPRi cells were transduced with guide RNA expression plasmids, selected in puromycin for 72 hr and either directly used for experiments or expanded for SILAC labeling. HeLa cell lines were confirmed by STR analysis and tested as free from mycoplasma contamination.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Mammalian ribosome profiling </title><p>Ribosome profiling was performed for HeLa-dCas9-KRAB cells, and HeLa-dCas9-KRAB cells expressing EMC2 or Gal4-4 control guide RNAs. Cells were cultured in 15 cm plates with Dulbecco modified eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) until ~80% confluency. Cells were treated with 100 ug/ml CHX for 2 min and then lysed using 500 µl per polysome lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1% Triton x-100, 1 mM DTT, 8% glycerol, 100 µg/ml CHX, 24 U/ml Turbo DNase) per plate using a rubber cell scraper to facilitate lysis. Lysate was centrifuged for at 20,000 x g for 2 min at 4ºC and the remaining cleared polysome-containing lysate was flash frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80ºC until digestion. CaCl<sub>2</sub> was added to polysome-containing lysate to a final concentration of 5 mM and 30 µg was digested to monosomes using micrococcal nuclease (8 U/µg) for 1 hr at room temperature and the reaction was terminated by the addition of EGTA (6.25 mM). Digested lysates were equilibrated to 500 µl with polysome gradient buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1% Triton x-100, 1 mM DTT, 100 µg/ml CHX) and loaded on top of a sucrose cushion (polysome buffer containing 1.65 M sucrose) and ultracentrifuged in a TLA-110 rotor (Beckman Coulter) for 4 hours at 4ºC. The monosome-containing pellet was resuspended in 700 µl Trizol (Life Technologies). Total RNA was extracted and libraries were prepared as described for proximity-based ribosome profiling.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Quantitative SILAC mass spectrometry</title><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Cell culture and harvesting</title><p>All cell culture reagents were obtained from Gibco unless otherwise stated.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Vivek Malhotra (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Gunnar von Heijne (Reviewer #2); Ari Helenius (Reviewer #3). The complete, un-redacted comments of all three are posted below.</p><p>We have discussed the reviews with one another and have drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study addresses an important question related to multipass membrane protein maturation and quality control in the ER. Although it has been previously shown that the EMC complexes interact with such proteins, the mechanisms and detailed functions have not been analyzed. Here, elegant and extensive studies reveal not only a spectrum of client proteins in yeast and human cells but also describe important aspects related to molecular mechanism. The EMC complex associates with cargo molecules already co-translationally following the synthesis of clusters of transmembrane domains (TMDs) with specific properties shared by many transporters.</p><p>The findings in this paper are conceptually important and they are of wide-reaching significance. The overall mechanism with a direct interaction of nascent-growing client polypeptides with EMC modulated by client-specific co-chaperones and general folding factors is intriguing. The experiments are elegant, the documentation convincing, the text well-written, and the Discussion interesting and balanced. Therefore, we find the paper acceptable for publication, subject to some revision.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer's 1 and 2 raised concerns in regards to Figure 6, addressing the role of the EMC in biogenesis of the multipass protein BCAP31. Both the strength of the evidence that EMC deletion affects the fate of BCAP31 directly and the strength of the evidence that the rescued BCAP31 is a membrane associated species are questioned. Therefore we feel that these limitations need to be addressed in the revised manuscript. As options, we suggest eliminating the figure altogether, or if you have some other more creative approach to the problem, please feel free to incorporate it into the revised version.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper significantly advances the notion that the EMC is implicated in the biogenesis of multipass transmembrane proteins whose mature folded structure places heavy constrains on their stability during biogenesis. While this idea has been in circulation for some time; essentially since the discovery of the EMC, the experimental support for this notion has to date not been strong.</p><p>Proximity-based profiling of the mRNA associated with ribosomes found in proximity to the EMC reveals these to be enriched for sequences encoding the aforementioned class of special multi-pass TM proteins. The resolution of the proximity-based profiling is such that one may conclude that the ribosome-nascent chain complex encoding multipass transmembrane proteins whose mature folded structure places heavy constrains on their stability during biogenesis associate with the EMC around the time the challenging segment is synthesized and remains associated with the EMC until completion of synthesis. These findings, reported on in Figures 3 and 4 are the hard core of the paper, but they are nicely buttressed by correlative findings concerning the phenotype of EMC loss in yeast and mammalian cells as well as information on the protein contingents of the EMC.</p><p>This reviewer, who is not an expert in the area, found this paper easy to read and was persuaded by the novelty and importance of the findings in the paper as is.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The EMC has recently emerged as an important ER complex, functioning in the biogenesis of membrane proteins, whose functions and mode of operation are largely uncharacterized. In this manuscript, Shurtleff et al. use several high-throughput techniques to better define the complex components, its clientele and time of engagement by the EMC. The use of MS-based approaches helps revealing which proteins interact with the EMC in yeast and which putative client proteins get destabilized by its depletion in human cells. Most convincingly, proximity ribosome profiling in yeast provides clear evidence for cotranslational interaction of the EMC with its clients and helps in directly identifying them. The work reveals a major role in cotranslational chaperoning of multi-spanning membrane proteins that likely continues also post-translationally. Overall this well written manuscript describes work that represents an important step in our understanding of this important complex. As such, I recommend its publication without delay.</p><p>1) In the last section of the paper (Figure 6), the authors try to better characterize the mechanism of the EMC by zeroing in on BCAP31 as a 'model' EMC substrate. This part feels premature, primarily because it is not completely clear if BCAP31 represents a true substrate. Its degradation upon EMC depletion might suggest it to be a substrate, but this can also be a secondary effect. The authors themselves see some probable secondarily-degraded proteins, containing no TM, in their analysis of the human proteome. While the authors rule out a secondary effect of FDFT1 in BCAP31 degradation, it could still be a secondary effect that depends on another protein. In any case this part does not provide much mechanistic insight. Since most EMC substrates have multiple TMs and are targeted by the SRP – it is pretty clear that even in the absence of the EMC they will be inserted (at least some of their TMs) and not completely cytosolic. I therefore believe that this part can be omitted from the paper without compromising the rest of the work reported in the other sections.</p><p>2) The parts that discuss the post-translational interaction of the EMC with its clients need to be written with more caution since there is insufficient information about this in the work reported, except for a few full-length protein clients identified in Figure 1A.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This study addresses an important question related to multipass membrane protein maturation and quality control in the ER.

This part feels premature, primarily because it is not completely clear if BCAP31 represents a true substrate. Its degradation upon EMC depletion might suggest it to be a substrate, but this can also be a secondary effect. The authors themselves see some probable secondarily-degraded proteins, containing no TM, in their analysis of the human proteome. While the authors rule out a secondary effect of FDFT1 in BCAP31 degradation, it could still be a secondary effect that depends on another protein. In any case this part does not provide much mechanistic insight. Since most EMC substrates have multiple TMs and are targeted by the SRP – it is pretty clear that even in the absence of the EMC they will be inserted (at least some of their TMs) and not completely cytosolic. I therefore believe that this part can be omitted from the paper without compromising the rest of the work reported in the other sections.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the strength of the paper lies in the global analyses and that we cannot, at this stage, exclude the formal possibility that decreased BCAP31 abundance could be secondary to another depleted client (we did of course explicitly exclude this possibility for what we thought was the most immediate concern in this regard i.e. that loss of BCAP31 is a secondary consequence of FDFT1. Per the reviewers’ suggestions we have removed the BCAP31 data from this figure and hope to present this in the future as part of an expanded mechanistic study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The parts that discuss the post-translational interaction of the EMC with its clients need to be written with more caution since there is insufficient information about this in the work reported, except for a few full-length protein clients identified in Figure 1A.</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to the full-length clients shown in Figure 1A, we also observed peptides spanning the full-length of client proteins in pulldown mass spec analyses in Figure 1B and Figure 2B. However, we agree that, given the limited number of clients detected using these approaches, that post-translational interaction between the EMC and clients as a general rule remains to be more fully explored. In the revised version we have toned down this claim throughout.</p><p>For example: “The presence of full-length multipass membrane proteins in our pulldown analyses in yeast (Figures 1 and 2) indicate that the EMC can engage clients cotranslationally and remain bound after completion of protein synthesis for at least a subset of client proteins.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] There is one interesting aspect that could be discussed more deeply.

Indeed, we do not observe oligomeric channel proteins as being among the list of proteins of decreased abundance as a upon EMC depletion in HeLa cells. However, the EMC has previously been implicated in the biosynthesis of such channel proteins in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (acetylcholine receptors and GABA receptor) (Richard, 2013). These proteins however are not expressed in HeLa cells. Based on this observation, we suspect that some, but not all, oligomeric channel proteins are EMC clients in specific cell types, however this will require further examination in future studies.</p><p>To clarify this point for the reader, we have added the following sentence to the Discussion:</p><p>“While our studies in HeLa cells primarily identified solute carriers and transmembrane ATPases as clients, the EMC was previously implicated in the biogenesis of cell-type specific multimeric channel proteins that also contain TMDs with charged residues (Richard et al., 2013).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
