mevalonate pathway. As HMGR acts at the beginning of the pathway, its regulation affects the synthesis of sterols and of other essential mevalonate-derived metabolites, such as ubiquinone or dolichol. Here, we describe a novel, evolutionarily conserved feedback system operating at a sterol-specific step of the mevalonate pathway. This involves the sterol-dependent degradation of squalene monooxygenase mediated by the yeast Doa10 or mammalian Teb4, a ubiquitin ligase implicated in a branch of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway. Since the other branch of ERAD is required for HMGR regulation, our results reveal a fundamental role for ERAD in sterol homeostasis, with the two branches of this pathway acting together to control sterol biosynthesis at different levels and thereby allowing independent regulation of multiple products of the mevalonate pathway.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00953.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00953.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00953.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All cells are enclosed by a membrane that is made up of fatty molecules called lipids and is studded with proteins. This membrane allows cells to detect and react to outside events. Since external conditions, such as temperature, can vary dramatically, membranes need to be able to adjust their properties. For example, lipids become more fluid as the temperature rises, so membranes respond to heat stress by incorporating molecules called sterols to increase their rigidity. In fact, sterols have profound effects on membrane properties and are essential to regulate a number of cellular processes. But high levels of sterols can become toxic, so it is essential that they are carefully controlled.</p><p>Sterols, such as ergosterol in yeast or cholesterol in mammals, are synthesized in a tightly regulated multi-step process; some of the early steps in sterol production also make common building blocks for other key molecules in the cell. A mechanism to control sterol levels is the regulated destruction of an enzyme that carries out an early step of their synthesis. This occurs via one branch of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which also destroys non-functional proteins. Now, Foresti et al. have found that sterol synthesis is also regulated by another branch of the ERAD pathway. This second control point, which occurs later in the biosynthetic process, allows cells to regulate sterol levels independent of the other products of the pathway that are derived from the same preliminary compounds.</p><p>In yeast, the two ERAD branches are directed by Hrd1 and Doa10. These are both ubiquitin ligases—proteins that attach a tag called ubiquitin to other proteins, thus labeling them for recycling by the proteasome (essentially a waste-disposal complex in the cell). To identify the proteins that are tagged by Doa10, Foresti et al. compared protein levels in strains lacking Doa10 with those in wild type yeast. Unexpectedly, the enzyme Erg1, which helps to synthesize ergosterol, was more abundant in cells lacking Doa10.</p><p>Foresti et al. found that Doa10 tagged Erg1 for destruction when levels of the building blocks of ergosterol rose inside the cell. These ergosterol intermediates are toxic to yeast, which converts them into less harmful molecules known as sterol esters using the proteins Are1/2. When the <italic>DOA10</italic> or <italic>ARE1/2</italic> genes were deleted, these intermediates were more abundant; strikingly, they became even more prevalent when all three genes were knocked out in the same strain. In contrast, blocking the other ERAD branch by deleting <italic>HRD1</italic> did not cause ergosterol intermediates to accumulate, nor did it exacerbate the effects of <italic>ARE1/2</italic> knockout.</p><p>When combined with previous findings, these results provide evidence that the different branches of the ERAD pathway regulate ergosterol synthesis at distinct steps. The same mechanism is observed in human cells when high levels of cholesterol are detected. By identifying parallel routes to control sterol levels, this work reinforces the importance of membrane integrity to life.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00953.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00953.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>ERAD</kwd><kwd>sterol homeostasis</kwd><kwd>squalene monooxygenase</kwd><kwd>DOA10</kwd><kwd>TEB4</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Center for Genomic Regulation (CRG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carvalho</surname><given-names>Pedro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Spanish MCCIN</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carvalho</surname><given-names>Pedro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>International Early Career Scientist, Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carvalho</surname><given-names>Pedro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Danish Council for Independent Research/Natural Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ejsing</surname><given-names>Christer S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ejsing</surname><given-names>Christer S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>La Caixa Graduate fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ruggiano</surname><given-names>Annamaria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Parallel branches of the ERAD pathway regulate sterol synthesis at multiple steps via feedback inhibition.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sterols, such as cholesterol in animals or ergosterol in yeast, are essential components of cellular membranes and their concentration to a large extent determines many of the membrane properties, such as fluidity and rigidity.

In fact, an increase in sterol biosynthetic intermediates, such as geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate in yeast and lanosterol or its immediate product 24,25-dihydrolanosterol in mammals, strongly accelerates the degradation of HMGR, thereby lowering the flux through the mevalonate pathway. Both in yeast and in mammals, the targeting of HMGR to the proteasome for degradation is mediated by a branch of the ER-associated protein degradation (or ERAD) pathway, which is primarily studied for its role in the elimination of misfolded ER proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smith et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brodsky, 2012</xref>). Importantly, ERAD factors involved in the recognition of misfolded ER proteins are not required for HMGR degradation. Instead specific chaperones called Insigs, in the presence of the right sterol signal, regulate the interaction of HMGR with the central ERAD components, a ubiquitin ligase complex in the ER membrane, called Hrd1 in yeast and Gp78 in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hampton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bays et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sever et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flury et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Song et al., 2005b</xref>). The Hrd1/Gp78-dependent ubiquitination of HMGR leads to its membrane extraction, facilitated by the Cdc48/p97 ATPase, and release in the cytoplasm for degradation by the proteasome. In mammalian cells, a second ER-bound ubiquitin ligase, Trc8, can also promote the sterol-dependent degradation of HMGR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jo et al., 2011a</xref>). Other branches of ERAD have never been implicated in sterol homeostasis.</p><p>Here, we report a novel role of ERAD in the regulation of sterol biosynthesis. A screen for substrates of the ERAD ubiquitin ligase Doa10 identified the squalene monooxygenase Erg1, an enzyme required for a sterol-specific step of the mevalonate pathway in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. We show that Doa10-dependent degradation of Erg1 is regulated by the levels of lanosterol and that, together with sterol esterification, it is essential for preventing the accumulation of toxic sterol intermediates. Moreover, in mammalian cells, sterol-dependent degradation of squalene monooxygenase requires the Doa10 homologue Teb4. Altogether, our findings reveal an evolutionarily conserved, central role of ERAD in sterol homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Erg1 is a substrate of the Doa10 complex</title><p>To identify novel substrates of the ERAD ubiquitin ligase Doa10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Swanson et al., 2001</xref>), we used SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino acids in Culture) labeling followed by quantitative proteomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Godoy et al., 2008</xref>). We found that, at steady state, several proteins were overrepresented in <italic>doa10Δ</italic> mutant when compared to wild type (<italic>wt</italic>) cells (data not shown). Among these potential Doa10 substrates was the yeast squalene monooxygenase Erg1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Other components of the yeast sterol biosynthetic pathway (ergosterol or Erg pathway) were present at similar levels in <italic>doa10Δ</italic> and <italic>wt</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The high levels of Erg1 in <italic>doa10Δ</italic> mutants are not due to increased <italic>ERG1</italic> transcription as the abundance of Erg1 mRNA was indistinguishable between <italic>doa10Δ</italic> and <italic>wt</italic> cells (data not shown). Interestingly, cells lacking Ubc6 or Ubc7, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes required for Doa10-dependent ubiquitination and members of the Doa10 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carvalho et al., 2006</xref>), also showed increased steady state levels of Erg1 when compared to <italic>wt</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, deletion of Hrd1, Der1, or Usa1, involved in a different branch of ERAD as part of the Hrd1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carvalho et al., 2006</xref>), had no effect on the steady state levels of Erg1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To directly test for a role of Doa10 in the turnover of Erg1, we performed cycloheximide shut-off experiments. We found that in <italic>wt</italic> cells Erg1 is an unstable protein with a half-life of &lt;120 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Deletion of the ubiquitin ligase Doa10 or any of the components of the Doa10 complex strongly impaired the degradation of Erg1 expressed from its own promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) or from the heterologous glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (<italic>GAPDH</italic>) promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Similarly, Erg1 degradation was virtually blocked in <italic>cdc48-3</italic> and <italic>npl4-1</italic> cells, expressing temperature sensitive alleles in essential subunits of the Cdc48 ATPase complex that pulls substrates out of the ER membrane after Doa10-dependent ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). On the other hand, in <italic>hrd1Δ</italic> cells the kinetics of Erg1 degradation was similar to that in <italic>wt</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Together, these data show that Erg1 is an ERAD substrate of the Doa10 complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ERAD of Erg1 depends on a single lysine residue</title><p>In the vast majority of cases, protein ubiquitination occurs on the ε-amino group of lysine residues. We therefore searched for Erg1 lysine residues required for its Doa10-dependent degradation. We focused our attention on a cluster of residues proximal to the C-terminal region (K278, K284, K311, and K360) that were reported to be ubiquitinated in several large scale studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hitchcock et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beltrao et al., 2012</xref>). We generated Erg1-derivatives in which individual or pairs of the lysine residues were mutated to arginine. These lysine mutant alleles supported the growth of yeast cells, indicating that the substitutions did not significantly affect the essential enzymatic function of Erg1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To test the effect of the lysine mutations on Erg1 stability, we performed cycloheximide shut-off assays in otherwise <italic>wt</italic> cells. Degradation of Erg1(K278,284R) and Erg1(K360R) was indistinguishable from degradation of <italic>wt</italic> Erg1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>). In contrast, Erg1(K311R) was strongly stabilized either when expressed from the endogenous <italic>ERG1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>) or from the strong constitutive <italic>GAPDH</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) . Importantly, Erg1(K311R) and Erg1(K278,284,311,360R), with simultaneous mutations on four lysine residues, were only slightly stabilized by additional deletion of <italic>DOA10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>).

Reduction of ergosterol synthesis in <italic>wt</italic> cells by a brief treatment with zaragozic acid, an inhibitor of the squalene synthetase Erg9, led to a strong stabilization of Erg1 when compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

These experiments indicate that sterol depletion specifically affects the Doa10-dependent degradation of Erg1 but not other Doa10 substrates, such as misfolded proteins. Similar results were obtained upon treatment of <italic>wt</italic> cells with Ro48-807, an inhibitor of the squalene cyclase Erg7 and whose product (lanosterol) is the first sterol of the pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). The next step in ergosterol biosynthesis is catalyzed by Erg11, the lanosterol demethylase, which is inhibited by fluconazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast to zaragozic acid and Ro48-807, a short treatment of <italic>wt</italic> cells with fluconazole induced a marked acceleration of Erg1 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). Importantly, the acceleration of Erg1 degradation upon fluconazole treatment was completely dependent on Doa10, as it was blocked in <italic>doa10Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Moreover, fluconazole treatment did not have any effect on the kinetics of degradation of the Doa10 substrates Pca1<sub>1–392</sub>-DHFR-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>) and Vma12-Ndc10<sub>902–956</sub>-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Therefore, lanosterol accumulation induced by fluconazole treatment stimulates Doa10-dependent degradation of Erg1.

Interestingly, <italic>doa10Δ</italic> cells also accumulated significantly higher amounts of sterol esters (approximately a 40% increase in relation to <italic>wt</italic> cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This increase prompted us to investigate a potential connection between the Doa10-dependent feedback regulation of Erg1 and sterol esterification. In yeast, esterified sterols are produced by two partially redundant acyl-CoA sterol acyl transferases (ASATs), Are1 and Are2, that are not essential for growth under laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zweytick et al., 2000</xref>). We then again used shotgun lipidomics to evaluate the effect of the <italic>DOA10</italic> mutation on sterol composition in esterification-deficient <italic>are1Δ are2Δ</italic> cells. Compared to <italic>wt</italic> cells, <italic>are1Δ are2Δ</italic> mutant has ∼20% less ergosterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zweytick et al., 2000</xref>). Moreover, <italic>are1Δ are2Δ</italic> cells show significantly higher amounts of lanosterol and ergostadienol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating that loss of esterification also leads to the accumulation of sterol intermediates. Strikingly, in <italic>are1Δ are2Δ doa10Δ</italic> mutant the levels of ergosterol dropped by more than 50%, while the levels of the intermediates lanosterol and ergostadienol increased dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The changes observed in the <italic>are1Δ are2Δ doa10Δ</italic> mutant, although of a much larger magnitude, perfectly mirror those observed in <italic>doa10Δ</italic> cells. Importantly, the effects appear specific to <italic>doa10Δ</italic>, as deletion of <italic>HRD1</italic> did not significantly change the sterol profile of esterification-deficient cells (data not shown). These data suggest that sterol esterification and the ubiquitin ligase Doa10 play parallel, redundant functions in preventing accumulation of sterol intermediate metabolites. Does the massive increase in sterol intermediates at the expense of the final product, ergosterol, have any impact in the cellular physiology of <italic>are1Δ are2Δ doa10Δ</italic> cells? To address this issue, we have performed growth assays under conditions of membrane stress such as low temperature or the presence of benzyl alcohol, a membrane fluidizing agent. Although <italic>are1Δ are2Δ doa10Δ</italic> mutant grows normally at 25°C, these cells barely grew when incubated at 14°C or in the presence of benzyl alcohol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The same phenotype was observed when <italic>are1Δ are2Δ</italic> mutation was combined with deletion of <italic>UBC7</italic>, encoding for the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in complex with Doa10 (data not shown). In contrast, the <italic>are1Δ are2Δ hrd1Δ</italic> mutant cells, lacking the ubiquitin ligase of the other ERAD branch, did not display any growth defect at 14°C or in the presence of benzyl alcohol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These results indicate that accumulation of sterol intermediates with a concomitant decrease in ergosterol levels renders <italic>are1Δ are2Δ doa10Δ</italic> cells vulnerable to membrane stress, perhaps due to the inability to adjust membrane fluidity. To rule out the possibility that the growth phenotypes of <italic>are1Δ are2Δ doa10Δ</italic> are due to pleiotropic effects of <italic>doa10Δ</italic>, for example due to its role in the clearance of misfolded proteins, we took advantage of the degradation resistant <italic>ERG1</italic> allele, <italic>ERG1(K311R)</italic>. Remarkably, constitutive expression from the <italic>GAPDH</italic> promoter of <italic>ERG1(K311R)</italic> in <italic>are1Δ are2Δ</italic> cells led to a cold phenotype comparable to that observed in <italic>are1Δ are2Δ doa10Δ</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In contrast, expression of <italic>ERG1</italic> or <italic>ERG1(K360R)</italic> under the same conditions did not cause any apparent defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), suggesting that Erg1 is a key Doa10 substrate for sterol homeostasis. In sum, these data show that Are1, Are2-dependent sterol esterification and Doa10-dependent degradation of Erg1 are parallel mechanisms preventing abnormal accumulation of potentially toxic sterol intermediates. Interestingly, these two mechanisms appear to be tightly integrated in cells. As suggested by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sorger et al., 2004</xref>), we found that degradation of Erg1 is accelerated in <italic>are1Δ are2Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, F</xref>), likely due to the higher levels of lanosterol in this mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Importantly, this accelerated degradation still requires the lysine at position 311 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) and is completely dependent on Doa10 as it is blocked in <italic>doa10Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Doa10 homologue Teb4 promotes degradation of human squalene monooxygenase SM</title><p>The homologue of Erg1 in mammals, SM, is ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gill et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, SM proteasomal-dependent degradation is stimulated by sterols, in this case by the final product of the pathway, cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gill et al., 2011</xref>). These similarities prompted us to test whether the mammalian homologue of Doa10, the ubiquitin ligase Teb4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Swanson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hassink et al., 2005</xref>), was involved in the turnover of SM. We transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells with a pool of siRNA against Teb4, which led to a 57% (±0.044%) reduction in TEB4 mRNA levels compared to control treated cells, as detected by qPCR. We noticed that although transcription of SM in Teb4-depleted and control cells was indistinguishable, the steady state levels of SM were 1.8-fold (±0.232) higher in cells treated with Teb4 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, ‘untreated’ lanes). This stabilization is consistent with a role of Teb4 in the degradation of SM. To directly examine SM half-life upon Teb4 depletion we performed cycloheximide shut-off experiments with or without the addition of cholesterol to stimulate SM degradation. These experiments were performed in sterol-deprived cells, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gill et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jo et al., 2011b</xref>). In these conditions, SM appears to have a relatively long half-life that is even longer in Teb4 siRNA-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>). Cholesterol treatment of control cells induces very rapid degradation of SM (half-life &lt;4 hr), as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gill et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, cholesterol treatment in Teb4-depleted cells has a much milder effect on the degradation of SM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>) and its half-life remains longer than 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Both in control and in Teb4-depleted cells, SM sterol-dependent degradation is significantly attenuated by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To independently assess the role of Teb4 in the regulated degradation of SM, HEK293 cells were transfected with constructs overexpressing Teb4-myc or Teb4(C9A)-myc, a dominant negative mutant that lacks ubiquitin ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hassink et al., 2005</xref>). While SM degradation occurred with normal kinetics in Teb4-overexpressing cells, expression of Teb4(C9A) strongly inhibited the cholesterol-dependent acceleration of SM degradation, as assayed by cycloheximide shut-off experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Altogether, these data indicate that the Teb4 ubiquitin ligase promotes the degradation of SM in a cholesterol-dependent manner.

We have now found that in yeast, high levels of lanosterol also lead to a decrease in flux through the sterol pathway, in this case by the Doa10-dependent degradation of Erg1. Together these observations suggest that the regulation of the rate of sterol biosynthesis according to the lanosterol levels might be a unifying principle of sterol homeostasis. Besides being the first sterol of the pathway, lanosterol is also a poor substrate for the sterol esterification enzyme Are2, the most active of the yeast ASATs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zweytick et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, lanosterol levels might provide an accurate measurement of the flux into the sterol branch of the mevalonate pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zweytick et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Espenshade and Hughes, 2007</xref>).</p><p>High Erg1 levels in <italic>doa10Δ</italic> cells lead to accumulation of lanosterol, that is particularly prominent in cells also lacking the ASATs Are1 and Are2. This huge increase in lanosterol levels is somewhat surprising because these cells have an intact Erg11, the lanosterol 14-α-demethylase that consumes lanosterol. This indicates that Erg11 activity is either rate limiting or regulated. Erg11 is an enzyme of the cytochrome P450 family that uses heme as a co-factor. Therefore, it is possible that lanosterol accumulation in these mutants is a consequence of changes in the availability of heme, also a product of the mevalonate pathway. Alternatively, the lanosterol accumulation might result from a still unknown regulatory system acting on Erg11 itself or another downstream enzyme. This possibility is supported by the observation that simultaneous overexpression of Erg1 and Erg11 leads to a significant increase in the production of ergosterol in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Veen et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Besides the Doa10-dependent degradation of Erg1 in yeast, we show that the Doa10 homologue Teb4 also promotes the degradation of SM in mammalian cells. While the degradation of yeast Erg1 is accelerated by the sterol intermediate lanosterol, SM degradation is stimulated by the end product of the sterol pathway, cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gill et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, Doa10-dependent degradation of Erg1 requires a single lysine residue that is poorly conserved outside fungi, while proteasomal-dependent degradation of SM depends on an N-terminal fragment conserved only in higher animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gill et al., 2011</xref>). Despite these differences, it appears that the post-translation feedback regulation of squalene monooxygenase by the Doa10/Teb4 ubiquitin ligase is a conserved mechanism of sterol homeostasis. In fact, this regulatory system might also operate in plants, as suggested by the observation that mutations of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Doa10 homologue suppress a hypomorphic allele of squalene monooxygenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doblas et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>HMGR, the major target for Hrd1/Gp78 regulation, acts at a very early step of the mevalonate pathway and is required for the synthesis of all its products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). On the other hand, squalene monooxygenase is required for the synthesis of sterols but not of other key metabolites of the mevalonate pathway, such as dolichol or ubiquinone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Therefore, the novel feedback system described here allows cells to independently regulate the biosynthesis of the different metabolites derived from mevalonate. Remarkably, regulation of HMGR and squalene monooxygenase is mediated by two branches of the ERAD pathway, both in yeast and in mammals. As previously shown, the ubiquitin ligase Hrd1/Gp78 promotes the degradation of HMGR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bays et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Song et al., 2005b</xref>). Our results now show that the ubiquitin ligase Doa10/Teb4 promotes the degradation of squalene monooxygenase, which place ERAD at the center of cellular sterol homeostasis, with multiple branches of ERAD acting together to regulate sterol biosynthesis at different levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). More broadly, our findings raise the possibility that regulated degradation of folded, active proteins might be a more prominent feature of ERAD, a pathway primarily studied for its role in the elimination of misfolded proteins. Whether regulated ERAD substrates are all related to sterol homeostasis or ERAD plays a more general role in regulating the ER proteome remains to be determined.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00953.012</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A central role of endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation in sterol homeostasis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the feedback inhibition systems required for sterol homeostasis in yeast (left) and mammals (right) previously characterized (dotted lines) and described here (solid lines).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers felt that the studies of yeast Erg1 are comprehensive and convincing. Moreover, they add a significant new element to our understanding of the regulation of sterol biosynthesis in this organism.</p><p>With regard to the animal cell experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>, there is precedent for a role of cholesterol in accelerating degradation of squalene monooxygenase (SM). Nevertheless, we feel that the new aspect, namely the role of Teb4, is worthy of publication if it can be fully documented.</p><p>1) The experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> show that elimination of Teb4 by SiRNA reduces, but does not abolish, the cholesterol-accelerated degradation of SM. Interpretation of this partial result would be aided if the authors quantitate the amount of Teb4 mRNA remaining after the SiRNA treatment. This is standard practice in SiRNA experiments. This one measurement would be the one piece of data that should be added prior to final acceptance.</p><p>2) In keeping with <italic>eLife's</italic> policy to minimize supplemental data, it will also be necessary for you to insert most of the supplementary figures into the body of the manuscript, editing the text accordingly.</p><p>3) You should also comply with the minor comments from Reviewer 3, listed below:</p><p>The model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> should be revised to show that 24,25-dihydrolanosterol, not lanosterol, triggers degradation of mammalian HMG CoA reductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nguyen et al.

The model should also show that two ubiquitin ligases, gp78 and Trc8 (Jo et al. (2011) PNAS 108:20503), mediate degradation of mammalian HMG CoA reductase. Finally, the model should indicate that mevalonate-derived nonsterol isoprenoids contribute to mammalian HMG CoA reductase ERAD.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00953.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The experiments of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>show that elimination of Teb4 by SiRNA reduces, but does not abolish, the cholesterol-accelerated degradation of SM.

The data in these four figures is redundant with the results presented in the associated main figures and none of the conclusions of the paper are based on the supplemental figures. We believe these four figures should be presented as figure supplements.</p><p><italic>3) You should also comply with the minor comments from Reviewer 3, listed below</italic>:</p><p><italic>The model shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref> <italic>should be revised to show that 24,25-dihydrolanosterol, not lanosterol, triggers degradation of mammalian HMG CoA reductase (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35"><italic>Nguyen et al.
