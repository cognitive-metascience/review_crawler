The molecules and reactions that drive these dynamics in vivo are not well understood. In this study, we present evidence that a group of intrinsically disordered, serine-rich proteins regulate the dynamics of P granules in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos. The MEG (maternal-effect germline defective) proteins are germ plasm components that are required redundantly for fertility. We demonstrate that MEG-1 and MEG-3 are substrates of the kinase MBK-2/DYRK and the phosphatase PP2A<sup>PPTR−½</sup>. Phosphorylation of the MEGs promotes granule disassembly and dephosphorylation promotes granule assembly. Using lattice light sheet microscopy on live embryos, we show that GFP-tagged MEG-3 localizes to a dynamic domain that surrounds and penetrates each granule. We conclude that, despite their liquid-like behavior, P granules are non-homogeneous structures whose assembly in embryos is regulated by phosphorylation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04591.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04591.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04591.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>For a gene to be expressed as a protein, its DNA is first used as a template to make a molecule of RNA, which is then translated to make the protein. In most cells, RNA molecules concentrate into aggregates called RNA granules. These granules contain both RNA and proteins that bind to RNA and are used to transport, store, and regulate the translation and breakdown of RNA molecules. Unlike many other structures within cells, RNA granules are not surrounded by a membrane; and the molecules that hold RNA granules together are not known.</p><p>P granules are a type of RNA granule that is found in the germ cells (the cells that go on to form eggs and sperm) of a microscopic worm called <italic>C. elegans</italic>. When a <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo is still a single cell, P granules move throughout the cell and the P granules at the front of the cell dissolve, while those at the back condense. As such, when the single-celled embryo divides, the front forms a cell without P granules (that will go on to form the tissues of the worm's body) and the back becomes a P granule-containing germ cell.</p><p>Two proteins called MBK-2 and PPTR-1 have opposite effects on P granules: MBK-2 causes P granules to dissolve, while PPTR-1 makes them form. MBK-2 is an enzyme that adds phosphate groups onto other proteins, whereas PPTR-1 is part of an enzyme that removes such groups. Wang et al. have now searched for proteins that interact with MBK-2 and PPTR-1 in order to identify the molecules that regulate the assembly of P granules. They found that a group of proteins, known as MEG proteins, are acted upon by both of these proteins. Wang et al. found that MBK-2 adds phosphate groups to MEG proteins, which encourages granules to disassemble, while PPTR-1 removes these groups to promote granule assembly.</p><p>Wang et al. generated mutant worms that lacked each of the MEG proteins. These mutant worms had fewer and smaller P granules than normal worms. Without MEG proteins, P granules failed to assemble or disassemble normally and the worms were infertile. Using high resolution microscopy, Wang et al. observed that the MEG proteins wrap around the P granules and that one of the MEG proteins—called MEG-3—follows an almost ribbon-like path that surrounds and enters each granule. These observations suggest that the MEG proteins stabilize RNA granules by forming a cage-like scaffold around each granule. How the MEG proteins—which are predicted to lack a fixed or ordered three-dimensional structure and show no similarity to proteins with known functions—assemble into a scaffold will be the focus of future studies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04591.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04591.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>RNA granule</kwd><kwd>intrinsically disordered protein</kwd><kwd>germ plasm</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000071</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD37047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jennifer T</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Jarrett</given-names></name><name><surname>Paix</surname><given-names>Alexandre</given-names></name><name><surname>Lambrus</surname><given-names>Bramwell G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Jarrett</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Bi-Chang</given-names></name><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>Helen</given-names></name><name><surname>Rasoloson</surname><given-names>Dominique</given-names></name><name><surname>Calidas</surname><given-names>Deepika</given-names></name><name><surname>Betzig</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name><name><surname>Seydoux</surname><given-names>Geraldine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The MEG (maternal-effect germline defective) proteins, MEG-1, 2, 3 and 4, regulate RNA granule dynamics in vivo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>RNA granules are ubiquitous cytoplasmic organelles that contain RNA and RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kedersha et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchan, 2014</xref>). Several types of RNA granules have been described, including germ granules in germ cells, neuronal granules in neurons, and stress granules and P bodies in somatic cells. Their functions include mRNA transport and storage and the regulation of mRNA degradation and translation. Unlike other organelles, RNA granules are not bound by limiting membranes and their internal components are in constant flux with the surrounding cytoplasm. RNA granules assemble and disassemble in response to developmental or environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kedersha et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchan, 2014</xref>). Live imaging studies in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> zygotes have suggested that RNA granules behave like liquid droplets that undergo phase transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>). Granule components exist in a condensed liquid or gel-like phase in the granule and a dispersed phase in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weber and Brangwynne, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Toretsky and Wright, 2014</xref>). In vitro studies have lent support to this hypothesis by demonstrating that purified proteins can undergo phase transitions in aqueous solutions. For example, proteins that contain weak, multivalent protein-binding domains undergo liquid–liquid demixing in concentrated solutions to form micron-sized droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, RNA-binding proteins that contain low sequence-complexity domains assemble into ordered fibers that coalesce into hydrogels when maintained at low temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kato et al., 2012</xref>). The proteins that drive the phase transitions in vivo, however, are not known. Several proteins and RNAs are required for granule integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchan, 2014</xref>), and recently the kinase DYRK3 has been implicated in the regulation of stress granule dissolution and condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wippich et al., 2013</xref>). In the present study, we identify the substrates of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> DYRK3 homolog MBK-2 and demonstrate that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of these substrates drive the dissolution and condensation of P granules in embryos.</p><p>P granules are the germ granules of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Strome and Wood, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Updike and Strome, 2010</xref>). P granules are perinuclear during most of the germline development. During the oocyte-to-embryo transition, P granules detach from nuclei and disperse in the cytoplasm for asymmetric segregation to the nascent embryonic germline. Preferential dissolution of the granules in the anterior and condensation in the posterior of the zygote cause the granules to accumulate in the cytoplasm destined for the germline blastomere P<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gallo et al., 2010</xref>). P granules segregate asymmetrically for three more divisions until the P granules are uniquely concentrated in the germline founder cell P<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Strome and Wood, 1983</xref>). Two groups of RNA-binding proteins form the core components of P granules: the RGG domain proteins PGL-1 and PGL-3 and the Vasa-related helicases GLH-1, 2, 3, and 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Updike and Strome, 2010</xref>). A self-association domain in the PGL family is essential for granule nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hanazawa et al., 2011</xref>), and FG repeats in GLH-1 are required for P granules to associate with nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Updike et al., 2011</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04591.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MBK-2 and PP2A<sup>PPTR−1/2</sup> are an opposing kinase/phosphatase pair.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) P granule dynamics during the oocyte to embryo transition.

The lower levels inherited by the somatic daughter are turned over after division (degradation). In <italic>meg-3 meg-4</italic> zygotes, we found that <italic>nos-2</italic> RNA was distributed equally to P blastomeres and their somatic sisters, consistent with the lack of stable P granules. <italic>nos-2</italic> RNA, however, was still quickly degraded in the somatic blastomeres after division as in wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Thus, as previously reported for <italic>pptr-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gallo et al., 2010</xref>), despite symmetric segregation of <italic>nos-2</italic> RNA, an inherent asymmetry between somatic and germline blastomeres in <italic>meg</italic>-3 <italic>meg-4</italic> embryos causes <italic>nos-2</italic> RNA to be maintained only in the germline blastomeres.

Our findings indicate that the MEGs are required to stabilize the condensed phase of P granules. Phosphorylation of the MEGs by the anteriorly enriched kinase MBK-2/DYRK and dephosphorylation by PP2A<sup>PPTR−1/PPTR2</sup> antagonizes and promotes, respectively, the stabilizing function of the MEGs. The MEGs also contribute redundantly to a second activity required for germline proliferation during larval development. We discuss each aspect of this model below.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The MEGs stabilize P granules in embryos: possible scaffolding function</title><p>During the oocyte-to-zygote transition, oocyte granules disassemble and are replaced by smaller and much more dynamic granules (zygote granules). We suggest that this transition depends on scaffolding of new granules by MEG assemblies throughout the cytoplasm. We propose that, shortly after fertilization, MEG assemblies promote PGL condensation, depleting the cytoplasmic PGL-1 pool available to maintain oocyte granules and causing PGL-1 to redistribute from oocyte granules to MEG-scaffolded zygote granules. In <italic>meg</italic> mutants, this competition does not take place, allowing oocyte granules to persist longer. The alternative possibility that the primary role of the MEGs is to disassemble oocyte granules, which indirectly is required for zygote granule assembly, is unlikely since (1) the <italic>meg-3</italic> single mutant disassembles oocyte granules, yet is still partially defective in zygote granule assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), (2) <italic>mbk-2</italic>, which is required for the disassembly of zygote granules, is not required for the disassembly of oocyte granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and (3) oocyte granules represent less than 1% of the total PGL-1 pool available in <italic>meg-3 meg-4</italic> zygotes, so their mere presence is unlikely to interfere with the assembly of new granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). We detected GFP::MEG-3 in the cytoplasm of oocytes before fertilization, yet loss of <italic>meg-3</italic> does not affect oocyte granules until after fertilization. We do not know what cue activates the scaffolding function of MEG proteins specifically in zygotes.</p><p>How do MEG proteins stimulate PGL-1 condensation? Unlike the RNA-binding proteins that associate with hydrogels in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kato et al., 2012</xref>), the MEGs do not contain a recognizable RNA-binding domain or short repeated motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The MEGs contain, however, extended regions with predicted high disorder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Intrinsically disordered proteins have been shown to oligomerize and organize scaffolds that template supramolecular structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Turoverov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Toretsky and Wright, 2014</xref>). For example, ameloblastin self-assembles in vitro into ribbons that can extend to hundreds of nanometers in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wald et al., 2013</xref>). In vivo, ameloblastin is essential for the organization of enamel matrix proteins during teeth biomineralization. MEG-1 and MEG-3 bind directly to PGL-1 in vitro, consistent with a role in organizing PGL-1 assemblies. When over-expressed in mammalian cells, PGL-1 can assemble granules on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hanazawa et al., 2011</xref>). In <italic>meg-3 meg-4</italic> zygotes, a few small PGL-1 granules form transiently in the posterior cytoplasm but are not maintained. We suggest that, in zygotes, the self-assembly properties of PGL-1 are only sufficient to form small, unstable granules, which must be stabilized by a MEG-dependent scaffold. Our observations using light sheet microscopy indicate that MEG-3 localizes to small assemblies in the cytoplasm and larger assemblies surrounding a PGL core in the P granules. During granule disassembly, MEG-3 and MEG-4 assemblies persist longer than the PGL-1 core, consistent with occupying a distinct domain. Together these observations suggest the following working model: the MEGs promote granule assembly by forming dynamic scaffolds in the cytoplasm that stabilize and wrap around PGL condensates.</p><p>By electron microscopy, embryonic P granules were reported to appear as homogenous, fibrillar granular bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wolf et al., 1983</xref>). Our observations suggest that embryonic P granules in fact contain distinct surface and internal zones, as also reported for post-embryonic, perinuclear P granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pitt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sheth et al., 2010</xref>). Nucleoli, which also behave like liquid droplets, also contain a distinct surface shell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brangwynne et al., 2011</xref>). Nucleoli, however, are perfect spheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brangwynne et al., 2011</xref>), whereas P granules are imperfect spheres with irregular, asymmetric contours that are constantly in flux. We suggest that this difference is due to the fact that P granules are undergoing continuous exchange with smaller assemblies in the surrounding cytoplasm. Consistent with this possibility, photobleaching experiments have demonstrated rapid exchange of GFP::PGL-1 and GFP::MEG-3 between granules and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref> and data not shown). We conclude that P granules in embryos are not stable, homogeneous droplets, but dynamic assemblies of two (or more) condensates that mix only partially and are constantly in flux with smaller assemblies in the cytoplasm.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Phosphorylation of the MEGs by MBK-2/DYRK promotes granule disassembly</title><p>MEG-1 and MEG-3 are direct targets of MBK-2/DYRK and the PP2A phosphatase. The MEGs are rich in serines (75 serines in MEG-1 and 119 serines in MEG-3), and their migration on Phos-tag gels suggests a complex pattern of phosphorylation with many phosphoisoforms. Initial attempts to mutate individual serines in MEG-1 and MEG-3 have not yielded detectable phenotypes, suggesting that the serines may function cumulatively (data not shown). Accumulation of negatively charged phosphates could interfere with the interactions that stabilize the MEG scaffold or its interactions with PGL-1. Consistent with this possibility, phosphorylation of the low complexity domain of the FUS stress granule protein interferes with its incorporation into hydrogels in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Han et al., 2012</xref>). Our genetic analyses suggest that all MEGs contribute to assembly and disassembly but to different extents, with MEG-3 and MEG-4 together making the most important contribution to assembly. The predicted pI (isoelectric point) of MEG-1 and MEG-2 in the unphosphorylated state is 6.63 and 6.04, compared to 9.74 and 9.33 for MEG-3 and MEG-4. We speculate that the intrinsic negative charge of MEG-1 and MEG-2, which is increased further by phosphorylation, favors a role for these proteins in disassembly. In contrast, the intrinsic weak positive charge of MEG-3 and MEG-4 allows them to contribute robustly to both disassembly and assembly, as they switch to negative and back to positive upon phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.</p><p>How are disassembly and assembly spatially segregated? At the onset of disassembly, MBK-2/DYRK is enriched in the anterior half of the zygote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pellettieri et al., 2003</xref>). If dephosphorylation by PP2A continuously antagonizes phosphorylation by MBK-2, even small changes in the level of MBK-2 levels along the anterior/posterior axis could bias MEG phosphorylation and P granule disassembly. Paradoxically, MBK-2/DYRK also accumulates in P granules, especially late in the first cell cycle as the granules continue to grow in the posterior cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pellettieri et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, DYRK3, the vertebrate homolog of MBK-2 that regulates stress granule dynamics, also localizes in the granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wippich et al., 2013</xref>). Drug inhibition studies suggest that DYRK3 enhances granule condensation when its kinase activity is inhibited and promotes granule dissolution when activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wippich et al., 2013</xref>). An attractive possibility is that, as P granules increase in size, MBK-2 activity decreases within the granule, perhaps due to the accumulation of an inhibitor. Interestingly, GFP::PPTR-1 also becomes enriched in P granules in zygotes (data not shown). There are also other asymmetries in the zygote cytoplasm that could bias P granule dynamics. GFP::MEG-3 forms an anterior-low/posterior-high gradient along the length of the zygote, and the RNA-binding protein MEX-5, which is required for full disassembly, forms an opposing gradient with higher levels in the anterior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schubert et al., 2000</xref>). Modeling studies have already demonstrated that, in principle, even weak gradients of phase transition regulators are sufficient to segregate P granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). It will be important to determine which asymmetry in the zygote cytoplasm is directly responsible for patterning P granule dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>MEG proteins contribute to an essential germ plasm activity that does not require P granules</title><p>Analysis of single, double, and triple <italic>meg</italic> combinations indicate that the <italic>meg</italic>s display synthetic sterility.

We conclude that the MEGs contribute redundantly to an activity essential for germ cell viability and/or proliferation.</p><p>The MEGs are components of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ plasm, the specialized maternal cytoplasm that segregates with the embryonic germline and specifies germ cell fate. Germ plasm is thought to have evolved independently several times during metazoan evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Extavour and Akam, 2003</xref>), and the molecules that initiate germ plasm and/or germ granule assembly in eggs are not conserved between different species, although some contain intrinsically disordered regions (e.g., Bucky Ball/Xvelo in vertebrates, MEGs in <italic>C. elegans</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marlow and Mullins, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bontems et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nijjar and Woodland, 2013</xref>). In all species examined, the germ plasm contains microscopically visible P granule-like structures that are enriched for conserved mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins required for germ cell development (e.g., <italic>nanos</italic> RNA and VASA-related helicases) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Voronina et al., 2011</xref>). Despite this conservation, our genetic analyses suggest that the MEGs' contribution to fertility is not linked to their effects on P granules, as also suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leacock and Reinke (2008</xref>). <italic>meg-1 meg-2</italic> embryos assemble embryonic P granules and <italic>meg-1 meg-3 meg-4</italic> embryos do not, yet both display the same fully penetrant Meg sterility phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leacock and Reinke, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>meg-3 meg-4</italic> embryos show the same dramatic defect in P granule assembly as <italic>meg-1 meg-3 meg-4 embryos</italic>, yet most <italic>meg-3 meg-4</italic> animals (70%) are fertile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We conclude that P granule assembly in the germ plasm of early embryos is neither required nor sufficient for fertility in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In contrast, the perinuclear P granules that form in primordial germ cells and their descendents are required for fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Updike and Strome, 2010</xref>). Consistent with that view, fertile <italic>meg</italic> mutants that do not assemble P granules in the germ plasm assemble perinuclear P granules de novo later in development. De novo assembly of perinuclear germ granules is also observed in animals that do not inherit germ plasm and specify their primordial germ cells through inductive mechanisms later in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Voronina et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Previously, our analyses of <italic>pptr-1</italic> mutants led us to conclude that asymmetric segregation of core P granule components is not essential to distinguish germline from soma in embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gallo et al., 2010</xref>). Our results here support this view and suggest that the essential activity of the germ plasm resides not in the assembly of P granules per se but in the MEG proteins that regulate granule assembly. How the maternally provided MEGs contribute to the health and proliferating potential of the PGCs will be an interesting area for future exploration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Worm handling, transgenics, CRISPR-mediated editing, RNAi, sterility counts</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> was cultured according to standard methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brenner, 1974</xref>).

Coverslips were pre-cleaned and coated with 2 μl of BD Cell-Tak (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and 2 μl of poly-D-lysine. In the time-lapse dithered mode, 21 z planes with a z step size 0.3 μm, spanning 6 μm, were acquired. Exposure time was 10 ms per plane per color with one exposure acquired in each color before proceeding to the next plane, for a total exposure time of 21 × 10 × 2 = 420 ms for each 3D stack. A 150 ms pause was added between each time point. Dithered-mode stacks were deconvolved in 3D using the Richardson–Lucy algorithm with experimentally measured point spread functions for each color. Granule cross-sectional area was calculated using ImageJ using maximum-projection images from two embryos.</p><p>3D-SIM mode images were acquired as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al.

Note that the granules shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> span only 7–10 z planes, corresponding to 1–1.75 s acquisition time. We confirmed that during this time, the granules were stationary on the scale of the SIM excitation pattern, allaying any concerns of motion-induced artifacts in the SIM reconstructions.</p><p>Photon counts were calculated according to the formula P(photo) = CF × (C − off)/Q(lambda), where CF is the conversion factor (electron/count), C is output count of the selected pixel, off is the background of the camera, and Q(lambda) is a curve based on the wavelength. Signal to noise ratio was calculated as sqrt(P).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Valerie Reinke, Sam Kapelle, Karen Bennett, the National Bioresource Center (Japan), and the CGC (USA) for strains and reagents, the Janelia Farm Visitors Program for hosting Jenn Wang, and Cliff Brangwynne and the Seydoux lab for discussions.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 4 reviewers, one of whom has agreed to be identified: Roy Parker (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission. As you will see, all felt that the work was potentially quite interesting but all also raise a number of points that need to be dealt with via revision. In particular all of the reviewers question the conclusion that the MEG proteins serve as a scaffold for P granules. It is essential that you provide convincing evidence in support of this conclusion. Please address this issue as well as the other concerns of the reviewers as thoroughly as possible.</p><p>Although we ordinarily collate the reviews into a single narrative, the reviewers felt that you would benefit by a full disclosure of their comments:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript addresses the mechanisms by which P-granules (maternal mRNA-protein assemblies in <italic>C. elegans</italic>) assemble and disassemble in a temporal and spatially regulated manner. The main contribution of the work is to demonstrate that a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle of the Meg1-4 proteins plays a role in modulating the assembly and disassembly of P-granules. The kinase and phosphatase for this process are identified (building on earlier genetics) and the data generally supports the authors' conclusions, although there are some issues as detailed below.</p><p>This review is from Roy Parker and I would be happy to directly clarify the comments for the authors if desired.</p><p>A major point of the manuscript (in title and abstract) is that the Meg proteins form a scaffold that modulates P-granule assembly/disassembly. While it is clear that Meg proteins modulate P-granule assembly/disassembly in a phosphorylation dependent manner, the evidence that they form a scaffold is solely that by microscopy they are dynamic and non-uniform within P-granules. Although they could form a scaffold, the current evidence is also open to other interpretations. I suggest they a) change the tone of the manuscript to emphasize that how the Meg proteins affect P-granule structurally is not yet known, and b) remove the scaffold conclusion from the title and the abstract. Alternatively, if the authors want to argue for a scaffolding function per se, they would need additional data to support such a conclusion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The Wang et. al. paper advances our understanding of regulation of P granule dynamics and partitioning by a kinase, a phosphatase, and cycles of substrate phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Most of the players have been previously described: MBK-2 kinase is needed for P granule disassembly, PP2A phosphatase (PPTR-1, 2) is needed for P granule assembly/stability, and MEG-1 and MEG-2 are needed for P granule segregation in early embryos and for fertility. By screening for proteins that interact with PPTR-1 in yeast 2-hybrid, Wang et al. additionally identified GEI-11/MEG-3 and MEG-4. They showed that a) MEG-1,3,4 directly interact with PPTR-1,2 and also with the P granule component PGL-1, b) MEG-1 and MEG-3 are phosphorylated by MBK-2 in vitro, c) MEG-1 and MEG-3 are phospho-proteins in vivo and the abundance of their phosphorylated forms is influenced by MBK-2 and PPTR-1. Analysis of double and triple mutants showed that MBK-2 is epistatic to PPTR-1, 2, and the MEGs are epistatic to both. MEG-3, 4 function redundantly to promote P granule assembly. The model is that MBK-2 and MEG phosphorylation promote P granule disassembly in the anterior cytoplasm, and PPTR-1, 2 and MEG dephosphorylation promote P granule assembly in the posterior cytoplasm destined for the germline blastomeres. The MEG proteins are predicted to be largely disordered and based on high resolution imaging of MEG-3 in live embryos using lattice light sheet microscopy, the authors propose the MEGs form a scaffold that surrounds and penetrates the P granules and that regulates P granule dynamics.</p><p>This is an impressive “stitch it all together” paper. The genetics are especially compelling. The biochemistry contributes important molecular details, but some of it needs strengthening. The lattice light sheet microscopy images in the figures convey that P granules are heterogeneous and dynamic, and the movies support that MEG-3 forms ribbon-like structures around each granule.

A more appropriate conclusion would be that P granules ARE required for fertility in adults, but that assembly of large P granules in early embryos is not required to specify the primordial germ cells, similar to their conclusions for pptr-1.

This study reveals that the phosphorylation state of the proteins MEG-1 and MEG-3 is regulated by activity of MBK-2, a kinase homologous to the DYRK kinase shown to regulate stress granule assembly, and the phosphatase PPTR-1/2 PP2A. The authors perform a detailed molecular mechanistic analysis using mutants and/or RNAi, revealing important insights into the epistastic relationships governing P granule assembly. Moreover, the authors utilize a novel super-resolution imaging technique to gain insights into the molecular distribution within P granules. This is an interesting and important study that makes an important contribution to our molecular understanding of P granule assembly, and should therefore definitely be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Despite my enthusiasm for much of the work in this paper, I nevertheless have a problem with what I think are over-interpretations of the data, particularly the imaging data.</p><p>One of the major concerns I have can be seen clearly in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref> (and other movies/images). There is a fair amount of “structure” apparent within the P granules. This is particularly obvious in the largest granule at the center of the image, which looks a bit like popcorn. There is apparently structure within the granules, which exists on a characteristic length scale of ∼200 nm. The problem is that if one looks at regions of the cytoplasm that does not contain granules, there is also structure on this length scale. Why is that? The mottled pattern seen both in granules and in the cytoplasm is quite reminiscent of the patterns one gets after running e.g. a Gaussian bandpass filter through unstructured white noise images, or after running deconvolution algorithms on unstructured images (I just did this for a random, white noise image and the result of applying a Gaussian bandpass filter looks, qualitatively, very similar to the mottled patterns you show; however, I can't seem to figure out how to upload an image with this review...). This is very relevant because for at least some of the light sheet images shown, there is a deconvolution algorithm being employed, where care needs to be taken to avoid artifacts. Do you see structure like that seen in the P granules when you use this technique to image a homogenous solution of dye? If you use this technique to image micron-sized fluorescent spherical particles, for which the embedded dye is presumably uniformly distributed within the particle, does it come out looking like popcorn? (is this also true if the particle is “pre-bleached” so that the fluorophores density is comparable to what one might expect for an average GFP density in the granule?). For these reasons, it is difficult for me to put any weight on arguments made about both the internal structure of the granules, and the idea that they are highly non-spherical on these length scales. Since the authors make such a big deal about the non-homogenity of the granules (e.g. last sentence of the abstract), this seems important to nail down.</p><p>As far as I can tell from the movies shown, the mottled patterns are highly dynamic, as one would expect if they were random intensity distributions that were amplified by the imaging technique and post-processing. Together with the observation that the MEG “scaffold” does not form in pgl-1/pgl-3 zygotes, the case for referring to this as a “scaffold”, which implies a static structure on which the rest of the P granule components hang, is a bit of a weak proposition.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>This manuscript provides new insight into the process of P granule assembly and disassembly by identifying a set of proteins, the MEGs, whose phosphorylation and dephosphorylation cycle may explain the assembly and disassembly of P granules in the oocyte and early stages of embryonic development. The work is intriguing and most of the data presented are convincing, but the study seems incomplete in several respects. First, it is not clear why the authors chose to analyze some mutants or combinations of mutants and not others. For example, why is the meg-4 mutant omitted? In the analysis of triple mutants, why isn't the phenotype of meg-1/2/3 or meg-2/3/4 shown? The localization analysis is one of the strengths of the paper but is limited to MEG-3 protein; the conclusions would be greatly enhanced by the analysis of other MEGs and, ideally, a combination of two different MEGs differentially labeled with GFP and Cherry. Second, the paper seems to stop short of a critical experiment, analyzing the dynamics of MEG-3 (or other MEG protein) in mbk-2 and pptr-1 mutants or even the distribution in wildtype animals during disassembly. A second major concern is that meg-3 meg-4 mutant animals are fertile despite the fact P1 has very few P granules and none are apparent in P4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), which makes me question the importance of these genes and the P granule assembly process.</p><p>Additional issues:</p><p>1) Protein-protein interactions are only demonstrated in vitro; the data would be significantly strengthened by demonstration of in vivo interactions through co-IP experiments.</p><p>2) The Phos-tag gel data are not particularly convincing. The authors say that they detected “one primary species for both GFP:MEG1 and GFP:MEG3 and several higher mw species that did not resolve well into bands.” These are not at all apparent on the gels shown (or at least there are no higher mw species that appear different between wt and pptr-1 or mbk-2), although a single higher mw isoform of GFP:MEG-3 is visible in the supplemental figure. Also, treatment of MEG-3 by AP in both the mbk-2 mutant, where presumably the protein is not phosphorylated, results in an increase in the intensity of the band comparable to that in the wt. This would suggest that the protein is primarily phosphorylated by one or more kinases other than mbk-2 but the authors seem to ignore this.</p><p>3) What are the data that allow the conclusion that the MEGs are scaffolds?

While it is clear that Meg proteins modulate P-granule assembly/disassembly in a phosphorylation dependent manner, the evidence that they form a scaffold is solely that by microscopy they are dynamic and non-uniform within P-granules. Although they could form a scaffold, the current evidence is also open to other interpretations. I suggest they a) change the tone of the manuscript to emphasize that how the Meg proteins affect P-granule structurally is not yet known, and b) remove the scaffold conclusion from the title and the abstract.

They aren't sufficient for P granule assembly and it seems like an over interpretation of the localization data</italic>.</p><p>We agree and now only mention the scaffold idea as a working hypothesis in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
