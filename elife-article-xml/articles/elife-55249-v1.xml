the inner ear are selectively vulnerable to numerous genetic and environmental insults. In mammals, hair cells lack regenerative capacity, and their death leads to permanent hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction. Their paucity and inaccessibility has limited the search for otoprotective and regenerative strategies. Growing hair cells in vitro would provide a route to overcome this experimental bottleneck. We report a combination of four transcription factors (<italic>Six1, Atoh1, Pou4f3</italic>, and <italic>Gfi1</italic>) that can convert mouse embryonic fibroblasts, adult tail-tip fibroblasts and postnatal supporting cells into induced hair cell-like cells (iHCs). iHCs exhibit hair cell-like morphology, transcriptomic and epigenetic profiles, electrophysiological properties, mechanosensory channel expression, and vulnerability to ototoxin in a high-content phenotypic screening system. Thus, direct reprogramming provides a platform to identify causes and treatments for hair cell loss, and may help identify future gene therapy approaches for restoring hearing.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Worldwide, hearing loss is the most common loss of sensation. Most cases of hearing loss are due to the death of specialized hair cells found deep inside the ear. These hair cells convert sounds into nerve impulses which can be understood by the brain. Hair cells naturally degrade as part of aging and can be damaged by other factors including loud noises, and otherwise therapeutic drugs, such as those used in chemotherapy for cancer. In humans and other mammals, once hair cells are lost they cannot be replaced.</p><p>Hair cells have often been studied using mice, but the small number of hair cells in their ears, and their location deep inside the skull, makes it particularly difficult to study them in this way. Scientists are seeking ways to grow hair cells in the laboratory to make it easier to understand how they work and the factors that contribute to their damage and loss. Different cell types in the body are formed in response to specific combinations of biological signals. Currently, scientists do not have an efficient way to grow hair cells in the laboratory, because the correct signals needed to create them are not known.</p><p>Menendez et al. have now identified four proteins which, when activated, convert fibroblasts, a common type of cell, into hair cells similar to those in the ear. These proteins are called Six1, Atoh1, Pou4f3 and Gfi1. Menendez et al. termed the resulting cells induced hair cells, or iHCs for short, and analyzed these cells to identify those characteristics that are similar to normal hair cells, as well as their differences. Importantly, the iHCs were found to be damaged by the same chemicals that specifically harm normal hair cells, suggesting they are useful test subjects.</p><p>The ability to create hair cells in the laboratory using more easily available cells has many uses. These cells can help to understand the normal function of hair cells and how they become damaged. They can also be used to test new drugs to assess their success in preventing or reversing hearing loss. These findings may also lead to genetic solutions to curing hearing loss.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>inner ear</kwd><kwd>reprogramming</kwd><kwd>sensory hair cell</kwd><kwd>screening</kwd><kwd>ototoxin</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC015530</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ichida</surname><given-names>Justin</given-names></name><name><surname>Segil</surname><given-names>Neil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008786</institution-id><institution>Keck School of Medicine of USC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ichida</surname><given-names>Justin</given-names></name><name><surname>Segil</surname><given-names>Neil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00NS077435</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ichida</surname><given-names>Justin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS097850</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ichida</surname><given-names>Justin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100003194</institution-id><institution>New York Stem Cell Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>New York Stem Cell Foundation-Robertson Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ichida</surname><given-names>Justin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Merkin Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Richard N.

Loss of sensory hair cells of the inner ear is the primary cause of sensorineural hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bohne and Harding, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hinojosa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Géléoc and Holt, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Wong and Ryan, 2015</xref>). The highly structured sensory epithelium of the inner ear, known as the organ of Corti, develops from a post-mitotic, pro-sensory domain established in the developing cochlear duct between embryonic days E12.5 and E14.5 in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Ruben and Sidman, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Lowenheim et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chen and Segil, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Matei et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lee et al., 2006</xref>). These post-mitotic cells are the progenitors for sensory hair cells and their adjacent supporting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fekete et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kelley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Driver et al., 2013</xref>). Sensory hair cells function as the essential mechanoreceptors that convert sound vibrations into electrical signals, which are then transmitted to the brain via the spiral ganglion neurons that innervate the hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Géléoc and Holt, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Sensory hair cells are located in both the auditory and vestibular portions of the inner ear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The hair cells within the organ of Corti are precisely arranged into one row of inner hair cells and three rows of outer hair cells, interdigitating with a variety of supporting cells; inner border, inner phalangeal, pillar cells, Deiters’ cells and Hensen’s cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Hair cells are susceptible to degeneration by a variety of genetic mutations and environmental stressors, such as exposure to loud noise, ototoxic drugs including cancer chemotherapy and aminoglycoside antibiotics, aging and over 200 known syndromic and non-syndromic genetic loci conferring predispositions to hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Matsui et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cheng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bodmer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Langer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atkinson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Wong and Ryan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Vaisbuch and Santa Maria, 2018</xref>).

In contrast, non-mammalian species, such as birds and reptiles, are able to spontaneously regenerate lost hair cells from existing supporting cells, leading to full functional recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Corwin and Cotanche, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Ryals and Rubel, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Stone and Cotanche, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brignull et al., 2009</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overexpression of Six1, Atoh1, Pou4f3 and Gfi1 is capable of activating hair cell markers in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of the mouse inner ear shows the vestibular system (green) and the cochlea of the auditory system (red).

However, these elegant approaches require three-dimensional culture conditions that complicate high-throughput studies, for instance screening for otoprotectants. In contrast to morphogen-based directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, transcription factor (TF) -mediated lineage conversion of somatic cells enables the rapid production of neurons and other cell types in microtiter plates with ≥96 wells, allowing the reproducibility and homogeneity required for high-throughput phenotypic screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Babos et al., 2019</xref>).

The MEFs showed gross electrophysiological properties that did not overlap with that of primary hair cells or induced hair cells (data not shown). The mean resting potentials for primary hair cells, cocultured iHCs, and monolayer-cultured iHCs were −58.6 mV (± 6.9), –54.8 mV (± 4.1), and −50.8 mV (± 2.4), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

The input resistances were measured to infer the total ion channel composition of the cell. Higher input resistance values indicate the cell may have fewer ion channels to allow current to flow in and out of the plasma membrane. The input resistance was highest in monolayer-cultured iHCs (3878 ± 557 MΩ). However, the input resistance of co-cultured iHCs (1432 ± 327 MΩ) was comparable to that of primary hair cells (1950 ± 755 MΩ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Lastly, the capacitance, which can be used to infer the surface area of the cell, was highest in primary hair cells (8.4 ± 3.1 pF), followed by co-cultured iHCs (5.6 ± 2.2 pF) and then monolayer-cultured iHCs (4.2 ± 1.2 pF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we performed voltage-clamp to measure the magnitude and time dependent activity of the whole-cell currents in primary hair cells, co-cultured iHCs and monolayer-cultured iHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In response to the applied voltage, both primary hair cells and iHCs produced positive-outward currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). However, the monolayer-cultured iHCs produced relatively small whole-cell currents that rapidly inactivated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In contrast, primary hair cells and co-cultured iHCs displayed robust outward currents that more slowly inactivated over the course of the protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). We measured the steady-state outward current as a function of the voltage-clamp potential and normalized the current magnitude by the cell’s capacitance to analyze current densities. Monolayer-cultured iHCs showed small current densities while the co-cultured iHCs and primary hair cells displayed overlapping magnitudes of voltage-dependent current densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>A prominent voltage-clamp feature in primary hair cells is a delayed onset of a slow-activating outward current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Housley and Ashmore, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Marcotti and Kros, 1999</xref>). In order to measure the kinetic properties of this slow-activating outward current, we fit a single exponential at the onset of the current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) to compare the mean time constants when the cells were clamped from −120 mV to 70 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). The delayed onset current of monolayer-cultured iHCs displayed fast time constants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). In contrast, the co-cultured iHCs and primary hair cells showed similarly longer time constants, indicating that their outward currents have similar activation kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Together, these electrophysiological data suggest that both monolayer and co-cultured iHCs possess voltage dependent currents, however, when iHCs are co-cultured with dissociated organ of Corti, their size, passive membrane properties and ion channel function are more similar to those of primary hair cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Induced hair cells possess rudimentary mechanotransduction properties</title><p>Primary sensory hair cells acquire distinct functional properties early in development in order to properly convert mechanical sound waves into neurotransmitter signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Wu et al., 2017</xref>).

The current study is an effort to alleviate this problem through the use of direct lineage reprogramming of somatic cells to generate the large numbers of induced hair cells needed for high-throughput screening. To this end, we have succeeded in identifying a cocktail of transcription factors, <italic>Six1, Atoh1, Pou4f3</italic>, and <italic>Gfi1</italic> (SAPG), that is able to reprogram somatic cells to a sensory hair cell-like fate using alternately, mouse embryonic fibroblasts, adult tail tip fibroblasts, and postnatal day eight supporting cells. The reprogramming efficiency using this SAPG cocktail (35%) is similar and in some cases higher than the best reprogramming strategies for other cell types such as cardiomyocytes with 20% efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ieda et al., 2010</xref>) and motor neurons with 10–40% efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ichida et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Babos et al., 2019</xref>). With this method, we show that the reprogrammed hair cells are transcriptionally and epigenetically similar to perinatal primary cochlear hair cells, including morphology, physiology, and susceptibility to ototoxic agents, specifically gentamicin. We also demonstrate a method for high-throughput screening, that in the future will allow the discovery of new otoprotectants, as well as gene-therapy/regenerative medicine approaches to treat hearing loss.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Reprogramming efficiency and the level of maturity of iHCs</title><p>As confirmation of the importance of the four transcription factors identified in our unbiased reprogramming investigation, three of the four transcription factors, <italic>Atoh1, Pou4f3</italic>, and <italic>Gfi1</italic>, were previously used to induce a hair cell like-fate from mouse ES cells that had been partially differentiated into ectodermal organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Costa et al., 2015</xref>). In our hands, these factors are able to activate reporter expression in MEFs from <italic>Atoh1-</italic>nGFP mice, but yield a mixed population in which many GFP-positive cells failed to upregulate the hair cell markers MyosinVIIa and Parvalbumin. We hypothesize that the addition of <italic>Six1</italic> increases reprogramming efficiency by pushing cells towards the sensory ectodermal lineage. <italic>Six1</italic> has been reported previously to promote competency and progenitor-like state, as well as being an essential determinant of early sensory inner ear lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">Zheng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Ozaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). The expression gradient of <italic>Six1</italic> in the developing sensory epithelium precedes the activation of <italic>Atoh1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Six1</italic> directly targets the <italic>Atoh1</italic> autoregulatory enhancer, as well as other essential hair cell enhancers for <italic>Pou4f3</italic> and <italic>Gfi1</italic>, with an increase in <italic>Six1</italic> occupancy as hair cells differentiate with in the sensory epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, <italic>Six1</italic> has been shown to play a role in the maturation of hair cells by regulating key genes involved in the establishment of planar cell polarity and hair-bundle orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Li et al., 2020</xref>). These studies support our findings that, in addition to <italic>Atoh1, Pou4f3</italic> and <italic>Gfi1</italic>, <italic>Six1</italic> is an important upstream transcription factor in establishing a hair cell-specific gene expression program in our direct reprogramming.</p><p>At perinatal times, only modest differences in gene expression are able to distinguish inner and outer hair cells of the cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Liu et al., 2014b</xref>), as well as vestibular vs. cochlear hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Burns et al., 2015</xref>). The transcriptional profiles of postnatal day one cochlear hair cells and utricular hair cells are very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This time point represents an immature hair cell, and the transcriptional profiles are known to change as the hair cells mature and acquire subtype specificity and functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Burns et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib165">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hoa et al., 2020</xref>). As a result of comparing iHCs to postnatal day one primary hair cells, we are unable to statistically classify iHCs as being more similar to one or another hair cell type based on the bulk RNA sequencing. While many of the specialized gene characteristics of the cochlear hair cells are clearly upregulated during reprogramming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), the iHCs fail to activate other important genes essential for the functional maturation of the sensory receptors in the cochlea, such as <italic>Prestin</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Liberman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bardhan et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The imperfections of iHC reprogramming could have several causes. First, as noted, we could be lacking additional, hair cell-type transcription factors to drive cells to a more mature state. For example, the transcription factor Zfp503 identified in the initial set of 16 factors for reprogramming, does not get activated in response to the SAPG reprogramming cocktail. We saw that the addition of Zfp503 to the core group SAPG negatively impacted the efficiency of activation of the <italic>Atoh1</italic>-nGFP reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>), however it remains to be investigated whether the addition of Zfp503 can confer a more mature induced hair cell phenotype. Zfp503 is highly expressed in postnatal day one cochlear hair cells, but not in utricular hair cells, suggesting it could play an important role in conferring subtype specificity in the iHC reprogramming. Additional bioinformatic analysis has shown that some of the relatively small group of distal regulatory elements that are present in P1 hair cells, but fail to open in iHCs, associate with hair cell-specific genes that also fail to be robustly expressed during reprogramming (data not shown). This further suggests additional factors, perhaps such as Gata3, that may improve the quality and maturity of the iHCs. In addition, transcriptional characterization of older hair cells will allow for identification of additional TFs, which may improve the reprogramming strategy. Second, our current strategy relies on constitutive expression of the reprogramming factors, while continuous expression of <italic>Atoh1</italic> is known to halt hair cell maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Liu et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Liu et al., 2014a</xref>). We plan to overcome this limitation by using inducible gene expression constructs to drive reprogramming in the future. Finally, lack of organ-specific context in vitro may not provide additional signals for maturation. In fact, we demonstrate that iHCs co-cultured with dissociated organ of Corti cells, promoted morphological and electrophysiological maturation of iHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This functional maturation may be mediated, at least in part, by improved trafficking and assembly of ion channel subunits conferred by the co-cultures. We plan to examine the transcriptional profile changes that occur in iHCs after co-culture in order to understand what genes may be contributing to the morphological and functional maturation.</p><p>As has been documented in other reprogramming experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Wapinski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Wapinski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Rhee et al., 2017</xref>), the chromatin landscape was also drastically remodeled during reprogramming of MEFs to a hair cell-like state, readily opening de novo distal elements to change their chromatin to resemble P1 cochlear hair cells. Similar to the RNA sequencing results, there is a residual MEF signature of the chromatin landscape, and the failure to close down these chromatin regions may be acting as a barrier for more efficient and/or faithful reprogramming. In addition, the opening of a large number of peaks inappropriately (peaks that occur in neither MEFs of primary P1 hair cells) suggests that our cocktail may lack a transcriptional repressor, and that these inappropriately open distal elements may provide some explanation for the low level of inappropriate gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>).</p><p>Despite these pitfalls, common to most if not all reprogramming strategies published to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ieda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Son et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Treutlein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kaminski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Van Pham et al., 2017</xref>), induced hair cells are highly similar to their primary counterparts on transcriptional and epigenetic levels, as well as functional levels.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Direct reprogramming as a strategy for gene therapy and identification of genetic causes of hearing loss</title><p>Recently the use of Anc80-based adeno associated vectors made inner ear gene delivery feasible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Suzuki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Tao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Tan et al., 2019</xref>).

Supernatants from the transfected cells were collected at 24 hr and 48 hr after medium replacement, filtered through 0.45 um filters and used immediately if generated from Plat-E or concentrated using Lenti-X concentrator (Clontech) and stored at −80°C if generated from HEK293T.</p><p>MEFs were transduced by mixing virus with MEF media. The virus containing media was removed from the MEFs after 24 hr and replaced with MEF media. The next day, medium was switched to hair cell medium (HCM: DMEM/F-12 (supplier), N2 and B27 supplements (supplier), EGF (2.5 ng/ml), and FGF (5 ng/ml)).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>MEF isolation</title><p>Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were obtained from E13-14 embryos taking care to exclude contamination with other Atoh1 expressing tissues (kidney, brain, spinal cord and webbing between digits). Tissue was minced with a razor blade and enzymatically dissociated with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 30 min at 37°C. Trypsinization was quenched by addition of MEF media (previously described). The isolated cells were centrifuged (800 g for 10 min) and the pellet was resuspended in MEF media before plating onto gelatin coated T75 tissue culture flasks. We found that plating two embryos per T75 gave optimal survival post-dissection. The MEFs were cultured until confluency was reached and then cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen using freezing media (1:1 mixture of MEF media and Freezing media (FM; 80% fetal bovine serum and 20% DMSO)). MEFs were used without further passaging for reprogramming experiments. All cells were tested for mycoplasma contamination and came back negative.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>TTF isolation</title><p>Tail tip fibroblasts (TTFs) were obtained from 6 month old adult Atoh1-nGFP transgenic mice. The tail was harvested from the sacrificed mouse by removing the skin and dissecting the remaining tail tissue into small segments. After plating on gelatin coated dishes, the tissue adhered to the dish and the expanding cells eventually covered the dish. The TTFs were harvested for reprogramming by simply moving the segments to a new dish and then collecting the remaining adherent cells. TTFs were cultured in DMEM with 40% fetal bovine serum. TTFs were frozen in liquid nitrogen and used without further passaging for reprogramming experiments. All cells were tested for mycoplasma contamination and came back negative.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Merkel cell isolation</title><p>Skin was obtained from postnatal day 1 (P1) mice. Skin was incubated overnight at 4°C in Accutase. The epithelium (epidermis and hair follicles) was separated from the underlying dermis with forceps and the epidermal cells were dissociated with trypsin for 10 min at 37°C then dissociated to single cell suspension. The freshly isolated epidermal cell suspension was then FACS purified to sort for <italic>Atoh1</italic>-nGFP positive Merkel cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Gut secretory cell isolation</title><p>Small intestines were obtained from adult mice. Intestinal villi were scraped away, crypt epithelium was collected by shaking in 5 mM EDTA for 50 min at four degrees Celsius, and single cell suspensions were prepared by digestion in 4x TrypLE (Invitrogen) for 50 min at 37°C.

The cells were dissociated to a single cell suspension and plated onto laminin coated tissue culture plates or cover slips.</p><p>The primary cultures from Lfng-CreERt2::Rosa26<sup>tdTomato</sup> transgenic mice were done at postnatal day 8 (P8). Lfng-CreERt2::Rosa26<sup>tdTomato</sup> transgenic mice were injected with tamoxifen at postnatal day three for lineage tracing of the Lfng+ supporting cell population. The organs of Corti were harvested at P8, dissociated to single cell suspension in HCM and the reprogramming factors were added to the cell suspension. The cells were then plated onto laminin coated tissue culture treated cover slips. The virus containing media was replaced after 24 hr with fresh HCM.</p><p>All primary cultures were plated using ROCK Inhibitor (Y-27632) (Sigma-Aldrich) for the first 24 hr to help promote survival.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Co-culture of iHCs</title><p>Induced hair cells were FACS purified to obtain the <italic>Atoh1</italic>-nGFP positive cells and collected in HCM. The primary organ of Corti was dissected from wild type mice at E13.5 and enzymatically dissociated to a single cell suspension containing primary hair cells, primary supporting cells and a portion of the surrounding periotic mesenchmye. The iHCs were then mixed with the dissociated organs of Corti. The ratio of iHC to cells of the organ of Corti was kept at about 1:33. This ratio was determined from the fact that the primary organ of Corti contains approximately 3000 hair cells and upon dissociation gives approximately 100,000 total cells. Co-cultures were grown on tissue culture treated coverslips in wells of 24 well plates that had been coated with a 20 ul drop of matrigel (10% in HCM) at the center of the coverslip. The co-culture cell suspension was plated as 30 ul drops (2,500–3,000 cells per ul) in the center of the matrigel coated drop on the cover slip. 12–24 hr after plating the drops the well was flooded with 500 ul of HCM. All cocultures were maintained in HCM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Immunostaining</title><p>Cells for staining were washed with PBS and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min at room temperature.

For quantification of reprogramming efficiency in adherent cultures, images were acquired at 10x using the Molecular Devices ImageExpress. The images were either processed manually using ImageJ software and the Cell Counter plug in or automatically using SVCell RS (described below). Counts are represented as reprogramming efficiency (percent of <italic>Atoh1</italic>-nGFP+ cells per well of 5000 MEFs infected).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>iHC detection and counting method</title><p>Automated cell counting used thresholds for size, intensity and roundness of the <italic>Atoh1-</italic>nGFP signal. The imaging was done at 10x. For each time frame, the customized time-lapse nuclei count recipe of SVCell RS is applied to first reduce noise with image smoothing. Objects are detected by performing background removal followed by adaptive thresholding. A size filtering is then applied to remove objects that are either too large or too small. The count of remaining objects is measured for the time point. Batch processing is available for applying the recipe to multiple time-lapse images and saving results. To ensure the reliability of the automated counting a comparison was done of 20 wells counted both manually and automatically (p=0.53).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Flow cytometry preparations</title><p>Primary hair cells were harvested from <italic>Atoh1</italic>-nGFP transgenic mice. The cochleas were incubated in 0.25% trypsin for 8 min and gently triturated to single cell suspension.

The first preparation was iHCs in the monolayer culture of MEFs at D14-15 post infection with SAPG. The second preparation was iHCs FACS purified and replated with dissociated wild type organ of Corti. The third preparation was postnatal day one primary hair cells from the dissociated transgenic <italic>Atoh1</italic>-nGFP organ of Corti. Preparations were viewed at X630 using a Zeiss Axios Examiner D1 microscope fitted with Zeiss W Plan-Aprochromat optics.

Recording and cleaning pipettes were fabricated using filamented borosilicate glass. Pipettes were fired polished to yield an access resistance between 4–8 MΩ. Each recording pipette was covered in a layer of parafilm to reduce pipette capacitance. Recording pipettes were filled with standard internal solution. The contents of the standard internal solution are (in mM): 135 KCl, 3.5 MgCl2, 3 Na2ATP, 5 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 0.1 CaCl2, 0.1 Li-GTP, and titrated with 1M KOH to a pH of 7.35 and an osmolarity of about 300 mmol/kg. The voltage clamp protocol was performed by holding the cell at −60 mV followed by a stimulus of voltage steps (−120 to +70 mV, by intervals of 10 mV).

The mixture contained 4.4mls of 50 mg/ml gentamicin (GT) with 0.6mls of 2 mg/ml Texas Red (TR) to produce approximately 300:1 molar ratio of GT:GTTR. A high ratio of gentamicin ensures a minimum of unbound Texas Red molecules. The molecular weight of GT is 477.6 g/mol and the molecular weight of TR is 816.94 g/mol. The GTTR was made at a stock concentration of 100 mM. The cells were incubated with HCM containing 0.5 mM or 1 mM GTTR for three hours.

Cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kathryn Cheah as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This exciting study identifies a combination of 4 transcription factors (<italic>Six1</italic>, <italic>Atoh1</italic>, <italic>Pou4f3</italic> and <italic>Gfi1</italic>) to directly reprogram several different types of somatic cells into hair cell-like cells (iHCs). Such in vitro generation of Hair Cells allows screening for otoprotective and regenerative strategies. Previous studies showed that hair cells can be generated from murine pluripotent stem cells either by directed differentiation, human embryonic stem cells or by a combination of directed differentiation to a placodal cell type followed by transcription factor induction. The disadvantage of these techniques is that they require 3D culture conditions which makes screening challenging. The most impressive feature of the paper is a series of assessments of the iHCs compared to the normal HCs. The transcriptomic and epigenetic profiles of iHCs were well characterized, which distinguishes this work from other, less thorough, studies on new har cell induction in vitro. In addition to the fact that the strategy developed by the authors has a high reprogramming efficiency and is already useful for screening purposes the authors frankly discuss any shortcomings of this reprogramming strategy and how they could be overcome. Overall, the manuscript is well-written and logically conveys the dataset. Below are a list of concerns that should be addressed through discussion or experimentation prior to publication:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The following comments should be addressed by further experimentation or analysis:</p><p>1) It should be evaluated, based on published data, whether the 16 transcription factors initially identified are also expressed by vestibular hair cells. A comparison of iHCs with cochlear hair cells is appropriate based on the rationale presented in the study, but further comparison with vestibular hair cells might reveal an even higher level of similarity.</p><p>2) FM dye uptake assay: The images in Figure 6C are not entirely convincing. For instance, it would aid with the interpretation to see FM uptake in a native hair cell vs. iHCs in this co-culture setup.</p><p>3) The signature genes for Merkel Cells omit some classic markers, such as <italic>Sox2</italic>, Isl1, Krt20. Is it possible that this dataset contains a mixture of keratinocytes and Merkel cells?</p><p>The following comments should be discussed:</p><p>1) A powerful experiment that would suggest translatability would be to add the cocktail to rodent utricle cultures treated with an aminoglycoside. Have the authors already attempted this experiment? If yes, the results should be discussed.</p><p>2) Postnatal day 8 (P8) cochlear supporting cells: The author explain that supporting cells became an interesting target to drive HC differentiation, but they do not clearly explain why they chose P8 for the viral transduction experiment. The HC differentiation rate is actually quite promising (71%). It would be interesting to see whether reprograming P14 SCs can achieve a similar efficiency. Have the authors already attempted this experiment? If yes, the results should be discussed.</p><p>3) <italic>Atoh1</italic>-GFP+ postnatal day 1 (P1) cochlear hair cells were sorted and used to identify 16 transcription factors. How about later postnatal stages of cochlear hair cell maturation? Would that transcriptional information be helpful to make more mature/functional hair cells?</p><p>On the other hand, identifying transcription factors in <italic>atoh1</italic>+ cells assumes that <italic>atoh1</italic> is the very first hair cell specifying transcription factor.

A comparison of iHCs with cochlear hair cells is appropriate based on the rationale presented in the study, but further comparison with vestibular hair cells might reveal an even higher level of similarity.</p></disp-quote><p>The 16 transcription factors initially identified are all expressed by both P1 cochlear and utricular hair cells, with the exception of Zfp503. The transcription factor Zfp503 is only expressed in the cochlear hair cells. Based on this expression, the lack of Zfp503 in the iHCs may suggest that the lack of this transcription factor is making them more vestibular in nature, however as supported by the PCA plot (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A), the iHCs are not more similar to P1 cHCs or P1 uHCs, at a bulk transcriptional level. Future single cell analysis, including the addition of Zfp503 and other transcription factors to our reprogramming cocktail, will better determine the necessary components in the differentiation of specified hair cell types from these two tissues, as well as those components that are needed for maturation of specific hair cell subtypes.</p><p>A figure showing the comparison of iHCs to P1 primary cochlear hair cells and P1 utricular hair cells by PCA analysis, as well as a figure showing the expression levels of the 12 additional reprogramming transcription factors tested alongside <italic>Six1</italic>, <italic>Atoh1</italic>, <italic>Pou4f3</italic> and <italic>Gfi1</italic> has been added to Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, D and discussed in the Results (subsection “Induced Hair Cells resemble primary juvenile mouse hair cells transcriptionally”) and the Discussion (subsection “Reprogramming efficiency and the level of maturity of iHCs”). The expression bar graphs (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and Figure 2D) are now represented in Rlog counts instead of FPKM, as we now believe that FPKM from gene level quantification is complicated by single-end versus paired-end sequencing and differences in library preparation. We have now included the expression level of the 12 additional reprogramming factors as Rlog counts instead (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D). The data added to the supplementary figure indicates the similarity of iHCs to the two primary hair cell types. By noting the variance in the PCA, it is clear that induced hair cells are not more like one than the other at this stage of maturation.</p><p>We thank our reviewer for suggesting we include these data and explanation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) FM dye uptake assay: The images in Figure 6C are not entirely convincing. For instance, it would aid with the interpretation to see FM uptake in a native hair cell vs. iHCs in this co-culture setup.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, and while our data clearly indicate a rapid and selective uptake of FM4-64 into reprogrammed hair cells, we acknowledge that the pictures are not optimal. The challenge has been the accumulation of cell debris in the monolayer culture of mouse embryonic fibroblasts from which the induced hair cells are derived. Both the live nuclear dye (NucBlue), and the FM4-64, rapidly label the debris associated with these cultures. We undertook to redo these experiments in the context of our co-cultures, with the hope that induced hair cells could be monitored alongside primary hair cells embedded in the epithelial islands that form (Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1). Unfortunately, these experiments were interrupted by the Corona virus shutdown just as we were beginning to set up the cultures.</p><p>In lieu of new experiments, we have gone back to the original images for Figure 6C, and using ImageJ, we cropped a smaller area and filtered the images on the “minimum background intensity”. This filter measures the minimum signal intensity found in the image and applies the filter to remove the minimum signal across the entire image. This modification step was used uniformly on all channels to ensure that the filtering was not changing the image in a biased way. We were also able to include an image of the same FM treatment, performed on dissociated primary hair cells from P1 transgenic mice. The primary hair cells express the <italic>Atoh1</italic>::nGFP reporter and accumulate the FM dye in the same time frame (after a 30 second treatment) as the induced hair cells. The same scale of 25µm and the same minimum background intensity filter was used in the iHC image and the primary HC image. We feel that this change improves the quality of our images, and hope that the reviewers find these changes sufficient to clearly demonstrate the rapid uptake of dye in induced hair cells.</p><p>We have taken this opportunity to reorganize Figure 6. The portions of text corresponding to the FM images have been moved to the subsection “Induced hair cells demonstrate voltage-dependent ion currents”, so it comes after the electrophysiology portion of the text. This also led us to relabel the figure panels so that they match the modified Figure 6. The new Figure 6 has been provided and the figure legend changed accordingly. The Materials and methods section was also changed accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The signature genes for Merkel Cells omit some classic markers, such as Sox2, Isl1, Krt20. Is it possible that this dataset contains a mixture of keratinocytes and Merkel cells?</p></disp-quote><p>With regard to the GSEA analysis, this was constructed of genes that were unique to each individual cell type analyzed (MEF, HC, MC, GUT, CGP), thus excluding those genes that are expressed in any two cell types. The genes <italic>Sox2</italic> and Isl1 are expressed in Merkel cells, but also expressed in primary hair cells, thus they were eliminated from the cell specific gene sets. Similarly, the gene Krt20, while a characteristic Merkel cell marker, is also expressed in the gut secretory cells. The gene-lists generated for GSEA analysis were intended to represent genes specific to only one of the cell types, for the purposes of comparing the multiple cell types. This allowed an overall comparison between induced hair cells, with MEF, HC, MC, CGP, and GUT as a group, and allowed better statistical analysis.</p><p>We have changed the text to include the following sentence: “The GSEA program identified gene-lists exclusive to each cell type; these gene-lists included only genes which were not expressed in any two cell types.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The following comments should be discussed:</p><p>1) A powerful experiment that would suggest translatability would be to add the cocktail to rodent utricle cultures treated with an aminoglycoside. Have the authors already attempted this experiment? If yes, the results should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>The above experiment has not been attempted yet, but it is on the list. We are working to develop a minimum number of polycistronic AAV constructs for our transcription factor combination of SAPG. AAV delivery has only recently been successful in the context of the inner ear, and will allow us to pursue reprogramming in organ explants of the organ of Corti or utricle, as well as in vivo. Our future experiments will consist of ablating some or all of the primary hair cells, using either aminoglycosides or DTR mice. Following ablation, we will introduce the reprogramming transcription factors to see if we can convert the primary supporting cells to a hair cell-like fate in the context of the intact organ of Corti or utricle, both in vitro and in vivo. We have modified the Discussion to include suggestions for this line of research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Postnatal day 8 (P8) cochlear supporting cells: The author explain that supporting cells became an interesting target to drive HC differentiation, but they do not clearly explain why they chose P8 for the viral transduction experiment. The HC differentiation rate is actually quite promising (71%). It would be interesting to see whether reprograming P14 SCs can achieve a similar efficiency. Have the authors already attempted this experiment? If yes, the results should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not attempted to perform this experiment using P14 SCs, due to the technical challenges associated with dissecting, dissociating, culturing and FACS-sorting the inner ear at later post-natal stages. There is a latent ability of perinatal organ of Corti supporting cells to transdifferentiate in response to either Notch inhibition or <italic>Atoh1</italic> over expression (Kelly et al., 2012; Maass et al., 2015). This ability is present at P1 (White et al., 2006), but has disappeared by P6. P8 was chosen as the latest time point when the temporal bone is still soft enough to allow reliable preparation of FACS-purified supporting cells. By using P8 supporting cells as our starting material for viral transduction with the reprogramming transcription factors, we have minimized the possibility for spontaneous transdifferentiation in the experiment.</p><p>We have modified the subsection “<italic>Six1</italic>, <italic>Atoh1</italic>, <italic>Pou4f3</italic>, and <italic>Gfi1</italic> are capable of reprogramming postnatal and adult somatic cells” to explain the use of the developmental stage of P8 supporting cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Atoh1-GFP+ postnatal day1 (P1) cochlear hair cells were sorted and used to identify 16 transcription factors. How about later postnatal stages of cochlear hair cell maturation? Would that transcriptional information be helpful to make more mature/functional hair cells?</p></disp-quote><p>At the time these experiments were initiated, we did not have reliable transcriptomes of older hair cells, which are notoriously hard to profile due to the difficulty of acquiring sufficient numbers of FACS-pure, viable cells. Also, we felt that P1 represented a good target population, as being definitive hair cells that will not revert to a progenitor phenotype if <italic>Atoh1</italic> is knocked out (Maass et al., 2015). Thus, this <italic>Atoh1</italic>-independence suggests that if we could get them to this stage, subsequent maturation would be possible based on an initial gene hierarchy, dependent on <italic>Atoh1</italic>. Of course, this was guess work, but it represents our reasoning at a time when nothing was known about the possibility of reprogramming unrelated somatic cells to a hair cell fate.</p><p>In the event, and as we have discussed, the induced hair cells that we have produced are not fully mature, and indeed, engraftment with primary hair cells and supporting cells in our co-cultures (Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1) only modestly improves their molecular maturity. We agree that it is likely that additional transcription factors will be needed to bring about maturity, and mining our, now available, older transcriptomes has been ongoing. In the next iteration of these experiments, we will test several additional transcription factors that we hope will induce a more mature cell type during the reprogramming process. We have added this suggestion to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On the other hand, identifying transcription factors in atoh1+ cells assumes that atoh1 is the very first hair cell specifying transcription factor. Maybe there are transcription factors upstream of atoh1 that would improve hair cell induction rates?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment, and indeed, our transcription factor cocktail includes <italic>Six1</italic>, which is expressed upstream of <italic>Atoh1</italic> and may contribute to preparing the epigenetic landscape of the sensory primordia. This hypothesis will be tested in the context of single-cell analysis of reprogramming, that we planned before the Corona virus shut us down.</p><p>The other reason that we agree with this idea, is that we have discovered that although <italic>Atoh1</italic> is technically epistatic to <italic>Pou4f3</italic>, <italic>Atoh1</italic> requires <italic>Pou4f3</italic> activity to access much of its targetome (in preparation). Thus, our unbiased choice of reprogramming factors identified two factors, <italic>Atoh1</italic> and <italic>Pou4f3</italic>, that synergize to drive expression of the hair cell phenotype. We imagine that there are additional synergies that are likely to be important during hair cell maturation, and that using newly engineered reporters for more mature markers, will enable a similarly unbiased selection of TFs that act at lower levels in the hair cell gene regulatory network.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this query and have added a short sentence in the discussion to explain that <italic>Six1</italic> expression precedes <italic>Atoh1</italic> activation in the developing organ of Corti (subsection “Reprogramming efficiency and the level of maturity of iHCs”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors discuss the fact that the gene expression profiles of iHCs cannot be compared to nascent vestibular or cochlear hair cell subtypes because vestibular and cochlear hair cell subtypes are too similar, which precludes a comparison with the goal of a statistically supported classification.

Some discussion of this is warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>Tail-tip fibroblasts (TTFs) are typically used in reprogramming studies as a proof-of-principle that mature somatic cell types from alternate embryonic lineages can be reprogrammed. Their reprogramming has been shown to be much less efficient, regardless of the target cell type and commonly require additional medium supplementation (Liu et al., 2011; Lalit et al., 2016). In addition, they are difficult to culture, expand, and infect. The extremely low conversion rate reported in the manuscript is typical of this cell type in many other reprogramming protocols regardless of target cell type. We believe that the low conversion rate also contributed to the difference in morphology, since there were simply not sufficient reprogrammed cells to induce the kind of clustering seen with the MEFS. In addition, it is likely that the epigenetic landscape of the TTF is significantly different than the less mature MEFS, and certainly than the more highly-related P8 supporting cells. We hope that this will, in the future, contribute to the success of in vivo reprogramming, which from a translational perspective, is one of our long-term goals. Indeed, we speculate that unlike TTF, surviving supporting cells in long-deafened mice and humans, are likely to have an epigenetic memory that is more similar to hair cells, which share an immediate developmental lineage, as compared to a distantly related cell type like TTFs. We thank the reviewer, and have modified the text to include this issue in the subsection “<italic>Six1</italic>, <italic>Atoh1</italic>, <italic>Pou4f3</italic>, and <italic>Gfi1</italic> are capable of reprogramming postnatal and adult somatic cells”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Subsection “Induced Hair Cells resemble primary juvenile mouse hair cells transcriptionally”, last paragraph: lack of expression of Zfp503 is interesting.

It is possible that the lack of Zfp503 in the iHCs suggests a lack of cochlear specification, however this is unclear given our bulk RNA sequencing results, as discussed in the response to Question 1 of the “Essential Revisions”. The addition of Zfp503 to the SAPG transcription factor cocktail cut the reporter activation in half (see Figure 1—figure supplement 1G), and so for the purposes of this first-generation reprogramming protocol, was not used in the final cocktail. However, we agree with our reviewer that it’s inclusion in subsequent experiments could be extremely interesting with regard to HC maturation, as well as inner vs. outer differentiation. The next iteration of these experiments will be analyzed using single cell RNAseq and ATACseq to analyze additional TFs that are suggested by our bioinformatic analysis.

We tested the purification and addition of mesenchyme and sensory epithelium separately, but found that doing a preparation with both provided more consistent co-cultures, for reasons that are not clear.

The survival assays on iHCs and primary hair cells were done independently from each other, since both systems employ the same <italic>Atoh1</italic>::nGFP reporter. The inclusion of primary hair cell cultures was done for comparison only. The rationale behind the experiment is to produce an efficient assay that could be used for high-throughput drug screening. Addition of primary cells from the organ of Corti would induce epithelial island formation, which is harder to image, and thus confound this goal.</p><p>Automated cell counting used thresholds for size, intensity and roundness of the <italic>Atoh1</italic>::nGFP signal (as described in the Materials and methods). Since the GFP was localized to the nucleus in the induced hair cells, as well as the primary hair cells, the same quantification parameters were used. The imaging is done at 10x and the nuclei count recipe parameters include: background removal factor (removes variation in background), contrast thresholding (allows user to adjust detection sensitivity), smoothing factor (smooths nuclei boundaries), minimum and maximum object size (objects not within the specified size range will be removed), and a separation filter (separates neighboring objects). All of these parameters were optimized using reference 10x images of the <italic>Atoh1</italic>::nGFP reporter.
