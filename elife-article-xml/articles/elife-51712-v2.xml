from coevolutionary cycles as specialization in herbivores imposes diversifying selection on plant chemical defenses. Plants in the speciose genus <italic>Erysimum</italic> (Brassicaceae) produce both ancestral glucosinolates and evolutionarily novel cardenolides as defenses. Here we test macroevolutionary hypotheses on co-expression, co-regulation, and diversification of these potentially redundant defenses across this genus. We sequenced and assembled the genome of <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> and foliar transcriptomes of 47 additional <italic>Erysimum</italic> species to construct a phylogeny from 9868 orthologous genes, revealing several geographic clades but also high levels of gene discordance. Concentrations, inducibility, and diversity of the two defenses varied independently among species, with no evidence for trade-offs. Closely related, geographically co-occurring species shared similar cardenolide traits, but not glucosinolate traits, likely as a result of specific selective pressures acting on each defense. Ancestral and novel chemical defenses in <italic>Erysimum</italic> thus appear to provide complementary rather than redundant functions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plants are often attacked by insects and other herbivores. As a result, they have evolved to defend themselves by producing many different chemicals that are toxic to these pests. As producing each chemical costs energy, individual plants often only produce one type of chemical that is targeted towards their main herbivore. Related species of plants often use the same type of chemical defense so, if a particular herbivore gains the ability to cope with this chemical, it may rapidly become an important pest for the whole plant family.</p><p>To escape this threat, some plants have gained the ability to produce more than one type of chemical defense. Wallflowers, for example, are a group of plants in the mustard family that produce two types of toxic chemicals: mustard oils, which are common in most plants in this family; and cardenolides, which are an innovation of the wallflowers, and which are otherwise found only in distantly related plants such as foxglove and milkweed. The combination of these two chemical defenses within the same plant may have allowed the wallflowers to escape attacks from their main herbivores and may explain why the number of wallflower species rapidly increased within the last two million years.</p><p>Züst et al. have now studied the diversity of mustard oils and cardenolides present in many different species of wallflower. This analysis revealed that almost all of the tested wallflower species produced high amounts of both chemical defenses, while only one species lacked the ability to produce cardenolides. The levels of mustard oils had no relation to the levels of cardenolides in the tested species, which suggests that the regulation of these two defenses is not linked. Furthermore, Züst et al. found that closely related wallflower species produced more similar cardenolides, but less similar mustard oils, to each other. This suggests that mustard oils and cardenolides have evolved independently in wallflowers and have distinct roles in the defense against different herbivores.</p><p>The evolution of insect resistance to pesticides and other toxins is an important concern for agriculture. Applying multiple toxins to crops at the same time is an important strategy to slow the evolution of resistance in the pests. The findings of Züst et al. describe a system in which plants have naturally evolved an equivalent strategy to escape their main herbivores. Understanding how plants produce multiple chemical defenses, and the costs involved, may help efforts to breed crop species that are more resistant to herbivores and require fewer applications of pesticides.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Erysimum</italic></kwd><kwd>glucosinolates</kwd><kwd>cardenolides</kwd><kwd>phytochemical diversification</kwd><kwd>myrosinase</kwd><kwd>trait evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PZ00P3-161472</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Züst</surname><given-names>Tobias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1811965</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holland</surname><given-names>Cynthia K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Triad Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Strickler</surname><given-names>Susan R</given-names></name><name><surname>Mueller</surname><given-names>Lukas A</given-names></name><name><surname>Jander</surname><given-names>Georg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1645256</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jander</surname><given-names>Georg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFG-PE 2059/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petschenka</surname><given-names>Georg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011033</institution-id><institution>Agencia Estatal de Investigación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CGL2017-86626-C2-2-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perfectti</surname><given-names>Francisco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>LOEWE Program Insect Biotechnology and Bioresources</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petschenka</surname><given-names>Georg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Junta de Andalucia Programa Operativo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FEDER 2014-2020 A-RNM-505-UGR18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perfectti</surname><given-names>Francisco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A gain-of-function in a new chemical defense resulted in no trade-offs and and independent evolution between novel and ancestral defenses, suggesting low redundancy among different defensive chemicals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plant chemical defenses play a central role in the coevolutionary arms race with herbivorous insects. In response to diverse environmental challenges, plants have evolved a plethora of structurally diverse organic compounds with repellent, antinutritive, or toxic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Fraenkel, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Mithöfer and Boland, 2012</xref>). Chemical defenses can impose barriers to consumption by herbivores, but in parallel may favor the evolution of specialized herbivores that can tolerate or disable these defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Cornell and Hawkins, 2003</xref>). Chemical diversity is likely evolving in response to a multitude of plant-herbivore interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Salazar et al., 2018</xref>), and community-level phytochemical diversity may be a key driver of niche segregation and insect community dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Richards et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Sedio et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>For individual plants, the production of diverse mixtures of chemicals is often considered advantageous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Romeo, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Firn and Jones, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Gershenzon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Forbey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Richards et al., 2016</xref>). For example, different chemicals may target distinct herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Iason et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Richards et al., 2015</xref>), or may act synergistically to increase overall toxicity of a plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib168">Steppuhn and Baldwin, 2007</xref>). However, metabolic constraints can limit the extent of phytochemical diversity within individual plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Firn and Jones, 2003</xref>). Most defensive metabolites originate from a small group of precursor compounds and conserved biosynthetic pathways, which are modified in a hierarchical process into diverse, species-specific end products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Moore et al., 2014</xref>). As constraints are likely strongest for the early stages of these pathways, related plant species commonly share the same functional ‘classes’ of defensive chemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib183">Wink, 2003</xref>), but vary considerably in the number of compounds within each class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Fahey et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Rasmann and Agrawal, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Functional conservatism in defensive chemicals among related plants should facilitate host expansion and the evolution of tolerance in herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Cornell and Hawkins, 2003</xref>), as specialized resistance mechanisms against one type of compound are more likely to be effective against structurally similar than structurally dissimilar compounds. This may result in a seemingly paradoxical scenario, wherein well-defended plants are nonetheless attacked by a diverse community of specialized herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agrawal, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bidart-Bouzat and Kliebenstein, 2008</xref>). For example, most plants in the Brassicaceae produce glucosinolates as their primary defense, which upon activation by myrosinase (thioglucoside glucohydrolase) enzymes upon leaf damage become potent repellents of many herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Fahey et al., 2001</xref>). However, despite the potency of this defense system and the large diversity of glucosinolates produced by the Brassicaceae, several specialized herbivores have evolved strategies to overcome this defense, enabling them to consume most Brassicaceae and even to sequester glucosinolates for their own defense against predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Müller, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib182">Winde and Wittstock, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Plants may occasionally overcome the constraints on functional diversification and gain the ability to produce new classes of defensive chemicals as a ‘second line of defense’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Feeny, 1977</xref>). Although this phenomenon is likely widespread across the plant kingdom, it has most commonly been reported from the well-studied Brassicaceae. In addition to producing evolutionarily ancestral glucosinolates, plants in this family have gained the ability to produce saponins in <italic>Barbarea vulgaris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Shinoda et al., 2002</xref>), alkaloids in <italic>Cochlearia officinalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Brock et al., 2006</xref>), cucurbitacins in <italic>Iberis</italic> spp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Nielsen, 1978b</xref>), alliarinoside in <italic>Alliaria petiolata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Frisch and Møller, 2012</xref>), and cardenolides in the genus <italic>Erysimum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Makarevich et al., 1994</xref>). These recently-evolved chemical defenses with modes of action distinct from glucosinolates have likely allowed the plants to escape attack from specialized, glucosinolate-adapted herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Nielsen, 1978b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Dimock et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Haribal and Renwick, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Shinoda et al., 2002</xref>). Gains of novel defenses are expected to result in a release from selective pressures imposed by specialized antagonists, and thus may represent key steps in herbivore-plant coevolution that lead to rapid phylogenetic diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib180">Weber and Agrawal, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The production of cardenolides by species in the genus <italic>Erysimum</italic> is one of the longest- and best-studied examples of an evolutionarily recent gain of a novel chemical defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Jaretzky and Wilcke, 1932</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Nagata et al., 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">Singh and Rastogi, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Makarevich et al., 1994</xref>). Cardenolides are a type of cardiac glycoside, which act as allosteric inhibitors of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, an essential membrane ion transporter that is expressed ubiquitously in animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Agrawal et al., 2012</xref>). Cardiac glycosides are produced by plants in approximately sixty genera belonging to twelve plant families, and several cardiac glycoside-producing plants are known for their toxicity or medicinal uses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Agrawal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib192">Züst et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Erysimum</italic> is a species-rich genus consisting of diploid and polyploid species with diverse morphologies, growth habits, and ecological niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Al-Shehbaz, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Polatschek and Snogerup, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Al-Shehbaz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Gómez et al., 2015</xref>). Of the <italic>Erysimum</italic> species evaluated to date, all produce some of the novel cardenolide defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Makarevich et al., 1994</xref>). Previous phylogenetic studies suggest a recent and rapid diversification of the genus, with most species divergence occurring within the last 2–3 million years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Gómez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Moazzeni et al., 2014</xref>), resulting in 150 to 350 extant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Polatschek and Snogerup, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Al-Shehbaz, 2010</xref>). The large uncertainty in species number reflects taxonomic challenges in this genus, which includes many species that readily hybridize, as well as cryptic species with near-identical morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelaziz et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In most <italic>Erysimum</italic> species, cardenolides appear to have enabled an escape from at least some glucosinolate-adapted specialist herbivores.

Nonetheless, <italic>Erysimum</italic> plants are still attacked by a range of herbivores and seed predators, including some mammals and several glucosinolate-adapted aphids, true bugs, and lepidopteran larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Gómez, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib192">Züst et al., 2018</xref>). These herbivores likely rely on general detoxification mechanisms for tolerance of the novel defense, while to date there are no reports of de novo gains of specialized cardenolide resistance in <italic>Erysimum</italic> herbivores. However, the gain of the novel defense may have facilitated host shifts in at least one cardenolide-adapted herbivore: in addition to its main host <italic>Digitalis purpurea</italic> (Plantaginaceae), the seed-feeding bug <italic>Horvathiolus superbus</italic> (Lygaeinae) commonly feeds on seeds of <italic>E. crepidifolium</italic>, and is able to sequester cardenolides from both sources (Georg Petschenka, personal observations).</p><p>The gain of a novel chemical defense makes the genus <italic>Erysimum</italic> an excellent model system to study the causes and consequences of phytochemical diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib192">Züst et al., 2018</xref>). While an increasing number of studies are beginning to describe taxon-wide patterns of chemical diversity in plants (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Richards et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Sedio et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Salazar et al., 2018</xref>), the <italic>Erysimum</italic> system is unique in combining two classes of plant metabolites with primarily defensive function – although a broader role of glucosinolates is increasingly recognized (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Katz et al., 2015</xref>). The system thus is ideally suited to evaluate the evolutionary consequences of co-expressing two functionally distinct but potentially redundant defenses. Here, we present a high-quality genome sequence assembly and annotation for the short-lived annual <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> as an important resource for future molecular studies in this system. Furthermore, we present a new phylogeny for 48 species constructed from transcriptome sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), corresponding to 10–30% of species in the genus <italic>Erysimum</italic>. We combine this phylogeny with a characterization of the full diversity of glucosinolates and cardenolides in leaves to evaluate macroevolutionary patterns in the evolution of phytochemical diversity across the genus. We complemented the characterization of defensive phenotypes by quantifying glucosinolate-activating myrosinase activity, inhibition of animal Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase by leaf extracts, and defense inducibility in response to exogenous application of jasmonic acid (JA). By assessing co-variation of diversity, abundance and inducibility of ancestral and novel defenses, we provide evidence that these two classes of defense metabolites evolved in response to different selective pressures and appear to have specific, non-redundant functions.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Geographic location of <italic>Erysimum</italic> species source populations used for transcriptome sequencing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Source populations in Europe.

To obtain an estimate of biological activity and evaluate quantification from total MS ion counts, we used an established assay that quantifies cardenolide concentrations from specific inhibition of animal Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase by crude <italic>Erysimum</italic> leaf extracts.

Thus, the use of ion count data for cross-species comparisons was appropriate for this purpose. Both the total numbers of compounds and the total abundances exhibited a strong phylogenetic signal (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), indicating that closely related species shared similar cardenolide traits.</p><p>Cardenolide diversity was considerably higher than that of glucosinolates, with a total of 97 distinguishable candidate cardenolide compounds identified across the 48 <italic>Erysimum</italic> species (two compounds were later excluded, leaving 95 compounds; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). Of these, 46 compounds had distinct molecular masses and mass fragments, while the remaining compounds likely were isomers, sharing a molecular mass with other compounds but having distinct HPLC retention times. The 95 putative cardenolides comprised nine distinct genins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>), the majority of which were glycosylated with digitoxose, deoxy hexoses, xylose, or glucose moieties. Only digitoxigenin and cannogenol accumulated as free genins, while all other compounds occurred as either mono- or di-glycosides. A likely major source of isomeric cardenolide compounds was thus the incorporation of different deoxy hexoses of equivalent mass, such as rhamnose, fucose, or gulomethylose. A subset of compounds had molecular masses that were heavier by 42.011 m/z than known mono- or di-glycoside cardenolides. Such a gain in mass corresponds to the gain of an acetyl-group, and mass fragmentation patterns indicated that these compounds were acetylated on the first sugar moiety (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). Out of the nine detected genins, six had previously been described from <italic>Erysimum</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Makarevich et al., 1994</xref>). In addition, we identified three previously undescribed mass features with fragmentation patterns characteristic of cardenolide genins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Of these three, one matched an acetylated cannogenol, one matched formylated cannogenol, and one matched formylated nigrescigenin, assuming acetylation/formylation of a free OH-group on the precursor molecule. Formyl adducts can sometimes be formed during LC-MS due to the addition of formic acid to solvents, although this is less common with positive ionization. To exclude the possibility that these were technical artefacts, we analyzed a subset of extracts by LC-MS without the addition of formic acid and found both formyl-genins at comparable concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Genin diversity likely originates from digitoxigenin, which is transformed into more stucturally complex cardenolides by hydroxylases, dehydrogenases, and formyl-, methyl-, or acetyltransferases. Acetyl-cannogenol could be derived directly from cannogenol or from formyl-cannogenol, with the frequent co-occurrence of acetyl-cannogenol and formyl-cannogenol in leaf extracts suggesting the latter.

In the more commonly studied milkweeds (<italic>Asclepias</italic> spp., Apocynaceae), cardenolides are usually inducible in response to herbivore stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Rasmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bingham and Agrawal, 2010</xref>), but cardenolide suppression is also common, particularly in plants with high constitutive cardenolide concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bingham and Agrawal, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Rasmann and Agrawal, 2011</xref>). Milkweed plants are attacked by a rich community of cardenolide-specialized herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Dobler et al., 2012</xref>), likely making this defensive plasticity adaptive for these plants. The lack of cardenolide inducibility in <italic>Erysimum</italic> could therefore indicate a lack of widespread cardenolide-specialized herbivores that might otherwise select against high constitutive cardenolide levels.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Phylogenetic relationships and phytochemical similarity</title><p>The genus <italic>Erysimum</italic> poses considerable phylogenetic challenges, with its evolutionary recent radiation resulting in a large number of hybridizing species and high prevalence of polyploidization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Polatschek and Snogerup, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Marhold and Lihová, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Al-Shehbaz, 2010</xref>). Both previous partial phylogenies of the genus, constructed from internal transcribed spacer (ITS) or chloroplast sequences, consequently struggled to resolve polytomies among species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Gómez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Moazzeni et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we attempted to construct a better-resolved phylogeny from 9868 orthologous genes extracted from transcriptome sequences. However, while our species tree provided good posterior probabilities for all nodes, it also revealed very high levels of gene discordance. Several internal nodes of our species tree topology were supported by less than 1% of all gene trees, and only the most recent branching events were supported by more than 10% of gene trees. High levels of discordance, likely driven by introgression and incomplete lineage sorting, are common during ongoing species radiations, with many recent plant examples reporting similar findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Novikova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Pease et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Copetti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib185">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). The abundance of polyploid species in our phylogeny (at least 21 out of 48, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) may have further exacerbated levels of discordance. Specifically, if these are allopolyploid rather than autopolyploid species, discordance could be introduced by our methodological approach for gene selection, which randomly retained only a single copy for each identified orthologous gene with multiple copies. This same problem could also have inflated the estimation of hybridization by our HyDe analysis, although a high rate of gene flow is likely, at least among geographically close species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abdelaziz et al., 2014</xref>). More fundamentally, the high levels of gene discordance also highlight the limitations of simple bifurcating species trees to represent the significantly more complicated network of splits and reticulate evolutionary events that is likely the true history of the genus <italic>Erysimum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Marhold and Lihová, 2006</xref>). However, while we have been unsuccessful in reconstructing the exact evolutionary history of the genus, we nevertheless believe our species tree captures key aspects of its phylogenetic relationships, particularly in respect to closely related species and geographic clades.</p><p>In our species tree, the three annual species, <italic>E. repandum</italic>, <italic>E. incanum</italic>, and <italic>E. wilczekianum</italic> grouped together as a well-supported monophyletic clade sister to all other <italic>Erysimum</italic> species. These species co-occur geographically with several perennial <italic>Erysimum</italic> species, but they are largely isolated by non-overlapping flowering times. Further separate clades were present for species from Iran, North America, and a combined clade of species from Spain, Morocco, and the Canary Islands, while the remaining species grouped into four central and eastern European clades. Within the Spanish clade, species from southeastern Spain exhibited closer relatedness to Moroccan species than to species from northeastern or northwestern Spain, loosely matching more fine-scale evaluations of species relatedness in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abdelaziz et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, even though none of these clades were supported by high gene concordance factors, the main topology of our species tree captured an apparently meaningful pattern of closely related species commonly occurring in close geographic proximity.</p><p>Clustering of species by dissimilarities in glucosinolate profiles revealed distinct groups of chemically similar species, largely corresponding to nine chemotypes determined by the predicted function of few major-effect glucosinolate genes. However, we found no phylogenetic signal for chemical similarity, compound number, or total concentrations of glucosinolates (Blomberg’s K &lt; 1 for all traits). Closely related species thus appear to be less likely to share similar glucosinolate chemotypes. In a comparative study of 30 <italic>Strepthanthus</italic> species, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cacho et al. (2015)</xref> reported similarly low values for Blomberg’s K for most glucosinolate traits, suggesting that this may be a general pattern in glucosinolate diversity.</p><p>In contrast, clustering of species by dissimilarities in cardenolide profiles revealed fewer distinct groups of chemically similar species, suggesting that the considerably more complex cardenolide chemotypes may be controlled by many minor-effect genes. However, we found strong phylogenetic signals for chemical similarity, compound numbers, and total concentrations of cardenolides (Blomberg’s K &gt; 1). Closely related species were therefore more likely to share similar cardenolide chemotypes. Given the high levels of gene discordance in our phylogeny, it seems probable that at least the glucosinolate results may have been affected by hemiplasy, i.e., a phenomenon where a trait is determined by genes whose topologies does not match the species tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Avise and Robinson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Pease et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib185">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). Hemiplasy may result in the overestimation of a trait’s evolutionary rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Mendes et al., 2018</xref>), and results must be evaluated with caution. However, even though trait evolution within <italic>Erysimum</italic> almost certainly has been significantly more complex than can be represented by a simple bifurcating species tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Novikova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Pease et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib185">Wu et al., 2018</xref>), we believe our results remain robust in three key points. First, geographically close <italic>Erysimum</italic> species tend to be more closely related, likely because geographic proximity may facilitate gene flow. Indeed, geographic signatures were present in both previously published phylogenies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Gómez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Moazzeni et al., 2014</xref>) as well as in our tree. Second, geographically close, related species share similar cardenolide but not glucosinolate phenotypes. Third, these distinct patterns in chemical classes indicate distinct evolutionary mechanisms for glucosinolate and cardenolide defenses, with a small number of major-effect glucosinolate genes evolving independently of a putatively larger set of minor-effect cardenolide genes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Phytochemical diversity</title><p>Despite vast morphological differences among sampled <italic>Erysimum</italic> species, the diversity in glucosinolate profiles across species was relatively limited, with a total of 25 different glucosinolate compounds detected. Even though this diversity may be further amplified by enzymes that direct glucosinolates into different toxic products upon activation (not measured here; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Lambrix et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Burow et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib189">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>), intraspecific glucosinolate diversity of Arabidopsis alone is significantly higher, with more than 30 compounds reported across a range of accessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Kliebenstein et al., 2001a</xref>). In contrast, an evaluation of 30 <italic>Streptanthus</italic> species revealed a similarly low total number of 35 glucosinolate compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cacho et al., 2015</xref>). The intraspecific diversity of Arabidopsis may therefore not be typical for all plants of the Brassicaceae. Additional broadly comparative studies of glucosinolate diversity in other Brassicaceae species are needed to provide a reliable ‘baseline’ for glucosinolate diversity. Importantly, we intentionally ignored intraspecific chemical diversity as we lacked genetically diverse seed material for most species. However, a preliminary screening of multiple <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> accessions suggests that there is little to no variation in glucosinolate profiles within this one species, while there is considerable variation in cardenolide profiles (T. Züst, unpublished data).</p><p>The majority of <italic>Erysimum</italic> species produced glucoiberin as their main glucosinolate. Aliphatic glucosinolates such as glucoiberin are derived from methionine in a process that involves elongation and modification of a variable side-chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Halkier and Gershenzon, 2006</xref>), and in this context the 3-carbon glucosinolate glucoiberin is one of the least biosynthetically complex glucosinolates. However, the potential to produce additional aliphatic glucosinolates with longer side chains clearly exists in the genus, as 4-, 5-, and 6-carbon glucosinolates with more complex modifications were scattered across the phylogeny. A few species produced glucosinolates that are not found in Arabidopsis, including a sub-class of aliphatic glucosinolates, the methylsulfonyl glucosinolates. The homolog of GS-OH, which in Arabidopsis forms 2-hydroxy-but-3-enyl glucosinolate from 3-butenyl glucosinolate, does not have a clear function in <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> due to the lack of alkenyl glucosinolates. It is therefore possible that the GS-OH homolog in <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> may code for the unknown enzyme that hydroxylates 4-methylsulfonylbutyl glucosinolate to form 3-hydroxy-4-methylsulfonylbutyl glucosinolate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8</xref>). Methylsulfonyl glucosinolates are found in several Brassicaceae genera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Fahey et al., 2001</xref>), and glucocheirolin, the most abundant methylsulfonyl glucosinolate in <italic>Erysimum</italic> species, is only a weak egg-laying stimulant for the cabbage white butterfly (<italic>Pieris rapae</italic>), compared to other glucosinolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Huang et al., 1993</xref>). Methylsulfonyl glucosinolates may thus represent a plant response to specialist herbivores that use plant defenses as host-finding cues.</p><p>The species <italic>E. pulchellum</italic> (PUL) and <italic>E. collinum</italic> (COL) from Turkey and Iran, respectively, accumulated glucoerypestrin as their main glucosinolate compound. This compound was first described in <italic>E. rupestre</italic> [syn. <italic>E. pulchellum</italic>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Polatschek, 2011</xref>)] by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Kjær et al. (1957)</xref> and to date has been found exclusively in plants of the genus <italic>Erysimum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Fahey et al., 2001</xref>). Radioactive labeling experiments indicated that glucoerypestrin is derived from a dicarboxylic amino acid, possibly 2-amino-5-methoxycarbonyl-pentanoic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Chisholm, 1973</xref>). Modification of the amino acid side chain during methionine-derived aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis as a pathway to glucoerypestrin is less likely, due to the lower specific incorporation of <sup>14</sup>C-labeled methionine compared to <sup>14</sup>C-labeled dicarboxylic acids into this compound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Chisholm, 1973</xref>). In any case, the gain of glucoerypestrin represents yet another evolutionary novelty in the <italic>Erysimum</italic> genus, but its relative toxicity and the adaptive benefits of its production have yet to be elucidated.</p><p>Myrosinase activity levels differed among glucosinolate chemotypes, and activity was positively correlated with glucosinolate abundance in plants when controlling for glucosinolate chemotype. <italic>Erysimum</italic> species that predominantly produced indole glucosinolates or 4-methylsulfinyl glucosinolates had negligible myrosinase activity against the assayed aliphatic glucosinolate sinigrin. Indole glucosinolates can be activated by <italic>PEN2</italic> – a thioglucosidase that is more specific for indole glucosinolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bednarek et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Clay et al., 2009</xref>) – or even break down in the absence of plant-derived myrosinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). The negligible activity in these species could therefore indicate the existence of selective pressures to tailor myrosinase expression to the type and concentrations of glucosinolates that are produced. Mirroring results for glucosinolate defenses, myrosinase activity was not more similar among related species, suggesting that the two components of glucosinolate defense evolve in concert.</p><p>We detected considerable amounts of the evolutionarily novel cardenolide defense in 47 out of 48 <italic>Erysimum</italic> species or accessions. Among the 95 likely cardenolide compounds detected, at least 22 had not been described previously in <italic>Erysimum</italic>. This metabolic diversity had three main sources: modification of the genin core structure, variation of the glycoside chain, or isomeric variation (e.g., through the incorporation of different isomeric sugars). Structural variation in cardenolides affects the relative inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Dzimiri et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Petschenka et al., 2018</xref>) and physiochemical properties such as lipophilicity, which play an important role in uptake and metabolism of plant metabolites by insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Duffey, 1980</xref>). Individual <italic>Erysimum</italic> species produced between 15 and 50 different cardenolide compounds, and the comparison of quantification by total mass ion counts <italic>vs.</italic> quantification by inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase revealed highly similar results. While both methods of quantification are only approximate, this correlation at least provides no obvious indication of vast differences in Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase inhibitory activity among <italic>Erysimum</italic> cardenolides.</p><p>The metabolic pathways involved in the biosynthesis and modification of cardenolides have yet to be elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Kreis and Müller-Uri, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib192">Züst et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we propose a pathway for the modification of digitoxigenin, commonly assumed to be the least biosynthetically complex cardenolide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Kreis and Müller-Uri, 2010</xref>), into the eight structurally more complex genins found within <italic>Erysimum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Variation in glycoside chains is likely mediated by glycosyltransferases that act on the different genins. In the Brassicaceae genus <italic>Barbarea</italic>, plants produce saponin glycosides as an evolutionary novel defense, and a significant proportion of glycoside diversity in this system has been linked to the action of a small set of UDP glycosyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Erthmann et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, through the joint action of genin-modifying enzymes and glycosyltransferases, a relatively small set of enzymes and corresponding genes could generate the vast cardenolide diversity found in the <italic>Erysimum</italic> genus. The identification and manipulation of these genes in different <italic>Erysimum</italic> species will make it possible to test the adaptive benefits of this structural diversity.</p><p>On average, leaves of <italic>Erysimum</italic> species contained cardenolides equivalent to 6 µg ouabain per mg dry leaf weight (estimated from Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase inhibition), placing them slightly above most species of the well-studied cardenolide-producing genus <italic>Asclepias</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Rasmann and Agrawal, 2011</xref>). However, two species, <italic>E. collinum</italic> (COL) and <italic>E. crepidifolium</italic> (CRE), were clear outliers in terms of cardenolide content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E</xref>). The almost complete absence of cardenolides in <italic>E. collinum</italic> (COL), which clustered phylogenetically with two other Middle Eastern species producing average concentrations of these compounds (<italic>E. crassipes</italic> [CSS] and <italic>E. crassicaule</italic> [CRA], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), likely represents a secondary loss of this trait in the course of evolution. This species also accumulated an evolutionary novel glucosinolate, glucoerypestrin (see above), which may have resulted in a shift in selective pressures that led to the loss of potentially costly cardenolide production. Conversely, <italic>E. crepidifolium</italic> (CRE) had cardenolide concentrations more than three times higher than any other tested <italic>Erysimum</italic> species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). This is consistent with the highly toxic nature of this species, which has the German vernacular name ‘Gänsesterbe’ (geese death) and has been associated with mortality in geese that consume the plant.</p><p>Whereas most species did not induce cardenolide accumulation in response to JA, <italic>E. crepidifolium</italic> (CRE) had a significant 48% increase. While not as extreme, this observation is similar to the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Munkert et al. (2014)</xref>, who reported a three-fold increase in cardenolide levels of <italic>E. crepidifolium</italic> in response to a high dose of methyl jasmonate. Plants use conserved transcriptional networks to continuously integrate signals from their environment and optimize allocation of resources to growth and defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Havko et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, while these networks commonly govern hardwired responses (e.g., an attenuation of growth upon activation of JA signaling), they may nevertheless be altered by mutations at key nodes of the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Campos et al., 2016</xref>). Given this relative flexibility in signaling networks, it is perhaps not surprising that the evolutionary novel cardenolides have been integrated into the defense signaling of <italic>Erysimum</italic> species to variable degrees. Investigating gene expression changes in the inducible <italic>E. crepidifolium</italic> relative to the non-inducing <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> may therefore provide valuable insights into the molecular regulation of this defense.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The study of the speciose genus <italic>Erysimum</italic>, which has two co-expressed chemical defense classes, revealed largely independent evolution of the ancestral and the novel defense. With no evidence for trade-offs between the structurally and biosynthetically unrelated defenses, the diversity, abundance, and inducibility of each class of defenses appears to be evolving independently in response to the unique selective environment of each individual species. The evolutionarily recent gain of novel cardenolides has resulted in a system in which no known specific adaptations to cardenolides have yet evolved de novo in insect herbivores, although general adaptations to toxic food may still allow herbivores to consume the plants. <italic>Erysimum</italic> is thus an excellent model system for phytochemical diversification, as it facilitates the study of coevolutionary adaptations in real time. Our current work provides the foundation for a more mechanistic evaluation of these processes, which promises to greatly improve our understanding of the role of phytochemical diversity in plant-insect interactions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>The genus <italic>Erysimum</italic> is distributed across the northern hemisphere, with the center of diversity stretching from the Mediterranean Basin into Central Asia, and a smaller number of species centered in western North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Moazzeni et al., 2014</xref>).

While most plant samples were screened for constitutive levels of chemical defenses only, we quantified inducibility of chemical defenses in a subset of 30 species with sufficient replication (eight or more plants) in the third experiment (2017–2). For these species, half of all plants were randomly assigned to the induction treatment and given a foliar spray of JA one week prior to harvest.

Due to large differences in the physiochemical properties between glucosinolates and cardenolides, each plant extract was analyzed in two different modes to optimize detection of each compound class. For glucosinolates, extracts were separated on a Waters Acquity charged surface hybrid (CSH) C18 100 × 2.1 mm column with 1.7 µm pore size, fitted with a CSH guard column. The column was maintained at 40°C and injections of 1 µl were eluted at a constant flow rate of 0.4 mL/min with a gradient of 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (B) as follows: 0–6 min from 2% to 45% B, 6–6.5 min from 45% to 100% B, followed by a 2 min wash phase at 100% B, and 2 min reconditioning at 2% B. For cardenolides, extracts were either separated using an equivalent method, or an optimized method using a Waters Cortecs C18 150 × 2.1 mm column with 2.7 µm pore size, fitted with a Cortecs C18 guard column. The column was maintained at 40°C and injections were eluted at a constant flow rate of 0.4 mL/min with a gradient of 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (B) as follows: 0–10 min from 5% to 40% B, 10–15 min from 40% to 100% B, followed by a 2.5 min wash phase at 100% B, and 2.5 min reconditioning at 5% B.</p><p>Compounds were ionized in negative mode for glucosinolate analysis and in positive mode for cardenolide analysis.

In addition, we screened all negative scan data for characteristic glucosinolate mass fragments to identify additional candidate compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cataldi et al., 2010</xref>). For mass features with multiple possible identifications, we inferred the most likely compound identity from relative HPLC retention times and the presence of biosynthetically related compounds in the same sample. We confirmed our identifications using commercial standards for glucoiberin, glucocheirolin (both Phytolab GmbH), and sinigrin (Sigma-Aldrich), as well as by comparison to extracts of Arabidopsis accessions with known glucosinolate profiles. Compound abundances of all glucosinolates were quantified by integrating ion intensities of the [M-H]<sup>-</sup> adducts using QuanLynx in the MassLynx software (v4.1, Waters).</p><p>All cardenolides share a highly conserved structure consisting of a steroid core (5β,14β-androstane-3β14-diol) linked to a five-membered lactone ring, which as a unit (the genin) mediates the specific binding of cardenolides to Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>- ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Dzimiri et al., 1987</xref>). While cardenolide genins are sufficient to inhibit Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>- ATPase function, genins are commonly glycosylated or modified by hydroxylation on the steroid moiety to change the physiochemical properties and binding affinity of compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Dzimiri et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Petschenka et al., 2018</xref>). We obtained commercial standards for the abundant <italic>Erysimum</italic> cardenolides erysimoside and helveticoside (Sigma-Aldrich), allowing us to identify these compounds through comparison of retention times and mass fragmentation patterns. Additional cardenolide compounds were tentatively identified from characteristic LC-MS fragmentation patterns. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Sachdev-Gupta et al. (1990)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Sachdev-Gupta et al. (1993)</xref> reported fragmentation patterns for glycosides of strophanthidin, digitoxigenin, and cannogenol from <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic>. Their results highlight the propensity of cardenolides to fragment at glycosidic bonds, with genin masses in particular being a prominent feature of cardenolide mass spectra. Additionally, cardenolide genins exhibit further fragmentation related to the loss of OH-groups from the steroidal core structure. We confirmed these rules of fragmentation for our mass spectrometry system using commercial standards of strophanthidin and digitoxigenin (Sigma-Aldrich). Importantly, while fragments were most abundant under high-energy conditions (MS<sup>E</sup>), they were still apparent under standard MS conditions, likely due to in-source fragmentation.</p><p>Characteristic fragmentation allowed us to identify candidate cardenolide compounds in a genin-guided approach, where the presence of characteristic genin fragments in a chromatographic peak indicated the likely presence of a cardenolide molecule. We then identified the parental mass of these chromatographic peaks from the presence of paired mass features separated by 21.98 m/z, corresponding to the [M+H]<sup>+</sup> and [M+Na]<sup>+</sup> adducts of the intact molecule. For di-glycosidic cardenolides, additional fragments corresponding to the loss of the outer sugar moiety allowed us to determine the mass and order of sugar moieties in the linear glycoside chain of the molecule. We screened our data for the presence of glycosides of strophanthidin, digitoxigenin, and cannogenol, and additional genins known to occur in <italic>Erysimum</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Makarevich et al., 1994</xref>). Multiple cardenolide genins can share the same molecular structure and may not be distinguished by mass spectrometry alone. Thus, all genin identifications are tentative and based on previous literature reports. We screened LC-MS data from two experiments (Phylo16 and Phylo17-2) to generate a list of cardenolide compounds. Cardenolide data of experiment Phylo17-1 could not be used due to technical problems with the LC-MS analysis in positive mode. Relative compound abundances were quantified by integrating the ion intensities of the [M+H]<sup>+</sup> or the [M+Na]<sup>+</sup> adduct, whichever was more abundant for a given compound across all samples. In the third experiment, we added hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich) to each sample as an internal standard, but between-sample variation (technical noise) was negligible compared to between-species variation.</p><p>For glucosinolate and cardenolide data separately, we averaged raw ion counts for each compound across experiments to yield a single chemical profile per compound class and species. We thereby intentionally ignored potential intraspecific variation in chemical diversity, as a lack of multiple seed origins or accessions for most species did not allow us to appropriately quantify this dimension of complexity. Raw ion counts were standardized by the dry sample weight, possible dilution of samples, and internal standard concentrations (where available). For pooled samples, ion counts were standardized by the average dry weight calculated from all samples that contributed to a pool. The full set of standardized compound ion counts was then analyzed using linear mixed effects models (package <italic>nlme</italic> v3.1–137 in R v3.5.3). Because standardized ion counts still had a heavily skewed distribution, we applied a log(+0.1) transformation to all values. Log-transformed ion counts were modelled treating experiment as a fixed effect, and a species-by-compound identifier as the main random effect. Nested within the main random effect, we fitted a species-by-compound-by-experiment identifier as a second random effect to account for the difference of pooled or individual samples among experiments. The fixed effect of this model thus captures the overall differences in compound ion counts between experiments, while the main random effect captures the average deviation from an overall compound mean for each compound in each species. We extracted the overall compound mean and the main random effects from these models, providing us with average ion counts for each compound in each species on the log-scale. Negative values on the log-scale were set to zero as they would correspond to values below the limit of reliable detection of the LC-MS on the normal scale.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Inhibition of mammal Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase by leaf extracts</title><p>Although all cardenolides target the same enzyme in animal cells, structural variation among different cardenolides can significantly influence binding affinity and thus affect toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Dzimiri et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Petschenka et al., 2018</xref>). Cardenolide quantification from LC-MS mass signal intensity does not capture such differences in biological activity, and furthermore may be challenging due to compound-specific response factors and narrow ranges of signal linearity. To evaluate whether total ion counts are an appropriate and biologically relevant measure for between-species comparisons of defense levels, we therefore quantified cardenolide concentrations by a separate method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib193">Züst et al., 2019</xref>). For the subset of plants in the 2016 experiment, we measured the biological activity of leaf extracts on the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase from the cerebral cortex of pigs (<italic>Sus scrofa</italic>, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) using an in vitro assay introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Klauck and Luckner (1995)</xref> and adapted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Petschenka et al. (2013)</xref>. This colorimetric assay measures Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity from phosphate released during ATP consumption, and can be used to quantify relative enzymatic inhibition by cardenolide-containing plant extracts. Briefly, we tested the inhibitory effect of each plant extract at four concentrations to estimate the sigmoid enzyme inhibition function from which we could determine the cardenolide content of the extract relative to a standard curve for ouabain (Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA). We dried a 100 µL aliquot of each extract used for metabolomic analyses at 45°C on a vacuum concentrator (SpeedVac, Labconco, MO, USA). Dried residues were dissolved in 200 µL 10% DMSO in water, and further diluted 1:5, 1:50, and 1:500 using 10% DMSO. To quantify potential non-specific enzymatic inhibition that could occur at high concentrations of plant extracts, we also included control extracts from <italic>Sinapis arvensis</italic> leaves (a non-cardenolide producing species of the Brassicaceae) in these assays.</p><p>Assays were carried out in 96-well microplate format. Reactions were started by adding 80 μL of a reaction mix containing 0.0015 units of porcine Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase to 20 μL of leaf extracts in 10% DMSO, to achieve final well concentrations (in 100 μL) of 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 mM imidazol, and 2.5 mM ATP at pH 7.4. To control for coloration of leaf extracts, we replicated each reaction on the same 96-well plate using a buffered background mix with identical composition as the reaction mix but lacking KCl, resulting in inactive Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPases. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 20 min, after which enzymatic reactions were stopped by addition of 100 μL sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, 10% plus 0.05% Antifoam A) to each well.

At the time of harvest of metabolomic samples, we collected an additional set of leaf disks from each plant, corresponding to approximately 50 mg fresh weight. After determination of exact fresh weight, samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until enzyme activity measurements. Following the protocol of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib174">Travers-Martin et al.

Myrosinase activities were determined by adding sinigrin to plant extracts and monitoring the enzymatic release of glucose from its activation. Control reactions with sinigrin-free buffer were used to correct for plant-derived glucose. All samples were measured in duplicate and mean values related to a glucose calibration curve, measured also in duplicate. Reactions were carried out in 96-well plates and concentrations of released glucose were measured by adding a mix of glucose oxidase, peroxidase, 4-aminoantipyrine and phenol as color reagent to each well and measuring the kinetics for 45 min at room temperature in a microplate photometer (Multiskan EX, Thermo Electron, China) at 492 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Similarity in defense profiles between <italic>Erysimum</italic> species</title><p>To quantify chemical similarity among species, we performed separate cluster analyses on the glucosinolate and cardenolide profile data averaged across the three experiments. For each species, the log-transformed average ion counts of all compounds were converted to proportions (all compounds produced by a species summing to 1). From this proportional data we then calculated pairwise Bray-Curtis dissimilarities for all species pairs using function <italic>vegdist</italic> in the R package <italic>vegan</italic> v2.5–4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Oksanen et al., 2019</xref>).

We constructed chemical dendrograms (chemograms) of glucosinolate and cardenolide profile similarities by fitting hierarchical clustering models (Ward’s D) and estimated support for individual species clusters from 10,000 permutations. To test whether similarity in glucosinolate and cardenolide profiles was correlated with each other and with phylogenetic relatedness, we performed Mantel tests [function <italic>mantel.test</italic> in R package <italic>ape</italic> v5.0, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Paradis and Schliep, 2019</xref>) with 1000 permutations to compare Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices or the cophenetic distance matrix extracted for the ultrametric ExaML species tree.

As variation in traits can impact the propensity for evolutionary diversification, we also tested for correlations between trait variation across the tips of the ExaML phylogeny and tip-specific estimates of speciation rates (tip-rate correlation, TRC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Harvey and Rabosky, 2018</xref>). Tip-specific speciation rates were estimated as node density (ND) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Freckleton et al., 2008</xref>) and as inverse equal split (ES) measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Jetz et al., 2012</xref>), where ND captures splitting dynamics over the entire history of a lineage leading to a tip, while ES is weighted towards branching patterns nearer the tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Harvey and Rabosky, 2018</xref>). We tested for significant correlations between speciation rate measures and chemical traits using standard PGLS models, as well as a more robust simulation-based method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Harvey and Rabosky, 2018</xref>), thereby performing four tests for each of four chemical plant traits. To estimate the likelihood of false positives in this approach, we performed all four tests on 1000 sets of randomly generated plant traits and quantified the number of traits with more than one significant test. Finally, we evaluated the evidence for geographic signal in phylogenetic relatedness by performing a Mantel test to compare the cophenetic distance matrix to the pairwise geographic distances for all species with known collection locations.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Hartmut Christier for collecting <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> seeds, Erik Poelman for collecting <italic>E. cheiri</italic> seeds, and the botanical gardens listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for providing seeds of additional species.

The reviewers have given explicit advice on these topics including suggested technical approaches to better handle this complexity and avenues where removing claims or caveating claims is more appropriate than new analysis.</p><p>Please see the below reviews for more detailed discussions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors conduct a very interesting assessment of <italic>Erysimum</italic> chemical variation starting with a foundation genome. Transcriptome work is used to aid in discerning phylogenetic relationships among the species to aid in the analysis. I'm presuming that the deeper use of the transcriptomes to look at gene family evolution is being reserved for follow-up manuscripts. Overall, this is a very strong manuscript and I largely only have points that require cleaner analysis and/or clarification. They will require some new data analysis but not experimentation.</p><p>I'm having a bit of difficulty in the annotation of glucosinolate biosynthetic genes in <italic>E. cheiranthoides.</italic> This analysis appears to be using a single BLAST score value to call homology without phylogenetic interpretation whereas in the myrosinase family, there is an excellent alignment based approach. There are a number of reasons that make me request that a similar phylogenetic approach be used for all steps in the biosynthetic pathway similar to what was done with myrosinase. First, the use of the threshold similarity value can be misleading if the divergence happened after the <italic>Erysimum</italic>/Arabidopsis split. For example, AOP2/AOP3 likely diverged within the Arabidopsis species and as such the difficulty of finding only AOP3 and not AOP2 is likely due to this fact. This is equally true for GS-OH where the similarity value would be similar between the non-functional and functional GS-OH enzymes in Arabidopsis. There are also very few species between <italic>Erysimum</italic> and Arabidopsis that have the GS-OH product or even precursor so it is not clear if we should expect conservation of the gene. Another indicator that phylogenetic approaches should be used is that a tree with just Arabidopsis species shows that there is not a 1:1 orthology conservation in the FMO GS-OX family and as such it is highly unlikely that this is true to <italic>Erysimum</italic>. I agree that for most steps, the data supports the presence of a gene, but to really clarify the relationships and predictions, this should be based on phylogenies for each gene family. Optimally, this would be using Brassica as an outgroup to help position the Arabidopsis/<italic>Erysimum</italic> relationships. This is true for both the aliphatic and indolic pathways.</p><p>The chemical diversity in glucosinolates is largely an epistatic interaction of the side-chain modifying genes and the MAM locus. In Table 2, principal components of the Bray-Curtiss Matrices are used to describe the chemical diversity. Given the heatmap in Figure 7, there is a tree relationship largely driven by the bottom cluster. Further, the authors are able to classify based on the ALK/MSO/MSI status. This suggests that the linear decomposition is creating a false negative. Another way to test this would be to create a genotypic matrix based on the imputed status of the major structural loci within each species and then compare the tree derived from this glucosinolate &quot;genotype&quot; to the genomic &quot;Tree&quot;. Presently, I'm struggling to understand how Figure 7 provides such a &quot;clear&quot; image while Table 2 suggests that the chemotype/tree relationship is barely if at all there.</p><p>When the authors are discussing diversity of cardenolides vs. glucosinolates, it seems that the catabolic diversity of glucosinolates should be included. Cardenolides from my understanding function as intact molecules while each glucosinolate can be catabolized to at least three different structures (nitrile, thiocyanate or isothiocyanate) each with different activities. This suggests that the presence or absence of the ESP/TSP/NSP family should be investigated to assess if this might be making up for the lower glucosinolate diversity.</p><p>In both the cardenolide and glucosinolate pathway, is it proper to assume a linear gain of structural diversity? Both pathways appear to be structured to allow for non-linear gains in structural diversity. For example, in the glucosinolate pathway, the simple shift of 3C to 4C gains a suite of new compounds. Could the pathways structures be the reason that there is no evidence for a directional trend and instead a rapid gain? A discussion of how pathway shape influences the assumptions in the gain of chemical diversity should be included. Future work on using modelling to understand how pathway structure and enzyme &quot;promiscuity&quot; may be misleading our assumptions would be really cool but is way outside of the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>I'm somewhat confused by the description of the metabolite analysis. The Materials and methods section alludes to both pools and individuals being analyzed but it isn't clear how many samples were used per species for the figures. For example, in Figure 7, is there no observed within species genetic variation or are all the species selfing meaning that the samples were isogenic? Or are these averages that are blind to potential genetic variation? The same question is true for the cardenolides. Work by Cacho and Strauss showed extensive within species genetic variation across the <italic>Streptanthus</italic> for glucosinolates so it would be very helpful to clarify this.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is a comprehensive study on the origin and diversification of the remarkable <italic>Erysimum</italic> lineage within the Brassicaceae that contains species that produce both glucosinolates as well as cardenolides that deserves to be published in the current venue, in my mind. It is entirely “descriptive” and that's just fine. It provides a wonderful and systematic set of data that can leveraged by many different types of biologists and it provides a real example of the escape and radiate model of Ehrlich and Raven.</p><p>A major question that has evaded us in a general sense is whether there are tradeoffs in the production of these two classes of so-called secondary compounds, as one might expect given their metabolic costs. To test this, they needed to obtain a phylogeny, and the authors sequenced and assembled the genome of an exemplar species, <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> and obtained foliar transcriptomes for 47 additional <italic>Erysimum</italic> species. They also profiled the two chemical classes from these plant species. Further, they complemented this by obtaining glucosinolate-activating myrosinase activity data, inhibition of the animal target of the cardenolides (the sodium pump) by leaf extracts, and inducibility of these defenses in response to application of jasmonic acid, a standard, but not ideal (but often good enough) proxy for chewing herbivore (or necrotoph) attack. The functional work is laudable. They also propose a new pathway for the modification of the simplest cardenolide, digitoxigenin, which may aid in the identification of genes encoding enzymes predicted to be required at different points on the pathway.</p><p>The central questions that they address are: the relative timing of diversification of species in this group, and whether the diversity and amount of glucosinolates is correlated in any way with those in the cardenolides. They find rapid origin for most extant lineages in the clade, and they find a phylogenetic signal for cardenolides (closely related species are more similar in their profiles than less closely related species) but not glucosinolates.</p><p>My main feedback on the phylogenetics is that I thought some of the questions were under-explored. The authors should attempt to create a chronogram so that one could begin to place some dates on different diversification events and the origin of the homologies that are salient here.

They apparently don't, at least at first blush.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript examines the variation in plant defensive metabolites across the genus <italic>Erysimum</italic>, presenting a well-argued motivation for why these should be studied. The manuscript contains a lot of different kinds of data, including a de novo genome assembly, metabolic profiles (under multiple conditions), measurements of enzyme activity, mass spectrometry, and transcriptome sequencing. The genome assembly looks good, and I know very little about the biochemical methods used here. As a result, my review focuses on the transcriptome sequencing and downstream phylogenetic analyses.</p><p>In short, the phylogenetics is lacking. The analyses presented are very incomplete, and some of them are wrong. That being said, there is a lot the authors could conclude without a phylogeny, including almost everything about the lack of correlation between glucosinolates and cardenolides. My comments therefore attempt to describe my concerns about the existing phylogenetic analyses and how they could be improved, and to point out where what is claimed in the current manuscript is unsupported by the data.</p><p>(I apologize ahead of time for the citations to my own work below. I do this not because I expect the papers to be cited, but because they are the easiest examples for me to recall. Feel free to cite alternatives.)</p><p>1) Phylogenomics in a radiation.</p><p>Perhaps the most interesting part of the phylogenetic data is undescribed: the huge amount of gene tree discordance. I can tell that there is a lot of discordance because the ASTRAL internal branches are extremely short, and these are inferred from the amount of discordance observed in the input gene trees. But the paper doesn't describe these gene trees at all, even though this sort of pattern (i.e. radiations with lots of incomplete lineage sorting and/or introgression) is one of the most interesting current patterns in phylogenomics. There are many recent plant examples of this, including Novikova et al., 2016; Pease et al., 2016; Copetti et al., 2017 and Wu et al., 2018.</p><p>This lack of results about discordance is not simply a subject that I think would be nice for the manuscript. Rather, I think these results are required to put the radiation in context, for a number of reasons. First, though the manuscript focuses on the statistical support for individual nodes, this support is misleading about the history of individual gene trees. One can have 100% statistical support for a branch, but still have most gene trees be discordant with it. So, at a basic descriptive level, I would argue that only reporting support values is misleading.</p><p>Second, as has been discussed in multiple recent papers about radiations and histories with discordance (e.g. Pease et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2018), standard phylogenetic methods looking at trait evolution will fail. This occurs because the traits are analyzed using the species tree, even though traits follow individual gene trees (this general problem has been termed &quot;hemiplasy&quot;). For example, diversity present in the common ancestor of some or all of the species in the genus may sort among species (via drift or selection), resulting in an incongruent trait pattern. But each of these traits only needed to arise once-there is no need to invoke complex evolutionary scenarios such as the one described.</p><p>How hemiplasy interacts with continuous traits is less clear and is an active area of research (e.g. Mendes et al., 2018). What is clear, however, is that simply simulating Brownian motion of a trait across a fixed species tree (as is done here in the analyses for Blomberg's K, for instance), is not a good model for how traits are truly evolving in clades such as this one.</p><p>In summary, there are a number of analyses that should be run to describe the data better (gene or site discordance), and a number of analyses and conclusions that should be re-thought in light of whatever levels of discordance are found.</p><p>2) Phylogenomic methods.</p><p>I had a number of basic questions about the analyses being done, and two suggested (though not necessary) analyses. First, the suggested analyses: why not date the <italic>Erysimum</italic> radiation here? Strangely, the authors rely on dating from a paper with one locus (I believe), when they should be able to do a much better job. Later in the manuscript the authors even dismiss these earlier papers because they used &quot;conventional approaches&quot; for phylogenetics (which I think means only a handful of loci), so it is strange to see this straightforward analysis lacking here. The second suggested analysis is of introgression: the authors have more than enough data to test for introgression, either across the tree as a whole or in individual parts (e.g. using the ABBA-BABA test). The manuscript vaguely invokes the possibility of introgression in this genus, but why not test for it directly?</p><p>In terms of the analyses that are done, I noticed that the ASTRAL tree presented has equal branch lengths across all tips. Because ASTRAL infers branch lengths from levels of discordance, it cannot directly estimate tip branches when one sample per species is used. It appears that the authors have simply used a standard unit branch length for all the tips (in my experience, ASTRAL assigns these branches a length of 1 coalescent unit, but no units are given on this tree, so it is hard to tell). This usage is incorrect, as the ASTRAL tree has no information about tip branches. The authors should either present a different tree or find a different way to express terminal branch lengths.</p><p>The authors do seem to use branch lengths in substitutions per site when they need them for the comparative methods, but these lengths come from a different dataset (with one-quarter as many loci) and a tree with a different topology. Instead, if the authors want to use this type of branch length, they should either make a concatenated tree from the full dataset or use a method like StarBeast2 (Ogilvie et al., 2017, MBE) to infer proper branch lengths.</p><p>I also wondered why there is a whole other method for identifying orthologs presented. This method is both very confusing (i.e. I could not follow the methods) and it is basically not used. The only place it really seems to be used is in constructing a tree with branch lengths in substitutions per site, but it would be much more appropriate to do this with the larger dataset (and would allow for a direct comparison of concatenation and ASTRAL using the same dataset; plus, the branch to the species with a genome is strangely long in the tree that is presented). Furthermore, comparison of the trees reveals a bunch of differences, including in branches supported by posterior probabilities of 1, unlike what is stated in the main text. Maybe drop this second dataset?</p><p>3) Phylogenetic comparative methods and ancestral states.</p><p>As alluded to earlier, I think there are real problems with applying standard phylogenetic comparative methods to radiations. This affects not only the inferred modes of evolution, but the rates as well. Given that the main effect of discordance should be in erasing phylogenetic signal, it was actually surprising to me that so many traits had significant values of Blomberg's K that were &gt;1. I think this result means that lots of similarities are driven by geographical area, so that variance between clades (which are geographically structured) is much greater than variance within clades. It's also interesting that other traits do not show these patterns, and again I want to point out that similar differences between traits have been found in other radiations (e.g. Wu et al., 2018).</p><p>More importantly, I think there are two problems in how the trees and analyses are interpreted:</p><p>First, the authors claim that there is rapid evolution of cardenolides. It is not clear where this comes from. The only test I could find is for directionality of cardenolides, as opposed to a Brownian motion model. I am unsure how this is a test for rapid evolution (especially since it is the lack of significance that appears to be taken as positive evidence), nor how any trait would pass such a test on the tree being used. If the rapid evolution of these traits is going to be a major conclusion of the current manuscript (it's in the title, after all), a much clearer description of the evidence for this is needed.</p><p>Second, throughout the manuscript the authors refer to &quot;early-diverging&quot; species as if they somehow represent the ancestral state. Phylogenetic trees cannot be read in this manner, and there is nothing more ancestral about species on one side or the other of the deepest splits in a tree. All of this language and conclusions should be fixed.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Independent evolution of ancestral and novel defenses in a genus of toxic plants (<italic>Erysimum</italic>, Brassicaceae)&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Even for the analyses still included that I don't quite agree with, I think the authors have done well in explaining what the problems might be. I thank them for all their hard work.</p><p>Given this, I do have several suggestions about how to clarify the new analyses and the way they are discussed.</p><p>1) The language surrounding concordance factors (and discordance in general) has a few problems.</p><p>a) For instance, the authors say: &quot;Despite considerable discordance in the ASTRAL species tree…&quot; But this is not right: the discordance is in the species tree, not somehow only in the ASTRAL tree. The same short branches are obvious in the ExaML tree, and there is also discordance with it. This problem would most helpfully be solved by displaying the concordance factors on the tree shown in the main text (regardless of which algorithm produced it) – this is easily done with the numbers the authors have already calculated.</p><p>b) The &quot;distinct geographic clades&quot; referred to in the text all seem to be supported by equal to or less than ~50% of gene trees. While this does not make them any less correlated with geography, it also doesn't mean that gene tree discordance across these clades should be ignored. (The agreement between the ASTRAL topology and the ExaML topology on these clades is not extra evidence of anything.)</p><p>c) I think the text misstates what the concordance factors are: these are not only a proportion relative to the top three topologies. These are the proportion of all informative trees that support the most common topology (though ASTRAL will also report the proportion supporting the second- and third-most common topologies).</p><p>2) I had a question about the detected phylogenetic signal in cardenolides. I noticed that the text reports a &quot;strong correlation&quot; between cardenolide profile and phylogenetic relatedness, but when I tried to compare the cardenolide chemogram to the phylogeny (by eye), I found that they were very different, except for one &quot;clade&quot; of Spanish/Moroccan plants. How can these two things both be true?</p><p>Similarly, can the authors explain the two apparently contradictory patterns reported in this sentence: &quot;In contrast, species formed less distinct clusters based on similarity in cardenolide defenses, but more related species shared more similar cardenolide profiles&quot;.</p><p>Is there a biological interpretation to this?</p><p>3) The introgression analyses are not very clear. First, HyDE is explicitly testing for homoploid hybrid speciation. Is this what the authors think is happening in <italic>Erysimum</italic>? I would have thought that a standard D-test would be more agnostic about patterns of discordance due to introgression.</p><p>Second, I can't find a list of results or a description of how many tests were carried out, etc. for these tests. The supplementary figure simply says that significant results are shown.</p><p>4) The authors have added a bunch of new analyses of speciation rates but have failed to correct for the many tests they have carried out. These analyses calculate &quot;tip-specific&quot; speciation rates in two different ways, but then test for associations with multiple measures of both glucosinolates and cardenolides, and in multiple different ways.</p><p>Multiple-test corrections must be carried out, including correcting for tests on variables that are reported as &quot;not shown.&quot; The discussion of these results should also be updated to reflect corrected p-values.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Independent evolution of ancestral and novel defenses in a genus of toxic plants (<italic>Erysimum</italic>, Brassicaceae)&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

This analysis appears to be using a single BLAST score value to call homology without phylogenetic interpretation whereas in the myrosinase family, there is an excellent alignment based approach. There are a number of reasons that make me request that a similar phylogenetic approach be used for all steps in the biosynthetic pathway similar to what was done with myrosinase. First, the use of the threshold similarity value can be misleading if the divergence happened after the Erysimum/Arabidopsis split. For example, AOP2/AOP3 likely diverged within the Arabidopsis species and as such the difficulty of finding only AOP3 and not AOP2 is likely due to this fact. This is equally true for GS-OH where the similarity value would be similar between the non-functional and functional GS-OH enzymes in Arabidopsis. There are also very few species between Erysimum and Arabidopsis that have the GS-OH product or even precursor so it is not clear if we should expect conservation of the gene. Another indicator that phylogenetic approaches should be used is that a tree with just Arabidopsis species shows that there is not a 1:1 orthology conservation in the FMO GS-OX family and as such it is highly unlikely that this is true to Erysimum. I agree that for most steps, the data supports the presence of a gene, but to really clarify the relationships and predictions, this should be based on phylogenies for each gene family. Optimally, this would be using Brassica as an outgroup to help position the Arabidopsis/Erysimum relationships. This is true for both the aliphatic and indolic pathways.</p></disp-quote><p>We have constructed and added phylogenetic trees of aliphatic and indole glucosinolate genes using sequences from <italic>E. cheiranthoides, A. thaliana</italic>, and <italic>B. oleracea.</italic> These have been added to the revised manuscript as figure supplements to Figures 3 and 4. Note that some <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> gene names have changed due to further refinement of the genome assembly and annotation since the previous submission of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The chemical diversity in glucosinolates is largely an epistatic interaction of the side-chain modifying genes and the MAM locus. In Table 2, principal components of the Bray-Curtiss Matrices are used to describe the chemical diversity. Given the heatmap in Figure 7, there is a tree relationship largely driven by the bottom cluster. Further, the authors are able to classify based on the ALK/MSO/MSI status. This suggests that the linear decomposition is creating a false negative. Another way to test this would be to create a genotypic matrix based on the imputed status of the major structural loci within each species and then compare the tree derived from this glucosinolate &quot;genotype&quot; to the genomic &quot;Tree&quot;. Presently, I'm struggling to understand how Figure 7 provides such a &quot;clear&quot; image while Table 2 suggests that the chemotype/tree relationship is barely if at all there.</p></disp-quote><p>The heatmap in Figure 7 is structured by chemical similarity, and the “tree” in panel A is a chemogram that clusters together the chemically most similar species. The very clear structure in this chemogram (and the lack thereof in Figure 10) indicates that glucosinolate chemotypes are likely driven by a small number of major effect genes (mainly the MAM and ALK/MSO/MSI loci), whereas cardenolide chemotypes appear to be driven by more minor effect genes with less distinct distributions among species. However, there is no direct link of this figure to phylogenetic relatedness, explaining why the first and second coordinates of the glucosinolate PCoA show no phylogenetic signal. We have now added two analyses to clarify these results. First, we have added Mantel tests that compare the full chemical dissimilarity matrix to the cophenetic distance matrix, with equivalent results. In addition, we have added a figure supplement (Figure 5—figure supplement 3) in which we reconstruct ancestral states for total glucosinolate/cardenolide compounds and for the first principal coordinates of each compound dissimilarity matrix. This highlights that the lack of phylogenetic signal for glucosinolates is driven by several clades in which closely related species evolved in opposite directions on the first PCoA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>When the authors are discussing diversity of cardenolides vs. glucosinolates, it seems that the catabolic diversity of glucosinolates should be included. Cardenolides from my understanding function as intact molecules while each glucosinolate can be catabolized to at least three different structures (nitrile, thiocyanate or isothiocyanate) each with different activities. This suggests that the presence or absence of the ESP/TSP/NSP family should be investigated to assess if this might be making up for the lower glucosinolate diversity.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point, and we have included it as part of our discussion. Unfortunately, we did not measure glucosinolate breakdown products on the 48 species, which would be the most direct test of potential “hidden” chemical diversity. We have, however, constructed a phylogenetic tree of the ESP/TSP/NSP family from <italic>E. cheiranthoides, A. thaliana</italic>, and <italic>B. oleracea</italic> (Figure 4—figure supplement 11). This shows the likely presence of these genes in <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> and suggests that there is variation in glucosinolate breakdown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In both the cardenolide and glucosinolate pathway, is it proper to assume a linear gain of structural diversity? Both pathways appear to be structured to allow for non-linear gains in structural diversity. For example, in the glucosinolate pathway, the simple shift of 3C to 4C gains a suite of new compounds. Could the pathways structures be the reason that there is no evidence for a directional trend and instead a rapid gain? A discussion of how pathway shape influences the assumptions in the gain of chemical diversity should be included. Future work on using modelling to understand how pathway structure and enzyme &quot;promiscuity&quot; may be misleading our assumptions would be really cool but is way outside of the scope of this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that biosynthesis of both compounds should be considered as networks rather than linear pathways, and future analysis of pathway structures would be a highly exciting area of research. For the current study we maintain the more linear presentation of biosynthesis but highlight that this likely is an oversimplification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I'm somewhat confused by the description of the metabolite analysis. The Materials and methods section alludes to both pools and individuals being analyzed but it isn't clear how many samples were used per species for the figures. For example, in Figure 7, is there no observed within species genetic variation or are all the species selfing meaning that the samples were isogenic? Or are these averages that are blind to potential genetic variation? The same question is true for the cardenolides. Work by Cacho and Strauss showed extensive within species genetic variation across the Streptanthus for glucosinolates so it would be very helpful to clarify this.</p></disp-quote><p>None of the plants used for chemical analysis were isogenic (<italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> used for chemistry was F1), but nonetheless genetic variation was likely quite low, with seeds mostly originating from single mothers. In addition, species obtained from Botanical Gardens likely experienced significant inbreeding, as they often had been cultivated in small artificial populations for several years after initial collection from the field. Due to the low availability of multiple natural accessions for most species and varying degrees of “natural” levels of genetic diversity among species, we decided to use an averaging approach that is intentionally blind to intraspecific variation. We added statements to make this more explicit. However, at least for the annual <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> we have evidence that intraspecific variation is lower than might be expected. Among a collection of more than 20 natural accessions we find no variation in glucosinolate profiles, and only moderate variation in cardenolide profiles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>My main feedback on the phylogenetics is that I thought some of the questions were under-explored.

The different speciation rates measures and statistical methods largely agree in their main results and reveal a lack of correlation between glucosinolate compound numbers or concentrations and speciation rates.

Nonetheless, we argue that for a broadly comparative study such as ours, a simple analysis such as Blomberg’s K still provides valuable first insights.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In summary, there are a number of analyses that should be run to describe the data better (gene or site discordance), and a number of analyses and conclusions that should be re-thought in light of whatever levels of discordance are found.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope that our modified analyses and discussion of results now appropriately reflect the levels of discordance found within our species tree.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Phylogenomic methods.</p><p>I had a number of basic questions about the analyses being done, and two suggested (though not necessary) analyses. First, the suggested analyses: why not date the Erysimum radiation here? Strangely, the authors rely on dating from a paper with one locus (I believe), when they should be able to do a much better job. Later in the manuscript the authors even dismiss these earlier papers because they used &quot;conventional approaches&quot; for phylogenetics (which I think means only a handful of loci), so it is strange to see this straightforward analysis lacking here. The second suggested analysis is of introgression: the authors have more than enough data to test for introgression, either across the tree as a whole or in individual parts (e.g. using the ABBA-BABA test). The manuscript vaguely invokes the possibility of introgression in this genus, but why not test for it directly?</p></disp-quote><p>We now have included a dated, ultrametric ExaML tree which provides estimates of divergence time. This analysis used treePL in which we relied on a few estimates from published studies to constrain specific nodes (see Materials and methods). Without these constraints, divergence time estimates would not have matched the general consensus of a very recent radiation of the genus. However, it seems feasible that polyploidization, chimerism, and hybridization could result in incorrect estimation of divergence times in our dataset. As such, we acknowledge the relatively weak confidence in our own divergence time estimates, and we also removed all statements dismissing earlier papers’ estimates.</p><p>To quantify hybridization we used HyDe (see Materials and methods), which revealed high levels of hybridization across all 48 species and provides a likely explanation for the high levels of discordance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In terms of the analyses that are done, I noticed that the ASTRAL tree presented has equal branch lengths across all tips. Because ASTRAL infers branch lengths from levels of discordance, it cannot directly estimate tip branches when one sample per species is used. It appears that the authors have simply used a standard unit branch length for all the tips (in my experience, ASTRAL assigns these branches a length of 1 coalescent unit, but no units are given on this tree, so it is hard to tell). This usage is incorrect, as the ASTRAL tree has no information about tip branches. The authors should either present a different tree or find a different way to express terminal branch lengths.</p></disp-quote><p>We now present an ASTRAL tree with terminal branch length manually adjusted to 0.2 coalescent units as a supplementary figure to highlight tree discordance (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). As our main tree we present a concatenated and dated ExaML tree in which branch lengths correspond to estimated divergence times.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors do seem to use branch lengths in substitutions per site when they need them for the comparative methods, but these lengths come from a different dataset (with one-quarter as many loci) and a tree with a different topology. Instead, if the authors want to use this type of branch length, they should either make a concatenated tree from the full dataset or use a method like StarBeast2 (Ogilvie et al., 2017, MBE) to infer proper branch lengths.</p></disp-quote><p>While we have removed the main inadequate analysis that relied on branch lengths as substitutions per site (see below), we now use an ultrametric ExaML tree for all our remaining and new analyses. There are several differences in topology between the ASTRAL and ExaML trees, likely reflecting the high degree of gene discordance among species. However, the main geographic clades are conserved between the trees, and the direction of results from trait analyses remained unchanged, thus we believe this approach is adequate for an evaluation of general patterns in our chemistry data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also wondered why there is a whole other method for identifying orthologs presented. This method is both very confusing (i.e. I could not follow the methods) and it is basically not used. The only place it really seems to be used is in constructing a tree with branch lengths in substitutions per site, but it would be much more appropriate to do this with the larger dataset (and would allow for a direct comparison of concatenation and ASTRAL using the same dataset; plus, the branch to the species with a genome is strangely long in the tree that is presented). Furthermore, comparison of the trees reveals a bunch of differences, including in branches supported by posterior probabilities of 1, unlike what is stated in the main text. Maybe drop this second dataset?</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion we removed the separate method for identifying orthologs and tree construction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Phylogenetic comparative methods and ancestral states.</p><p>As alluded to earlier, I think there are real problems with applying standard phylogenetic comparative methods to radiations. This affects not only the inferred modes of evolution, but the rates as well. Given that the main effect of discordance should be in erasing phylogenetic signal, it was actually surprising to me that so many traits had significant values of Blomberg's K that were &gt;1. I think this result means that lots of similarities are driven by geographical area, so that variance between clades (which are geographically structured) is much greater than variance within clades. It's also interesting that other traits do not show these patterns, and again I want to point out that similar differences between traits have been found in other radiations (e.g. Wu et al., 2018).</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the limitation of standard phylogenetic analyses using single fixed trees and have added discussion points throughout to highlight these limitations and place our results better in the context of other recent studies. However, we decided to keep the analyses of Blomberg’s K as we believe they still provide meaningful results. Phylogenetic distances captured by both the ExaML and ASTRAL trees are highly correlated with geographic distances, and as such we agree that geographical area is likely a major driver of similarities in cardenolides, as captured by Blomberg’s K. Nonetheless, the lack of an equivalent signal in glucosinolates indicates that different mechanisms are determining glucosinolate and cardenolide phenotypes. To visualize these differences even better, we also added new analyses in which we reconstruct the ancestral states of total concentrations and the first PCoA for both glucosinolates and cardenolides (Figure 5—figure supplement 3). Together, these results clearly demonstrate that closely related and co-occurring species share the same cardenolide but distinct glucosinolate phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More importantly, I think there are two problems in how the trees and analyses are interpreted:</p><p>First, the authors claim that there is rapid evolution of cardenolides. It is not clear where this comes from. The only test I could find is for directionality of cardenolides, as opposed to a Brownian motion model. I am unsure how this is a test for rapid evolution (especially since it is the lack of significance that appears to be taken as positive evidence), nor how any trait would pass such a test on the tree being used. If the rapid evolution of these traits is going to be a major conclusion of the current manuscript (it's in the title, after all), a much clearer description of the evidence for this is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed all mentions of speed from the text and title and have removed the test of directionality. We generally de-emphasize the speed of trait changes, but rather focus on the apparently independent evolution of glucosinolate and cardenolide traits.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, throughout the manuscript the authors refer to &quot;early-diverging&quot; species as if they somehow represent the ancestral state. Phylogenetic trees cannot be read in this manner, and there is nothing more ancestral about species on one side or the other of the deepest splits in a tree. All of this language and conclusions should be fixed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have carefully checked the text and removed all mentions of “early-diverging”.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are three key factors that need to be addressed.</p><p>1) The strength of claims around the concordance factors and general wording needs correcting.</p><p>2) Multiple testing control needs to be described.</p><p>3) A description of if these species fitting the model assumptions.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the three essential revision requests, we have implemented concordance factors on our phylogeny (previously another metric of discordance was used) and made significant edits to the manuscript text to reflect the significant amounts of uncertainty in our phylogenetic analysis. We have modified the section criticized for multiple tests and provide evidence that false positives are unlikely to affect these results, and we argue that the HyDe test for hybridization is robust in response to unknown are likely multiple types of speciation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) The language surrounding concordance factors (and discordance in general) has a few problems.</p><p>a) For instance, the authors say: &quot;Despite considerable discordance in the ASTRAL species tree…&quot; But this is not right: the discordance is in the species tree, not somehow only in the ASTRAL tree. The same short branches are obvious in the ExaML tree, and there is also discordance with it. This problem would most helpfully be solved by displaying the concordance factors on the tree shown in the main text (regardless of which algorithm produced it) – this is easily done with the numbers the authors have already calculated.</p></disp-quote><p>We are aware that discordance is an inherent problem of the species tree and not just the ASTRAL tree. Our point here was simply that because there is this high level of discordance, it is unsurprising that the main topologies of the ExaML and ASTRAL trees don’t fully agree. For the same reason, we cannot use the numbers calculated for the ASTRAL tree to display discordance of the ExaML tree (note that values on the ASTRAL tree are quartet support values, not concordance factors). Instead, we have now calculated gene concordance factors (gCF) for the ExaML tree and display these on the main tree figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The &quot;distinct geographic clades&quot; referred to in the text all seem to be supported by equal to or less than ~50% of gene trees. While this does not make them any less correlated with geography, it also doesn't mean that gene tree discordance across these clades should be ignored. (The agreement between the ASTRAL topology and the ExaML topology on these clades is not extra evidence of anything.)</p></disp-quote><p>Most of the geographic clades of the main species tree are in fact supported by less than 5% of the gene trees when evaluated as concordance factors and have equivalent support over the first and second alternative when evaluated as quartet support values. We have further revised our manuscript to provide a more comprehensive discussion of the discordance results and highlight the combination of factors likely responsible, including methodological issues that could have inflated measures of discordance. We also shortened the discussion of geographic clades and emphasize that there is very low gene concordance supporting these clades. Nonetheless, we argue that the geographic clades uncovered by the main topology of our species tree are biologically meaningful given the high rate of endemism and often highly restricted geographic ranges among species. We maintain the set of phylogenetic analyses that uses the main species tree, and we are convinced that the main results from these analyses are robust even if the species tree is unlikely to be a perfect representation of species relatedness.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) I think the text misstates what the concordance factors are: these are not only a proportion relative to the top three topologies. These are the proportion of all informative trees that support the most common topology (though ASTRAL will also report the proportion supporting the second- and third-most common topologies).</p></disp-quote><p>The estimates of discordance displayed in the ASTRAL tree are not concordance factors but quartet support values for the main topology (q1) relative to the first and second alternative. The minimum of q1 values is therefore of 33%, corresponding to complete discordance. We now have added concordance factors to the ExaML tree, and these are indeed the proportion of all informative trees that support the most common topology. For most deeper nodes, concordance factors are around 1%, highlighting very high levels of gene discordance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I had a question about the detected phylogenetic signal in cardenolides. I noticed that the text reports a &quot;strong correlation&quot; between cardenolide profile and phylogenetic relatedness, but when I tried to compare the cardenolide chemogram to the phylogeny (by eye), I found that they were very different, except for one &quot;clade&quot; of Spanish/Moroccan plants. How can these two things both be true?</p></disp-quote><p>There is indeed a strong statistical correlation between phylogenetic relatedness and similarity in cardenolide profiles. However, this correlation is mostly not driven by whole clades, and therefore it is not easy to see by eye. To improve visualization, we have added co-phylogenetic plots as supplementary figures that optimize tip-to-tip matches between the ExaML phylogeny and the glucosinolate or cardenolide chemograms (Figure 5—figure supplement 4). Two distinct patterns are apparent from these figures that support a phylogenetic signal for cardenolide similarity. First, the number of species pairs for which the closest phylogenetic neighbor is also the most chemically similar species is higher for cardenolides than glucosinolates (12 vs 5 species pairs). Second, the total length of tip-to-tip links between phylogeny and chemograms is approximately twice as high for glucosinolates than it is for cardenolides (quantified by the minRotate coefficients of <italic>cophylo</italic>), which is clearly visible from many more long links. This highlights how closely related species are more often chemically distant for glucosinolates than for cardenolides.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, can the authors explain the two apparently contradictory patterns reported in this sentence: &quot;In contrast, species formed less distinct clusters based on similarity in cardenolide defenses, but more related species shared more similar cardenolide profiles&quot;.</p><p>Is there a biological interpretation to this?</p></disp-quote><p>“Species forming less distinct clusters” referred to the grouping of species into distinct chemotypes. For cardenolides, species could not be grouped into obviously distinct chemotypes and variation in profiles was less often due to clear presence/absence of compounds. The biological interpretation is that glucosinolate chemotypes are likely controlled by a small number of major-effect genes, while cardenolide diversity is more likely generated by many minor-effect genes. We have modified the discussion of these patterns to make this point clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The introgression analyses are not very clear. First, HyDE is explicitly testing for homoploid hybrid speciation. Is this what the authors think is happening in Erysimum? I would have thought that a standard D-test would be more agnostic about patterns of discordance due to introgression.</p></disp-quote><p>The mode of speciation for each species of <italic>Erysimum</italic> is not known, but we believe that HyDe, which allows us to test for patterns of hybridization across the tree at once, provides evidence for the conclusions we make. If multiple modes of speciation are being utilized by <italic>Erysimum</italic>, we may be underestimating hybridization, but since we already are estimating widespread hybridization, we do not think this is a problem.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, I can't find a list of results or a description of how many tests were carried out, etc. for these tests. The supplementary figure simply says that significant results are shown.</p></disp-quote><p>HyDe ran a total of 51,888 tests, from which the software automatically selects the subset of significant results using a Bonferroni corrected p-value. We have added these details to the figure legend and also provide the full list of tests as a file on the Dryad repository.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors have added a bunch of new analyses of speciation rates but have failed to correct for the many tests they have carried out. These analyses calculate &quot;tip-specific&quot; speciation rates in two different ways, but then test for associations with multiple measures of both glucosinolates and cardenolides, and in multiple different ways.</p><p>Multiple-test corrections must be carried out, including correcting for tests on variables that are reported as &quot;not shown.&quot; The discussion of these results should also be updated to reflect corrected p-values.</p></disp-quote><p>Tests for correlations with speciation rates were added in response to a request from reviewer #2 in the previous revision. The results from these tests suggest that the number of cardenolide compounds and tip-specific speciation rates correlate positively, which we believe is an interesting finding. However, we are well aware of the limitations of this approach, particularly given that all analyses rely on the single species tree, which we know to suffer from high level of gene discordance. In consequence, these findings are neither a central aspect of our results nor of our discussion.</p><p>While we acknowledge these limitations, we disagree that multiple-test correction “must be carried out” to make these results more valid. It is obvious that any crude multiple-test correction such as Bonferroni-correction would make modestly significant correlations, such as we found them between cardenolide numbers and speciation rate, become non-significant. However, it is also well known that such corrections are excessively conservative and inflate Type II error.</p><p>We test for correlations in just four traits, the number and concentrations of cardenolides and glucosinolates. Instead of testing a bunch of different analyses and only presenting one test with significant results, we present four tests for each trait, since it is our impression that there is no clear consensus on how to best test for correlations with speciation rates. This brings the total number of tests to 16, but this would still mean we would expect less than one test to be false positive at p=0.05. Furthermore, the four tests per trait are hardly independent: the two speciation rate metrics are highly correlated and only differ slightly in relative weighting of diversification history, and PGLS and simulation tests attempt to model the same correlation but have different methodological biases. Given that three out of four tests involving a single trait are significant or marginal, this strengthens rather than weakens our confidence that this trait may be correlated with speciation rate.</p><p>We have added the missing non-significant test results and now present all 16 tests as the new Table 3. Instead of performing multiple test correction, we have performed a simulation test in which we generated random trait values from a normal distribution, performed all four tests on these random traits, and evaluated how often at least two of the tests were significant at the p=0.05 level. For a set of 1000 random traits, just three met these criteria, thus we conclude that false positives were highly unlikely to affect our results.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>I thank the authors again for all their changes and clarifications. The text is now much clearer, and I think the methods are described in better detail (I do apologize for having missed the fact that they had previously used quartet scores and not concordance factors).</p><p>My one remaining comment involves the new text describing all of the polyploid taxa in this clade, and the possibility that orthologs have been misidentified, leading to higher-than-expected discordance. While I think it is good to raise this possibility here, I request that the authors add a note of caution to the interpretation of the hybridization analyses, as these could also be affected by the same problem (e.g. allopolyploidy could look like between-species introgression).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the requested statement to our Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
