Synapses contain two pools of receptors, immobilized and diffusing receptors, both of which are confined to post-synaptic elements. Here we show that immobile and diffusing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are stabilized by distinct synaptic scaffolds at <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuromuscular junctions. Immobilized GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are stabilized by binding to FRM-3/EPB4.1 and LIN-2A/CASK. Diffusing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are stabilized by the synaptic adhesion molecules Neurexin and Neuroligin. Inhibitory post-synaptic currents are eliminated in double mutants lacking both scaffolds. Neurexin, Neuroligin, and CASK mutations are all linked to Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Our results suggest that these mutations may directly alter inhibitory transmission, which could contribute to the developmental and cognitive deficits observed in ASD.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09648.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09648.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09648.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Behaviors ranging from movement to memory are dependent on the activity of extensive networks of cells called neurons. Within these networks, neurons communicate across junctions called synapses. The arrival of an electrical signal called an action potential at the ‘presynaptic’ neuron on one side of the synapse triggers the neuron to release chemical neurotransmitter molecules into the synapse. These molecules then bind to receptors on the ‘postsynaptic’ cell on the other side of the synapse.</p><p>At excitatory synapses, the binding of neurotransmitter to postsynaptic receptors increases the likelihood that the postsynaptic cell will fire its own action potential. By contrast, at inhibitory synapses the binding of neurotransmitters reduces the chances of the postsynaptic cell firing. Most inhibitory synapses use a type of neurotransmitter called GABA, which exerts its effects mainly by binding to a class of receptors called GABA-activated chloride channels (also known as GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors).</p><p>GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors at inhibitory synapses can themselves be divided into two groups: ‘mobile’ receptors, which can move within the cell membrane that surrounds the postsynaptic cell; and ‘immobilized’ receptors that form clusters and cannot move. Recent work in mammalian cells identified a protein complex that anchors GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors to the cell's internal skeleton to immobilize the receptors. However, there is evidence to suggest that these are not the only proteins that control the location of the receptors.</p><p>By studying the inhibitory synapses formed between neurons and body muscles in the roundworm species <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, Tong, Hu et al. now show that different groups of proteins maintain the positioning of immobilized and mobile receptors. Specifically, proteins called LIN-2A (a component of the cell's internal skeleton) and FRM-3 (which joins receptors to the cell's skeleton) immobilize GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, whilst the proteins Neuroligin and Neurexin ensure that mobile GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors remain within the synapse.</p><p>Disturbances to the activity of inhibitory synapses are often seen in autism spectrum disorders, and so too are mutations in the genes that encode the mammalian equivalents of Neuroligin, Neurexin and LIN-2A. The work of Tong, Hu et al. thus suggests a mechanism by which these mutations might contribute to information processing impairments in people with autism. Further research could now investigate if (and how) other genes linked to autism spectrum disorders alter inhibitory synapses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09648.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09648.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>autism</kwd><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd><kwd>GABA-A receptors</kwd><kwd>CASK</kwd><kwd>neurexin</kwd><kwd>neuroligin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS32196</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tong</surname><given-names>Xia-Jing</given-names></name><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Zhitao</given-names></name><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>Dorian</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaplan</surname><given-names>Joshua M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SF273555</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tong</surname><given-names>Xia-Jing</given-names></name><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Zhitao</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yu</given-names></name><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>Dorian</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaplan</surname><given-names>Joshua M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mobile and immobile GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuromuscular synapse are stabilized by two distinct protein scaffolds.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fast synaptic inhibition is primarily mediated by the neurotransmitter GABA and GABA-activated chloride channels (GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors). Several studies suggest that an important mechanism for modulating inhibitory transmission is altered abundance of synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. In mammalian neurons, variation in the amplitude of miniature inhibitory post-synaptic currents (mIPSCs) is caused by corresponding differences in the abundance of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nusser et al., 1997</xref>). Long term potentiation of GABAergic transmission is associated with increased mIPSC amplitudes and increased GABA<sub>A</sub> abundance at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petrini et al., 2014</xref>) while the converse effects are associated with long term depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bannai et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors on the cell surface are mobile, undergoing lateral diffusion in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jacob et al., 2005</xref>). Like all synaptic receptors, GABA<sub>A</sub> diffusion is significantly reduced at synapses, resulting in accumulation of receptors at the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jacob et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thomas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bannai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petrini et al., 2014</xref>). Local confinement of receptors at synapses is termed diffusional trapping and is mediated by binding to cytoplasmic scaffolds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choquet and Triller, 2013</xref>). The post-synaptic scaffold that immobilizes GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors is proposed to consist of a ternary complex of Gephyrin, Neuroligin-2 (NL2), and collybistin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jacob et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Poulopoulos et al., 2009</xref>). Gephyrin binds directly to the large cytoplasmic loop between the third and fourth transmembrane domains (TM3-4 loop) of GABRA1 and 2 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tretter et al., 2008</xref>), thereby confining these receptors at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jacob et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mukherjee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saliba et al., 2012</xref>). Genetic manipulations impairing the Gephyrin/NL2/Collybistin complex invariably decrease but fail to eliminate synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kneussel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Papadopoulos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Poulopoulos et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, it is likely that additional proteins are involved in this process.</p><p>Within a post-synaptic element, receptors exhibit heterogenous behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choquet and Triller, 2013</xref>). At both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, super-resolution imaging suggests that a subset of receptors are localized in immobile nanoclusters (∼75 nm in diameter) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nair et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Specht et al., 2013</xref>). These immobile receptors undergo dynamic exchange with diffusing receptors that are confined to synapses. These studies highlight several important questions. Do immobile and diffusing receptors both contribute to IPSCs? Current models propose that post-synaptic currents are mediated by immobilized receptors and synaptic plasticity is mediated by the dynamic exchange of receptors between the diffusing and immobile pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choquet and Triller, 2013</xref>). It has not been possible to genetically test these models because mutations that selectively disrupt the two receptor pools are not available. What are the synaptic scaffolds that stabilize immobilized and diffusing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors? What controls the exchange between the two receptor pools?</p><p>Here we utilize the <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a model to address these questions. We show that immobilized and diffusing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are stabilized by two distinct post-synaptic scaffolds both of which contain subunits encoded by genes linked to ASD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inhibitory synapses contain both mobile and immobile UNC-49/GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> body muscles receive direct inhibitory input from GABAergic motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">White et al., 1986</xref>).

Mutants lacking UNC-49 receptors have defects in GABA-activated muscle currents, as assessed by recording miniature inhibitory post-synaptic currents (mIPSCs) and muscle currents evoked by an exogenous GABA agonist (muscimol) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–E</xref>). An mIPSC corresponds to the current evoked by the fusion of a single synaptic vesicle at a GABAergic NMJ and, consequently, measures the function of synaptic UNC-49 receptors. Muscimol activates all surface UNC-49 receptors (including non-synaptic receptors in the nerve cord and muscle cell bodies). The mIPSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>) and muscimol-evoked current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>) defects of <italic>unc-49</italic> mutants were rescued by a transgene expressing GFP-tagged UNC-49B receptor in body muscles.

These results demonstrate that the GFP-tag (inserted into the TM3-4 loop) did not impair UNC-49B receptor function.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09648.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Inhibitory NMJs contain both mobile and immobile UNC-49/GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>E</bold>) mIPSCs and muscimol-evoked currents were abolished in <italic>unc-49</italic> mutants, and were restored by a transgene expressing GFP-tagged UNC-49B in body muscles. mIPSCs (<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>) and muscimol-evoked currents (<bold>D</bold>, <bold>E</bold>) were recorded from adult body wall muscles.

To assess the mobility of synaptic UNC-49B receptors, we measured fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of GFP-UNC-49B puncta in the dorsal nerve cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>). FRAP assesses the mobility of proteins in vivo whereby increased mobility is indicated by increased FRAP. UNC-49B puncta that were co-localized with mCherry-tagged RAB-3 expressed in GABAergic motor neurons were considered synaptic. In wild type controls, 40% of UNC-49B puncta fluorescence was mobile in FRAP experiments, with recovery occurring several minutes after photobleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). GFP-UNC-49B puncta fluorescence could comprise receptors on the cell surface and those in intracellular organelles. To more accurately assess the mobility of surface receptors, we analyzed UNC-49B receptors containing a pH-sensitive GFP (pHluorin) tag in the ecto-domain (pH-UNC-49B). pHluorin fluorescence is quenched in intracellular acidic compartments (e.g., endosomes); consequently, pHluorin fluorescence primarily results from molecules in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miesenbock et al., 1998</xref>). In wild type animals, 46% of pH-UNC-49B synaptic fluorescence recovered following photobleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Because similar mobile fractions were observed with the GFP and pHluorin tagged receptors, these results suggest that the majority of UNC-49B puncta fluorescence results from receptors in the plasma membrane. Collectively, these results suggest that UNC-49B synaptic puncta comprise a mixture of mobile (∼40% total) and immobilized (∼60% total) receptors on the cell surface. Prior studies utilizing both FRAP and single molecule tracking techniques reported similar proportions of mobile and immobilized receptors at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in cultured mammalian neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jacob et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashby et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heine et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>FRM-3/EPB4.1 binds the UNC-49B TM3-4 cytoplasmic loop</title><p>ERM (Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin) domain containing proteins couple cell surface receptors to the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tepass, 2009</xref>) and are implicated in targeting synaptic glutamate receptors and extra-synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biederer and Sudhof, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Loebrich et al., 2006</xref>).

The coefficient of variation (CV) of the mIPSC amplitudes was ∼0.6–7 in wild type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>), which is similar to values reported for some mammalian CNS synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bekkers et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hanse and Gustafsson, 2001</xref>).

Our results lead to seven conclusions. First, UNC-49 synaptic puncta comprise both mobile and immobilized receptors, consistent with prior studies analysing mammalian synapses. Second, immobilized UNC-49B is stabilized at synapses via binding to FRM-3/EPB4.1 and LIN-2A/CASK. Third, mobile UNC-49B is stabilized at synapses by post-synaptic NLG-1/Neuroligin. Fourth, pre-synaptic NRX-1α/Neurexin inhibits the immobilization of NLG-1 stabilized UNC-49B. Fifth, the FRM-3 and NLG-1 stabilized receptor pools both contribute to inhibitory synaptic transmission. Sixth, both scaffolds increase the variability of quantal responses. And seventh, all synaptic UNC-49 receptors can be explained by these two scaffolds. Below we discuss the significance of these findings.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Two pools of synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors</title><p>Synaptic UNC-49/GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are confined by two scaffolds that function in parallel. The FRM-3/EPB4.1 and LIN-2A/CASK scaffold accounts for ∼40% of synaptic receptors while the NLG-1 scaffold accounts for ∼30% of synaptic UNC-49 (assessed by puncta fluorescence). These scaffolds define two pools of synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors that function independently. In double mutants lacking both pools, immobilized synaptic UNC-49 receptors and mIPSCs are eliminated. Mobile receptors detected by FRAP in <italic>frm-3 nlg-1</italic> double mutants likely correspond to extra-synaptic receptors on the cell surface (which mediate muscimol-activated currents). Thus, the FRM-3 and NLG-1 scaffolds together account for all GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors at the body wall NMJ. Consequently, the dynamics of GABA<sub>A</sub> levels at this synapse will be determined by the detailed biochemistry of these two scaffolds. Our results also suggest that synaptic receptors represent a small fraction of total surface UNC-49 receptors. Mutants lacking both scaffolds have no defect in total surface receptors (assessed by muscimol-activated currents). Thus, these scaffolds have no effect on the assembly, anterograde trafficking, and surface delivery of UNC-49 receptors. Instead, these scaffolds play a specific role in concentrating UNC-49 surface receptors at synapses.</p><p>Our results strongly support the idea that both GABA<sub>A</sub> pools are required for inhibitory synaptic transmission. Mutations inactivating the FRM-3/LIN-2A scaffold caused similar decreases in immobilized UNC-49B (40% decrease) and mIPSC amplitude (30% decrease). Inactivating NLG-1 caused corresponding decreases in total synaptic UNC-49B (30% decrease), mobile UNC-49B (40% decrease), and mIPSC amplitudes (48% decrease). Thus, analysis of single mutants suggests that FRM-3 and NLG-1 stabilized receptors contribute equally to post-synaptic currents.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>FRM-3/EPB4.1 and LIN-2A/CASK define an immobile pool of synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors</title><p>We show that FRM-3/EPB4.1 and LIN-2A/CASK together comprise a scaffold that immobilizes synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Other ERM domain containing proteins were previously implicated in neurotransmitter receptor localization. The ERM protein Radixin stabilizes extra-synaptic GABRA5 receptors in mammalian neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Loebrich et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that different populations of GABA receptors are stabilized by distinct ERM proteins. Mammalian EPB4.1 and its <italic>Drosophila</italic> counterpart (coracle) were previously implicated in synaptic localization of glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2005</xref>). Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission were not significantly altered in mouse CASK knockouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atasoy et al., 2007</xref>); however, subtle defects (e.g., the ∼20% decrease in quantal size reported here) could have been missed in this study. <italic>Drosophila</italic> CASK mutants have decreased targeting of glutamate receptors to larval NMJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Featherstone, 2011</xref>). A role for CASK in synaptic targeting of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors has not been described.</p><p>We found that <italic>frm-3</italic> EPB4.1 and <italic>lin-2</italic> CASK mutants have decreased synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> levels, decreased immobilization of synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, and corresponding decreases in mIPSC amplitudes. Both mutants had significant residual levels of immobile synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and post-synaptic currents. Thus, FRM-3 and LIN-2 define a sub-population of immobilized synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, accounting for ∼40% of total synaptic receptors. For all synaptic phenotypes, <italic>lin-2</italic> defects were less severe than those observed in <italic>frm-3</italic> mutants, perhaps because LIN-2/CASK regulates UNC-49 targeting by modulating FRM-3 function. For example, prior studies suggest that ERM proteins equilibrate between active (open) and inactive (closed) conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pearson et al., 2000</xref>). It is possible that LIN-2/CASK binding stabilizes the active conformation of FRM-3. Collectively, these results suggest that ERM and CASK proteins play a conserved role in targeting neurotransmitter receptors. In each case, CASK and ERM proteins account for a subset of receptors confined to a synapse.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The UNC-49 pool stabilized by pre-synaptic NRX-1α and post-synaptic NLG-1 consists of both immobilized and diffusing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors</title><p>In mammals, Neuroligin 2 works in conjunction with gephyrin and collybistin to localize GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors to synapses. Knockout mutations in each of these genes reduce but do not eliminate synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mukherjee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nair et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Specht et al., 2013</xref>).

The impact of Neuroligin 2 mutations on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor mobility has not been determined. Our results are largely consistent with these prior studies. Mutations inactivating NLG-1 decreased but did not eliminate synaptic UNC-49 and caused a corresponding decrease in mIPSC amplitudes. Two recent studies reported similar effects of <italic>nlg-1</italic> mutations on synaptic UNC-49 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maro et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tu et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, as in mammalian neurons, NLG-1 represents one of multiple mechanisms for confining GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors at synapses. NLG-1 association with UNC-49 could be mediated by binding to an intermediary Gephyrin-like molecule. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of gephyrin is MOC-1; however, its role in synaptic targeting of UNC-49 has not been determined.</p><p>Our studies provide further insights into how Neurexin and Neuroligin function to target synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Two results suggest that the NLG-1 stabilized pool consists of both mobile and immobilized UNC-49 receptors. First, in double mutants lacking both scaffolds (i.e. <italic>frm-3 nlg-1</italic> double mutants), immobilized UNC-49B receptors and mIPSCs were both eliminated. This result implies that immobile UNC-49B receptors observed in <italic>frm-3</italic> single mutants are derived from the NLG-1-stabilized pool and that immobilization of these receptors does not require FRM-3. Second, mIPSC amplitudes and immobile synaptic UNC-49B levels are significantly increased in mutants lacking presynaptic NRX-1α. Both of these effects were abolished in <italic>nrx-1; nlg-1</italic> double mutants. These results suggest that pre-synaptic NRX-1α inhibits immobilization of diffusing NLG-1-stabilized UNC-49 receptors. Trans-synaptic NRX-1α/NLG-1 complexes may confine mobile synaptic receptors via low affinity binding interactions with UNC-49B, or by sterically interfering with UNC-49B lateral diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Santamaria et al., 2010</xref>). Because NLG-1 stabilizes both forms of synaptic receptors, the contribution of the NLG-1 pool to post-synaptic currents could be mediated by immobilized or diffusing UNC-49 receptors (or a mixture of the two).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Both scaffolds increase post-synaptic noise</title><p>Synaptic responses are intrinsically noisy, varying considerably even among inputs to the same cell. This noise arises from variability in both pre- and post-synaptic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lisman et al., 2007</xref>). Prior studies suggested that an important contributor to post-synaptic noise is variation in receptor levels between synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nusser et al., 1997</xref>), which can be adjusted bidirectionally by activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bannai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petrini et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>How do FRM-3 and NLG-1 alter quantal size? Prior modelling studies suggest that the non-homogeneous distribution of synaptic receptors into nanoclusters has profound effects on synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">MacGillavry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nair et al., 2013</xref>). Although these studies analyzed glutamatergic synapses, in the following we assume that similar principles apply to GABAergic synapses. Within post-synaptic elements, ∼60% of receptors are localized in immobile nanoclusters (mean diameter 75 nm, mean receptor number 25) while the remaining ∼40% are mobile and diffusely distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">MacGillavry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nair et al., 2013</xref>). The effect of receptor nanoclusters on transmission results from the fact that a single synaptic vesicle (SV) fusion activates receptors in a subsynaptic domain. For glutamate, the domain of activated receptors is estimated to have diameter ∼200 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Raghavachari and Lisman, 2004</xref>). The size of the GABA domain has not been calculated, but is likely to be larger (due to the higher affinity of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors). SV fusions at <italic>C. elegans</italic> cholinergic and GABAergic NMJs occur in an active zone with a diameter of 700 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hammarlund et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Watanabe et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the spatial extent of GABA in the synaptic cleft will vary depending on the location of the SV fusion event within the active zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barberis et al., 2011</xref>). Consequently, quantal amplitude will vary depending on the proximity of the vesicle fusion site to the receptor nanocluster and the density of receptors in each nanocluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Franks et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">MacGillavry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nair et al., 2013</xref>). By contrast, mobile (unclustered) receptors have lower but uniform surface density; consequently, mobile receptors are predicted to mediate smaller quantal responses that have lower CV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">MacGillavry et al., 2013</xref>). Our results are largely consistent with these modelling studies. The FRM-3 and NLG-1 scaffolds increase mIPSC amplitude and CV, presumably due to an increase in the number of UNC-49 nanoclusters at synapses or an increase in the number of receptors in each nanocluster.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Implications for understanding psychiatric disorders</title><p>Changes in synaptic inhibition are proposed to play an important role in the pathophysiology of several neuropsychiatric disorders. Decreased inhibition is implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003</xref>), whereas excess inhibition has been proposed to occur in mental retardation syndromes, such as Down and Rett Syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kleschevnikov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dani et al., 2005</xref>).

The dissected adult worms were superfused in an extracellular solution containing 127 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 20 mM glucose, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, bubbled with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 95% O<sub>2</sub> at 20°C. Endogenous GABA IPSC recordings were carried out at 0 mV using an internal solution containing 120 mM CsCH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, 4 mM CsCl, 15 mM CsF, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM EGTA, 0.25 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, and 4 mM Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, adjusted to pH 7.2 using CsOH. For muscimol-activated current recordings, 100 μM muscimol was pressure ejected for 1.0 s onto body muscles of adult worms.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Microscopy</title><p>For colocalization studies, images were captured using a 60x objective (NA 1.45) on an Olympus FV-1000 confocal microscope at 5× digital zoom. Worms were immobilized with 30 mg/ml 2,3-Butanedione monoxamine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, United States). UNC-49B puncta fluorescence was quantified by wide field fluorescence microscopy in, the dorsal nerve cord of young adults (midway between the vulva and the tail). Images were acquired using a Zeiss Axioskop I, Olympus PlanAPO 100× 1.4 NA objective, and a CoolSnap HQ CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Tuscon, AZ, United States). Maximum intensity projections of Z-series stacks were made using Metamorph 7.1 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, United States). Line scans of dorsal cord fluorescence were analyzed in Igor Pro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR, United States) using custom-written software. Mean fluorescence of 0.5 μm FluoSphere beads (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, United States), which was measured during each experiment, was used to control the illumination intensity. All fluorescence values are normalized to wild type controls to facilitate comparison. All p-values indicated were based on ONE-way ANOVA or student t-tests.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)</title><p>For FRAP studies, images were captured using a 60x objective (NA 1.45) on an Olympus FV-1000 confocal microscope at 5× digital zoom. Worms were immobilized with 0.1 μm polystyrene microspheres (Polysciences), and pads composed of 10% agarose in M9. To image GFP-UNC-49B, pH-UNC-49B, and RAB-3-mCherry, we used 0.5% power from a 473 nm (GFP) and 559 nm (mCherry) solid state diode laser. Five frames of GFP and mCherry signals were recorded prior to photobleaching. Photobleaching was achieved by one scan (90% power from the 473 nm laser) on a square region of interest (ROI, about 1.5 × 1.5 μm) that covered a single GFP punctum. GFP and mCherry signals were further recorded for 5 min at 0.2 frames/second. To eliminate motion artifacts, traces with more than 10% changes in mCherry signals were discarded. UNC-49B mobile fractions were calculated in MATLAB by fitting the data with a single exponential function, I<sub>frap</sub>(t) = A(1-e<sup>-τt</sup>), where A is reported as the mobile fraction. Statistical significance was determined using ONE-way ANOVA or Student's t test and all values reported are means ±SEM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Co-Immunoprecipitation</title><p>Extracts were prepared from mixed staged worms expressing GFP-UNC-49 or GFP-UNC-49 and FLAG-FRM3 using a microfluidizer in buffer A (50 mM HEPES PH7.7, 50 mM KAc, 2mMgAc<sub>2</sub>, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA and proteinase inhibitors). Worm extracts were clarified by centrifugation (15 min, 7000g). Membranes were isolated from the resulting supernatant by high speed centrifugation (40 min, 45,000g). Membrane proteins were solubilized with a dounce homogenizer (5 times) in IP buffer (20 mM HEPES PH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0,1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton and proteinase inhibitors), and incubated with FLAG M2 affinity gel (A2220) overnight at 4<sup>o</sup>. Flag affinity gel were washed three times with IP buffer, and eluted with loading buffer for Western blot.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the following for strains and reagents: the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Genetics Stock Center and Jean-Louis Bessereau.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. One of the three reviewers, Kang Shen (Reviewer 2), has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Previous single molecule-receptor tracking experiments have identified mobile and immobile pools of postsynaptic receptors at excitatory and inhibitory synapses, although these results rely on mostly in vitro results. Tong et al. employ in vivo approaches to demonstrate that there are mobile and immobile pools of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (UNC-49) at <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuromuscular junctions. In addition, they explore molecular mechanisms that control UNC-49 localization and report distinct phenotypes for two different scaffolds, one consisting of the trans-synaptic neurexin-neuroligin complex and one consisting of a cytoplasmic scaffold containing FRM-3 and LIN-2. Mutation of each scaffold individually produces specific phenotypes with respect to receptor mobility (assessed by FRAP) and synaptic transmission. Importantly, the authors find that FRM-3 and NLG-1, function in parallel to recruit GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors to synapses, and that simultaneous inactivation of both scaffolds results in a near complete loss of GABAergic transmission and receptor stabilization at synapses.</p><p>This work complements two very recent studies (Shen and Bessereau labs, Neuron, 2015) that reported the importance of NLG-1 in synaptic recruitment of UNC-49. The identification of a function for FRM-3 for synaptic UNC-49 concentration is novel and important. Moreover, an important concept advanced by this work is the presence of multiple systems that act in parallel to stabilize functionally different pools of postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors at the same class of synapse. This concept is backed up by strong in vivo data, and is accompanied by specific molecular mechanisms that stabilize the two different pools of receptors.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors show that the UNC-49 fluorescence is reduced in the <italic>nlg-1</italic> mutant. They also show that the FRAP rate is modified by the <italic>nlg-1</italic> mutation and that the <italic>frm-3</italic> mutant phenotype is greatly enhanced by the <italic>nlg-1</italic> mutation. These data argue strongly that <italic>nlg-1</italic> and <italic>frm-3</italic> function in parallel, both contributing to the synaptic targeting of UNC-49. The one piece of data that does not support this model is the lack of changes of either mIPSC frequency or amplitude. Nevertheless, two recent papers (Tu et al. and Maro et al.) did report electrophysiological phenotypes in <italic>nlg-1</italic> mutant. Both papers showed a strong reduction of mIPSC frequency and a subtle reduction of mIPSC amplitude. All these results seem to be consistent with the parallel model. Based on the lack of observed functional phenotypes, the authors propose that the <italic>nlg-1</italic> anchored UNC-49 receptors do not contribute to the GABAergic synaptic transmission. The authors have several options to deal with this discrepancy. First, the authors can provide reasons why the recording conditions that they used are better than the two published reports. Or, they can provide additional evidence to show that the NLG-1-dependent UNC-49 receptors are inactive and do not contribute to synaptic currents. Or, the authors can modify their conclusions.</p><p>2) The data from the different genetic manipulations strongly suggests that there are different pools of UNC-49 defined by their differentially dependence on NLG-1 and FRM-3. What is not entirely clear is whether “mobile” and “immobile” is an accurate classification. If the NLG-1-dependent pool is “mobile” then why does mobility in <italic>frm-3</italic>, <italic>nlg-1</italic> double mutants increase compared to <italic>frm-3</italic> mutants alone? The authors suggest that this “immobilization of the mobile pool” is correlated to these receptors participating in synaptic transmission in the mutant context but a mechanism to explain this is not offered. Additional data or indications to clarify this point this would greatly improve the paper.</p><p>3) One potential weakness of the receptor mobility (FRAP) experiments is the use of transgenically overexpressed UNC-49 receptors. Thus, the size of mobile and immobile pools may differ between conditions. What supports the validity of the transgenically expressed receptors is that the mIPSC amplitudes and rates are similar to wild-type. Also, the magnitude of loss of UNC-49-GFP fluorescence in <italic>nlg-1</italic> mutants is similar to what was reported by Bessereau and colleagues who used a tag introduced into the endogenous <italic>nlg-1</italic>. As the mobility measurements are a central part of this study this issue needs to be addressed somewhere in the text.</p><p>4) This study does not detect a significant reduction in mIPSC amplitude in <italic>nlg-1</italic> mutants, which is different from the Bessereau and Shen work. In the Discussion the authors point out that <italic>nlg-1</italic> mutant animals are behaviorally normal and suggest that this supports their observation that GABAergic transmission is not severely impaired. This important point could be made much more clearly if the authors included data on this observation for <italic>nlg-1</italic>, <italic>frm-3</italic> and <italic>nlg-1:frm-3</italic> double mutants.</p><p>5) The authors state in Discussion that “mobile NLG-1-stabilized UNC-49 receptors can be actively recruited to the receptor field that mediates synaptic responses, and that this recruitment is inhibited by pre-synaptic NRX-1α”. Given that NLG-1 mutation suppresses UNC-49B puncta (Figure 9C), perhaps NRX-1α is inhibiting the translocation of NLG-stabilized UNC-49B from a subsynaptic region that is not affected by GABA to an adjacent subsynaptic region that mediates GABA synaptic transmission in the same synapse? If this is the case, how is it possible that GABA released from the nerve terminal acts so specifically on a subsynaptic region but not on another in the same inhibitory synapse? This should be clarified.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09648.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors show that the UNC-49 fluorescence is reduced in the</italic> nlg-1 <italic>mutant.

If this is the case, how is it possible that GABA released from the nerve terminal acts so specifically on a subsynaptic region but not on another in the same inhibitory synapse? This should be clarified.</italic></p><p>These three comments all refer to the same issue, our failure to detect a significant mIPSC defect in <italic>nlg-1</italic> single mutants. Prompted by these comments (and by Tu and Maro’s results), we decided to repeat our analysis of <italic>nlg-1</italic> mutants. Our new experiments indicate that <italic>nlg-1</italic> mutants have significant reductions in mIPSC rate and amplitude, similar to results reported by Tu and Maro. We thank the reviewers for urging us to revisit the <italic>nlg-1</italic> phenotype in our revised manuscript. These new results are described in the revised text (please see the following passage in the Results: “The mIPSC rate was significantly reduced in <italic>nlg-1</italic> mutants […] the decreased mIPSC rate could result from decreased pre-synaptic GABA release”).</p><p>In the Discussion, we also add that inactivating NLG-1 caused corresponding decreases in total synaptic UNC-49B (30% decrease), mobile UNC-49B (40% decrease), and mIPSC amplitudes (48% decrease). Thus, analysis of single mutants suggests that FRM-3 and NLG-1 stabilized receptors contribute equally to post-synaptic currents.</p><p>We do not know why our prior analysis failed to detect the <italic>nlg-1</italic> mIPSC defect. The new results have been replicated multiple times (n=28), the <italic>nlg-1</italic> defect is fully rescued by a muscle transgene, and these results are more similar to those reported by Tu and Maro. For these reasons, we are very confident in our new conclusions. Given these new results, we decided to confirm mIPSC rate and amplitude phenotypes for several additional genotypes in our paper, including: <italic>frm-3</italic> (n=8), <italic>nrx-1</italic> (n=39), <italic>frm-3 nlg-1</italic> double mutant (n=10), and <italic>nrx-1;nlg-1</italic> double mutant (n=18). These new experiments replicated the results in our original submission. In the revised manuscript, the mIPSC data reported for <italic>nlg-1</italic> and <italic>nrx-1; nlg-1</italic> double mutants are new. The original data is reported for all other genotypes.</p><p><italic>2) The data from the different genetic manipulations strongly suggests that there are different pools of UNC-49 defined by their differentially dependence on NLG-1 and FRM-3. What is not entirely clear is whether “mobile” and “immobile” is an accurate classification.</italic></p><p>We agree that the NLG-1-stabilized pool comprises a mixture of both mobile and immobilized receptors. We attempt to explain this more clearly in our revised Discussion (please see: “Two results suggest that the NLG-1 stabilized pool […] could be mediated by immobilized or diffusing UNC-49 receptors (or a mixture of the two)”).</p><p>Despite this complexity, we believe it is accurate to state that NLG-1-stabilized synaptic receptors are more mobile than those stabilized by FRM-3.</p><p><italic>If the NLG-1-dependent pool is “mobile” then why does mobility in</italic> frm-3<italic>,</italic> nlg-1 <italic>double mutants increase compared to</italic> frm-3 <italic>mutants alone?

Additional data or indications to clarify this point this would greatly improve the paper.</italic></p><p>Thanks for pointing this out. Our original submission did not explain this result clearly. In FRAP experiments, we measure the ability of extra-synaptic (i.e. unbleached) receptors to restore synaptic fluorescence following photobleaching. These extra-synaptic receptors are mobile UNC-49 receptors on the cell surface, which we also detect in our muscimol-activated current recordings. In the <italic>frm-3 nlg-1</italic> double mutant, we argue that synaptic receptors are eliminated and that all remaining receptors are extra-synaptic receptors in the muscle plasma membrane. Prompted by this comment, we revised our discussion to explain this result more clearly (“Mobile receptors detected by FRAP in <italic>frm-3 nlg-1</italic> double mutants likely correspond to extra-synaptic receptors on the cell surface (which mediate muscimol-activated currents)”).</p><p><italic>3) One potential weakness of the receptor mobility (FRAP) experiments is the use of transgenically overexpressed UNC-49 receptors.

To address this issue, we repeated our FRAP experiments using the single copy RFP-tagged UNC-49B transgene described by Bessereau and colleagues. Please see the subsections “LIN-2A and FRM-3 stabilize immobile UNC-49B receptors at GABAergic NMJs” (“The GFP-UNC-49B transgene is likely to be expressed at higher levels […] a similar increase in FRAP of RFP-UNC-49B was observed in <italic>frm-3</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1C-D</xref>)”) and “NLG-1 Neuroligin stabilizes mobile UNC-49B at synapses” (“FRAP of GFP-UNC-49B […] residual synaptic UNC-49B receptors were largely immobile”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
