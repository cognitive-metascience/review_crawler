domains and thereby promote physiological activities including fast signaling in the heart and nervous system. Ankyrins specifically bind to numerous membrane targets through their 24 ankyrin repeats (ANK repeats), although the mechanism for the facile and independent evolution of these interactions has not been resolved. Here we report the structures of ANK repeats in complex with an inhibitory segment from the C-terminal regulatory domain and with a sodium channel Nav1.2 peptide, respectively, showing that the extended, extremely conserved inner groove spanning the entire ANK repeat solenoid contains multiple target binding sites capable of accommodating target proteins with very diverse sequences via combinatorial usage of these sites. These structures establish a framework for understanding the evolution of ankyrins' membrane targets, with implications for other proteins containing extended ANK repeat domains.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04353.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04353.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04353.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are made up of smaller building blocks called amino acids that are linked to form long chains that then fold into specific shapes. Each protein gets its unique identity from the number and order of the amino acids that it contains, but different proteins can contain similar arrangements of amino acids. These similar sequences, known as motifs, are usually short and typically mark the sites within proteins that bind to other molecules or proteins. A single protein can contain many motifs, including multiple repeats of the same motif.</p><p>One common motif is called the ankyrin (or ANK) repeat, which is found in 100s of proteins in different species, including bacteria and humans. Ankyrin proteins perform a range of important functions, such as connecting proteins in the cell surface membrane to a scaffold-like structure underneath the membrane.</p><p>Proteins containing ankyrin repeats are known to interact with a diverse range of other proteins (or targets) that are different in size and shape. The 24 repeats found in human ankyrin proteins appear to have essentially remained unchanged for the last 500 million years. As such, it remains unclear how the conserved ankyrin repeats can bind to such a wide variety of protein targets.</p><p>Now, Wang, Wei et al. have uncovered the three-dimensional structure of ankyrin repeats from a human ankyrin protein while it was bound either to a regulatory fragment from another ankyrin protein or to a region of a target protein (which transports sodium ions in and out of cells). The ankyrin repeats were shown to form an extended ‘left-handed helix’: a structure that has also been seen in other proteins with different repeating motifs. Wang, Wei et al. found that the ankyrin protein fragment bound to the inner surface of the part of the helix formed by the first 14 ankyrin repeats. The target protein region also bound to the helix's inner surface. Wang, Wei et al. show that this surface contains many binding sites that can be used, in different combinations, to allow ankyrins to interact with diverse proteins.</p><p>Other proteins with long sequences of repeats are widespread in nature, but uncovering the structures of these proteins is technically challenging. Wang, Wei et al.'s findings might reveal new insights into the functions of many of such proteins in a wide range of living species. Furthermore, the new structures could help explain why specific mutations in the genes that encode ankyrins (or their binding targets) can cause various diseases in humans—including heart diseases and psychiatric disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04353.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04353.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>ANK1/ANK2/ANK3</kwd><kwd>ankyrin repeat</kwd><kwd>axon initial segment</kwd><kwd>L1CAM</kwd><kwd>sodium channel</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, Hong Kong</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>663811, 663812, 664113, HKUST6/CRF/10, SEG_HKUST06, AoE/M09/12, and T13-607/12R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Mingjie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bennett</surname><given-names>Vann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Key Basic Research Program of China 2014CB910204</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Mingjie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The 24 ankyrin repeats of ankyrin proteins form an extended solenoid that provides an extremely conserved groove for binding to numerous targets via combinatorial usage of multiple weak interaction sites.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ankyrins are a family of scaffold proteins which play essential roles in connecting numerous ion channels, cell adhesion molecules, and receptors to the spectrin-based cytoskeleton beneath membranes and thereby provide mechanical support for plasma membranes and control the activities of excitable tissues including neurons and muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennett and Chen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bennett and Healy, 2009</xref>). There are three members in the human ankyrin family: ankyrin-R/B/G (AnkR/B/G) encoded by <italic>ANK1/2/3</italic>, respectively. They all consist of a highly similar N-terminal membrane binding domain composed of 24 ankyrin (ANK) repeats, a spectrin-binding domain comprised of two ZU5 domains, and a UPA domain followed by a death domain (DD) and a variable C-terminal regulatory domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bennett and Lorenzo, 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Although sharing similar domain organization, the three ankyrins have distinct and non-overlapping functions in specific membrane domains coordinated by ankyrin-spectrin networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mohler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">He et al., 2013</xref>). As ankyrins are adaptor proteins linking membrane proteins to the underlying cytoskeleton, ankyrin dysfunction is closely related to serious human diseases.

One good example is the formation and maintenance of axon initial segments (AIS) in neurons. Interaction between AnkG and L1 cell adhesion molecules (e.g., the 186 kDa neurofascin, referred to as Nfasc in this study) is required for the formation and stability of the AIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hedstrom et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zonta et al., 2011</xref>). AnkG is in turn responsible for clustering voltage-gated sodium channels at the AIS, which underlies the mechanistic basis of action potential generation and propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garrido et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kole et al., 2008</xref>) (see review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rasband, 2010</xref>). Anchoring of L1 cell adhesion molecules also directs inhibitory GABAergic synapse innervation at the AIS of excitatory Purkinje neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ango et al., 2004</xref>), a critical step for balanced neuronal circuit formation. Depletion of AnkG both in cultured hippocampal neurons and in mice causes axons to lose axonal properties and acquire the molecular characteristics of dendrites, showing that AnkG is required for the maintenance of axonal polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hedstrom et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sobotzik et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Other examples of ankyrin function in organizing membrane signaling networks include, but are not limit to, AnkB/G-mediated coordination of voltage-gated sodium channels, Na/K ATPase, Na/Ca exchanger, and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mohler et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hund et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lowe et al., 2008</xref>) and the dystrophin/dystroglycan complex in skeletal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ayalon et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2011</xref>). Finally, as originally discovered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bennett and Stenbuck (1979a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">1979b</xref>), AnkR is well known to be essential for preserving erythrocyte membrane integrity. Although the critical functions of ankyrins in the specialized membrane domains have been recognized for decades, the underlying mechanistic basis governing ankyrin's coordination with such broad spectrum of membrane targets remains essentially unknown, largely due to challenges in characterizing the biochemical and structural properties of the elongated ANK repeats. Additionally, it is noted that the ANK repeats of ankyrins have been extremely conserved, whereas the membrane targets have continued to expand throughout evolution, presumably due to functional requirements for membrane microdomain-mediated fast signaling events in higher eukaryotes including mammals.</p><p>In this study, we performed detailed biochemical characterizations of ANK repeats of ankyrins and their interactions with various binding partners. We solved the crystal structures of ANK repeats in complex with an auto-inhibitory segment from AnkR C-terminal domain and with a peptide from Nav1.2, respectively. The 24 ANK repeats of ankyrins form a superhelical solenoid with an extremely conserved elongated inner groove, which contains multiple quasi-independent target binding sites. We further show that ankyrins can accommodate different membrane targets with diverse sequences by combinatorial usage of these binding sites. The ankyrin-Nav1.2 complex structure also provides a mechanistic explanation for the mutation found in Nav channels that causes cardiac disease in humans. Collectively, our findings provide a first glimpse into the mechanistic basis governing membrane target recognition by the highly conserved ANK repeats in ankyrins and establish a structural framework for future investigation of ankyrin's involvement in physiological functions and pathological conditions in diverse tissues. Our results also provide a molecular mechanism for the rapid expansion of ankyrin partners in vertebrate evolution. These insights also will be valuable for understanding the recognition mechanisms of other long ANK repeat proteins as well as many other long repeat-containing proteins in living organisms in general.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An auto-inhibitory segment from the C-terminal domain of AnkR specifically binds to ANK repeats of ankyrins</title><p>To elucidate the mechanisms governing ANK repeat-mediated binding of ankyrins to diverse membrane targets, we attempted to determine the atomic structures of ANK repeats alone or in complex with their targets. However, extensive trials of crystallizing ANK repeat domains of AnkR/B/G were not successful, presumably because of the highly dynamic nature of the extended ANK repeat solenoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Howard and Bechstedt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2006</xref>). Anticipating that ANK repeats binders may rigidify the conformation of ANK repeats, we turned our attention to the ANK repeat/target complexes. The C-terminal regulatory domains have been reported to bind to ANK repeats intra-molecularly and modulate the target binding properties of ankyrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davis et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdi et al., 2006</xref>). We measured the interaction of AnkR_repeats with its entire C-terminal regulatory domain (residues 1529–1907) using highly purified recombinant proteins, and found that they interact with each other with a K<sub>d</sub> of around 1 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). It is expected that the intra-molecular association between ANK repeats and its C-terminal tail of AnkR is very stable, and thus the full-length AnkR likely adopts an auto-inhibited conformation and ANK repeats-mediated binding to membrane targets requires release of the auto-inhibited conformation of AnkR.</p><p>Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)-based quantitative binding assays, we identified a 48-residue auto-inhibitory segment (residues 1577–1624, referred to as ‘AS’) as the complete ANK repeat-binding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Further truncation at either end of this 48-residue AS fragment significantly decreased its binding to AnkR_repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The corresponding sequence does not exist in AnkB or AnkG, indicating the AS is specific to AnkR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). AnkR_AS was found to bind to AnkR/B/G ANK repeats with comparable affinities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), as expected since AnkR/B/G share extremely conserved ANK repeat sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and see below). Thus, we tried the complexes of AnkR_AS with ANK repeats of all three isoforms to increase the chances of obtaining suitable crystals. Although crystals of various complexes were obtained, they all diffracted very poorly. After extensive trials of screening and optimization, we succeeded in obtaining good-diffraction crystals of AnkR_AS fused at its C-terminus with the AnkB_repeats and solved the structure of the fusion protein at 3.5 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The NMR spectra of the <sup>13</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>-Met selectively labeled fusion protein and the ANK repeats/AS complex produced by cleavage of the fusion protein at the fusion site are essentially identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the fusion strategy used here facilitates crystallization but does not alter the structure of the ANK repeats/AS complex. There are three Met residues in AS (Met1601, Met1604, and Met1607) and all three Met residues are in the binding interface between ANK repeats and AS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04353.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Vertebrate ANK repeats of ankyrins share the same architecture and target binding properties.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequence alignment of the 24 ANK repeats of human AnkB.

The 24 ANK repeats form a left-handed helical solenoid with each repeat rotating anti-clockwise by ∼16° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Except for the capping helices in the first and last repeats (i.e., αA of R1 and αB of R24), each repeat has the typical ANK repeat sequence pattern and forms a helix-turn-helix conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>). A well-defined finger-like hairpin loop (finger loop) connects two consecutive repeats. The inner αA helices and the finger loops of the 24 repeats line together to form an elongated concave inner groove, and the αB helices of the repeats form the solvent-exposed convex outer surface. The ANK repeats superhelix has outer and inner diameters of approximately 60 Å and 45 Å, respectively, and a total height of ∼150 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The size of the ANK repeats revealed here is consistent with the previous measurement by atomic force microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2006</xref>).

Further analysis reveals that residues forming the target binding concave inner groove (i.e., residues of the finger loops and αA helices of the 24 repeats) are essentially identical among vertebrate AnkR/B/G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), indicating that both the structure and the target binding properties of their ANK repeats are likely to be the same (also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Additionally, the residues in the entire inner groove of the ANK repeats superhelix are highly conserved for all ankyrins throughout evolution (from worm to human) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>), suggesting that the functions of ANK repeats in different species of ankyrins are highly conserved during evolution and that the inner groove of ANK repeats is the general binding site for membrane-associated targets of ankyrins. Consistent with this prediction, binding of AS to AnkG_repeats prevents voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.2 and Nfasc from binding to AnkG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that the ANK repeats/AS structure presented here serves as a general framework for understanding how ankyrins engage their membrane targets, and tested this hypothesis using mutations designed and tested as described below.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mpg" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-04353-media1.mpg"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04353.009</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Surface conservation of 24 ANK repeats.</title><p>This video shows the concave groove is highly conserved across various species from human to worm.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04353.009">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04353.009</ext-link></p></caption></media></p><p>Before binding to ANK repeats, AS adopts a random coil structure as indicated by its NMR spectrum (data not shown). In the complex, AS adopts a highly extended structure binding to part of the inner groove formed by the N-terminal 14 ANK repeats (R1–14) with its chain orientation anti-parallel to that of ANK repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>). A 10-residue segment of AS (residues 1592–1601) forms an α helix when bound to ANK repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The residues connecting AS and ANK repeats (10 residues in total, ‘GSLVPRGSGS’) are flexible, indicating that the fusion of the two chains together does not introduce obvious conformational restraints to the complex.</p><p>The binding of AS to ANK repeats can be divided somewhat arbitrarily into three sites (sites 1, 2, and 3) formed by the repeats 2–6, 7–10, and 11–14, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). Nonetheless, this division is supported by several lines of evidence. Structurally, there is a fairly clear boundary between each of the two binding sites in the ANK repeats/AS complex structure, whereas the interactions within each site are rather concentrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The most direct evidence is from the interaction between ANK repeats and Nav1.2 (see below). In the case of Nav1.2 binding, R1–6 of ANK repeats binds to the C-terminal half of the Nav1.2_ABD (ankyrin binding domain) and R11–14 binds to the N-terminal half of Nav1.2_ABD. R7–10 is not involved in the Nav1.2 binding. Thus, one can naturally divide ANK repeats R1–14 into three parts. Such division is further supported by the accepted concept that four to five ANK repeats can form a folded structural unit. In our case, sites 2 and 3 contain four repeats each, and site 1 contains five repeats if we do not count the repeat 1 which serves as a capping repeat.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04353.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Structural and biochemical characterizations of target binding properties of ANK repeats. </title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>) Stereo views showing the detailed ANK repeats/AS interfaces of the three binding sites shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>.

The K<sub>d</sub> of the binding of AnkG_repeats to the Nav1.2_ABD (residues 1035–1129, comprising the majority of the cytoplasmic loop connecting transmembrane helices II and III, see below for details) and to the Nfasc_ABD (a 28-residue fragment in the cytoplasmic tail; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> and see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garver et al., 1997</xref>) is 0.17 and 0.21 μΜ, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, upper panels). To probe the binding sites of Nav1.2 and Nfasc on AnkG, we constructed AnkG_repeat mutants with the corresponding hydrophobic residues in binding site 1 (Phe131 and Phe164 in R4 and R5, termed ‘FF’), site 2 (Ile267 and Leu300 in R8 and R9; ‘IL’), and site 3 (Leu366, Phe399, and Leu432 in R11, R12, and R13; ‘LFL’) substituted with Gln (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), and examined their binding to the two targets. The mutations in site 1 significantly decreased ANK repeat binding to Nav1.2, but had no impact on Nfasc binding. Conversely, the mutations in site 2 had minimal impact on Nav1.2 binding, but significantly weakened Nfasc binding. The mutations in site 3 weakened ANK repeat binding to both targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). The above results indicate that the two targets bind to ANK repeats with distinct modes, with Nav1.2 binding to sites 1 and 3 and Nfasc binding to sites 2 and 3. This conclusion is further supported by the binding of the two targets to various AnkG_repeat truncation mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>We have also assayed the impact of the mutations of the three sites on the binding of AnkR_AS to ANK repeats. The mutations in sites 1 and 2 led to ∼20-fold decrease in AnkR_AS binding, while the site 3 mutation only caused an approximately threefold decrease in AnkR_AS binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Finally, we tested the binding of another two reported ankyrin targets, the KCNQ2 potassium channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pan et al., 2006</xref>) and the voltage-gated calcium channel Cav1.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cunha et al., 2011</xref>), to the ANK repeats and its mutants, and found that KCNQ2 mainly binds to sites 1 and 2, and Cav1.3 primarily relies on site 2 of ANK repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). Taken together, the above biochemical analysis plus the structure of the ANK repeats/AS complex reveals that through combinations of multiple binding sites on the extremely conserved and elongated inner groove formed by the 24 ANK repeats, ankyrins can bind to numerous targets with diverse amino acid sequences. It is likely that some ankyrin targets may bind to the groove formed by the rest of the repeats in addition to R1–14.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04353.015</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Fluorescence polarization-based measurement of the binding affinities of different targets to AnkB_repeats WT and its mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fluorescence polarization-based measurement of the binding affinities of AnkR_AS peptide to AnkB_repeats WT and its mutants.

Previous studies have reported that the intracellular loop connecting the transmembrane helices II and III (loop 2) is responsible for targeting Nav1.2 to the AIS via directly binding to AnkG, and identified a 27-residue motif within loop 2 (‘ABD-C’, indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,D</xref>) as the AnkG binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garrido et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lemaillet et al., 2003</xref>).

Surprisingly, we found that the C-terminal part of the ABD (ABD-C, the 27-residue motif identified previously for ANK repeats binding) binds to ANK repeats with an affinity ∼15-fold weaker than the entire ABD, indicating that the ABD-C is not sufficient for binding to ANK repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). Consistent with this observation, the N-terminal 68-residue fragment of loop 2 (ABD-N, residues 1035–1102) also binds to ANK repeats, albeit with a relatively weak affinity (K<sub>d</sub> of ∼8 μΜ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). We further showed that the ABD-C fragment binds to repeats 1–6 (R1–6) of ANK repeats, as ABD-C binds to R1–6 and the entire 24 ANK repeats with essentially the same affinities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). These results also reveal that, like the AnkR_AS, the Nav1.2 peptide segment binds to ANK repeats in an anti-parallel manner. Taken together, the biochemical data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> indicate that two distinct fragments of Nav1.2 loop 2, ABD-N and ABD-C, are responsible for binding to ANK repeats. The previously identified ABD-C binds to site 1 and ABD-N binds to site 3 of ANK repeats, and the interactions between the two sites are largely independent from each other energetically.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04353.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Characterization of the interaction between Nav1.2 and AnkG_repeats. </title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram showing the domain organization of the Nav1 family ion channels.

In particular, the hydrophobic residues of Nav1.2_ABD-C and AS occupy very similar positions on the hydrophobic groove formed by residues from ANK repeats R4 and R5, and subtle conformational differences in the finger loops of R4 and R5 can accommodate amino acid sequence differences between the two targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). This similar pattern and subtle accommodation illustrate that ANK repeats in general are incredibly adaptable and versatile as protein binding modules. Unique to Nav1.2, the binding of ABD-C extends all the way to R1 via charge–charge and hydrogen-bond interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,E</xref>). We also compared our ANK repeats complex structure with two recently determined peptide-bound ANK repeats structures, ANKRA2 and RFXANK in complex with HDAC4 and RFX5 peptides, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). Although the HDAC4 and RFX5 peptides also bind to ANKRA2 and RFXANK ANK repeats in extended conformations, the key target binding residues are restricted to a small set of hydrophobic residues in the A helices of the five ANK repeats. Accordingly, a consensus sequence motif can be recognized to bind to the ANKRA2 and RFXANK ANK repeats.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>A completely conserved Glu in ABD-C anchors Nav1 to ankyrins</title><p>We noted that Glu1112, which is completely conserved in both Na+ and K+ channels and mutation of which in Nav1.5 to Lys is known to cause Brugada syndrome in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mohler et al., 2004</xref>), occupies the identical position as Glu1622 of AS does in the ANK repeats/AS complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,E</xref>). In contrast to the common expectation of directly interacting with positively charged residue(s), Glu1112 of Nav1.2 is buried deeply in the groove and forms hydrogen bonds with the sidechains of Thr94 and Asn98 in the R2 and R3 finger loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Charge potential calculation shows that the Glu1112 binding pocket formed by R2 and R3 is highly positive, and thus nicely accommodates the negatively charged carboxyl group of Glu1112 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). As expected, the charge reversal mutation of Nav1.2 (E1112K) abolished the channel's binding to ANK repeats. Even mild substitutions (E1112Q- and E1112A-Nav1.2) weakened the binding of Nav1.2 to ANK repeats by ∼30-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In agreement with our findings, E1112Q- and E1112A-Nav1.2 (or E1100 in Nav1.6) failed to cluster at the AIS of hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fache et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gasser et al., 2012</xref>).

As shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">He et al., 2012</xref>), the defect in both AIS formation and Nav channels/Nfasc clustering at the AIS caused by knockdown of endogenous AnkG could be rescued by co-transfection of the shRNA-resistant, WT 270 kDa AnkG-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The ‘FF’ mutant of 270 kDa AnkG-GFP was concentrated normally at the AIS, but failed to rescue clustering of endogenous Nav at the AIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,C,D</xref>), consistent with the significantly weakened binding of the mutant AnkG to Nav1.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>).

Gene duplications as well as alternative splicing have generated much functional diversity of ankyrins in various tissues in vertebrates. However, the N-terminal 24 ANK repeats of ankyrins have remained essentially the same for at least 500 million years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). In contrast, the membrane targets for ankyrins have expanded greatly in respond to physiological needs (e.g., fast signaling in neurons and heart muscles in mammals) throughout evolution, and these membrane targets almost invariably bind to the 24 ANK repeats of ankyrins. Intriguingly, among about a dozen ankyrin-binding membrane targets identified to date (see review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bennett and Healy, 2009</xref>) and those characterized in this study, the ankyrin-binding sequences of these targets are highly diverse. It has been unclear how the extremely conserved ANK repeats can specifically bind to such a diverse set of target sequences. Additionally, it is mechanistically unclear why the membrane targets instead of ANK repeats have undergone amino acid sequence changes in respond to functional diversification in higher vertebrates during evolution. The structure of the entire 24 ANK repeats in complex with an auto-inhibitory domain, together with the structure of part of ANK repeats in complex with its binding domain of Nav1.2, begin to offer insights into the issues above.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ankyrin's diverse membrane targets</title><p>The 24 ANK repeats form an elongated, continuous solenoid structure with its extremely conserved target binding inner groove spanning a total length of ∼210 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We identified three distinct target binding sites in the first 14 repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This is in agreement with earlier studies showing that three to five ANK repeats can form a stable structural unit capable of recognizing certain target sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tamaskovic et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we predict that the last 10 ANK repeats of ankyrins can contain an additional two to three target binding sites. Importantly, the target binding sites on ANK repeats behave rather independently, as mutations/disruptions of interactions in each site do not lead to large perturbations in the interactions in the neighboring sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Equal importantly, the ANK repeats targets bind to the inner groove with extended conformations, and the segments responsible for binding to each site do not seem to cooperate with each other (i.e., an alteration in one segment does not have a large impact on the neighboring segments) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore, the multiple target binding sites on ANK repeats are quasi-independent.</p><p>We further show that the AnkR_AS, the Nfasc, the Nav1.2, the KCNQ2, and the Cav1.3 peptides use different combinations of these sites that spread along the elongated and near completely conserved inner ANK repeat groove to form specific ankyrin/target complexes. One can envision that such combinatorial usage of multiple quasi-independent sites can in principle generate a large repertoire of binding targets with different sequences for ANK repeats. Although a number of ion channels use site 1 as the common binding site, the amino acid sequences of the corresponding site 1-binding peptide segments are rather diverse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). One can expect that the sequences of target peptide segments responsible for binding to sites 2 and 3 will be even more diverse (e.g., the corresponding site 3 binding sequence of AnkR_AS and Nav1.2 ABD_N have no detectable sequence similarity), as the interactions in these two sites are more hydrophobic in nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). The combinatorial usage of the quasi-independent sites, together with the low sequence specificity of each binding site as well as the structural plasticity of the ANK repeat solenoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2006</xref>), indicate that ANK repeats can have large capacities in binding to numerous membrane targets with diverse sequences. In light of the above points, unidentified ANK repeat binding proteins will likely be difficult to predict simply based on amino acid sequences, although a firm conclusion awaits detailed characterizations of more ankyrin binding targets.</p><p>The combinatorial usage of multiple binding sites has also been observed in other long repeat-containing proteins including the Karyopherin family nuclear import/export scaffold proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kobe, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chook and Blobel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 2010</xref>), the Wnt signaling regulatory scaffold β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Graham et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huber and Weis, 2001</xref>), and tetratricopeptide repeats protein LGN/Pins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). It is possible such a combinatorial target binding strategy may be a common feature for many other elongated repeat-containing proteins in diverse living organisms. The combinatorial multi-site interaction mode may also be advantageous for efficient regulation of ANK repeats/target interactions. By spreading a target binding to multiple sites along the ANK repeats inner groove that are not directly coupled, each binding site can be regulated independently and in a graded fashion. This might allow multiple regulatory signals to be integrated in a combinatorial manner to regulate ankyrin/membrane target interactions. Such a graded regulatory mechanism can be important for ankyrins to respond to various signal inputs when multiple membrane targets co-exist. For example, AnkG co-exists with Nfasc and sodium and potassium channels at the AIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jenkins and Bennett, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Le Bras et al., 2013</xref>), and the components of the AnkG-mediated complex at the AIS can undergo distinct activity-dependent changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grubb and Burrone, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kuba et al., 2010</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kole and Stuart, 2012)</xref> and exhibit AIS plasticity during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galiano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gutzmann et al., 2014</xref>).

In contrast, most, if not all, currently identified ANK repeat-binding segments of ankyrin's membrane targets are either shown or predicted to be unstructured before binding to ankyrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bennett and Lorenzo, 2013</xref>). Such unstructured sequences are more tolerant of mutations as alterations are likely to have a minimal impact on the overall folding of proteins harboring them. Additionally, the conformational malleability is also advantageous for these unstructured peptide sequences to bind to ANK repeats with a molded groove. Since ANK repeats of ankyrins are responsible for binding to numerous targets with diverse sequences, it is likely that there is evolutionary pressure against random mutations in the ANK repeat sequences (the residues in the inner groove in particular). The core function of the ankyrin/spectrin duo in patterning membrane micro-domains has remained unchanged throughout evolution, and thus the amino acid sequences of ANK repeats and the spectrin-binding domain of ankyrins are highly conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). New ankyrin binders (e.g., sodium and potassium channels at the AIS of neurons of higher mammals) can evolve due to functional requirements.</p><p>In summary, the structure of the 24 ANK repeats of ankyrins not only offers an explanation for the remarkable capacity of AnkR/B/G to bind to numerous membrane targets, but also provides a framework for guiding future studies of physiological functions and numerous pathological conditions directly associated with ankyrins. Since the three isoforms of ankyrins have distinct physiological functions, highly variable sequences outside the extremely conserved ANK repeats and spectrin-binding domain likely play critical roles in determining the cellular functions of each ankyrin isoform. Finally, proteins with extended ANK repeat domains (e.g., TRP channels, elongation factors, protein kinases and phosphatases, and various scaffold proteins) may also interact with diverse partners via combinatorial uses of multiple, quasi-independent binding sites and thus are particularly suited as adaptors for assembling macromolecular complexes with broad cellular functions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Constructs, protein expression, and purification</title><p>The coding sequences of AnkB_repeats (residues 28–873) were PCR amplified using the full-length human 220 kDa AnkB as the template.

The fusion construct of AnkR_AS and AnkB_repeats was made by standard two-step PCR with a coding sequence of thrombin recognition residues ‘GSLVPRGS’ as the linker. This construct was used to crystallize and determine the complex structure. The same strategy was used in making other fusion constructs, including the Nav1.2_ABD-C/AnkB_repeats_R1–9 fusion construct containing residues 1103–1129 from mouse Nav1.2 and human AnkB residues 28–318 followed by a capping sequence corresponding to the αB of R24 (residues 814–822) and the AnkR_AS/AnkG_repeats fusion construct. For truncation mutations of ANK repeats constructs, the same capping sequence was added to the appropriate region of the C-terminus of each construct for protein stabilization. Mouse Nav1.2 (NP_001092768.1) and mouse neurofascin (CAD65849.1) were used here for studying their interaction with ankyrins. Peptides for mouse KCNQ2 (NP_034741.2, residues 826–845) and mouse Cav1.3 (NP_083257.2, residues 2134–2166) were commercially synthesized. For simplicity, we used human 220 kDa AnkB for the amino acid numbering throughout the manuscript. For the corresponding point mutations made on AnkG_repeats, each residue number should be increased by 10. All point mutations were created using the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit and confirmed by DNA sequencing. All of these coding sequences were cloned into a home-modified pET32a vector for protein expression. The N-terminal thioredoxin-His<sub>6</sub>-tagged proteins were expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) and purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). The thioredoxin-His<sub>6</sub> tag was removed by incubation with HRV 3C protease and separated by size exclusion columns when needed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Isothermal titration calorimetry assay</title><p>Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements were carried out on a VP-ITC MicroCal calorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA) at 25°C. All proteins were dissolved in 50 mM Tris buffer containing 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT at pH 7.5. High concentrations (200–300 µM) of each binding partner assayed in this study, including AnkR_AS, different Nav1.2 ABD proteins and mutants, and neurofascin ABD, were loaded into the syringe, with the corresponding ANK repeats proteins of ankyrin-R/B/G (20–30 µM) placed in the cell. Each titration point was obtained by injecting a 10 μl aliquot of syringe protein into various ankyrin protein samples in the cell at a time interval of 120 s to ensure that the titration peak returned to baseline. The titration data were analyzed using the program Origin 7.0 and fitted by the one-site binding model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Analytical gel filtration</title><p>Analytical gel filtration chromatography was carried out on an AKTA FPLC system (GE Healthcare, Sweden). Proteins were loaded onto a Superose 12 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with a buffer containing 50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT at pH 7.5.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Fluorescence assay</title><p>Fluorescence assays were performed on a PerkinElmer LS-55 fiuorimeter equipped with an automated polarizer at 25°C. In a typical assay, a FITC (Molecular Probes)-labeled peptide (∼1 μM) was titrated with each binding partner in a 50 mM Tris pH 8.0 buffer containing 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM EDTA. The K<sub>d</sub> values were obtained by fitting the titration curves with the classical one-site binding model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>NMR spectroscopy</title><p>For the purpose of NMR analysis, AnkB_repeats fused with AnkR_AS was prepared by growing bacteria in M9 minimal medium supplemented with <sup>13</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>-Met (CIL, Cambridge, MA). The protein was expressed and purified using the same method as for the native proteins. Two identical NMR samples containing 0.35 mM of the fusion protein in 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.0, with 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA) were prepared, except that one of the samples contained 50 µg/ml of thrombin. The complete cleavage of the fusion protein was assessed by taking a small aliquot of the thrombin-added sample for SDS-PAGE analysis. NMR spectra were acquired at 35°C on a Varian Inova 750 MHz spectrometer equipped with an actively <italic>z</italic>-gradient shielded triple resonance probe.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Crystallography</title><p>Crystallization of the native AnkR_AS/AnkB_repeats complex and its Se-Met derivative, and the Nav1.2_ABD-C/AnkB_repeats_R1–9 complex was performed using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 16°C. Crystals of the ANK repeats/AS complex were obtained from the crystallization buffer containing 0.5 M ammonium sulfate, 1.0 M lithium sulfate, and 0.1 M sodium citrate at pH 5.6. Crystals of the Nav1.2_ABD-C/AnkB_repeats_R1–9 complex were harvested in the crystallization condition with 1.8 M ammonium sulfate, 6–8% dioxane, and 0.1 M MES pH 6.5. Before diffraction experiments, crystals were soaked in crystallization solution containing 30% glycerol for cryoprotection. The diffraction data were collected at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility and processed and scaled using HKL2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Otwinowski and Minor, 1997</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>By using the single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering method, the Se-Met sites were found and refined, and the initial phase was determined in AutoSHARP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vonrhein et al., 2007</xref>). The structure model of ANK repeats was built manually based on the experimental phase and the last 12 ANK repeats of AnkR_repeats (PBD ID: 1N11) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Michaely et al., 2002</xref>). Since the AS peptide contains three Met residues, the building of the AS structure was guided by the Se-anomalous difference map as the reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Each asymmetric unit contains one ANK repeats/AS molecule. The model was refined against the Se-Met dataset of ANK repeats/AS in PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2002</xref>). COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>) was used for model rebuilding and adjustments. In the final stage, an additional TLS refinement was performed in PHENIX. The initial phase of the Nav1.2_ABD-C/AnkB_repeats_R1–9 complex was determined by molecular replacement using the different repeat regions of the ANK repeats structure as the search models. The Nav1.2_ABD-C peptide was further built into the model. The model was refined using the same strategy as that used for ANK repeats/AS. The model qualities were checked by MolProbity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davis et al., 2007</xref>).

The shRNA of AnkG was cloned into a BFP-pll3.7 vector with the sequence GCGTCTCCTATTAGATCTTTC, targeting a serine-rich region shared by both the 270 kDa and 480 kDa isoforms of mouse AnkG but not the rescuing rat AnkG. Hippocampal neurons were obtained from newborn C57bl/6 mice and cultured until day 4 before co-transfection with the shRNA and different forms of rescue vectors containing rat AnkG using Lipofectamine 2000. On day 7, the neurons were fixed and processed for immunostaining.

Ankyrin is key protein in assembly of specific membrane complexes and in connecting membrane and cytoskeletal components. The authors solve the structure of the full 24-repeat ankyrin array, a challenging target that has been elusive for many years. To do this, the authors attach recognition sequences to one end of the ankyrin domain in cis. For two different target fusions, diffraction quality crystals were obtained, and structures solved. The structures nicely suggest autoinhibition of AnkR, and guides mutagenesis of potential binding sites for peptides from membrane protein targets.</p><p>Importantly, these structures identify a novel mode of recognition by the ankyrin array. There are currently many structures of ankyrin repeat proteins bound to targets, and all of them use short beta hairpins at the junctions separating repeats. Targets of this mode are folded proteins. The current mode of interaction involves an extended polypetide that binds to an elongated groove under the beta-hairpin, and appears to represent a mode by which ankyrin domains can recognize intrinsically disordered regions of targets.</p><p>Mutagenesis of 3 distinct sites on AnkR and comparison of effects on binding the autoinhibitory peptide and 4 target peptides suggest combinatorial use of the different sites, explaining sequence diversity of the large number of target peptides that are known to bind ankyrins. A crystal structure of a shorter AnkR repeats fragment bound to a Nav1.2 peptide showed how the target peptide binds 1 of the 3 binding sites that they had characterized.</p><p>The authors find that different targets respond differently to these sequence substitutions, and propose that there are different binding determinants within what appear to be overlapping sites. This proposition has interesting implications for how a single surface can develop different specificity for different targets.</p><p>However, there are a number of concerns that the author should address:</p><p>1) It is unclear how the authors arrived at 3 distinct binding sites for AS. Are the regions between the sites devoid of interactions with the peptide? It is also unclear how the authors concluded that the binding sites are quasi-independent. Independence refers to binding energetics. It doesn't appear that the authors have shown absence of cooperativity between the sites at this time.</p><p>At best, the authors might hope their data shows thermodynamic additivity when substitutions from different sites, though this is not shown. And even if it was shown, this does not mean the sites are not coupled, merely that coupling is maintained despite changes in affinity resulting from point substitution and/or fragmentation.</p><p>2) Because it was not discussed by the authors, it is unclear if the mode of target peptide binding uncovered here is different from those found in other structures of peptide-bound ankyrin repeat domains such as RFXANK and ANKRA2.</p><p>3) Similar combinatorial uses of multiple binding sites to bind diverse peptides have been shown and extensively characterized in other solenoid helical repeat protein systems such as the recognition diverse NLS peptides by the importin Transportin-1 or Karyopherin-beta2.</p><p>4) Though there are important new insights from the manuscript, the narrative is hard to follow, and in many cases is overly focused on the details of the mutagenesis and interaction of various targets. It would be help if this myriad of data could be consolidated around a few key ideas and hypotheses. Along these lines, the motivation for switching to fluorescence-based affinity assays from ITC part way through the manuscript is unclear. One of the best motivations would be to measure lower affinity interactions, though this advantage seems not to be used to determine the “ND” interactions from ITC. Note it is unclear that wild-type ANK R-AS fluorescence affinity is well determined. It is quite near the saturation limit, and there appears to be little data defining the saturated baseline.</p><p>5) The authors should show electron density for both structures. The resolution of the first structure is rather low, and it would be good to see the crystallographic evidence for specific side-chain interactions (especially charge and hydrogen bond interactions).</p><p>6) The methods used to calculate electrostatic potentials should be described.</p><p>7) The authors refer to a 1 micromolar binding constant as tight. At best, this as a subjective statement. And to the extent that it is not subjective, it is wrong. Most would regard this as a weak complex.</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>: if KDs for AnkR_repeats were measured by ITC, why was the symbol “+++ ” used instead of the actual KD value?</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>: it would help if the authors indicate directionality of the peptide or mention that the view is similar to that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>.

One motivation for doing this is that it is easier to convey the key messages derived from our structural and biochemical studies to the broader biological and biomedical research community interested in ankyrin biology. Nonetheless, this division method is supported by or consistent with a large body of experimental data, which would need lots of space to describe and discuss. In order not to distract the main points of the manuscript (please also refer to the point 4 from the reviewers/editors suggesting us to focus on the key points in the manuscript), we decided not to go into such details. The following is a list of some of supporting evidences for such division.</p><p>Structurally, there is a fairly clear boundary between each of the two binding sites in the AnkB_repeats/AS complex structure; whereas the interactions within each sites are rather concentrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>The most direct evidence for dividing AnkB_repeats R1-14 into three sites is probably from the comparison of the large body of the Nav1.2 and Nfsac binding data listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>. In the case of Nav1.2 binding, R1-6 binds to the C-terminal half of the Nav1.2_ABD (ankyrin binding domain) and R11-14 binds to N-terminal half of Nav1.2_ABD. AnkB_repeats R7-10 is not involved in the Nav1.2 binding. In addition, isolated R1-6 is stable and binds to the C-terminal half of the Nav1.2_ABD with a reasonable affinity (Kd ∼2.3 µM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), supporting that R1-6 can function as a structural unit for Nav1.2 binding. Thus, one can naturally divide AnkB_repeats R1-14 into three parts, as the middle part is not used for binding. Such division is further supported by the binding data of Nfsac to AnkB_repeats R1-14. Neither the mutations in nor the truncation of R1-6 had any impact on AnkB_repeats R1-14’s binding to Nfasc. Isolated R1-6 has no detectable binding to Nfasc. Thus, Nfasc binds to the R7-14 of AnkB_repeats, and the site-1 is not operational for this binding.</p><p>Our division of three binding sites in R1-14 is also based on the well accepted concept that 4-5 ANK repeats can form a folded structural unit. In our case, the sites-2&amp;3 contain 4 ANK repeats each, and the site-1 contains 5 repeats if we do not count the capping repeat 1.</p><p>Our experimental data also provide evidence that the three binding sites are largely independent from each other. Since all 24 repeats of ankyrins are folded together as an integral structural unit and their binding targets are all continuous in their amino acid sequences, the interactions among the three sites cannot be totally independent. This is why we used the term quasi-independent in our description. Such description has also been used in the cases of target recognitions by other long repeat scaffold proteins such as Karyopherins and β-catenin (covered in the “Discussion”). The following are a brief summary of some of our data showing that the three binding sites of AnkB_repeats R1-14 are rather independent from each other.</p><p>In the case of Nav1.2 binding, the binding affinity contributed by site-1 is with Kd ∼2.3 µM, and that by site-3 is ∼8.1 µM. The Kd of the Nav1.2 to the entire AnkB_repeats is only ∼0.17 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This means that the two sites are energetically rather independent from each other, as the Kd of Nav1.2/ AnkB_repeats would be ∼18 pM (2.3 µM X ∼8.1 µM) if the two sites are completely coupled with each other.</p><p>The dissections of the interaction sites of AnkB_repeats with AS and with Nfasc reveal a similar picture as that for the Nav1.2/AnkB_repeats interaction. For example, mutations in the site-1 or site-2 each caused a modest decrease (∼20-fold) of AS binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting that the two sites are not tightly coupled with each other. Similarly, mutations in site-2 and site-3 led to ∼13- and ∼30-fold decreases of Nfasc binding, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>We did not elaborate the above descriptions to avoid the manuscript being excessively lengthy.</p><p><italic>2) Because it was not discussed by the authors, it is unclear if the mode of target peptide binding uncovered here is different from those found in other structures of peptide-bound ankyrin repeat domains such as RFXANK and ANKRA2</italic>.</p><p>The largest difference between our AnkB/AS structure and the reported ANKRA2/HDAC4 and RFXANK/RFX5 structures is that AnkB uses a much longer target binding groove than the other two ankyrin repeats in binding to its targets. Nonetheless, the bindings of AnkB R1-6 (or the site-1) to AnkR_AS and to Nav1.2 bear some similarity to those of ANKRA2 and RFXANK in that these targets all bind to the inner groove of the ankyrin repeats with extended conformations (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref> below). However, obvious differences exist even in these short ankyrin repeats/target interactions. First, the orientation of peptide is reversed in ANKRA2/HDAC4 and RFXANK/RFX5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1A</xref>). Second, the binding of AnkB to its targets involves both the A helices and the connecting finger loops of the ankyrin repeats and target sequences are rather diverse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>); whereas the target binding residues in ANKRA2 and RFXANK are concentrated within a cluster of residues at the A helices (1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, and 5A) and accordingly these ankyrin repeats bind to a conserved sequence motif. We have discussed this briefly after describing the complex structure of Nav1.2 and AnkB in the revised manuscript.</p><p>In order not to distract from the main theme of the manuscript, we did not include <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref> below in the revised manuscript.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>Comparison of the bindings of AnkR_repeats R1-6 to Nav1.2 with those of ANKRA2 and RFXANK to HDAC4 and RFX5.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-04353-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>3) Similar combinatorial uses of multiple binding sites to bind diverse peptides have been shown and extensively characterized in other solenoid helical repeat protein systems such as the recognition diverse NLS peptides by the importin Transportin-1 or Karyopherin-beta2</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers/editors that several solenoid helical repeat proteins have been shown to bind to partners through combinatorial usages of multiple binding sites. We have discussed this concept in the third paragraph of the “Discussion”. We also hypothesized that such combinatorial target binding strategy may be a common feature for many other elongated repeat-containing proteins in diverse living organisms. We have cited two more early structural research articles reporting Karyopherin alpha/target interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conti et al, 1998</xref>; Kobe et al, 1999) in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) Though there are important new insights from the manuscript, the narrative is hard to follow, and in many cases is overly focused on the details of the mutagenesis and interaction of various targets. It would be help if this myriad of data could be consolidated around a few key ideas and hypotheses. Along these lines, the motivation for switching to fluorescence-based affinity assays from ITC part way through the manuscript is unclear. One of the best motivations would be to measure lower affinity interactions, though this advantage seems not to be used to determine the “ND” interactions from ITC. Note it is unclear that wild-type ANK R-AS fluorescence affinity is well determined. It is quite near the saturation limit, and there appears to be little data defining the saturated baseline</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers/editors for the suggestion. Indeed, the manuscript contains massive amounts of biochemical data involving Ank_repeats point mutations and truncations as well as a panel of ankyrin’s targets in order to provide adequate supports to the scientific conclusions drawn. We have tried further to balance the depth of description of these data and focus on the main points of the manuscript during the revision. We feel that certain level of description of experimental data is necessary in order to maintain the logic and to make the manuscript easily understandable.</p><p>Regarding the binding assay methods, we actually began our quantitative biochemical analyses using the fluorescence-based assay, and performed a large number of binding experiments. In the course of our study, we discovered that the hydrophobic fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) attached to the N-termini of peptides can artificially enhance their bindings to ANK_repeats, and this occurs when peptides bind to the center of ANK-repeats inner groove (e.g. the sites-2&amp;3 binding by the Nfasc peptide) or when FITC is too close to the key interacting residues in peptides. Because of such complications, we switched to the ITC-based method due to its label-free nature, and the majority of our binding data shown in the manuscript are based on ITC-derived measurements. Nonetheless, a large body of binding measurements derived from FITC-based assay is still valid, and chose a subset of the data to present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. We have control experiments to make sure that the FITC-based assay data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are free of FITC-induced artifacts, as the binding affinities of the peptides bind to the WT ANK_repeats measured using the two methods (fluorescence-based and ITC-based) are essentially the same (e.g., the AS peptide binding data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>For the WT AnkR_repeats/AS interaction measured by FITC-based assay, the enlarged insertion in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> (top right) shows that the titration has reached near saturation and the curve can be fitted with a very small error.</p><p><italic>5) The authors should show electron density for both structures. The resolution of the first structure is rather low, and it would be good to see the crystallographic evidence for specific side-chain interactions (especially charge and hydrogen bond interactions)</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers/editors for the suggestion of showing more crystallographic evidences. Although the resolution of the first structure is rather low, the electron densities for the binding sites are quite reliable. This is now shown in the updated version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref> panel B. We have also added a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>) to show the electron density of the AnkB/Nav1.2 complex structure.</p><p><italic>6) The methods used to calculate electrostatic potentials should be described.</italic></p><p>We have added the method for calculating the electrostatic potential in the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> legend). In brief, the electrostatic surface potentials were calculated by the APBS module embedded in PyMol with the nonlinear Poisson–Boltzmann equation and contoured at ± 10 kT/e.</p><p><italic>7) The authors refer to a 1 micromolar binding constant as tight. At best, this as a subjective statement. And to the extent that it is not subjective, it is wrong. Most would regard this as a weak complex</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers/editors on this point, and we have made corresponding changes in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>8)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref><italic>: if KDs for AnkR_repeats were measured by ITC, why was the symbol “+++ ” used instead of the actual KD value?</italic></p><p>In our mapping experiment, we tested the binding through analytical gel filtration chromatography-based assay first and the assay gave quite clear results showing that binding to 1529-1825 of AnkR C-terminal led to an obvious elution volume shift of AnkR_repeats, while 1826-1907 had no interaction at all. So we directly went on to the next round of mapping without measuring the binding affinities of the “1529-1825” fragment using ITC. In response to the comment above, we have performed the ITC experiments during the revision and revised the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> accordingly. The data is consistent with the expectation that the N-terminal part of AnkR_CT contains the complete AnkR_repeats binding domain by having the same Kd with of the 1529-1907 fragment.</p><p><italic>9)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6C</italic></xref><italic>: it would help if the authors indicate directionality of the peptide or mention that the view is similar to that in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6A</italic></xref><italic>.

For all the biochemical assays, we chose the “LFL” mutant as the mutation produced more obvious impacts (i.e. at similar levels to those of the site-1 or-2 mutants) in the target bindings via the site-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The “LF” mutant has a milder impact on AnkB’s binding to AS or Nav1.2. In our neuronal culture experiment, we discovered that the milder “LF” mutant in site-3 is sufficient to disrupt AnkG’s AIS clustering. We thus used this milder “LF” mutant instead of the “LFL” mutant in all subsequent multiple batches of neuronal culture experiments. We have specifically mentioned in the main text that the site-3 mutant used in neuronal culture experiments is the “LF” mutant.</p></body></sub-article></article>
