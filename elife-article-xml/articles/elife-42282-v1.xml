The axonemes of most motile flagella have a central pair (CP) apparatus that is comprised of two microtubules, C1 and C2, and their projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mitchell and Sale, 1999</xref>). The CP apparatus is essential to coordinate the action of dyneins so that the flagellum beat can be propagated efficiently and defects in the CP apparatus cause cell motility defects. For example, loss of Hydin, a component of the C2 projection, causes ciliary bending and beating impairment in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lechtreck et al., 2008</xref>), defective beat switching in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lechtreck and Witman, 2007</xref>), and loss of locomotion in trypanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dawe et al., 2007</xref>). Mutations in murine Hydin are associated with hydrocephalus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davy and Robinson, 2003</xref>) and human hydin is also associated with hydrocephalus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Callen et al., 1990</xref>) and primary ciliary dyskinesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Olbrich et al., 2012</xref>). Trypanosome and <italic>Leishmania</italic> mutants of PF16 (a C1 projection component) are paralysed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Branche et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beneke et al., 2017</xref>) and PF20 (which bridges the C1 and C2 microtubules) mutants have reduced flagellar motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Branche et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the outer axonemal microtubules, which are extensions of the basal body microtubules, the CP does not elongate directly from the basal body. Rather, the proximal end of one or both CP microtubules is embedded in an electron dense structure at the base of the axoneme termed the basal plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Höög et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">May-Simera and Kelley, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Although the basal plate is ideally located to nucleate the CP, the lack of basal plate mutants or known basal plate components has hampered efforts to determine its function and our knowledge of the role of the basal plate in CP assembly is limited. Ablating trypanosome gamma tubulin results in immotile flagella with no CP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McKean et al., 2003</xref>), suggesting that CP nucleation is mediated by the gamma tubulin ring complex. In agreement with this notion, gamma tubulin was localised to the flagellum base in trypanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhou and Li, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scott et al., 1997</xref>) and the TZ stellate structure in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Silflow et al., 1999</xref>).

Knockouts of the microtubule severing protein katanin in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> lack the CP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sharma et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dymek et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dymek and Smith, 2012</xref>), suggesting a role for microtubule severing in CP assembly. Mating katanin knockout gametes with wild type gametes caused cytoplasmic complementation and CP assembly at sub-distal regions of preformed flagellar axonemes in the resulting zygote, suggesting that CP formation does not require specific nucleating factors to be located at the base of the axoneme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lechtreck et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we reported the development and functional analysis of a trypanosome TZ proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dean et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we have analysed the function of a particular TZ protein that we have named basalin. Mutational analysis shows that RNAi ablation of basalin leads to paralysis and CP nucleation defects. Importantly, the TZs of cells induced for basalin RNAi possess a flagellum but are missing the basal plate, providing insights into the relationship between the basal plate and CP formation. At first sight, and intriguingly for a protein involved in such a conserved function, basalin appeared by homology searches to be a <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> clade-specific protein. However, using syntenic comparison of the genomes we discovered a putative syntenic version of basalin in the <italic>L. mexicana</italic> genome. Deletion of this gene in <italic>L. mexicana</italic> reproduced the missing basal plate phenotype observed upon basalin RNAi in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, suggesting that these proteins are related but extraordinarily divergent in sequence. This establishes that proteins with intrinsic disorder are important for evolutionary conserved cytoskeletal functions and raises the general concept that such proteins involved in cytoskeletal functions and apparently appearing to be organism-specific, may have highly divergent and cryptic orthologs in other species responsible for conserved functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Basalin knockdown generates flagellum paralysis, short flagella and a cytokinesis defect</title><p>Basalin (Tb927.7.3130) was identified as a putative basal plate constituent since it localised to the extreme distal TZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dean et al., 2016</xref>).

Two components of the CP complex (PF16 and Hydin), a component of the radial spokes (RSP2) and a component of the dynein arms were chosen as markers for this analysis.

A faint basalin signal was also observed in the pro-basal body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and this signal increased in intensity as the pro-basal body matured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), eventually becoming visible on both basal body/pro-basal body pairs in late dividing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>).

Given the similarity in their phenotypes and localisations, we addressed the dependency between basalin and TZP103.8 regarding their recruitment to the TZ. For this purpose, we targeted each individual protein for RNAi separately in a cell line co-expressing fluorescently-tagged copies of both proteins. RNAi targeting basalin was effective as judged by its absence from affected TZs. Strikingly, this resulted in loss of TZP103.8 from affected TZs such that it was either undetectable or almost undetectable by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,D</xref>).

Whilst a shorter axoneme is built in cells in which basalin was ablated, the absence of the basal plate leads a strong defect in CP assembly and flagellum immotility. Basalin appears to be fundamental for basal plate formation and to our knowledge this is the first example of a protein required for basal plate formation. Moreover, mutant analysis clearly demonstrates the link between the TZ basal plate structure and CP assembly. The discovery that, in basalin negative flagella, early new flagella lack PF16 and that the probability of PF16 incorporation into the axoneme increases in late new flagella, strongly argues for a defect in CP nucleation at the axoneme base, with subsequent ‘ectopic’ assembly in a relatively small (10–20%) of elongating axonemes. The alternative hypothesis - that the CP is nucleated correctly but loses contact with the top of the TZ and then shortens or collapses due to a stability defect - is unlikely because one would expect to see flagella in the very early stages of elongation that are positive for PF16, with decreasing frequency of PF16-positive new flagella in later cell cycle stages.</p><p>Basalin is required for recruitment of another, unrelated protein, TZP103.8, also required for CP formation. However, gamma tubulin, which again is required for CP formation, can still associate with the basal body in the absence of basalin, suggesting complex pathways are involved in CP formation. It is unlikely that the alternative view that the lack of a CP causes basal plate absence is correct since the basal plate remains in other mutants that lack the CP, such as TZP103.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dean et al., 2016</xref>)) and PF16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beneke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Branche et al., 2006</xref>) ablation mutants.</p><p>Although all examined TZs of <italic>Leishmania</italic> LmxM.22.1070 KO cells were missing their basal plate and the associated CP, 31% and 10% of axonemal cross-sections revealed a 9 + 2 and 9 + 1 axoneme, respectively. Moreover, PF16 assembly was observed in trypanosome axonemes in which TbBasalin was undetectable, indicating that some CP assembly occurs in the absence of the basal plate. How are these CPs formed in the absence of a basal plate? In TbBasalin RNAi cells, very new flagella in the early stages of construction were PF16 negative, and the probability of (often ectopic) PF16 assembly into the axoneme increased as the flagellum elongated. Further, in LmxBasalin KO cells, PF16 incorporation was much less likely in the very short, non-protruding flagella that likely correspond to the newest flagella in the population, and when PF16 was incorporation into the protruding flagella is was usually incomplete. All of this evidence, taken together suggests that in the absence of the basal plate, CP nucleation happens at a relatively low frequency and ectopically, in the distal axoneme. Therefore, the observed CPs may reflect stochastic self-assembly of the CP microtubules inside axonemes, possibly due to mis-localisation of nucleating factors in the absence of the basal plate. Consistent with this, studies in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> demonstrate that the CP can self-assemble at different points along pre-formed flagella during cytoplasmic complementation of katanin mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lechtreck et al., 2013</xref>). Under the normal conditions of an elongating flagellum, the presence of a basal plate-located nucleating factor may facilitate the assembly of a full CP running from the basal plate to tip.</p><p>Gamma tubulin and the gamma tubulin ring complex are essential for CP nucleation in trypanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McKean et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhou and Li, 2015</xref>), but the mechanism by which this occurs is not clear. Our data using fluorescent protein tagging, and previous findings using small epitope tags, localised gamma tubulin to the proximal end of the basal body, at a position ~400 nm proximal to the site of CP nucleation. A clear structural ortholog of the normal cilium TZ basal plate is not evident in the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> flagellum, but gamma tubulin has been located to the algae-specific stellate structure within its TZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Silflow et al., 1999</xref>) possibly indicating a role in CP nucleation. However, in mutants where the stellate structure was lost the central pair ‘penetrated’ into the basal body, suggesting it may in fact function as a barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jarvik and Suhan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koblenz et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, the CP was not observed in the TZ in our kinetoplastid basal plate mutants, suggesting these structures are not analogous.</p><p>The concentration of gamma tubulin signal at the trypanosome basal body may represent a pre-assembly pool, possibly interacting with alpha and beta tubulins and cofactors for more distal CP assembly. Alternatively, there could be a small, undetected focus of gamma tubulin within the TZ basal plate area, although other proteins can be easily located at the basal plate. Thus, gamma tubulin may be nucleating the CP directly at the basal plate, or if the more delocalised concentration of gamma tubulin at the basal body proximal end is real then this may indicate that CP nucleation takes place at a slight distance from the basal plate. In this latter model the basal plate may act to capture a CP structure whose assembly is initiated elsewhere, rather than nucleating the CP. However, in both the nucleating and capturing models there must be number control, that is two and only two CP microtubules are incorporated into the centre of the axoneme. <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> mutants that are missing radial spokes have 4 CP microtubules; similarly, axonemes from SAS6 mutants that have 10 doublets also have 4 CP microtubules, suggesting that the space available within the axoneme plays a role in limiting CP number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lechtreck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mitchell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nakazawa et al., 2014</xref>). However, the origin of the extra CP in these mutants is not clear, and could be caused by a nucleation phenotype or by a single CP that breaks and slides or grows to form two parallel CPs. The absence of extra CPs in basalin mutants argues that CP number is still constrained, but does not rule out number control via specific CP nucleating or capturing sites within the basal plate.</p><p>At the base of the flagellum in <italic>L. mexicana</italic> parental cells, the ‘lumen’ of the transition zone has a different electron density from that of the inner region of the axoneme, with the basal plate delimiting a clear ‘border’ between the TZ and axoneme inner regions. In contrast, longitudinal sections through the centre of the proximal flagellum of basalin KO cells revealed no clear border between the inner regions of the TZ and the axoneme, as these regions had a homogeneous electron density, which may indicate a boundary function for the <italic>Leishmania</italic> basal plate. However, axonemal structures, such as radial spokes and dynein arms, did not penetrate into the TZ in <italic>Leishmania</italic> or trypanosome basal plate mutants, suggesting that the TZ/axoneme boundary remained intact despite the loss of the basal plate.</p><p>Initial analyses failed to find basalin orthologs outside the <italic>Trypanosoma spp.</italic> and it was only after rigorous examination of the synteny, BLAST score, localisation and function that we were able to conclude the LmxM.22.1070 is the <italic>L. mexicana</italic> ortholog of basalin. Analysis of the trypanosome nuclear pore complex (NPC) architecture suggested common ancestry with yeast and metazoan NPCs despite the lack of sequence conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DeGrasse et al., 2009</xref>). However, basalin divergence is far more extreme because sequence homology was not clear even within the kinetoplastids. Interestingly, both TbBasalin and LmxBasalin are predicted to contain ~65% intrinsically disordered residues. Proteins with a high degree of intrinsic disorder have been shown to associate with different elements of the cytoskeleton, including microtubules, actin, intermediate filaments and motor proteins (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guharoy et al., 2013</xref>). Their roles include acting as hub proteins in protein-protein interaction networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dosztányi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dunker et al., 2005</xref>), scaffold proteins that cause ‘enforced proximity’ of proteins to promote their interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buday and Tompa, 2010</xref>), or acting as molecular ‘glue’ that becomes rigid once the protein complex has formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Uversky, 2015</xref>). Often only a few specific peptides are conserved and these proteins acquire structure upon interaction with a binding partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cumberworth et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, it may be that basalin is under little selective pressure to retain its primary sequence and that a few specific residues in a disordered polypeptide are sufficient to retain its interactions and function. Supporting this, the HHpred-driven alignment of TbBasalin and LmxBasalin suggests that a core helical scaffold is conserved that is rather plastic to insertions of sequences predicted as ‘disordered’. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that the expression of TbBasalin in <italic>L. mexicana</italic> did not rescue the LmxBasalin knockout phenotype, demonstrating some degree of biochemical divergence.</p><p>Given the difficulties in identifying the relationship between the trypanosome and <italic>Leishmania</italic> orthologs, more distant orthologs in other organisms would not be detected using BLAST-based methods. This raises the intriguing possibility that basalin has distant orthologs in other organisms and represents a key player in a fundamental mechanism of basal plate formation and CP assembly. The discovery that a fundamental and conserved flagellum structure and function involves such widely divergent orthologues was totally dependent on our use of kinetoplastids such as <italic>Leishmania</italic> and trypanosomes, whose genomes have retained an enormous degree of synteny. This is one of the few groups of organisms where this type of syntenic genome analysis is possible. This raises the fundamental issue that the proportion of lineage-specific proteins in flagellar proteomes of the various model systems is likely to have been over-estimated, and that some proteins that have been categorised as clade specific may, in fact, be highly divergent ancient proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Light and electron microscopy</title><p>Live cells and detergent extracted ‘cytoskeletons’ were prepared for light and electron microscopy as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dean et al., 2015</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Basalin: an evolutionary unconstrained protein revealed via a conserved role in basal plate function&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>All three reviewers agree that the work is (1) novel, (2) of excellent technical quality and (3) supports the main conclusions. However, one major issue was raised during the discussion regarding the lack of explanation as to how loss of basalin/the basal plate affects the central pair. Some suggestions are mentioned below that could help answer this question. This would considerably strengthen your manuscript and give it a wider scope. The proposed experiments seem accessible given the tools you already have in hand.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>1) The novel protein basalin is required for the assembly of the basal plate, an electron-dense structure at the base of the central pair (CP) of axonemal microtubules. When basalin is ablated in <italic>Trypanosoma</italic>, the assembly of the basal plate is impaired, the central pair is mostly absent, the flagella are shorter, and cell growth/cytokinesis are affected.</p><p>2) The localization of transition zone protein TZP103.8 depends on basalin, while gamma tubulin accumulates at the basal body independently of basalin.</p><p>3) The authors identify a basalin-related protein in <italic>Leishmania</italic>, which displays little sequence conservation but is required for basal plate assembly, as shown by knockout experiments. The conclusion that proteins with little conservation of primary structure can perform similar functions is well supported. The fluorescence images are beautiful and very convincing. The paper is well written and structured for the most part.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>How does basal plate loss affect the central pair is an important issue. We propose to perform a time course experiment during RNAi knockdown to monitor central pair presence/absence in trypanosomes. With the tools available (tagged cell lines with CP proteins, possibly TEM), it should be possible to determine whether the CP microtubules are just not made or actually lose contact with the top of the TZ and then shorten. Analysing PF16 and hydin distribution in cells with two flagella at different stages of elongation should provide essential insights. Releasing cells from basalin RNAi could also be a powerful way to monitor the relationship between CP and basal plate/basalin. The CP is still present in the <italic>Leishmania</italic> knockout and the authors explain this by suggesting the existence of an alternative mechanism of CP formation. It seems that this idea could be tested in <italic>Trypanosoma</italic>.</p><p>Another point to clarify is the differences in CP formation between <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> and <italic>Leishmania</italic> (BP-dependent vs. BP-independent). Indeed, the authors use the subtitle &quot;Basalin is essential for building the axonemal central pair&quot; and discuss how gamma tubulin and how the basal plate might determine the number of CP microtubules, both of which is not in agreement with published data (4 CP MTs are formed in the absence of radial spokes) nor their own data (2 CP MTs are still made in <italic>Leishmania</italic>, which has no BP, and gamma tub is neither at the BP nor is it distribution affected by BP loss/basalin knock-down).</p><p>The final main point to clarify relates to the role of TZP103.8. The authors report in the 2016 PNAS paper that RNAi against TZP103.8 &quot;caused a reduced basal plate&quot;, but here in this paper cite the 2016 paper as showing RNAi against 103.8 did not cause disappearance of the BP. Could you please clarify this? For example, 103.8 RNAi causes a BP defect, albeit not &quot;full disappearance&quot;, but retains basalin. Thus, the complete lack of BP in basalin KF, which lacks basalin + TXP103.8, could result from combined requirement of basalin and TZP103.8.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42282.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>How does basal plate loss affect the central pair is an important issue.

We chose to use PF16 as a CP marker because, as shown in Figure 1, this gives the clearest “absence vs. presence” pattern. This allowed us to unambiguously identify flagella that are absent for basalin and, by examining detergent extracted “cytoskeletons” prepared from cells undergoing division, examine the effect of basalin ablation upon PF16 assembly into newly-made axonemes.</p><p>Basalin-negative new flagella were not observed in a significant number of cells until 48 hours after RNAi. The delayed onset of RNAi penetrance is likely due to a cellular pool of basalin that must be depleted before basalin-negative flagella are observed. We therefore focussed on this timepoint for our analysis.</p><p>We then examined PF16 labelling in the new flagellum of dividing cells, using cell cycle position defined by the number of kinetoplasts and nuclei to score the ‘age’ of new flagella. Examining basalin-negative new flagella in dividing cells demonstrated that PF16 was nearly always absent at the earliest stages of elongation. Importantly, at more advanced cell-cycle stages, new flagella in dividing cells were more likely to be positive for PF16 (28% and 45% of new flagella were PF16 positive in 2k1n and 2k2n cells, respectively); however, flagella that were positive for PF16 but negative for basalin had incomplete PF16 incorporation, such that the central pair marker was missing from significant portions of the axoneme.</p><p>The discovery that, in basalin negative flagella, early new flagella are negative for PF16 and that the frequency of PF16 incorporation increases in late new flagella, strongly argues for a defect in central pair nucleation at the axoneme base, with subsequent ‘ectopic’ assembly in a relatively small percentage (10-20%) of elongating axonemes. The alternative hypothesis, that the central pair is nucleated correctly but loses contact with the top of the TZ and then shortens or collapses due to a stabilisation defect, is unlikely because one would expect to see flagella in the very early stages of elongation that are positive for PF16, with decreasing frequency of PF16-positive new flagella in later cell cycle stages.</p><p>Nevertheless, this new dataset does not rule out a linked/connected role for the basal plate in central pair stabilisation, in addition to its role in central pair nucleation.</p><p>The manuscript and figures have been amended to reflect this new data and the addition of this important conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another point to clarify is the differences in CP formation between Trypanosoma and Leishmania (BP-dependent vs. BP-independent).

Importantly, this incorporation occurs at a higher frequency in “older” new flagella and is incomplete.</p><p>This strongly indicates that, in the absence of the trypanosome basal plate, central pair nucleation in these cells is delayed until after the start of axoneme elongation. This is consistent with the LmxBasalin knockout TEM data, which shows that cross-sections of the “external” (i.e., distal) axoneme of flagella outside the pocket are more likely to have a central pair than cross-sections of the proximal axoneme inside the flagellar pocket. These data suggest that delayed, ectopic central pair formation in the absence of basalin can occur in the few Basalin KO cells that manage to elongate an axoneme past the flagellar pocket opening.</p><p>To evaluate PF16 incorporation (as a surrogate for central pair formation) in cells lacking basalin, we reproduced the LmxBasalin KO in <italic>Leishmania</italic> cells expressing PF16::eYFP and examined PF16::eYFP incorporation in cytoskeletons. We were not able to ascertain the “age” of flagella using the cell cycle position of dividing cells because cells with two ‘free’ flagella were not observed in KO cells, likely because the new flagellum remained short and therefore hidden inside the flagellar pocket of the cell. Instead, we examined PF16 assembly into flagella that were protruding (long) and those that did not protrude from the flagellar pocket, reasoning that the long flagella were likely to be the oldest flagella.</p><p>This revealed that cells with an external flagellum were more likely to incorporate PF16, and that PF16 assembly into these flagella was incomplete and often missing from substantial portions of the axoneme. Combined with the EM data, this demonstrates that CP and PF16 assembly can occur in flagella that have no basal plate, and suggests that this assembly is often ectopic and aberrant.</p><p>In summary, our data does not support a difference in central pair nucleation mechanisms and basal plate function between trypanosomes and <italic>Leishmania</italic>. The manuscript and subtitle have been changed to reflect this new data.</p><p>We have modified our discussion of CP number control to include discussion of CP assembly in radial spoke mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The final main point to clarify relates to the role of TZP103.8.
