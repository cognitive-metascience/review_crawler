pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39494.001</object-id><p>Rotaviruses (RVs), a leading cause of severe diarrhea in young children and many mammalian species, have evolved multiple strategies to counteract the host innate immunity, specifically interferon (IFN) signaling through RV non-structural protein 1 (NSP1). However, whether RV structural components also subvert antiviral response remains under-studied. Here, we found that MAVS, critical for the host RNA sensing pathway upstream of IFN induction, is degraded by the RV RNA methyl- and guanylyl-transferase (VP3) in a host-range-restricted manner. Mechanistically, VP3 localizes to the mitochondria and mediates the phosphorylation of a previously unidentified SPLTSS motif within the MAVS proline-rich region, leading to its proteasomal degradation and blockade of IFN-λ production in RV-infected intestinal epithelial cells. Importantly, VP3 inhibition of MAVS activity contributes to enhanced RV replication and to viral pathogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Collectively, our findings establish RV VP3 as a viral antagonist of MAVS function in mammals and uncover a novel pathogen-mediated inhibitory mechanism of MAVS signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Timely induction of the interferon (IFN) response is pivotal for the host to mount a successful defense against invading viruses and other intracellular microbial pathogens and requires precise orchestration of several signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ivashkiv and Donlin, 2014</xref>). Cytoplasmic RNA pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) generated during virus replication, including viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediate or genome, 5’-triphosphate RNA and other byproducts, are sensed by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including RIG-I and MDA5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kato et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Uzri and Greenberg, 2013</xref>). PRRs in turn activate the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), a predominantly mitochondria and partially peroxisome-resident protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bender et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Odendall et al., 2014</xref>), for downstream signal transduction and IFN production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seth et al., 2005</xref>). Due to its central role in host antiviral immunity, <italic>Mavs</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice are highly susceptible to multiple RNA virus infections, such as West Nile virus (WNV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pinto et al., 2014</xref>), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhoj et al., 2008</xref>), coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2010</xref>), rotavirus (RV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broquet et al., 2011</xref>), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sun et al., 2006</xref>). MAVS expression in the hematopoietic compartment is also critical for proper T cell functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>) and a T cell-independent antibody response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zeng et al., 2014</xref>). Since virus evolution is driven, in part, by host antiviral selection pressure, MAVS provides a useful tool to study virus immune evasion strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Patel et al., 2012</xref>). Multiple virus-encoded factors, including hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bender et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferreira et al., 2016</xref>), hepatitis A virus (HAV) 3ABC precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2007</xref>), enterovirus (EV) 71 2Apro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2013</xref>) and coronavirus SARS-CoV ORF9b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shi et al., 2014</xref>), all inhibit MAVS signaling through its cleavage or degradation. In fact, the ability of HAV to block human but not murine MAVS constitutes the basis of the HAV relative host range restriction to humans <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hirai-Yuki et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, the viral MAVS antagonists identified to date have been mostly non-structural proteins with the exception of influenza PB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Long and Fodor, 2016</xref>). In the present study, we report the unexpected discovery that the RV RNA capping enzyme VP3, an important RV structural protein, recently shown to also possess phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), also mediates MAVS degradation in an RV strain-specific manner. Of note, replication of a simian RV, which is unable to degrade murine MAVS, is significantly enhanced in <italic>Mavs</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Additionally, VP3 expression during RV infection induces specific degradation of the full-length functional MAVS protein but not the truncated ‘mini’-MAVS that does not activate IFN signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brubaker et al., 2014</xref>), thereby highlighting several previously unrecognized specificities in the virus-host arms race.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Intestinal epithelial cells predominantly produce type III IFN</title><p>RVs are segmented, dsRNA viruses that primarily infect the mature intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) located at the tip of the villi in the host small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Estes and Greenberg, 2013</xref>). A large number of mammalian and avian species are infected with their own host specific RV strains in a host range restricted fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ciarlet et al., 1998</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that both type I and type III IFNs are able to effectively restrict the replication of heterologous (non-murine) but not homologous (murine) RVs in suckling mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2016</xref>). It was also noted that in RV infected suckling mice, the bulk of type I IFNs (IFN-α/β) derive from the CD45<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic compartment whereas type III IFNs (IFN-λs) are produced primarily by the intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hernández et al., 2015</xref>). Here, to further delineate the IFN induction pathway in intestinal cell lines and primary IECs, we first generated, via CRISPR-Cas9, a single clonal <italic>MAVS</italic> knockout in the human colonic epithelial HT-29 cell line. Complete knockout of both full-length (FL) MAVS (75 kD) and mini-MAVS (52 kD) was confirmed by western blot and Sanger sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We noted that wild-type (WT) HT-29 cells expressed and secreted significantly more <italic>IFNL3</italic> mRNA (40–60 fold) and IFN-λ protein (31–34 fold) than type I IFN (<italic>IFNB</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), in response to RNA PAMPs, such as stimulation with poly(I:C), a dsRNA mimic, or RV infection, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pervolaraki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Saxena et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, <italic>MAVS</italic><sup>-/-</sup> HT-29 cells were completely defective in both, suggesting that: (1) HT-29 cells produced more IFN-λ than IFN-β, and (2) that this IFN secretory process was mediated through the RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS RNA sensing pathway in HT-29 cells. To validate these findings in a more physiologic system, we utilized a human origin ileum enteroid preparation that consisted entirely of primary IECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Saxena et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with the findings in HT-29 cells, we found that following infection with RV or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), an excellent source of RNA PAMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kell and Gale, 2015</xref>), human IECs expressed much more (50 fold) <italic>IFNL3</italic> than <italic>IFNB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Importantly, this type III IFN signature is specific for IECs, since <italic>IFNB</italic> was robustly expressed in RV-infected or poly(I:C) stimulated HEK293 cells, a human non-intestinal epithelial origin cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Both <italic>IFNB</italic> and <italic>IFNL3</italic> expression were reduced to baseline levels in the absence of MAVS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that human IECs intrinsically differ from some human non-intestinal origin cells and preferentially express IFN-λ over IFN-β in response to RNA PAMP stimulation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39494.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>IECs predominantly produce type III IFN in response to RNA PAMP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) WT and <italic>MAVS</italic><sup>-/-</sup> HT-29 cells were stimulated with low molecular weight (LMW) poly (<bold>I:C</bold>) (200 ng/ml) or infected with the simian RV RRV strain (MOI = 1) for 24 hr.

These associations were further documented in NIH3T3 cells, a mouse origin fibroblast cell line, where only the murine RV ETD strain efficiently degraded murine MAVS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lower panel). Species-specific MAVS degradation was recapitulated using human RV infection and Flag-tagged MAVS from human, African Green monkey and rhesus monkey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Since MAVS acts upstream of both IRF3 and NF-κB signaling, we next examined the functional significance of RV-induced MAVS degradation.

The present data indicate that only the expression of RV RNA methyl- and guanylyl-transferase VP3 and viroporin NSP4 could possibly lead to the degradation of endogenous FL-MAVS in MA104 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). IRF3, a well-characterized substrate of NSP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barro and Patton, 2005</xref>), served as a positive control and was only degraded following NSP1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These findings are further supported by the significant dose dependent reduction of ectopically expressed rhesus MAVS by simian RRV VP3 but not RRV NSP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Moreover, using a series of reassortant RVs derived from the simian RRV and bovine UK RV strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2011</xref>), we found that only the two reassortant RVs that encoded an RRV VP3 (7-1-1 and 27-3-1) were able to degrade rhesus MAVS in MA104 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, upper panel). Similarly, only the two reassortant RVs derived from the cross of simian RRV and murine EW RVs, both of which encoded a murine RV VP3 (B7/2 and D6/2), were able to degrade murine MAVS in NIH3T3 cells as compared to WT RRV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, lower panel), suggesting that the host range restricted MAVS degradation during RV infection can be recapitulated by VP3 derived from several different RV strains.

We infected MA104 cells with RRV in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, performed IP with anti-MAVS antibody, and identified bound RV proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, left panel and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We hypothesized that the use of MG132 would block MAVS degradation and stabilize any MAVS-RV protein complex. Notably, although the total levels of VP3 did not increase in MG132-treated cells (data not shown), only VP3 and not NSP3 or NSP4, was enriched in the immune-precipitate of the MG132 group in which MAVS proteasomal degradation was inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, right panel). These data support the hypothesis that VP3 rather than other RV proteins, physically interacts with MAVS to target it for degradation. In fact, the pull-down of NSP4 from MAVS interactome decreased in the presence of MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, right panel). We further interrogated possible VP3-MAVS interactions using traditional IP with both ectopic expression of Flag-tagged MAVS and GFP-tagged VP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and purified recombinant MAVS and VP3 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). While NSP4 did not co-precipitate with MAVS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), in both cases, we observed VP3 in the IP lysates, again suggesting that the VP3-MAVS, but not the NSP4-MAVS, interaction is likely to be direct.</p><p>To delineate the molecular basis underlying VP3-mediated MAVS degradation, we generated a series of RRV VP3 mutants containing N7-MTase, 2’-O-MTase, GTase/RTPase and PDE domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ogden et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, left panel), and examined their respective ability to immunoprecipitate and degrade MAVS. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that a previously uncharacterized N-terminal region (171 amino acids) of VP3 was important for its mitochondrial localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In contrast, NSP1 was largely localized to the Golgi apparatus as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding et al., 2016</xref>) and did not co-localize with MAVS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Importantly, the N-terminal domain itself, which turns out to be the most variable region with VP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ogden et al., 2014</xref>), was sufficient to induce MAVS degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, right panel). Co-IP experiments also pinpointed the N-terminal domain to be the MAVS-interacting part of VP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). We found that the C-terminal PDE domain, recently shown to prevent RNaseL activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sánchez-Tacuba et al., 2015</xref>), was not required for MAVS degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Importantly, neither pharmacological inhibitors of PDE activity nor site-directed mutagenesis of the two key histidine residues (H718, H797) within the PDE catalytic sites rescued MAVS levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>), suggesting that unlike RNaseL inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), the PDE enzymatic activity itself was not involved in MAVS degradation.</p><p>To further verify the role of the VP3 N-terminal region in mediating RV strain-specific MAVS degradation, we ectopically expressed VP3 derived from different RV strains. Consistent with our observation in the context of virus infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we observed a specific interaction between simian MAVS and VP3 from simian RV RRV strain, and not with VP3 from murine and human RV strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Importantly, replacing the first 171 N-terminal amino acids from simian RRV strain with those from murine ETD RV strain completely abrogated the VP3-MAVS interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), verifying a key role of VP3 N-terminus in MAVS binding. We also found that, similar to RV infection, blocking the proteasome by MG132 prevented MAVS degradation by VP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). We have not yet been able to identify a single host E3 ligase that is responsible for the ubiquitination event of MAVS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>), despite multiple efforts to use siRNA to knock down several E3 ligases such as TRIM25, AIP4 and MARCH5, all previously reported to induce MAVS ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castanier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yoo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">You et al., 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, our results clearly indicate that using its N-terminal region, RV structural protein VP3 localizes to the mitochondria and interacts with and targets MAVS for proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Multiple MAVS domains are required for efficient degradation by VP3</title><p>Previous studies uncovered several regulatory motifs within MAVS that are essential to its antiviral function and oligomerization capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). To identify the minimal subunit of MAVS that is subject to VP3-mediated degradation, we constructed a series of chimeric simian MAVS proteins with GFP fused to distinct regions, including the N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), the proline-rich region (PRR), and the transmembrane (TM) region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seth et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

It is intriguing that this CARD domain is missing from the signaling-defective mini-MAVS protein that is not degraded by RV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We found that lysine 10 is more important in VP3-mediated MAVS degradation, as mutation of K10 partially rescued MAVS levels in both single and double mutants K10A and K7AK10A respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, upper panel). Changing lysines to arginines to conserve the positive charge (K7RK10R) also partially blocked RV-infection induced MAVS degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, lower panel). K10 is highly conserved among MAVS from different species and is also required for its degradation by human RV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Through the use of a panel of ubiquitin mutants, we noted that during RRV infection, MAVS was modified by K48 poly-ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), consistent with its degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p>To gain additional mechanistic insights into the sequential events leading to MAVS degradation, we sought to identify possible post-translational modifications (PTMs) on MAVS during infection. As previously noted, both FL-MAVS and mini-MAVS expressed in mammalian cells migrate at larger band sizes than their predicted molecular weights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brubaker et al., 2014</xref>) and the same recombinant proteins from a bacterial expression system have correct sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hou et al., 2011</xref>). Although we did not detect any glycosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>, upper panel) or AMPylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>, lower panel), our high-resolution IP-MS using mock or RV-infected cell lysates and antibody against endogenous MAVS revealed three novel arginine methylation sites and a cluster of phosphorylated residues that had not been previously reported in phospho-proteome databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hornbeck et al., 2015</xref>) and thus represents novel phosphorylation hotspots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Similar to the prior characterization of serine-rich clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2015</xref>), this region consists of <sup>188</sup>SPLTSS<sup>193</sup> and <underline>is located in PRR</underline>, which we found to be required for VP3-mediated MAVS degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Within the SPLTSS motif, two serines and one threonine were phosphorylated during RV infection and these phosphorylation modifications were individual events that totaled to 16.0% of total MAVS proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). We further detected the same phosphorylation modifications in the SPLTSS motif when recombinant VP3 was expressed alone (data not shown), further indicating that this process is entirely mediated by RV VP3. TBK1, a key kinase downstream of MAVS signaling for IFN activation, was not responsible for MAVS phosphorylation at this novel site (data not shown). Remarkably, mutagenesis of the SPLTSS motif to six alanines completely abolished RV-induced MAVS degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). In contrast, mutation of all three methylated arginines to alanines did not prevent MAVS degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Importantly, disruption of this highly conserved SPLTSS motif in human MAVS also prevented MAVS phosphorylation and inhibited human RV-induced degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To shed more light on the molecular events leading to MAVS degradation, we also tested the ability of different MAVS mutants to bind to VP3. As expected, we observed specific binding of VP3 from human RV to human MAVS but not to simian MAVS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), suggesting that the interaction is the prerequisite of subsequent degradation. Interestingly, disruption of either the SPLTSS motif or the three-arginine site did not alter interaction with VP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), implying that VP3-MAVS interaction occurs independent of the SPLTSS motif. We also found that these MAVS proteins, including the SPLTSS and K7RK10R mutants, were still fully functional at inducing type I and type III IFN expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that VP3 mediated MAVS degradation is important for blocking the downstream signaling.

We first orally infected 5-day-old wild-type B6129SF2/J pups with the homologous EW strain of murine RV (10<sup>4</sup> diarrhea dose 50) or a heterologous simian RV RRV strain (10<sup>7</sup> plaque forming units, PFUs), doses that cause diarrhea in at least 90% of inoculated pups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feng et al., 2013</xref>).

Since RRV infects significantly fewer IECs than EW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feng et al., 2013</xref>), we would expect that RRV-induced IFN-λ expression is even higher on a single-cell level. A diminished IFN-λ response to EW infection is consistent with MAVS inhibition and disruption of the IFN induction pathway.</p><p>To further determine the importance and relative contribution of MAVS degradation to RV replication <italic>in vivo</italic>, we compared fecal RV antigen shedding induced by EW and RRV infection in WT and <italic>Mavs</italic><sup>-/-</sup> pups over a 12 day course.

In the present study, we add to the current understanding how RV, a ubiquitous dsRNA virus and highly important human pathogen that is very sensitive to the antiviral effects of IFN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnold et al., 2013b</xref>), avoids innate immune surveillance.</p><p>By combining genome editing techniques, proteomics, mutagenesis, intestinal enteroids, and a highly tractable mouse model of homologous and heterologous RV infection and disease, we uncovered a unique mechanism employed by homologous RVs to target MAVS in their homologous host for degradation and inhibit the RNA sensing pathway in infected IECs. We found that human HT-29 cells produce significantly more IFN-λ than IFN-β in response to the dsRNA RV infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This is consistent with the data derived from T84 cells, another human colonic epithelial cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Odendall et al., 2014</xref>). That study also revealed a differentiation-dependent increase in the ratio of IFN-λ/IFN-β expression, which correlated with the abundance of peroxisomes and IFN-λ expression after viral infection. We also confirmed this finding using primary human intestinal enteroids that naturally harbor tight junctions similar to differentiated T84 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that a preferential IFN-λ induction appears to be a specific feature of human IECs. Despite the report of anti-RV roles of both type I and type III IFNs using various IFN receptor knockout mice <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pott et al., 2011</xref>), whether IFN-λ plays a physiological role in suppressing RV replication in an entirely human IEC environment awaits further testing. However, our other observation that pex-MAVS induces both IFN-λ and IFN-β expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, right panel) is in contrast to the previously reported role of pex-MAVS capable of specifically activating IFN-λ in response to <italic>Listeria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Odendall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding and Robek, 2014</xref>).

It is noteworthy that neither our present study nor the Bender S et al. paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bender et al., 2015</xref>) used a cytosolic MAVS as a control. It is likely that the extent of IFN-β induction via pex-MAVS occurs in a pathogen (or context)-specific manner.</p><p>It was previously noted that although RVs bound with the same efficiency to MA104 cells and HT-29 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bass et al., 1992</xref>), HT-29 cells appeared to be more sensitive to human RV infection than MA104 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Superti et al., 1991</xref>). The molecular mechanism behind this cell culture restriction was unclear. Here, we found that human RVs replicate better in human origin cells by employing a novel strategy, a host range restricted MAVS degradation ability, to block IFN-λ expression in infected IECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Such a highly selective inhibitory event is reminiscent of the prototypic HCV NS3/4A protease and HAV ABC protease, both of which specifically inhibit human but not murine MAVS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2007</xref>). This is another instructive example of virus-host co-evolution, resulting in a unique pattern of virus strain-host species matched MAVS degradation. Mechanistically, the RV RNA capping enzyme VP3 localizes to the mitochondria using a previously uncharacterized N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ogden et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), induces MAVS phosphorylation at the SPLTSS motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) and subsequent ubiquitination at the K10 residue within the CARD domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), and this series of events mediates MAVS proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The identification of a novel phosphorylated SPLTSS motif is intriguing, given that a host kinase is likely involved. It also invites the question as to whether other proteins with a similar motif are subject to RV regulation. A quick search through the NCBI database reveals human mucin-3 precursor as a potential candidate, which has two SPLTSS motifs and is specifically expressed in the small intestine.</p><p>A missing piece in the understanding of the degradative interplay between VP3 and MAVS is the identity of a host E3 ubiquitin ligase. The fact that MAVS is K48 poly-ubiquitinated and degraded at the proteasome suggests the involvement of an E3 ligase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4E</xref>). Given the recent report that RV NSP1 requires the host Cullin-E3 ligase complex to degrade β-TrCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding et al., 2016</xref>), it is possible that RV does not possess a virally encoded E3 ligase(s). In an effort to identify host factors critical for VP3-mediated MAVS degradation, we tested the efficacy of MLN4924, a pan-cullin inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Soucy et al., 2009</xref>), to inhibit MAVS degradation. However, this small molecule did not affect MAVS levels during RV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). In addition, siRNA silencing of the expression of a panel of known MAVS negative regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castanier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yoo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">You et al., 2009</xref>) had minimal effect on MAVS degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). We also performed IP-MS and compiled a list of host E3 ligases that interact with MAVS during RV infection. Unfortunately, knocking down any of them did not rescue MAVS from degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>), leaving the possibility of some redundancy in usurping E3 ligase complexes by VP3 to target MAVS.</p><p>We extended our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings to the whole animal and demonstrated efficient VP3-mediated MAVS degradation during RV infection in the suckling mouse model. The degradation of MAVS at least partially contributes to the successful suppression of host innate immunity and RV host range restriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Compared to the minimal effects of MAVS on homologous murine RV infection of suckling mice, the intra-intestinal replication and fecal shedding of heterologous simian RV was enhanced approximately 100-fold in <italic>Mavs</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). This enhancement was significantly more dramatic than the 10-fold difference that we observed in <italic>MAVS</italic><sup>-/-</sup> HT-29 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The disparity is likely due to both the type and amount of IFNs induced in these distinct environments: both type I and III IFNs from IECs and hematopoietic cells contribute to virus inhibition <italic>in vivo</italic> in contrast to a limited IFN-λ secretion in HT-29 cells. This proposed model is in agreement with our data that the heterologous RV replication was not significantly different at extra-intestinal tissues including the mesenteric lymph nodes in WT and <italic>Mavs</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), where the dominant immune cell populations that RVs do not infect contribute to the majority of the IFNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In summary, this work reveals a new phosphorylation motif (SPLTSS) within MAVS that is subject to RV VP3 mediated regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and this effect on MAVS appears to be host range restricted. Our data also documents, for the first time, that inflammasome mediated antiviral signaling is comparable to IFN signaling in its ability to suppress heterologous RV replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). As both IFN and inflammasome components are highly expressed in IECs and presumed to be mutually inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guarda et al., 2011</xref>), how these two antiviral signaling cascades are coordinated in the small intestine in response to viral infections will be an active focus of future studies. It might also be interesting to test whether other enteric RNA viruses, in particular norovirus, has developed similar approaches to suppress MAVS signaling in the small intestine.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells and reagents</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Cells</title><p>African Green Monkey kidney epithelial cell lines MA104 (CRL-2378.1) and COS-7 (CRL-1651) were originally obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in complete M199 medium.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Barbara Sherry (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, the authors describe a novel rotavirus immune evasion strategy involving a viral structural protein, VP3, that binds MAVS, an important component of innate immune activation, leading to its degradation in a ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent manner. By testing species-specific rotaviruses in their homologous and heterologous hosts, the authors show that MAVS degradation occurs only in the natural virus-host pairs, an observation that explains, at least in part, rotavirus species specificity. The authors perform deletion and mutational analyses of VP3 and MAVS to roughly determine regions important for their interaction. Another novel aspect of this study is the identification of a phospho-acceptor cluster in the MAVS PRR domain. This cluster is phosphorylated upon virus infection, and when the authors block phosphorylation by mutagenesis, MAVS degradation was prevented. Based on these observations, the authors propose that phosphorylation of this cluster is required for MAVS degradation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to provide direct evidence that disrupting the VP3-MAVS interaction will prevent MAVS degradation in virus-infected cells.</p><p>2) The mass spec data on MAVS phosphorylation needs to be further documented and explained. For example, what fraction of the total protein is phosphorylated in mock and infected cells? Also, were the serines and threonine in the cluster always co-phosphorylated? Are there data to determine if the same MAVS molecules are both phosphorylated and ubiquitinated? Native mass spec might be helpful in sorting out these complexities.</p><p>3) The functional significance of MAVS phosphorylation has not been directly established. It is unclear what fraction of total MAVS is phosphorylated in rotavirus-infected cells, and if the loss of MAVS function is due to its phosphorylation, degradation or both. Also, it's not clear if VP3 has a direct role in MAVS phosphorylation (for example, does phosphorylation occur in VP3-transfected cells?).</p><p>4) The authors use peroxisome-localized alleles of MAVS to verify previous studies that RLR signaling from this organelle can induces Type III IFNs after viral infection. The authors also demonstrate that peroxisome-localized MAVS can induce Type I IFNs in response to rotavirus infection. A critical control experiment is missing from this study, and the study by Bender et al., which was cited in the text. This control is to use a MAVS allele that is cytosolic. This allele was described in the Odendall paper cited above and is necessary to make any conclusions regarding the importance of peroxisomal verses mitochondrial localization. At the least, the authors should revise the text to address this comment and the following one.</p><p>5) The authors should also note that the Bender and Odendall studies were in agreement that peroxisome-localized MAVS has the ability to induce Type I IFNs, in a pathogen specific manner. Odendall showed that <italic>Listeria</italic> induced Type I IFN expression via peroxisome-localized MAVS, whereas viruses did not. Bender used viruses (not bacteria). Rather than stating in the text that it is controversial whether peroxisome-localized MAVS induces IFN-β, it is more correct to state that this process occurs in a pathogen (or context)-specific manner. In contrast, Type III IFN expression is a common output from peroxisome-localized MAVS.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39494.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to provide direct evidence that disrupting the VP3-MAVS interaction will prevent MAVS degradation in virus-infected cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting the inclusion of this important experiment. Through a series of VP3 truncation mutants, we have mapped the MAVS interaction motif to the N-terminal 171 amino acids within VP3 (Figure 3E and 3F). In an effort to disrupt VP3-MAVS interaction in the context of RV infection, we utilized the recently developed RV reverse genetics system (Kanai Y et al., PNAS, 2017) to construct a recombinant simian RV that lacks the first 171 amino acids within VP3. The T7 promoter driven mutant plasmid (pT7-SA11-VP3 delta171) was obtained. Unfortunately, although we successfully recovered the wild-type simian RV SA11 strain directly from the BHK-T7/MA104 lysates (~ 800 focus forming unites per ml), the mutant virus with a loss of VP3 N-terminus was not successfully rescued (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>), likely suggesting that the N-terminal region is important for the integrity of VP3 structure/conformation. This possibility will be further explored in future studies. As an alternative approach, we cloned and generated GFP-tagged full length VP3s derived from non-simian RV strains including Wa (a human RV) and ETD (a murine RV). We then showed that, similar to RV infection, VP3 expression recapitulated RV strain-specific MAVS interaction (new Figure 3H). Finally, swapping just the N-terminal 171 amino acids of simian RV VP3 with those from the murine RV ETD strain abrogated the MAVS interaction in MA104 cells (new Figure 3H), verifying the role of VP3 N-terminus in mediating RV strain-specific MAVS-VP3 interaction.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39494.020</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-39494-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The mass spec data on MAVS phosphorylation needs to be further documented and explained.

Surprisingly, we found no co-phosphorylation on the two serines and one threonine within the MAVS SPLTSS motif (new Figure 4F), suggesting that these residues likely play a redundant role in mediating MAVS degradation. Further quantification revealed that at 6 hours post infection, pS188 (0.62%), pT191 (4.4%), pS193 (11.0%) made up the total MAVS proteins (new Figure 4F; subsection “Multiple MAVS domains are required for efficient degradation by VP3”, last paragraph). To further understand the role of phosphorylation and ubiquitination (Ub) PTMs on MAVS during RV infection, we performed additional IP-MS experiments to pull down MAVS under native conditions. However, we did not detect any peptides long enough to cover both the N-terminal ubiquitination sites and the phosphorylated SPTLSS motif (data not shown). We reason that this absence of dually labeled peptides could be due to either that the peptides are too far apart or that the modifications occur in a sequential manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The functional significance of MAVS phosphorylation has not been directly established. It is unclear what fraction of total MAVS is phosphorylated in rotavirus-infected cells, and if the loss of MAVS function is due to its phosphorylation, degradation or both. Also, it's not clear if VP3 has a direct role in MAVS phosphorylation (for example, does phosphorylation occur in VP3-transfected cells?).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this important point. As elaborated above, we have now carried out detailed analysis of the MAVS PTMs within the total protein pool and found that MAVS phosphorylated at the SPLTSS cluster compose ~16% of total MAVS at 6 hours post RV infection. Based on the reviewers’ suggestion, we have also now performed additional IP-MS analysis to measure MAVS PTMs post VP3 expression. Consistent with our virus infection results, we found MAVS phosphorylation at SPLTSS in VP3-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). The rate of phosphorylation (10.5%) was slightly lower compared to that observed during RV infection (~16%). and we also noticed such modification to be stable during IFN treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>), suggesting that it is a stable feature driven by RV VP3 protein and is not affected by an IFN feedback loop. This finding has now been added to the Results (subsection “Multiple MAVS domains are required for efficient degradation by VP3”, last paragraph).</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39494.021</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-39494-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors use peroxisome-localized alleles of MAVS to verify previous studies that RLR signaling from this organelle can induces Type III IFNs after viral infection.
