Several molecules implicated in cell interactions also control collective migration, but their precise role and the finely tuned expression that orchestrates this complex developmental process are poorly understood. Here, we show that the timely and threshold expression of the Netrin receptor Frazzled triggers the initiation of glia migration in the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing. Frazzled expression is induced by the transcription factor Glide/Gcm in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, the glial determinant also regulates the efficiency of collective migration. NetrinB but not NetrinA serves as a chemoattractant and Unc5 contributes as a repellant Netrin receptor for glia migration. Our model includes strict spatial localization of a ligand, a cell autonomously acting receptor and a fate determinant that act coordinately to direct glia toward their final destination.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15983.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15983.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Drosophila</kwd><kwd>glial cell</kwd><kwd>collective cell migration</kwd><kwd>glide/gcm</kwd><kwd>frazzled</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CEFIPRA-4403-1</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>graduate student fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>VijayRaghavan</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Giangrande</surname><given-names>Angela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>international award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giangrande</surname><given-names>Angela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>labelisation</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giangrande</surname><given-names>Angela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006105</institution-id><institution>ARC Centre of Excellence for Coherent X-Ray Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Projet grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giangrande</surname><given-names>Angela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004099</institution-id><institution>Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant regional</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giangrande</surname><given-names>Angela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>USIAS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giangrande</surname><given-names>Angela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The role of the Frazzled chemoattractant receptor is to triggers migration initiation as part of the glial developmental program induced by the Glide/Gcm transcription factor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons and glia show mutual reliance in many functional and developmental aspects of biology. Glia migrate collectively and over long distances to establish an intricate relationship with neurons. Defective glia migration is associated with several human diseases including glial brain tumors and defective regeneration following injury in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Klämbt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kocsis and Waxman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Oudega and Xu, 2006</xref>). Hence, a thorough understanding of the molecules involved in the process of glia migration may contribute to the development of therapeutics for these pathologies. Research progress in recent years has revealed the involvement of chemotropic cues in glia migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">von Hilchen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Spassky et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kinrade et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Netrins, a class of secreted laminin-related extracellular proteins, have been described as chemotropic guidance cues for axons and migrating cells during neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lai Wing Sun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harris et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ishii et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kennedy et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mitchell et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Serafini et al., 1994</xref>). In vertebrates, Netrins secreted by the floor plate cells act differentially on the migrating oligodendrocyte precursor cells and this differential outcome is dependant upon the type of receptors expressed in the migrating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Spassky et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wolf and Friedl, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jarjour, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsai et al., 2003</xref>). Netrins act as chemoattractants through the DCC/Frazzled family of receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">von Hilchen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lai Wing Sun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Keino-Masu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kolodziej et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Timofeev et al., 2012</xref>) and chemorepellants through the Unc5 receptor family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Keleman and Dickson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Labrador et al., 2005</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the two Netrins (NetA and NetB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harris et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mitchell et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Keleman and Dickson, 2001</xref>]) and their receptor Frazzled (Fra) mediate the attraction of embryonic longitudinal glia toward the midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">von Hilchen et al., 2010</xref>). Despite the extensive knowledge on these ligands and receptors, the transcriptional control underlying chemoattraction and the impact of this pathway remain largely unknown. For example, what is the specific role of the receptors and how do they contribute to the different steps of collective migration, such as initiation, maintenance and arrest? Related to this issue, which transcription factors regulate the cell-specific and timely expression of the receptors? We here investigate the chemoattraction cascade that controls cell migration using the chain of glial cells across the L1 nerve in the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aigouy et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berzsenyi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kumar et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We show that only one of the two <italic>Drosophila</italic> Netrins, NetB, serves as a chemoattractant for collective glia migration. The role of Fra is to control the time of initiation of glia migration in a dosage-dependent manner, whereas Unc5 acts as the repellant receptor that controls glial arrest. Finally, we identify the transcription factor that controls the expression of Fra at the appropriate time and levels: Glial cell deficient/Glial cell missing (Glide/Gcm or Gcm, for the sake of simplicity), the fate determinant that is expressed early and transiently in the glial lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hosoya et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vincent et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jones et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, we find that an early gene, which regulates the expression of transcription factors that execute a specific cell fate, also regulates effector genes that controls late developmental events. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that a fate determinant directly controls collective cell migration, prompting us to revisit the role and mode of action of these types of molecules during development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Frazzled expression in the glia of the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing</title><p>Fly wings are innervated by two major sensory nerves that navigate along the so-called L1 vein located at the anterior margin (L1 nerve) and along the L3 vein (L3 nerve) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–d</xref>). Glial cells originating from the sensory organ precursors (SOPs) present on the anterior margin migrate proximally, i.e. toward the central nervous system (CNS) following the axon bundle and ensheathing it throughout its length. L1 glia initiate migration at around 18 hr After Puparium Formation (hAPF), reach the level of the Costal nerve at around 22–24 hAPF and join the glial cells on the Radius by 28 hAPF. The migratory process has been accordingly subdivided into three steps: ‘Initiation’, ‘Costa reach’ and ‘Complete migration’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–c</xref>).</p><p>To gain insight into the molecular pathway that triggers collective glia migration, we first examined the expression of the Fra chemoattractant receptor by using the pan glial lines <italic>repo-Gal4 UAS</italic>-PH-GFP (henceforth <italic>repo</italic>&gt;GFP) or <italic>gcm-Gal4 UAS</italic>-CD8-GFP (<italic>gcm</italic>&gt;GFP), which label the glial membranes. Fra is detected in glia at the time these cells begin to move as well as in the underlying axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e–g’’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a–c, g</xref>). The Fra protein seems to be evenly distributed along the L1 glial chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d–g</xref>). We confirmed these data using the CoinFLP technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bosch et al., 2015</xref>) to generate WT and <italic>fra</italic> knock down clones (KD), obtained by means of the <italic>UAS-fra-RNAi</italic> line, within the same wing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h, i</xref>). The WT clones covering glia along the L1 nerve and surrounding cells show expression of Fra (GFP-expressing cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k–k’’’</xref>), whereas Fra levels are considerably reduced in the glia and in the surrounding cells within the KD clones (RFP expressing cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j–j’’’</xref>).

In short, we assessed the percentage of wings displaying complete glia migration at 28 hAPF (migratory index: MI), as an estimation of migration efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kumar et al., 2015</xref>).

The knock down of <italic>fra</italic> using the <italic>gcm</italic>&gt;GFP driver, which is the earliest glial driver, reveals a significant decrease in migration efficiency as compared to that observed in the control wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, compare blank and light blue columns). To exclude the possibility of off-target effects, we analyzed wings that express the <italic>UAS-fra-RNAi</italic> together with the <italic>UAS-fra</italic> transgene, and found complete rescue of the migratory phenotype induced by the <italic>fra</italic> KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, patterned light and dark blue column). This strongly suggests that the RNAi line induces a specific phenotype and that <italic>fra</italic> acts in a cell autonomous manner. Finally, as a complementary approach, we reintroduced <italic>fra</italic> expression only in the glial cells of <italic>fra<sup>3</sup>/+</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>), and found that this rescues the migratory phenotype, albeit partially. Given the high levels of Fra expression in the <italic>gcm</italic>&gt;<italic>fra</italic> GOF wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g–g’’’’</xref>), it is unlikely that this partial rescue is due to suboptimal levels of Fra. Rather, the lack of total rescue may be ascribed to the neuronal requirement of Fra. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e–f’’’’’</xref> shows that Fra is expressed in glia as well as in neurons, and indeed around one third of <italic>fra<sup>3</sup>/+</italic> wings show an axonal navigation phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b–d</xref>). In these wings, axonal navigation is delayed, which may indirectly affect glial migration. To further check the role of Fra neuronal expression in glia migration, we used a driver that is expressed specifically in the L1 neurons: <italic>nsyb-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">West et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pauli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Riabinina et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>nsyb</italic>-driven expression starts to be detected around 18 hAPF; but the expression is more prominent at 22 hAPF and onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1f–h”</xref>).

We first checked the MI of <italic>fra</italic> GOF wings at 28 hAPF and found that the percentage of wings that shows complete migration is higher as compared to that of control wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, compare white and dark blue columns). Since most control wings show complete migration by 28 hAPF (90%), we also analyzed an earlier stage, when migration has been achieved in only a few control wings (24 hAPF; 12.5%). We found that many more <italic>fra-</italic>overexpressing wings show complete migration (68.5%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). This strongly suggests that high doses of Fra significantly increase the efficiency of glia migration. Fra levels in <italic>fra</italic> KD and <italic>fra</italic> GOF conditions are indeed reduced and increased, respectively, as compared to those observed in control wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c–h</xref>).</p><p>To clarify why the migratory efficiency decreases in <italic>fra</italic> KD animals, we performed time-lapse analysis and found that reducing the levels of Fra affects the first step of migration (initiation), as glia start to migrate later than the control chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>, compare the initiation step of white and light blue columns and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1e</xref>). Accordingly, <italic>fra</italic>-overexpressing glia start migrating earlier than control glia, indicating that the phenotype is due to precocious initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i–k</xref>, compare the initiation step of white and dark blue columns), and that this is associated with precocious Fra accumulation in <italic>fra</italic> GOF glial cells compared to that in control glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3l–o”</xref>). Finally, the live imaging data demonstrates that the speed of migration at the time of initiation is not higher in <italic>fra</italic> GOF glia than in control glia, showing that the observed phenotype is due to precocious initiation rather than to acceleration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2a</xref>).</p><p>The cytoplasmic tail of Fra is known to play a major role in mediating Fra-dependent attractive responses in vivo and in cell culture studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bashaw and Goodman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hong et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ming et al., 1997</xref>). We therefore asked whether this region is important in mediating glia migration. A transgenic construct that lacks the Fra intracellular cytoplasmic domain was previously described as a dominant negative mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garbe et al., 2007</xref>) and indeed the expression of this reporter significantly reduces migration efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, compare white and green-gray columns).</p><p>In summary, we find that acts in a cell autonomous manner in glial cells to mediate migration.

The exit from the cell cycle results from the timely inactivation of the Cyclin-dependent protein kinase (Cdk) and Cyclin E (Cyc E) complexes. On the one hand, String/Cdc25 encodes a phosphatase that triggers mitosis by activating the Cdc2 kinase, hence enabling cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edgar et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edgar and O'Farrell, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lasko, 2013</xref>). On the other hand, Dacapo functions as an inhibitor of the Cdk–Cyc E complex both in vivo and in vitro, ultimately leading to cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Nooij et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lane et al., 1996</xref>). First, we produced animals overexpressing String or Dacapo in glia (<italic>gcm</italic>&gt;GFP) and verified that this induces a significant change in glial cell number compared to that present in control wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, compare white column with columns with vertical and horizontal lines). Then, we analyzed the migration efficiency in both backgrounds and found that it is not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), even though the glial number increase induced by String overexpression and the decrease induced by Dacapo overexpression are comparable to those observed in <italic>gcm</italic> GOF and LOF, respectively.

Furthermore, the expression of Unc5 is also directly regulated by the transcription factor gcm suggesting that the same early determinant controls the timely expression of effector genes that initiate and terminate glial cell migration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Collective migration is a complex biological process that allows cells to leave their place of birth and reach their destination in a coordinated and timely manner. Here we dissect the signaling pathway underlying the collective migration of glia on the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing. The careful coordination between extrinsic cues and intrinsic, cell autonomous mechanisms ensure that timely migration of the glia occurs on the wing disc. The chemoattractant receptor Fra controls glia migration in response to a long-distance signal, thechemoattractant NetB. Fra is expressed before glia start to move and triggers migration initiation in a dose-dependent manner. Such tight control of Fra expression depends upon the Gcm transcription factor, which directly induces the expression of Fra at threshold levels. Thus, the glial determinant factor also affects a specific step of collective migration by regulating the key effector gene.</p><p>Collective migration comes in different flavors: streams, chains, sheets and clusters, which all imply tight coordination and cell–cell interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Klämbt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gilmour et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gupta and Giangrande, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marín et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rørth, 2003</xref>).

The stream of hundreds of proliferating cells of the fish lateral line migrate directionally upon expressing different chemokine receptors within the collective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dambly-Chaudiere et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">David et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghysen and Dambly-Chaudière, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haas and Gilmour, 2006</xref>). The current challenge is to dissect the role of the signaling pathways in the different steps (initiation, maintenance and arrest) and features of collective migration (adhesion, overall velocity and timing) and to analyze this in vivo. The second challenge is to understand how those signaling pathways are regulated, an issue that has been addressed at the post-transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yu and Bargmann, 2001</xref>) but much less so at the transcriptional level.</p><p>By focusing on the Netrin signaling pathway, which has been extensively studied in the context of axonal navigation and cell proliferation, we have addressed the above questions using the migrating wing glia of <italic>Drosophila.</italic> The analysis of the mutant phenotypes and the time-lapse approach show that the Fra receptor controls glia migration along the L1 nerve. Reducing the amount of Fra delays migration, whereas excessive Fra in the glial cells triggers their precocious migration. Thus, the Fra receptor plays an instructive role in the first step of collective migration, initiation. These data highlight the importance of quantitative regulation: large cohorts of cells are likely to need strong forces to switch from an immotile to a motile phenotype; therefore only the strong expression of the receptor allows migration toward the chemoattractant. Other migratory collectives also depend on quantitative regulation. Typically, epithelial cells migrating in groups exert much stronger forces than an individual cell before and after epithelial-mesenchymal transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">du Roure et al., 2005</xref>). The cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin plays an important role in supporting the directional and efficient collective migration of epithelial cells by mediating adhesion and force generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, the collectively migrating border cell cluster cannot exert enough adhesive/pulling force to move between the nurse cells in the absence of E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Niewiadomska et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>The timely regulation of the Fra receptor and its early role in collective migration allowed us to show that the Gcm fate determinant affects migration through this receptor. Thus, early genes not only trigger the expression of transcription factors that in turn implement a specific developmental program, but also directly contribute to the acquisition of specific phenotypes, such as the migratory potential. Similarly, the Lim-homeodomain transcription factor Islet was shown to specify the electrical properties of motor neurons by repressing the expression of the ion channel Shaker during development, suggesting that the regulation of late genes by early transcription factors might also be a common phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wolfram et al., 2012</xref>). These observations prompt us to revisit the role of the so-called ‘master regulators’, which indeed control processes beyond fate choices.</p><p>Netrins are thought to act either in a gradient at long range, as secreted molecules, or at short range, as membrane-tethered molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lai Wing Sun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brankatschk and Dickson, 2006</xref>). In contrast with studies in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo and visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">von Hilchen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Timofeev et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brankatschk and Dickson, 2006</xref>), we observed that secreted NetB in the developing wing acts at a long range: glia migration is delayed when solely membrane-tethered NetB is available at near-endogenous levels. While we still do not know whether the distinction between long- and short-range signaling depends on the complement of surface receptors and the associated transduction pathways, it seems that different strategies are used in specific processes. Future studies will reveal whether long-range signaling is specifically dedicated to migration over many cell diameters and/or to large collectives.</p><p>NetA and NetB have been suggested to act on the embryonic longitudinal glia through Fra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">von Hilchen et al., 2010</xref>) and both Netrins are reported to act as chemoattractants, even though in one case, only NetB was proposed to mediate dendritic targeting via Fra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Matthews and Grueber, 2011</xref>). Clearly, downregulating or overexpressing NetA has no impact on the migrating glial cells of the wing and NetA cannot rescue the NetB phenotype. While it is possible that NetA may affect other aspects of wing glia biology, our data indicate that NetB alone serves as a chemoattractant ligand to guide L1 glia migration upon signaling to Fra. Studies in other systems will assess whether it is only NetB that works as a long-range chemoattractant. If this were the case, it would be interesting to assess whether the different behavior of NetA and NetB relies on the intrinsic potentials of the two ligands (e.g. the affinity with which NetA and NetB bind to their receptors) or on extrinsic cues (e.g. cell-specific cofactors modulating NetA and/or NetB activity).</p><p>The chemoattractant receptor DCC/Fra and the chemorepellant receptor Unc5 have been mostly studied in different cell types, so it is unclear whether the same process and cells require the counteracting activities of these molecules. While mammalian migrating oligodendrocyte precursor cells express both DCC and Unc5, the precise function of these receptors has not been assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsai et al., 2003</xref>). We found that the two receptors Fra and Unc5 are expressed by the same set of PNS glial cells, with Fra appearing earlier than Unc5. The two receptors seem to have a different impact on wing glia migration and their stoichiometry is an important factor, as reducing Unc5 levels does have an effect on migration when <italic>fra</italic> is downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1b</xref> last columns). The fact that overexpressing Unc5 and Fra have opposite effects suggests that Unc5 converts the Netrin-mediated signal from attraction to repulsion in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing glia, in agreement with published data on chimeric molecules. For example, when fused to the cytoplasmic domain of Unc5, the extracellular domain of DCC is as effective in mediating the chemorepellant response to Netrin as a wild type Unc5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hong et al., 1999</xref>). Additionally, a study performed on <italic>Drosophila</italic> showed that fusing the cytoplasmic domain of Fra with the extracellular domain of Unc5 signals chemoattraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Keleman and Dickson, 2001</xref>). This may explain how the same cues such as Netrins can work differently on various aspects of collective migratory behavior.</p><p>The key element in this study is time: Gcm accumulates and triggers the onset of glial migration through <italic>fra</italic> but subsequently fades away. The fact that the expression of <italic>fra</italic> stays on till the end of migration suggests that another player, possibly a direct target of Gcm, maintains its expression. Being a major Gcm target, <italic>repo</italic> represents a potential candidate. Our in vivo and cell transfection data using a Repo expression vector are in line with this hypothesis and suggest that Repo may play a regulatory role in the maintenance of <italic>fra</italic> at late migratory stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a</xref>). It is known that Repo expression first depends on Gcm but subsequently becomes independent of it through autoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flici et al., 2014</xref>), indicating a transition from early to late events in gliogenesis (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9b</xref>). We propose that the initial Fra expression in wing glia strictly depends on Gcm and triggers the initiation of migration (see the graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1e</xref>). Accordingly, the overexpression of Fra using the <italic>repo</italic> promoter does not induce migratory defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9c,d</xref>) and <italic>repo&gt;fra</italic> KD wings show only modest defects in migration initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Later on, however, when Gcm fades away, Repo takes over in controlling Fra expression, hence affecting later phases of migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1b</xref>, see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9b</xref>). Conversely, the <italic>unc5</italic> repellant is a weak target of Gcm thatmay require Repo and controls migration completion.</p><p>With respect to what has previously been described in embryonic glia migration, we propose a different role for Netrins and their receptors in the migration of L1 glia. The migration of embryonic longitudinal glial cells seems to rely on very early expression of Fra, which is detected in the longitudinal glial precursor, but no longer in the longitudinal glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">von Hilchen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kolodziej et al., 1996</xref>). In our work, we do detect Fra expression in the wing glia. However, while in the case of the longitudinal glia both Netrins guide the glia toward the midline, the L1 glia seem to require only NetB. Moreover, ectopic expression of Netrin affects the migration of the longitudinal glia, whereas it does not do so in wing glia, hence suggesting that Netrin has a role in migration efficiency rather than on directionality. And finally, we propose that Fra and Unc5 act in different migratory phases of the same glial population, the first phase being under the direct control of the Gcm glial determinant. Overall, this paper displays a model in which the ligand NetB is expressed early during wing development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), whereas its receptor Fra is expressed right before migration onset and cell autonomously decides the time of migration initiation of the glial chain. Unc5 appears later and contributes to migration termination. The acquisition of the Fra levels that trigger migration is part of the cell-specification program dictated by the Gcm glial determinant, which not only induces the expression of downstream transcription factors but also directly implements a specific developmental program by triggering the expression of effector genes.</p><p>Together, these findings in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing suggest that the dynamic and coordinated action of fate determinants and chemotropic cues contribute to the timely and efficient migration of the glial cells. A similar molecular mechanism, relying on Netrins or other localized attractive cues and their receptors, may be used in other cases of collective migration.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks and genetics</title><p>Fly stocks were raised at 25°C in standard medium. <italic>repo-Gal4</italic> (indicated as <italic>repo&gt;)</italic> was used to detect glial-specific expression of <italic>UAS-</italic>PH-GFP (fusion protein between the Pleckstrin homology domain of PLC-d and the GFP coding sequence). <italic>gcm-Gal4 UAS-</italic>mCD8-GFP (membrane localization) (<italic>gcm</italic>&gt;GFP) was used as an early glial-specific driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jacques et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>gcm-Gal4,tubGal80<sup>ts</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Soustelle et al., 2007</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three reviewers who are really familiar with the topic. They all three are positive about your work and we would be glad to consider a revised manuscript for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor (Hugo Bellen) and a Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Gupta et al. investigate here the function of netrins and their frazzled (Fra) and Unc5 receptors in glial cell chain migration in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing. Their findings show that frazzled is the major Netrin receptor facilitating initiation of glial migration, and that an early glial fate determinant TF Gcm directly activates frazzled expression. Furthermore, Netrin B but not Netrin A, apparently forms a long-range gradient that guides glia in their migration toward the CNS along peripheral nerves., and Unc5 serves as a repulsive receptor for migration of these wing glia. Transcriptional regulation of axon guidance cues and their receptors remains to be studied in detail. Therefore, this manuscript provides evidence extending our understanding of how these cues and receptors are utilized by glia and how they are transcriptionally regulated. In general, this paper appears to be one that could be of interest to the field and appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic> following revisions that address the concerns raised below.</p><p>1) The lab has previously demonstrated that Pioneer cells trigger chain migration. It would greatly improve this initial part of the paper, if the data on expression of Frazzled on migrating glial cells would be shown more convincingly. Instead of showing one confocal image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E-G</xref> show nerves of wild type, and nerves of animals with glial or neuronal knockdown of Frazzled. There is a MiMIC insertion line available which would allow easy imaging of Frazzled protein expression (Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2015).</p><p>Fra and Unc5 staining is not easy to see and compare across different conditions; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D'-H'</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C'-E'</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A'-D'</xref>, etc. GFP does not seem to match between different panels, such as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> compared to C', or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> compared to D'. The white used here makes it difficult to separate individual RGB colors when these images are analyzed. It would be far easier for the reader to appreciate these results if there were separate panels for each staining in these figures, especially for Fra and UNC5 ICC. It would be even better to quantify the change in Fra staining in glia vs. neurons in the Fra-KD and GOF experiments using confocal optical sections.</p><p>2) It would be quite interesting and relevant in the light that collective migration is triggered by a few pioneers if a clonal analysis could be performed using the existing frazzled null allele. Do all cells have to express Fra? Provided that the wild type twin spot is allowed to stay, do these glial cells overtake mutant cell in front of them?</p><p>3) The observed genetic interaction between GCM and FRA is interesting. The fact that the <italic>fra<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup></italic> phenotype is much worse in the background of a heterozygous rA87 insertion – which is a viable enhancer trap in the <italic>gcm</italic> promoter region and thus a very weak hypomorph – makes me wonder how the <italic>fra<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup></italic> phenotype would look in trans to a <italic>gcm</italic> null allele? Is it possible to quantify the reduction of <italic>gcm</italic> mRNA in the different genetic backgrounds?</p><p>The authors use a migratory index to characterize the different genotypes. This is clear and straightforward but I wonder given the dramatic differences between 28APF and 24APF whether general developmental problems caused by the expression of the different transgenes also in many cells outside the nervous system (e.g. <italic>gcm</italic> is active also in the hemocyte lineages?) contribute to the phenotype. This could be controlled by for example comparing the time it takes to form the puparium and to eclose from the pupal cases.</p><p>4) Fra is also expressed at high levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) in the axons that glia migrate along, raising the question of whether neuronal Fra influences glia migration, either directly or indirectly. What happens if Fra is knocked down specifically in neurons?</p><p>The authors claim that changes in Gcm expression lead to changes of Fra in glia. However, changes of Gcm expression in glia (using <italic>gcm</italic>-GAL4) seem to have profound effects on neuronal Fra expression. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D'-D'</xref>, knockdown of Gcm using <italic>gcm</italic>-GAL4 leads to a decrease of Fra in L1, and even in L3 which is not wrapped by GFP+ processes in these images. Again, in Fra GOF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E',E'</xref>), the Fra signal co-localizes more with red 22C10 staining than with green GFP. Is this due to leaky expression of <italic>gcm</italic>-GAL4 in neurons at earlier stages? Or, does this suggest non-cell autonomous functions of glial Gcm on neuronal Fra expression?</p><p>5) Pioneer glia vs. follower glia: during glia chain migration, pioneer glia at the tip of the chain are suggested to actively lead followers. Fra, however, appears to be detected all along the chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), raising the question as to whether follower glia also use Fra to initiate and direct their migration independent of pioneer glia. It is technically challenging to use GAL4 drivers to differentially target pioneer or follower glia. However, have the authors considered using MARCM (Aigouy et al., 2008) to randomly target different glia in the wing and monitor their migratory behavior in either WT or Fra mutant clones? This could also address the cell autonomous vs cell-type autonomous (RNAi experiment) requirement for Fra in wing glia migration.</p><p>6) It is surprising that the NetB mutant (NetBΔ/Y, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) has migration defects of similar severity to the Fra/+ heterozygote, and has milder effects than many other conditions, such as <italic>gcm&gt;fra</italic>-KD and <italic>gcm&gt;gcm</italic>-KD. This could be explained by NetB signaling through Unc5 to inhibit glial migration in Fra LOF. If this is true, the NetB mutant should enhance the Fra/+ heterozygote phenotype. Is this the case? Also, does ectopic expression of NetB in a different wing sub-region using drivers such as en-GAL4 or ap-Gal4 mis-direct glial migration?</p><p>7) In the subsection “<italic>fra</italic> plays an instructive role in L1 glia migration”, the authors claim 'Finally, we measured the migration speed at the time of initiation and it was not higher in Fra GOF glia (10 μm/h) than in control glia (40 μm/h)'. This is confusing since the numbers do appear to be significantly different. What is the actual speed of glial migration in Fra GOF vs. control? The authors should also include this important information in graphs using either the speed or duration of glial migration from initiation to completion of migration.</p><p>8) The authors try to rescue RNAi phenotypes by co-expression of RNAi and UAS-GOF constructs, stating that this 'excludes the possibility of off target effects'. This is not accurate since this rescue effect could be due to titration of siRNA away from the endogenous mRNA by overexpression of the exogenous mRNA. To directly rule out off target effects the rescue experiments should be done by using either a UAS construct bearing mutants that are insensitive to RNAi or perhaps an RNAi line that targets non coding regions.</p><p>9) Throughout the study, there are no details or explanations on the methods of quantification. For instance, Results: subsection “<italic>fra</italic> plays an instructive role in L1 glia migration”, third paragraph – this is very unclear! how exactly the authors define &quot;initiation? and how was the quantification done? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, how does author calculate the hAPF for initiation, costa reach, and complete migration? what is the n number? how early or late in migration do the authors consider a defect in initiation? These all have to be explained fully in the text (the Methods section or the legends). Without these knowledge, the readers will have a hard time to follow and do not understand how the conclusion was reached. Also, for the time-lapse figure, it is not clear what does 22:48 hAPF mean since there are different genotypes shown, and I cannot find any information on this in the legends nor methods.</p><p>10) Panel organization: In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, in which the authors characterize glia migration phenotypes (MI), genotypes are assigned in different panels with the same or different time points. These arrangements make it difficult to compare different genotypes. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref> could be combined, and the same is true for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7E</xref> and F. In some panels, more genotypes should be included. For example, <italic>gcm</italic>-GAL4&gt;<italic>gcm</italic> (GOF) is needed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, and NetB-GAL4&gt; NetB needs to be added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>, all three genotypes should be compared in both time points.</p><p>11) Since Gcm is a very important factor in controlling neuronal and glial cell fates, it is crucial to address clearly whether this conversion function is in any part related to the migration phenotype the authors are trying to assessing in the study. However, there is only one experiment provided which wasn't able to give a clear answer. For instance, Figure 4—figure supplement 1: it is not common to analyze the co-positive cells of <italic>gcm</italic>&gt;GFP and Elav as Elav stained for nucleus and GFP labels the membrane. Can't the author do the costaining of Repo and Elav? this might be more clear and definitive. Also, what is the percentage of <italic>gcm</italic> KD wings not having extra Elav positive cells? Is it high or low? Isn't it plausible that a high percentage of the <italic>gcm</italic> KD wings should have extra Elav cells? The <italic>gcm</italic> KD wings with normal Elav positive cells might as well mean that <italic>gcm</italic> expression wasn't knock-down and in that case why is the MI still defective? How do the authors reconcile the discrepancies? This section has to be explained clearly since glia-neuron switch is a very important function for Gcm and whether the migration function depends on this needs to be clearly addressed with clear, precise experimental results.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The Glide/Gcm fate determinant controls initiation of collective cell migration by regulating Frazzled&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

I admit there are some hints supporting this suggestion but I do not think the data are conclusive.</p><p>Expression of <italic>fra</italic> in glia. The authors added a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H-J</xref> which shows <italic>fra</italic> expression upon glial knockdown. For me this is <italic>not</italic> showing that <italic>fra</italic> is expressed in glia. There is as much background as in the wild type and the control experiment, neuronal knockdown, is not shown based on the argument that elav is also expressed by glia. Please, use nsybGal4 which is specific – and/or generate clones! The quality of the antibody stainings is not consistent and for example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> glial knockdown is also removing the neuronal Fra expression. For me the quality of the data is still simply not good enough.</p><p>The phenotypes are based on somewhat odd genetic backgrounds. May be there is a <italic>fra</italic> haploinsufficiency and heterozygous <italic>fra</italic>/+ animals show a phenotype. But to really determine the Fra phenotype, a true loss of function analysis is required. The argument that MARCM clones are hard to get is weird as the same lab has generated these clones before in another study. Glia-specific <italic>fra</italic> knockdown animals show roughly the same phenotype as heterozygous <italic>fra3</italic>/+ animals (MI 58 vs.61). Still only the RNAi induced phenotype can be completely rescued. The authors conclude that this may be due to the reduction of neuronal Fra expression (which was not tested). However, one could also argue that the authors are looking at a genetic background effect. Thus, a MARCM analysis is mandatory.</p><p>We had asked for the effect of <italic>gcm</italic> on the migratory phenotype of <italic>fra3</italic>/+ heterozygous animals. Although the authors provide arguments for an allelic series of the different <italic>gcm</italic> alleles they do not show the effect of a true <italic>gcm</italic> loss of function allele on the migratory index. Provided that the presence of one very weak, homozygous viable, <italic>gcm</italic> allele has such a profound effect on the migratory index, what would a true null allele do? The allelic series shown in the rebuttal letter indicates that homozygous <italic>gcm</italic>&gt;GFP animals have the same effect as <italic>gcm</italic>&gt;GFP gcmN7-4. Since <italic>gcm</italic>N7-4 is a null this implies that <italic>gcm</italic>&gt;GFP is a null as well – but why do they survive then?

It would greatly improve this initial part of the paper, if the data on expression of Frazzled on migrating glial cells would be shown more convincingly. Instead of showing one confocal image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E-G</xref> show nerves of wild type, and nerves of animals with glial or neuronal knockdown of Frazzled. There is a MiMIC insertion line available which would allow easy imaging of Frazzled protein expression (Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al., eLife, 2015).</italic> </p><p><italic>Fra and Unc5 staining is not easy to see and compare across different conditions; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D'-H'</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C'-E'</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A'-D'</xref>, etc. GFP does not seem to match between different panels, such as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> compared to C', or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> compared to D'. The white used here makes it difficult to separate individual RGB colors when these images are analyzed. It would be far easier for the reader to appreciate these results if there were separate panels for each staining in these figures, especially for Fra and UNC5 ICC. It would be even better to quantify the change in Fra staining in glia vs. neurons in the Fra-KD and GOF experiments using confocal optical sections.</italic> </p><p>As suggested by the referees we made sure that the labeling was indeed less prominent in the KD and more intense in the overexpressing animals. We have now included the data that also shows the glial knockdown of <italic>fra</italic> in a 18 hAPF old wing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H-J</xref> and we have included panels that only shows Fra or Unc5 labeling in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C'-G'”</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C‐E”'</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A‐D”'</xref>.</p><p>The difference in GFP intensity in the merged panels is due to the strong red signal. Specifically, at late stages these differences are due to the fact that glia wrap neurons (which are in red) completely. In addition, we have quantified Fra staining in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E-J</xref> between control and <italic>fra</italic> KD L1 glia by including heat maps. Note that in the KD the neuronal (but not the glial) Fra signal is as high if not higher than in the wt.</p><p>Concerning the MiMIC insertion, we tried and stay consistent, using the same antibody that was used in previous papers, in particular in the paper on glial migration from Altenhein and collaborators (References on the used antibody: Von Hilchen et al., 2010; Timofeeev et al., 2012; Joly et al., 2007; Kolodziej et al., 1996; Orr et al., 2014; Gong et al., 1999; Pert et al., 2015).</p><p><italic>2) It would be quite interesting and relevant in the light that collective migration is triggered by a few pioneers if a clonal analysis could be performed using the existing frazzled null allele. Do all cells have to express Fra? Provided that the wild type twin spot is allowed to stay, do these glial cells overtake mutant cell in front of them?</italic> </p><p>We see Fra expression in all L1 glia, which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>(subsection “Frazzled expression in the glia of the developing Drosophila wing”, second paragraph). The clonal analysis is a valuable point, however we think that the data from this experiment will not be easy to interpret. Fra is also expressed in neurons, therefore getting clones that only affect glia will be difficult (low division rate) and even more to get clones that specifically affect the pioneer cells. We did in the past get MARCM clones in pioneer cells, but this is a very rare event. This was useful to analyze the morphology of pioneers, but the analysis of migration phenotypes requires high number of events in order to perform the statistics. More importantly, we have previously shown that several pioneers are at work, therefore mutating one or two of them may not be sufficient to see a phenotype.</p><p><italic>3) The observed genetic interaction between GCM and FRA is interesting. The fact that the fra<sup>3</sup> phenotype is much worse in the background of a heterozygous rA87 insertion – which is a viable enhancer trap in the gcm promoter region and thus a very weak hypomorph – makes me wonder how the fra<sup>3</sup> phenotype would look in trans to a gcm null allele? Is it possible to quantify the reduction of gcm mRNA in the different genetic backgrounds?</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors use a migratory index to characterize the different genotypes. This is clear and straightforward but I wonder given the dramatic differences between 28APF and 24APF whether general developmental problems caused by the expression of the different transgenes also in many cells outside the nervous system (e.g. gcm is active also in the hemocyte lineages?) contribute to the phenotype. This could be controlled by for example comparing the time it takes to form the puparium and to eclose from the pupal cases.</italic> </p><p>Concerning the interaction, <italic>gcm<sup>rA87</sup></italic>is a weaker allele than the <italic>gcm‐Gal4</italic> line and, accordingly <italic>gcm<sup>rA87</sup>/fra<sup>3</sup> </italic>has a weaker migratory phenotype that <italic>gcm‐Gal4/ fra<sup>3</sup></italic>. These data are now shown together in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, to comply with reviewers’ suggestion. For the benefit of the reviewers, we also show here below the rate of conversion and/or the number of repo positive cells in different allelic combinations (<italic>gcm-Gal4/ gcm<sup>rA87</sup>, gcm-Gal4/ gcm-Gal4, gcm<sup>rA87</sup>/ gcmN7-4</italic> and <italic>gcm‐Gal4&gt;gcm RNAi</italic>). The inverse correlation between the two phenotypes in the different backgrounds further sustains our hypothesis. We believe that the phenotypic analysis of the allelic series is more sensitive than RNA quantification, given the low number of <italic>gcm</italic> expressing cells. For the sake of simplicity, we do not think that the data here below should be included. Should the referee feel it necessary, however, we are eager to include them in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>We did not observe any general developmental defect, such as delay in eclosion from the pupal case.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15983.028</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15983.028">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15983.028</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-15983-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>To rule out a possible hemocyte contribution in glia migration we downregulated <italic>gcm</italic> using a hemocyte driver collagen‐<italic>Gal4</italic> and found no effect on glia migration.

Since <italic>gcm</italic> is only expressed in blood cells embryonically, this eliminates any possible contribution of hemocyte Gcm expression to the observed phenotypes. These analyses confirm that <italic>gcm</italic> and <italic>fra</italic> directly affect glia migration as in these conditions too glia migration is significantly delayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) Fra is also expressed at a high levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) in the axons that glia migrate along, raising the question of whether neuronal Fra influences glia migration, either directly or indirectly. What happens if Fra is knocked down specifically in neurons?</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors claim that changes in Gcm expression lead to changes of Fra in glia. However, changes of Gcm expression in glia (using gcm-GAL4) seem to have profound effects on neuronal Fra expression. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>'-D', knockdown of Gcm using gcm-GAL4 leads to a decrease of Fra in L1, and even in L3 which is not wrapped by GFP+ processes in these images. Again, in Fra GOF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E', E'</xref>), the Fra signal co-localizes more with red 22C10 staining than with green GFP. Is this due to leaky expression of gcm-GAL4 in neurons at earlier stages? Or, does this suggest non-cell autonomous functions of glial Gcm on neuronal Fra expression?</italic> </p><p>The neuronal expression of Fra is an important issue and we thank the reviewer(s) for the comment. We analyzed L1 axons of 17 hAPF <italic>fra<sup>3</sup> </italic>wings and found that about 30% of them show a transient phenotype of delayed axonal growth (see now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B-D</xref>). We also analyzed wings where <italic>fra</italic> is knocked down using an Elav driver and got a very strong migratory phenotype (Data not shown in the manuscript). However, the available Elav drivers (we tested two of them) are also expressed in wing glia and epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 2</xref>). Other known drivers are either expressed in neuronal subsets (motoneurons) or too late for our purpose. Thus, in the wing, we were unable to use a driver that specifically activates or knocks down gene expression in neurons. These analyses suggested that downregulating <italic>fra</italic> in neurons may indirectly affect glia migration and prompted us to use a driver that specifically affects glia.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15983.029</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>25 hAPF immunolabeled wing of the <italic>elav-Gal4,UASmCD8GFP</italic> transgenic line (anti-GFP in green and anti-Repo in red).</title><p>Note the presence of the mCD8GFP in the axons, in the glia (Repo-positive cells in red, arrows) and in the epithelium (asterisk).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15983.029">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15983.029</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-15983-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig></p><p>We think there is no change in the neuronal expression of Fra upon <italic>gcm</italic> KD or GOF. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D‐D’”</xref> is only one example and the decrease might be due to the fact that these images are few sections and not the whole projection. Concerning the role of Gcm on neuronal expression of Fra. We never observed the Gcm driver being expressed in neurons. For all the above reasons, we do not think there is a non-cell autonomous effect.</p><p><italic>5) Pioneer glia vs. follower glia: during glia chain migration, pioneer glia at the tip of the chain are suggested to actively lead followers. Fra, however, appears to be detected all along the chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), raising the question as to whether follower glia also use Fra to initiate and direct their migration independent of pioneer glia. It is technically challenging to use GAL4 drivers to differentially target pioneer or follower glia. However, have the authors considered using MARCM (Aigouy et al., 2008) to randomly target different glia in the wing and monitor their migratory behavior in either WT or Fra mutant clones? This could also address the cell autonomous vs cell-type autonomous (RNAi experiment) requirement for Fra in wing glia migration.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers raise an interesting point, i.e. what is the role of Fra, since it is all along the L1 chain. We believe that the suggested MARCM clonal analysis is beyond the scope of this manuscript. We indeed used MARCM to follow the morphology of single pioneers but mutant clones on single pioneer glial cells are very rare, which makes it hard to draw conclusions that are statistically significant. If we go for big clones, they will also affect neurons, which will not help assessing the cell autonomous effect. See also answer to Q2.</p><p>To comply with the comment, we asked whether the ligand Net B accumulates on specific glia, based on the recent paper from Pert et al., (Biology Open 2015) showing Net B accumulation in Fra expressing cells. Immunolabeling assays on young wings indeed show preferential Net B accumulation in some cells at the front of the chain. We speculate that the receptor is all over the glia but pioneer glia are closer to the ligand than the other glia and some pioneers accumulate it, perhaps due to receptor‐mediated endocytosis. This may in turn triggers the ‘promigratory’ downstream pathway in those cells.<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15983.030</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15983.030">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15983.030</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-15983-resp-fig3-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>6) It is surprising that the NetB mutant (NetBΔ/Y, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) has migration defects of similar severity to the Fra/+ heterozygote, and has milder effects than many other conditions, such as gcm&gt;fra-KD and gcm&gt;gcm-KD.

Also, does ectopic expression of NetB in a different wing sub-region using drivers such as en-GAL4 or ap-Gal4 mis-direct glial migration?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer(s) for the thoughtful comments. The reviewer is correct, the NetB phenotype might be milder than that observed in <italic>fra3/+</italic> because of the effects of NetB on <italic>unc5</italic>. Along this line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref> shows that <italic>UAS‐RNAi</italic> for both <italic>unc5</italic> and <italic>fra</italic> has a weaker phenotype than <italic>UAS‐fra‐RNAi</italic> alone. As per the double mutant <italic>NetBΔ/Y; fra<sup>3</sup>/+</italic>, this genotype would not inform on the role of Unc5, because in a hemizygous <italic>NetB</italic>Δ<italic>/Y</italic> animal both Fra and Unc5 should be absent anyway, therefore removing the <italic>fra</italic> receptor would not make any difference. We thought that this experiment may nevertheless be informative and tell whether <italic>fra</italic> is also submitted to other signals, as suggested by recent studies (Neuhaus-Follini et al; 2015). We hence performed the suggested experiment and it does seem that <italic>fra</italic> also depends on other signals, see data on the right graph. We would not include this data in the main text, however, as they go beyond the scope of the manuscript, which is to show the impact of a fate determinant on late aspects of cell specification.

These experiments show that ectopic NetB does not affect glia migration (Now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, NetB does not act as a guidance molecule triggering directionality.

The speed analysis was done on the most proximal glial cell of the chain (μm/h, y-axis; hAPF, x‐axis).

Without these knowledge, the readers will have a hard time to follow and do not understand how the conclusion was reached.

Typically, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J, K</xref>shows a snap shot at 21h48, which corresponds to the time by which wild type glia have reached the Costa, in average. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D-F</xref>,shows a snap shot at 22h48, which corresponds to the time by which GOF glia have completed migration, in average. We have clarified this in the text.</p><p><italic>10) Panel organization: In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, in which the authors characterize glia migration phenotypes (MI), genotypes are assigned in different panels with the same or different time points.

However, there is only one experiment provided which wasn't able to give a clear answer. For instance, Figure 4—figure supplement 1: it is not common to analyze the co-positive cells of gcm&gt;GFP and Elav as Elav stained for nucleus and GFP labels the membrane. Can't the author do the costaining of Repo and Elav? this might be more clear and definitive. Also, what is the percentage of gcm KD wings not having extra Elav positive cells? Is it high or low? Isn't it plausible that a high percentage of the gcm KD wings should have extra Elav cells? The gcm KD wings with normal Elav positive cells might as well mean that gcm expression wasn't knock-down and in that case why is the MI still defective? How do the authors reconcile the discrepancies? This section has to be explained clearly since glia-neuron switch is a very important function for Gcm and whether the migration function depends on this needs to be clearly addressed with clear, precise experimental results.</italic><fig id="fig14" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15983.032</object-id><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15983.032">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15983.032</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-15983-resp-fig5-v2"/></fig></p><p>To address this issue we included the co-‐labeling of Repo and Elav in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-B”</xref>), as requested. Concerning the possible indirect effects of glia to neuron conversion on migration, we find that only 14% of the <italic>gcm</italic> KD wings show conversion, whereas 75% of the KD wings show delayed migration. Further, to make sure that glia to neuron transformation in <italic>gcm</italic> knockdown wings does not affect glia migration we analyzed two sets of KD wings. The first set comprises of wings with fate transformation and the migratory index of these wings is very low, 25%. The second set includes wings without fate transformation; in this case, the migratory index is 45%, which is still significantly different from the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Last but not the least, the number of converted cells is very low (10). We also analyzed an allelic combination that is weaker than the KD and that only shows fate conversion in 10% of the wings. We still find a migratory delay in these wings (<italic>gcm‐Gal4/gcm<sup>rA87</sup></italic>animals, See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This analysis confirms that Gcm affects glia migration irrespective of the change in the number of glial cells due to the fate transformation, which altogether fits perfectly with the finding that Gcm directly induces the expression of the Fra receptor.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>I read the revised paper and cannot support publication at this stage due to the poor demonstration that fra is expressed by the glia and the lack of a clear demonstration that the phenotype is due to loss of glial fra function.

The authors added a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H-J</xref>which shows fra expression upon glial knockdown. For me this is not showing that fra is expressed in glia. There is as much background as in the wild type and the control experiment, neuronal knockdown, is not shown based on the argument that elav is also expressed by glia. Please, use nsybGal4 which is specific – and/or generate clones! The quality of the antibody stainings is not consistent and for example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> glial knockdown is also removing the neuronal Fra expression. For me the quality of the data is still simply not good enough.</italic> </p><p>We followed the suggestion and used the nsybGal4 line as a neuronal driver. We first assessed expression of this driver in wing neurons, next we used the nsybGal4 line to knock down Fra in neurons and analyze glial migration. We found no defects in the migratory index, except in wings that carry an axonal navigation defect. These data are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. The wings carrying axon navigation defects were of course eliminated from the graph, as it has already been published that axonal defects result in glial migration defects.</p><p>We add Fra immunolabelling at 18 hAPF in combination with a second glial reporter (Repo&gt;GFP).

May be there is a fra haploinsufficiency and heterozygous fra/+ animals show a phenotype. But to really determine the Fra phenotype, a true loss of function analysis is required. The argument that MARCM clones are hard to get is weird as the same lab has generated these clones before in another study. Glia-specific fra knockdown animals show roughly the same phenotype as heterozygous fra3/+ animals (MI 58 vs.61). Still only the RNAi induced phenotype can be completely rescued. The authors conclude that this may be due to the reduction of neuronal Fra expression (which was not tested). However, one could also argue that the authors are looking at a genetic background effect. Thus, a MARCM analysis is mandatory.</italic> </p><p>We complied with the request of the referee and analyzed the migratory phenotype in transheterozygous animals <italic>fra3/gcm null (N7-4</italic>), which further confirms the data obtained with the hypomorphs and the KD line. These data are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, second last column.</p><p>We would like to clarify that the allelic series showing the reduction in the number of Repo+ cells in the last rebuttal letter shows the effects of <italic>gcm<sup>rA87</sup>/gcm<sup>N7-4</sup></italic>and not <italic>gcm</italic>&gt;GFP/ <italic>gcm<sup>N7-4</sup>,</italic> as claimed by the referee (see the same figure panel). We have already mentioned in the manuscript that <italic>gcm<sup>rA87</sup> </italic>is a weak <italic>gcm</italic> hypomorphic allele. Therefore, the effect it produces on the number of repo cells when combined with null <italic>gcm<sup>N7-4</sup> </italic>allele is similar to <italic>gcm&gt;</italic>GFP/<italic>gcm&gt;</italic>GFP.</p><p><italic>We had asked for the effect of gcm on the migratory phenotype of fra3/+ heterozygous animals. Although the authors provide arguments for an allelic series of the different gcm alleles they do not show the effect of a true gcm loss of function allele on the migratory index. Provided that the presence of one very weak, homozygous viable, gcm allele has such a profound effect on the migratory index, what would a true null allele do? The allelic series shown in the rebuttal letter indicates that homozygous gcm&gt;GFP animals have the same effect as gcm&gt;GFP gcmN7-4. Since gcmN7-4 is a null this implies that gcm&gt;GFP is a null as well – but why do they survive then? Something is odd here.</italic> </p><p>We performed mitotic clone analyses. We ordered the strain to produce MARCM clones in WT or in Fra KD cells. We also ordered strains to perform a more refined clonal analysis using the recently developed coinFLP technique in a wild type and in a Fra KD background. The crosses from this second approach went faster. Given the time frame we had agreed upon and the fact that the PhD student could only come for one month, we pursued the analyses of the coinFLP clones, which was indeed very successful. We could identify wild type and mutant clones in the same wing using two membrane reporters (GFP- green cells: WT cells; RFP – red cells: Fra DK cells). In this way, we could confirm that red (Fra KD) cells contain much less Fra than green (WT) cells. Furthermore, we could specifically identify WT and Fra KD glia using the Repo marker that is detected in glial nuclei. All these data are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
