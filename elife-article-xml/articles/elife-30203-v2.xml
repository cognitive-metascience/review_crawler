Classical ways of manipulating PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels are slower than its metabolism, making it difficult to distinguish effects of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> from those of its metabolites. We developed a membrane-permeant, photoactivatable PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, which is loaded into cells in an inactive form and activated by light, allowing sub-second increases in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels. By combining this compound with electrophysiological measurements in mouse adrenal chromaffin cells, we show that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> uncaging potentiates exocytosis and identify synaptotagmin-1 (the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for exocytosis) and Munc13-2 (a vesicle priming protein) as the relevant effector proteins. PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> activation of exocytosis did not depend on the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-binding CAPS-proteins, suggesting that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> uncaging may bypass CAPS-function. Finally, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> uncaging triggered the rapid fusion of a subset of readily-releasable vesicles, revealing a rapid role of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in fusion triggering. Thus, optical uncaging of signaling lipids can uncover their rapid effects on cellular processes and identify lipid effectors.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30203.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells in our body communicate by releasing compounds called transmitters that carry signals from one cell to the next. Packages called vesicles store transmitters within the signaling cell. When the cell needs to send a signal, the vesicles fuse with the cell's membrane and release their cargo. For many signaling processes, such as those used by neurons, this fusion is regulated, fast, and coupled to the signal that the cell receives to activate release. Specialized molecular machines made up of proteins and fatty acid molecules called signaling lipids enable this to happen.</p><p>One signaling lipid called PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (short for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) is essential for vesicle fusion as well as for other processes in cells. It interacts with several proteins that help it control fusion and the release of transmitter. While it is possible to study the role of these proteins using genetic tools to inactivate them, the signaling lipids are more difficult to manipulate. Existing methods result in slow changes in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels, making it hard to directly attribute later changes to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Walter, Müller, Tawfik et al. developed a new method to measure how PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> affects transmitter release in living mammalian cells, which causes a rapid increase in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels. The method uses a chemical compound called “caged PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>” that can be loaded into cells but remains undetected until ultraviolet light is shone on it. The ultraviolet light uncages the compound, generating active PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in less than one second. Walter et al. found that when they uncaged PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in this way, the amount of transmitter released by cells increased. Combining this with genetic tools, it was possible to investigate which proteins of the release machinery were required for this effect.</p><p>The results suggest that two different types of proteins that interact with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> are needed: one must bind PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> to carry out its role and the other helps PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> accumulate at the site of vesicle fusion. The new method also allowed Walter et al. to show that a fast increase in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> triggers a subset of vesicles to fuse very rapidly. This shows that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> rapidly regulates the release of transmitter. Caged PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> will be useful to study other processes in cells that need PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, helping scientists understand more about how signaling lipids control many different events at cellular membranes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>phosphatidylinositols</kwd><kwd>exocytosis</kwd><kwd>adrenal chromaffin

regulated exocytosis of vesicles to liberate neurotransmitters, neuropeptides and hormones. Neuronal exocytosis is driven by an evolutionarily conserved machinery that targets vesicles to the plasma membrane, attaches them to the membrane (sometimes referred to as vesicle ‘docking’), and molecularly matures (‘primes’) them to a fusion-competent state. Primed vesicles reside in the so-called Readily Releasable Pool (RRP) whose fusion triggering leads to transmitter/hormone release. The assembly of the thermodynamically stable neuronal SNARE complex formed by the vesicular SNARE protein VAMP2/synaptobrevin-2 and the plasma membrane SNAREs syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 provides energy needed for vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012</xref>). Indeed, SNARE proteins are already required for membrane attachment and priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Wit et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Imig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Walter et al., 2010</xref>), and during fusion they continue to influence fusion pore properties through their transmembrane domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dhara et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fang and Lindau, 2014</xref>). The protein families Unc18 (sec-1) and Unc13 interact with the neuronal SNAREs and are required for membrane attachment, priming and fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rizo and Südhof, 2012</xref>). The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activator protein for secretion (CAPS) is another priming factor in PC12-cells, chromaffin cells and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jockusch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grishanin et al., 2004</xref>), which interacts with SNAREs to stimulate their assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">James et al., 2009</xref>). A function of CAPS in membrane attachment of vesicles was also described in synapses of <italic>C.elegans</italic>, hippocampal neurons and PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Imig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kabachinski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>), but not in mouse chromaffin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). Vesicle fusion is temporally linked to electrical stimulation of the cell by voltage gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels that activate upon depolarization. In mouse chromaffin cells, the resulting increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration is sensed by the vesicular Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding proteins synaptotagmin-1, and −7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schonn et al., 2008</xref>), which interact with the SNAREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schupp et al., 2016</xref>), and trigger vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Südhof, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane – apart from taking part in the vesicle to plasma membrane merger - contains a variety of signaling lipids that can regulate exocytosis, most notably phosphatidylinositols (PIs) and diacylglycerols (DAGs). Phosphatidylinositols constitute a family of lipids, which can be phosphorylated on one or more positions of the inositol headgroup, giving rise to specific signals on cell membrane compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Di Paolo and De Camilli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balla, 2013</xref>). PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is the major phosphatidylinositol in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane where it plays multiple essential roles in cell motility, actin cytoskeleton organization, ion channel activity, and vesicle exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Di Paolo and De Camilli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martin, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Signaling lipids are recognized by specific protein motifs, particularly C1, C2 and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martin, 2015</xref>). One of the best characterized signaling lipid interactions with exocytosis proteins is that of the synaptotagmin-1 (syt-1) C2B-domain with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schiavo et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Honigmann et al., 2013</xref>). The syt-1 C2B domain binds Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and is essential for triggering of vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mackler et al., 2002</xref>). In vitro, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding to the C2B domain markedly increases the affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van den Bogaart et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, interactions of syt-1 with synaptic PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> ensure that the C2B domain interacts with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bai et al., 2004</xref>) and aid the triggering of vesicle fusion by bringing its Ca<sup>2+</sup>-affinity into the physiological range. All known Munc13 isoforms contain C1- and C2 domains that regulate exocytosis. The DAG analog phorbolester binds to the Munc13 C1 domain to strongly enhance exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rhee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basu et al., 2007</xref>). Membrane binding of Munc13 can be further augmented by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding to the neighboring C2B domain, which also influences the fusion probability of synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shin et al., 2010</xref>). CAPS contains a PH domain which binds PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and is essential for vesicle priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nguyen Truong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Loyet et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kabachinski et al., 2014</xref>). Because different species of signaling lipids may regulate different essential exocytosis proteins, systematic investigation of the relevant interactions for exocytosis is needed.</p><p>The most successful approaches to tease apart molecular components relevant for neurosecretion have been to mutate proteins of the release machinery or to regulate their expression. This is not directly possible for signaling lipids; instead, enzymes of lipid metabolism have been targeted. Early experiments in permeabilized bovine adrenal chromaffin cells using bacterial phospholipase C (PLC) showed that secretion depends on PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at an upstream ATP-dependent priming step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eberhard et al., 1990</xref>). Exocytosis was further found to require the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> synthesizing enzyme phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hay et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gong et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, experiments using fast capacitance measurements showed that overexpression of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> generating or degrading enzymes increased or decreased the RRP, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Milosevic et al., 2005</xref>). Even though the initial experiments indicated that PLC, which produces DAG at the expense of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, inhibits rather than stimulates secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eberhard et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hay et al., 1995</xref>), later experiments showed that phorbolesters – assumed to mimic DAG – strongly stimulate secretion when added to naïve cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smith et al., 1998</xref>). The phorbol ester effect has since been studied in a number of cell types, and has been found to rely on the activation of two priming factors Munc13 (via its C1 domain)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rhee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Betz et al., 1998</xref>) and Munc18-1 (via protein kinase C phosphorylation)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wierda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Genc et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nili et al., 2006</xref>). In the presence of PLC activity, experiments to increase or decrease the levels of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> might cause correlative changes in DAG. The same concern exists for the conversion of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> to PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, which might have profound effects on exocytosis in spite of being present in low abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khuong et al., 2013</xref>). Even the fastest existing techniques to manipulate PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels (by voltage, light, or chemical dimerization)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murata et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Suh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Idevall-Hagren et al., 2012</xref>) operate on similar speeds as PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> metabolism and vesicle priming (i.e. tens of seconds)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Voets et al., 1999</xref>), making it a general concern how to tease apart the effect of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> from that of its metabolites including DAG and other phosphatidylinositols.</p><p>To manipulate cellular PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels rapidly and distinguish its function from those of its metabolites in fast cellular reactions we here developed and characterized a new chemical tool: caged, membrane permeant PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. We show that our compound is taken up into living cells and verify that its UV-uncaging generates physiologically active PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> with sub-second temporal precision. Uncaging induced the re-distribution of proteins containing PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding motifs and locally increased actin-levels. Capacitance measurements in chromaffin cells showed that following PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> uncaging exocytosis is enhanced, and the RRP increased, which we demonstrate is specific to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> by contrasting the effects of DAG-uncaging. Systematic investigation of the relevant effector proteins revealed a requirement for the potentiation on syt-1 and Munc13-2, but not on CAPS. These results suggest two distinguishable types of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> effector proteins: ones that require stoichiometric PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-binding to exert their function, and ones that function in the local enrichment of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the vesicle fusion site. Finally, making full use of the rapid uncaging kinetics, we investigate the immediate effects of increasing the levels of signaling lipids on exocytosis and discover that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> but not DAG uncaging induces the rapid exocytosis of few vesicles from the RRP. Our data provide an example of how caged lipid compounds can be used to tease apart relevant interactions in fast biological reactions like neurosecretion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To achieve fast elevation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels on the relevant timescale for exocytosis we developed photoactivatable (caged), membrane-permeant PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> derivatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Optical uncaging is uniquely suited to increase the levels of signaling molecules non-invasively with high temporal precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Höglinger et al., 2014</xref>). Synthesis was based on a commercially available enantiomerically pure precursor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Because the hydroxyl and phosphate groups on the inositol ring make PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> a highly charged molecule it cannot pass across the cellular plasma membrane. To make the molecule membrane permeant, these groups were equipped with protective groups of acetoxymethyl (AM) esters and butyrates (Bt), respectively (as detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> legend and Methods). Once inside cells, these protective groups are removed by endogenous carboxyesterases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schultz, 2003</xref>).

Photosensitivity was achieved by the addition of a photocleavable cage designed to interfere with biological functions at the phosphate residues in positions 4 or 5 of the inositol ring.

For this, we directly diluted our compound in an imaging buffer (to a final concentration of 20 µM) and made use of the fact that if the solution was not heavily mixed by vortexing, some of the lipid formed micelles clearly visible on the bottom of the coverslip in the light microscope. The solution furthermore contained a reconstituted fusion protein of the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-binding PH domain of PLC-δ<sub>1</sub> linked to EGFP. Illumination in the TIRF field was used to limit light excitation to the surface of the glass coverslip. When EGFP was excited, the presence of PH-EGFP was visible as background in the solution of the TIRF field and some of the PH-EGFP was enriched on the micelles. Following UV-uncaging with a 405 nm laser in the TIRF field, the EGFP signal at these positions was greatly increased, indicative of PH-EGFP recruitment to the micelles from the surrounding solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).

Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) cells were first loaded with a membrane labelling dye excitable with infrared light (CellMask). Cells were then loaded with caged (cg) PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> by incubation for 30 min at 37°C with 20 µM of our compound (<bold>2a,b</bold>, diluted from a 20 mM DMSO-stock) in the presence of 0.02% Pluronic (prepared with heavy vortexing) to facilitate membrane passage. Cells receiving identical treatment but without the compound served as controls. To assess the localization of cg-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> quantitatively, cells were imaged on a spinning disc confocal microscope and fluorescence line profiles obtained from many cells that bordered open extracellular space (as opposed to ones in contact with other HEK cells). The line profiles were then aligned to local fluorescence maxima of the CellMask signal indicating the position of the plasma membrane. Subsequently, line profiles from all cells were averaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). We saw that average coumarin fluorescence increased inside the plasma membrane, demonstrating cellular uptake. Moreover, coumarin fluorescence was clearly observed at the position of the plasma membrane; however, it was also present inside the cell, possibly on endosomes. This is not surprising, as the coumarin group is expected (and, indeed, intended) to block interactions with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-binding proteins. This includes those proteins that usually establish a strict pattern of phosphoinositide composition on distinct cellular organelles. Therefore, it is an unavoidable side effect of using caged lipids that their distribution will be broader than the native lipid. Inevitably, visualization of the coumarin fluorescence by its excitation leads to its uncaging. This could be shown by continuous imaging which significantly reduced the coumarin fluorescence at the location of the plasma membrane (bar graph <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). As expected, neither the fluorescence gradient across the membrane nor the decrease in intensity at the plasma membrane was observed in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), indicating that our compound is taken up into cells, present at the plasma membrane and uncaged there.</p><p>We next validated that UV uncaging liberated physiologically active PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in living cells. For this, we transfected HEK cells with the PLC-δ<sub>1</sub>-PH-EGFP construct and looked for a possible recruitment of EGFP fluorescence to the plasma membrane by TIRF microscopy upon UV-uncaging. However, we found that even before uncaging, EGFP fluorescence intensities were very high and did not increase further upon UV-uncaging, which we attribute to saturation of the sensor due to relatively high plasma membrane levels of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> already at rest (data not shown). To circumvent this problem, we co-transfected COS-7 cells with a plasma membrane targeted 5-phosphatase which degrades PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Posor et al., 2013</xref>). Upon UV-uncaging in cells loaded with cg-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> we found a small, but highly significant increase of EGFP fluorescence at the cell’s footprint in line with the liberation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the plasma membrane, while no such effect was observed in control cells, which were also subjected to UV-light, but not loaded with cg-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). The relatively small effect size may be caused by the 5-phosphatase activity which likely rapidly degrades uncaged PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the plasma membrane before it can be detected by the PLC-δ<sub>1</sub>-PH-EGFP sensor which is why this experiment may underestimate the amount of liberated PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>We also investigated the behavior of our compound in cells were PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> was not constitutively depleted, but where degradation was acutely induced pharmacologically. Endogenous PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> cause the quantitative plasma membrane binding of the high-affinity PLC-δ<sub>1</sub>-PH-RFP sensor in tsA-201 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). By simultaneously expressing M<sub>1</sub> muscarinic receptors in these cells, we could acutely degrade PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> by the application of oxotremorine-M (Oxo-M) which activates M<sub>1</sub> receptors to stimulate PLC. This rapidly decreases PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels selectively at the plasma membrane and reliably induced the relocalization of PLC-δ<sub>1</sub>-PH-RFP sensor from the plasma membrane to the cytosol in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), indicating near complete plasma membrane PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> breakdown. Because this assay monitors the sensor’s dissociation it may be better suited to monitor PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> liberation close to the sensor’s initial location. We therefore combined OxoM-treatment with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-uncaging, which prevented PLC-δ<sub>1</sub>-PH-RFP membrane dissociation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), in line with substantial PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> release at the plasma membrane overruling PLC activity. Uncaging itself did not interfere with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> breakdown, because DAG was still produced (validated by parallel imaging with a DAG biosensor)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b,c</xref>).</p><p>To verify that UV-uncaging of our compound activated PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-dependent cellular responses, we investigated effects of cg-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> uncaging on actin bundles, for whose polymerization a pivotal role of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is firmly established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Di Paolo and De Camilli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rohatgi et al., 1999</xref>).

The right panel depicts the average normalized fluorescence per frame in both groups (+cg-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>: red, No cg-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>: black). The RFP fluorescence in the TIRF field increased in cells loaded with cg-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> after uncaging. (<bold>b</bold>) To verify PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> uncaging in chromaffin cells, the low-affinity PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-sensor PLCδ<sub>4</sub>-PH-EGFP was expressed and cells were imaged on a bright-field fluorescence microscope. Cells were either loaded for 30–45 min at 37°C with 25 µM cg-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (+cg-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, top) or not loaded (No cg-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, bottom). After a single EGPF frame, a strong UV-flash was applied. Imaging was then resumed in the EGFP channel at 1 Hz. The second column depicts difference images of the frames immediately after and before UV-flash exposure (only fluorescence increase is shown). To quantify translocation of the PLCδ<sub>4</sub>-PH-EGFP probe, the ratio of EGFP fluorescence in the periphery (between the two yellow dotted circles) and the center of the cell (inner yellow dotted circle) was measured and normalized to pre-flash values. The right panel shows the frame-wise quantification of the average (cell wise) ratio in both groups (+cg-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>: green, No cg-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>: black). The fluorescence ratio increased in cells loaded with cg-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> after UV-uncaging, indicating release of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in the plasma membrane. The fluorescence ratio relaxed to baseline with a mono-exponential time course (blue line). A second UV-flash applied 38.5 s after the first one also increased the ratio, but to a lesser degree. Scale bars 5 µm. All values are mean ±SEM. Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to calculate p-values.

As it is a distinct advantage of our compound that cellular PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> can be rapidly and specifically increased by light without interfering with basic PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> metabolism, we wanted to verify PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> uncaging without the prior manipulation of its resting levels. For this we employed a different biosensor harboring the lower affinity PH-domain of PLCδ<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kabachinski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2004</xref>). Chromaffin cells were infected with a virus expressing PLCδ<sub>4</sub>-PH-EGFP, and incubated with caged PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<bold>2a,b</bold>). Experiments were performed on the same microscope setup later used for electrophysiological recordings. Uncaging cg-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> by a 1–2 ms light pulse from a Xenon flash bulb caused rapid translocation of the sensor towards the periphery of the cell, in line with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> release in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). In cells not incubated with cg-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, no translocation was observed. Ongoing imaging of the PLCδ<sub>4</sub>-PH-EGFP allowed us to estimate the time constant of the [PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>] relaxation to ~25 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). A second flash caused markedly less translocation, suggesting that most of the cg-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> had already been uncaged. In this experiment, the relatively modest recruitment amplitude of to the plasma membrane is probably affected by the widespread intracellular localization of cg-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), because uncaging likely also increases PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> on intracellular membranes. However, the fact that PH-domains overall relocalize to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3b</xref>) indicate that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is uncaged there.</p><p>The essential role of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> for exocytosis was realized more than 25 years ago, through experiments showing that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion inhibits exocytosis from cracked-open adrenal chromaffin cells and PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eberhard et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hay et al., 1995</xref>).

To investigate the physiological effects of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> uncaging, cg-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> was loaded into the cells (see Materials and methods) and exocytosis was induced with a depolarization protocol to allow Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Voets et al., 1999</xref>). Exocytosis was monitored using patch-clamp capacitance measurements, which report on increased plasma membrane area upon vesicle fusion. After a pre-pulse, which elicited indistinguishable exocytosis in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), cells were either subjected to UV-light flashes (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> uncaging group) or not (control group), and a second depolarization protocol was used to assess the effect of uncaging. PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> uncaging significantly augmented exocytosis in wildtype cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b,ci</xref>).

Indeed, Phorbol esters, which are assumed to act as DAG analogues, augment the RRP size in chromaffin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smith et al., 1998</xref>). Therefore, we wanted to distinguish between PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> vs. DAG requirements for rapid exocytosis augmentation in chromaffin cells. To this end we performed DAG uncaging. Coumarin-caged DAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nadler et al., 2013</xref>) (cg-DAG, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>) was infused into cells via the patch pipette. Because both cg-DAG and cg-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> bear the same fluorescent coumarin cage, titration of coumarin fluorescence at different (known) DAG concentrations in the patch pipette allowed us to estimate the cellular concentration of cg-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in the experiments above. This concentration was not known, since AM-ester loading allows progressive accumulation in the cell with time. Based on comparable fluorescence values in the titration, we estimated that the final intracellular concentration of the caged PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> corresponded to ~29 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>) and therefore performed DAG uncaging using 30 or 45 μM DAG.

To this end, we performed double Ca<sup>2+</sup>-uncaging experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In these experiments no caged lipids were present, but UV uncaging of a photolysable Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator allowed the direct triggering of vesicles without voltage depolarization of the cell. Ca<sup>2+</sup> uncaging increases intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations to the tens-of micromolar range, which is sufficient to deplete the entire RRP and expected to activate endogenous PLC, leading to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> degradation. Two sequential Ca<sup>2+</sup>-uncaging stimuli were used to assess RRP sizes and thus refilling in cells incubated with a PLC inhibitor, or an inactive control compound. Recovery of the RRP was significantly enhanced by inhibiting PLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that preventing PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> degradation enhances vesicle priming. Thus, conversion of endogenous PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> to DAG is overall negative for refilling of the RRP, which confirms our findings using caged lipid compounds.</p><p>We next sought to identify relevant PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> effectors among the molecular release machinery.

The relevance of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-binding was indicated by mutation, which increased the Ca<sup>2+</sup> requirements for exocytosis. However, mutations can have other effects than those intended in the experiment. For instance, the same residues in the syt-1 C2B domain interacting with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> were also shown to interact with the neuronal SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, and to complement those experiments, we here uncaged PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in syt-1 knockout mice, and found that uncaging did not potentiate exocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Proper loading of the compound was ensured after the experiment by the intrinsic fluorescence of the coumarin group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Exocytosis from syt-1 KO cells is reduced compared to wild type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Voets et al., 2001a</xref>), although sizable release – including a small RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mohrmann et al., 2013</xref>) – remains. We asked whether the lack of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> augmentation was due to the smaller exocytosis amplitude, rather than the lack of syt-1. To this end, we reanalyzed data, identifying wild type cells with intrinsically low exocytosis amplitude, and syt-1 KO cells with high exocytosis amplitude. However, we still found significant potentiation in WT cells, but not in syt-1 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1d</xref>), suggesting a molecular requirement for syt-1. Neurosecretion is known to depend on the key vesicle priming factor Munc13, and the relevant isoform in chromaffin cells, Munc13-2, harbors a C2-domain (C2B), which displays a strong PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kabachinski et al., 2014</xref>). Adrenal chromaffin cells isolated from Munc13-2 knockout mice lacked the capacity of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> uncaging to potentiate exocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Thus, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> potentiation in chromaffin cells occurs via specific activation of the vesicular release machinery and requires syt-1 and Munc13-2. To identify additional molecular targets, we repeated experiments in knockout mouse cells for the major PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding proteins CAPS1 and −2. CAPS interacts with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> via a pleckstrin homology domain and loss of this interaction impedes vesicle exocytosis by reducing the number of releasable vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nguyen Truong et al., 2014</xref>). However, uncaging PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in CAPS1 and −2 double knockout mice revealed a similar enhancement of release upon PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> uncaging as in wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>), arguing that augmentation of exocytosis observed here occurs independently of CAPS, or bypasses CAPS (see Discussion). Surprisingly, the IRP size was actually reduced by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-uncaging in the Munc13-1 KO, whereas it was (nonsignificantly, p&lt;0.08) increased in the CAPS-1/2 DKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The implication of this finding is unclear, but Munc13 and CAPS-proteins play distinct roles during priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kabachinski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2010</xref>), and if they are both required for the formation of the IRP-vesicles, then the elimination of one or the other might create IRPs with distinct properties, including PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-dependence. We conclude that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-dependent activation of exocytosis operates via Munc13-2 and syt-1 to potentiate RRP size.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30203.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Exocytosis potentiation by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> uncaging requires synaptotagmin-1 and Munc13-2, but not CAPS.</title><p>(<bold>a–c</bold>) All cells were loaded with cg-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> prior to experiments and subjected to the stimulation paradigm shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>.

While release could still be augmented in wild type cells with low release, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> uncaging was without effect in syt-1 KO cells with high release. These data argue that the absence of potentiation by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> uncaging in syt-1 KO cells is not caused by the lower total exocytosis in these cells, which is in line with the augmenting effect observed in CAPS1/−2 DKO cells, which also have reduced exocytosis.

One interpretation is that IRP-vesicles are already saturated with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>; another possible explanation is that the IRP is limited in size by additional factors (for instance the availability of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels), and therefore cannot be further augmented. Based on the different types of effects we observe in our experiments (loss of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-dependent augmentation in syt-1 KO and Munc13-2 KO vs. no effect in CAPS DKO), two different mechanisms of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-binding proteins can be envisioned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>): the first is specific, and probably stoichiometric, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-binding to support protein function, for instance the ability of Munc13 to stimulate SNARE-complex formation, or to increase the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding affinity of syt-1 during secretion triggering. The other potential function is to co-localize the fusion machinery with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-patches in the plasma membrane. The latter, but not the former, function might be bypassed by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-uncaging, which uncovers PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> under the vesicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Thus, lipid uncaging can serve as an exquisite tool to distinguish between these two different functions of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-binding proteins, just as Ca<sup>2+</sup> uncaging has been instrumental in distinguishing between effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding to the release machinery itself, and effects on colocalizing vesicles with Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Voets et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wadel et al., 2007</xref>).

We found that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, but not DAG, uncaging caused the rapid fusion of vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a,c</xref>). The amount of fusion correlated with the RRP size, and this correlation extended to the knockouts tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). Thus, the acutely fusing vesicles probably constitute a fraction of the RRP. The fact that rapid fusion was only seen when uncaging PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, but not DAG, argue that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is more directly linked to exocytosis triggering in adrenal chromaffin cells, possibly because PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding to the C2-domains in Munc13-2 and syt-1 directly change the Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinities of those domains. The fusing vesicles might be members of the ‘Highly Calcium Sensitive Pool’ (HCSP), which fuse at lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations than the rest of the RRP vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 2002</xref>). Since these vesicles are close to fusion threshold, rapid binding of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> might increase the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-affinity of syt-1 enough that the vesicles fuse due to a rapid increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-affinity rather than a rapid increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration as would normally be the case.</p><p>A definite advantage of the photocaged approach is that it allows inducing sub-second increases in the phospholipid composition of membranes, which can be used to identify direct effects of a phospholipid before its metabolism takes place. A possible complication is that by shielding the head group, the lipid will no longer be recognized by proteins (enzymes, lipid-shuttling proteins) that establish the cellular pattern of lipid composition between different organelles. Thus, the localization of the caged lipid will likely be broader than for the native lipid. Indeed, investigating the sub-cellular distribution of our cg-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> revealed the uptake in compartments other than the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). However, our data also clearly show its specific uncaging at the plasma membrane, making it a suitable tool to address reactions at the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Moreover, uncaging PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in chromaffin cells led to a specific potentiation of vesicle priming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), which is consistent with previous findings using enzymatic over/underexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Milosevic et al., 2005</xref>), and with the use of a PLC-inhibitor to prevent PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> breakdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, the effect depended on known PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-binding proteins. Thus, although we cannot rule out that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is liberated elsewhere in the cell, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> uncaging results in valid and specific effects on exocytosis. The wide-spread distribution of our caged compound may also be considered a distinct advantage, because this allows to study the consequences of its focal liberation in regions where PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is sparse.</p><p>Collectively, our data demonstrate the power of caged phospholipids to dissect physiological functions of different, but interconvertible, phospholipids. The main power of the approach is that it outpaces the rate of metabolism/interconversion of one lipid into another. Using this method we have dissected the molecular requirement for the potentiating effect of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> on exocytosis, and we have demonstrated a novel, acute effect of uncaged PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>: to trigger rapid exocytosis. We anticipate that caged lipid second messengers will serve as valuable experimental tools to uncover mechanistic details of fast cellular processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(Mus.musculus)</td><td>CD1</td><td>Department of Experimental Medicine, <break/>Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, <break/>Unviersity of Copenhagen.</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent <break/>(M.musculus)</td><td>Syt-1 nul allele <break/>(gene symbol: syt1)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Geppert et al., 1994</xref></td><td>PMID: 18308932</td><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent <break/>(M.musculus)</td><td>Munc13-2 null allele <break/>(gene symbol: Unc13b)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</xref></td><td>PMID: 12070347</td><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent <break/>(M.musculus)</td><td>CAPS1 null allele <break/>(gene symbol: Cadps)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Speidel et al., 2005</xref></td><td>PMID: 15820695</td><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent <break/>(M.musculus)</td><td>CAPS2 null allele <break/>(gene symbol: <break/>Cadps2)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jockusch et al., 2007</xref></td><td>PMID: 18022372</td><td/></tr><tr><td>cell line (HEK 293T)</td><td>HEK 293T</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CRL-1573</td><td>Experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref></td></tr><tr><td>cell line (HEK 293T)</td><td>HEK 293T</td><td>A gift from Dr. Theres Schaub <break/>and Prof Victor Tarabykin, Institute <break/>of Cell Biology and Cell Biology, <break/>Charité Berlin</td><td/><td>Experiments <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref></td></tr><tr><td>cell line (COS-7)</td><td>COS-7</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CRL-1651</td><td/></tr><tr><td>cell line (tsA201)</td><td>tsA201</td><td>Sigma-aldrich</td><td>Sigma-aldrich: 96121229</td><td/></tr><tr><td>transfected lentiviral <break/>construct (p156rrl-pCMV- <break/>PLCδ4PH-EGFP)</td><td>PLCδ4-PH-GFP</td><td>This paper</td><td>Local reference: 131</td><td valign="bottom">plasmid with PLCδ4 received <break/>from Thomas F.

Image acquisition was controlled by the Nikon NIS-Elements AR Software (vers. 4.51.01). Frames were collected at 2 Hz, images in the RFP channel were acquired by excitation with a 561 nm laser (2% intensity) and an exposure time of 100–200 ms.

Integrated fluorescence density of a circular region of interest (ROI1) containing the entire cell was calculated. For each cell another, smaller, ROI – ROI2 – was defined as the interior of the cell, excluding the periphery. The content of the inner ROI was subtracted from the other ROI to isolate the intensity of the periphery of the cell (which includes the plasma membrane), and the ratio of periphery to inner ROI was calculated, i.e. (ROI1-ROI2)/ROI2. This ratio was calculated as a function of time and normalized to the pre-flash ratio.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom Suzanne Pfeffer is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen a Senior Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>This study uses impressive chemistry to create a caged, membrane-permeant PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, which is then used to test the effect of a rapid PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> increase on chromaffin cell exocytosis. Three observations are made for wildtype cell capacitance changes after initiating uncaging. First, there is an immediate burst of a small number of granules, next there is no change in the depolarization-induced immediately releasable pool (IRP), and finally there is significant augmentation of the depolarization-induced readily releasable pool (RRP). These observations imply that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> can, itself, stimulate a small amount of fusion and that it is a limiting factor controlling the priming for RRP. As might be expected, augmentation of the RRP requires Syt-1 and Munc13-2 but, surprisingly, did not require CAPS1/2.</p><p>After group discussion, it was the overall consensus of the referees that the impact of this study lies more in the development and use of a new tool than in a conceptual breakthrough. Previous studies reached similar conclusions using patch pipette delivery of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Thus, the improvement of temporal resolution is small for the experiments on IRP and RRP. While uncaging might have the spatial resolution to achieve highly localized changes in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, the present work has the same limitation of previous work in which the released PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is present throughout the cell (and may even cause mislocalization of proteins with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding domains). In terms of the biology, two findings stand out: the lack of a role for CAPS1/2 and that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is capable of stimulating fusion without Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Interestingly, the latter depended on a dramatically reduced time of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> exposure (the 1st 1-2msec flash) so it highlights the power of the tool. Nevertheless, as the authors concede, the physiological situation is that exocytosis is triggered by a rise in calcium not a rise in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> so the result is likely a consequence of something already present in the literature: that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> may increase of Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity of syt-1. Reluctantly, our overall assessment is that the study is better suited to a more specialized journal despite its elegance and convincingness.

A general problem with analysing lipid signaling has been that methods to manipulate lipid second messengers have been intrinsically slow. In the context of PPI<sub>2</sub> signaling, for instance, the activation of receptors coupled to downstream enzymes or the manipulation of the corresponding enzymes themselves (e.g. inhibition, activation, deletion, or ectopic localization) have mostly been used to modulate PPI<sub>2</sub> signaling, typically within timeframes of minutes and longer. The caged PPI<sub>2</sub> compounds described in the present study allow to manipulate PPI<sub>2</sub> levels in the sub-second timeframe and hence allow in principle to dissect multiple different sub-steps of cell biological processes that are influenced by PPI<sub>2</sub> signaling.</p><p>As far as I am concerned, the first introduction of a caged PPI<sub>2</sub> compound that actually works is a substantial achievement that deserves prominent publication. The authors did a good job in showing that the caged PPI<sub>2</sub> s work in principle. Clearly, a few open issues remain – e.g. (i) the question as to what the more or less homogeneous distribution of the caged compound in the cytosol after loading really means (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), (ii) how sure one can therefore be that it is actually plasma membrane PPI<sub>2</sub> that causes the effects seen, or (iii) what sub-steps of the secretion process are exactly regulated by the PPI<sub>2</sub> -Munc13-2 vs. PPI<sub>2</sub> -CAPS interaction. However, I am willing to cut the authors some slack here, because I am of the opinion that the new caged PPI<sub>2</sub> compounds and the proof-of-principle data of the present paper will be very interesting to scientists in all areas of cell biology. In fact, the new compounds might be at least as interesting to cell biologists as they may be to people working on neurons and neurosecretory cells.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate optical uncaging potentiates exocytosis&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Our newly developed tool enabled us to study secretion in the same cell before and after uncaging, which we combined with genetic mutations to accurately decipher the involvement of specific PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> - binding proteins. We use this to provide novel insights into molecular function of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in stimulated exocytosis:</p><p>• We are the first to provide a genetic analysis showing that the increase in secretion caused by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in living cells requires PAGE 2 OF 3 synatotagmin-1 and Munc13-2 (although reviewer #2 seems to have expected this result, this is the first experimental evidence).</p><p>• We are the first to show that CAPS-proteins are not involved in the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> -augmenting effect, a clearly important finding for all researchers studying regulated exocytosis, with mechanistic implications (see below).</p><p>• We identify a new, fast effect of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> to trigger release of a part of the Readily Releasable Pool of vesicles. This is the first time that a manipulation other than membrane depolarization or Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation was shown to trigger the release of secretory vesicles. These experiments establish that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is more than a vesicle recruitment factor; it is actually involved in fusion itself.</p><p>Apart from the biological insights, all reviewers share a consensus view that the tool itself, caged, membrane permeable PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, is a major methodological advance and we understand that the publication of such developments is within the scope of <italic>eLife</italic> (“we welcome the submission of significant technological or methodological advances”): “the work appears to be carried out to a high standard” (reviewer #1), “impressive chemistry” (reviewer #2), “the first introduction of a caged PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> compound that actually works is a substantial achievement that deserves prominent publication”. The compound is “very interesting to scientists in all areas of cell biology” (reviewer #3). Reviewer #2 recognizes the value of our caged compound in experiments where we show that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> uncaging can trigger rapid vesicle fusion which “highlights the power of the tool” but then detracts from its importance by noting that in the cell a rapid increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup>, not PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, will ordinarily trigger release. However, it is clear to any experimental biologist that the use of exogenous, even unnatural manipulations is key to understand biological function. For instance, Ca<sup>2+</sup> uncaging experiments (which initially also received skeptical comments) trigger synaptic transmission by unnatural means, yet have profoundly added to our understanding of synapse function, with dozens of papers published in leading journals. Any new tool requires authors, reviewers and editors to leave their comfort zone. As this is particularly difficult, and because any introduction of new methodology requires experiments to validate it, a reflexive notion can tend to be that not much has been learned, or that existing methods would suffice. But this is clearly not the case here. In fact, our compound opens up new avenues for research: using PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> uncaging it is now possible to distinguish between two different functions of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> -binding proteins: those activated by stoichiometric, obligatory, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> -binding (according to our data this will include synaptotagmin-1 and Munc13-2), and those operating to localize PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> to the vesicle surroundings. Our experiments indicate that CAPS proteins function in the latter fashion, because their requirement for vesicle priming (which depends PAGE 3 OF 3 on their PH domain) could be bypassed by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> uncaging, which uncovers PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> beneath the vesicle. Thus, application of our tool enabled us to make this distinction, which is a major finding. Likewise, the striking observation that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> can actually trigger exocytosis could not have been obtained by any other method. As described in our discussion, we agree with reviewer #2 that this may be due to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> -dependent increase in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity of synaptotagmin, which was observed in biochemical experiments. However, the biochemical experiments give no account for the kinetics of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-dependent activation. We here provide experimental data in living cells showing that this reaction operates on a comparable (millisecond) timescale as Ca<sup>2+</sup> association, which provides novel biological insights into the vesicle fusion process.</p><p>Overall, the editorial decision is not understandable to us. We appreciate your supportive comment that we should have no problem publishing the manuscript in another high-quality journal, but we struggle to see how the additional time and work on the parts of authors, editors and reviewers is justified, when we in fact have already received a remarkably positive evaluation at <italic>eLife</italic>.

We were happy to hear that the reviewers regard our work as a “high quality study” that “reports the synthesis and application of an optically caged PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>” (reviewer #1) – a “substantial achievement” (reviewer #3) using “impressive chemistry” (reviewer #2). In the revised version of our manuscript we have now carefully addressed all concerns raised by the reviewers and the editor. This was done by rewriting of the text, additional figure items and additional experiments. We would like to remain open in the discussion of the advantages and possible difficulties of our novel approach in the manuscript because it is the first time this compound is used in a cellular context.</p><p>New biological findings</p><p>The novel biological insights gained by our work were not stated clear enough. Now we provide these as bullet points in the Discussion section:</p><p>1) First genetic analysis showing that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> increases exocytosis via synatotagmin-1 and Munc13-2.</p><p>We identify a molecular requirement for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> regulation of exocytosis on these two proteins in genetic analyses. Our data are consistent with mutagenesis experiments that were predicted to interfere with protein lipid interaction in the cell (reviewer #2 also comments on this). However, these mutations are also expected to affect protein functions in additional ways (e.g. the same interface on the Synaptotagmin C2B domain was shown to interact with the neuronal SNAREs (Zhou et al., 2015)), which complicates the interpretation of the mutagenesis data. Here, by selectively studying mouse knockout cells for the relevant proteins, we now provide direct experimental evidence that Syt-1 and Munc13-2 indeed are PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> effector proteins in exocytosis. While this may have been guessed by previous mutagenesis studies, we present crucial experimental evidence.</p><p>2) The priming- and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> -binding CAPS proteins are not involved in the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> -augmenting effect.</p><p>Although CAPS proteins are essential for vesicle priming and well-known PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> interacting proteins, uncaging PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> was still capable to augment exocytosis in the absence of both CAPS isoforms. This functionally distinguishes CAPS from Munc13-2 and Syt-1 and provides insight into differential molecular mechanisms: our data indicate that stoichiometric binding of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> to Syt-1 and Munc13-2 potentiates exocytosis by activating these proteins. However, CAPS proteins appear to function differently. Loss of CAPS reduces secretion (Liu et al., 2010) and our data now show that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> uncaging partially reverts this. This is consistent with a function of CAPS to sequester PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> to the vesicle fusion site. Therefore uncaging PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> below the vesicle – as we do here – can bypass the requirement for CAPS. This is the first distinction between two fundamentally different mechanisms (stoichiometric binding for protein activation vs. local PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> recruitment) of lipid interactions regulating exocytosis (see also below).</p><p>3) Increasing PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> triggers the rapid release of a part of the Readily Releasable Pool of vesicles.</p><p>This is the first time that a manipulation other than membrane depolarization or Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation was shown to trigger the release of secretory vesicles. These experiments establish that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is more than a vesicle recruitment factor; it is actually involved in fusion itself. Moreover, our data establish that the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> induced triggering of exocytosis is very fast (milliseconds), demonstrating that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> can activate the vesicular fusion machinery on similar timescales as Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which is an important mechanistic insight into the vesicle fusion process.</p><p>In addition to these specific findings, we now discuss and illustrate (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) what the general advantages of caged lipids are. Using uncaging it is possible to distinguish between two different roles of lipid-interacting molecules: those that require specific binding of the lipid to perform their function (‘stoichiometric role’), and those proteins that help localize the lipids locally, in order to align them with the downstream machinery (‘localization role’). Uncaging lipids with a near-homogeneous distribution in the membrane would overcome a localization defect, but not an obligatory, stoichiometric role. Thus, caged lipids can help distinguish between those two roles, as we illustrate here by the contrasting findings upon deletion of Munc13-2 and syt-1 on one hand, and CAPS<sup>-1</sup>/2 on the other.</p><p>Localization of caged-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub></p><p>All reviewers commented on the localization of our cg-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. We would like to point out that it was our aim was to generate a caged, membrane permeable PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> variant which would remain undetected in the cell prior to UV-uncaging. However, the fact that our compound is invisible to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> -recognizing proteins will affect its sub-cellular localization. Proteins which usually establish a strict pattern of phosphoinositide composition on distinct cellular organelles will simply not detect our cg-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, the compound displays broad localization within the cell as we point out in the text. It is important to realize that it will not be possible to both ensure that the caged compound is physiological inert and that it has a similar localization as the physiologically active PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> – those two requirements are irreconcilable. We have now pointed this out in the text. However, this difference can be used to an advantage, because as described before and as can also be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, cellular PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> typically localizes to clusters at the plasma membrane. In contrast, our compound appears more homogenous on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, UV uncaging will proportionally result in a much stronger (relative) increase of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in areas surrounding endogenous PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> clusters, allowing us to specifically investigate this. Despite the wide-spread cellular distribution of our compound, we are convinced that the elevation of plasma membrane PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels is causative for the effects on exocytosis observed here for the following reasons:</p><p>1) Line profile analysis where the coumarin fluorescence was compared with a labelling of the plasma membrane demonstrated that cg-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> was present at the plasma membrane and liberated there (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>2) Using TIRF microscopy we show that cg-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is present at the plasma membrane and that its uncaging recruited PLC-δ1-PH-GFP, consistent with increased plasmalemmal PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>3) Uncaging PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> prevented the dissociation PLC-δ1-PH-GFP in cells where PLC activity was induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> uncaging counteracted PLC-mediated reduction of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the plasma membrane and stabilized PLC-δ1-PH-GFP in its initial location. Again, the opposite (stronger PLC-δ1-PH-GFP dissociation) would be expected if uncaging predominantly liberated PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> on intracellular organelles.</p><p>4) PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> uncaging at the footprint of HEK cells increased the local fluorescence of the actin-marker lifeact (new experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), indicating the activation of actin polymerization and/or redistribution to the plasma membrane.</p><p>5) Bright field uncaging of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in chromaffin cells showed that PLC-δ4-PH-GFP re-distributed to peripheral cell regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), in line with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> enrichment at the plasma membrane (if the uncaging of intracellular cg-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> had dominated, the opposite – a redistribution to the cell’s interior- would be expected). It might not have been clear that the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> show the ratio between fluorescence in the periphery and the center of the cell – thus an increase represents a redistribution towards the plasma membrane. At the suggestion of reviewer 2, we have now included an example difference picture showing the relocalization directly.</p><p>6) Exocytosis depends on a highly localized molecular machinery, particularly as we observe effects on primed RRP vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), which are docked via molecular contacts to the plasma membrane. Therefore, the only two membranes that affect exocytosis – within the time frame of our measurements – are the vesicular and plasma membranes.</p><p>7) We show that uncaging PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> potentiates exocytosis via synaptotagmin-1 which was previously shown to interact with plasma membrane PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> for fusion (Bai et al., 2004). If PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> uncaging on the vesicle membrane would dominate, it would steer the synaptotagmin C2B to the wrong membrane, leading to an inhibition of exocytosis by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> uncaging, rather than a stimulation.</p><p>In our manuscript we now discuss the issue of cg-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> localization in more detail, have restructured our figure layout, performed additional analyses and experiments, and included a cartoon summarizing main findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] 1) Please comment on the effect of the pluronic in cell viability and secretion efficiency; also, the compounds show strange localizations in cells–please comment.

Finally, it would help the reader if the authors could highlight at the end of the discussion precisely what this probe brings that was not really known before, and other important applications that will benefit from its use.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now pointed out that the overall capacity of the cells to undergo exocytosis in the presence of pluronic and caged PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is similar to previous experiments. We have also performed additional experiments in which we specifically investigate possible effects of the caged compound itself on exocytosis in chromaffin cells.

In all experiments in which exocytosis was investigated both groups (uncaging vs. control) received identical treatment with pluronic and the caged PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>.

In fact, previous studies reached similar conclusions using patch pipette delivery of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Thus, the improvement of temporal resolution is small for the experiments on IRP and RRP (both methods appear to have on the order of 1 min lead times). While uncaging might have the spatial resolution to achieve highly localized changes in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, the present work has the same limitation of previous work in which the released PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>is present throughout the cell (and may even cause mislocalization of proteins with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>binding domains). In terms of the biology, two findings stand out: the lack of a role for CAPS1/2 and that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>is capable of stimulating fusion without Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Interestingly, the latter depended on a dramatically reduced time of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>exposure (the first 1-2msec flash) so it highlights the power of the tool. Nevertheless, as the authors concede, the physiological situation is that exocytosis is triggered by a rise in calcium not a rise in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>so the result is likely a consequence of something already present in the literature: that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>may increase of Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity of syt-1. Reluctantly, my overall assessment is that the study is better suited to a more specialized journal despite its elegance and convincingness.</p></disp-quote><p>This reviewer points out that it might be expected that the augmentation of exocytosis by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depends on Syt-1 and Munc13-2, based on previous mutagenesis studies of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding sites. However, the introduced mutations are bound to have additional effects. For instance, the residues of the Syt-1 C2B domain interacting with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> were also shown to interact with the neuronal SNARE complex (Zhou et al., 2015). Our genetic analysis of Syt-1 and Munc13-2 combined with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> uncaging indicates a functional interaction with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, which was not shown before. Because any introduction of new methodology requires experiments to validate it, it might appear that not much has been learned, or that existing methods would suffice. But this is clearly not the case here. In fact, our compound opens up new avenues for research: using PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> uncaging it is now possible to distinguish between two different functions of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> -binding proteins: those activated by stoichiometric, obligatory, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> -binding (according to our data this will include synaptotagmin-1 and Munc13-2), and those operating to localize PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> to the vesicle surroundings. Our experiments are consistent with CAPS proteins functioning in the latter fashion, because their requirement for vesicle priming (which depends on their PH domain) could be bypassed by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> uncaging, which uncovers PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> beneath the vesicle. Thus, application of our tool enabled us to make this distinction, which is a major finding. Likewise, the striking observation that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> can actually trigger exocytosis could not have been obtained by any other method. As described in our discussion, we agree with reviewer #2 that this may be due to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> -dependent increase in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity of synaptotagmin, which was observed in biochemical experiments. However, the biochemical experiments give no account for the kinetics of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> -dependent activation. We here provide experimental data in living cells showing that this reaction operates on a comparable (millisecond) timescale as Ca<sup>2+</sup> association, which provides novel biological insights into the vesicle fusion mechanism. We cannot see how it is an argument against our approach that exocytosis is normally triggered by a calcium rise; many methods have been devised to stimulate cellular processes in an artificial way so that new insights could be obtained.</p><p>We now provide a list of bullet points of biological advance presented in our study (see above and Discussion section). We have also included a cartoon depicting the differential mechanisms of the two types of lipid interactions (stoichimetric, localization-based), which can be distinguished using caged lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] As far as I am concerned, the first introduction of a caged PPI<sub>2</sub>compund that actually works is a substantial achievement that deserves prominent publication. The authors did a good job in showing that the caged PPI<sub>2</sub>s work in principle. Clearly, a few open issues remain – e.g. (i) the question as to what the more or less homogeneous distribution of the caged compound in the cytosol after loading really means (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), (ii) how sure one can therefore be that it is actually plasma membrane PPI<sub>2</sub>that causes the effects seen, or (iii) what sub-steps of the secretion process are exactly regulated by the PPI<sub>2</sub>-Munc13-2 vs. PPI<sub>2</sub>-CAPS interaction. However, I am willing to cut the authors some slack here, because I am of the opinion that the new caged PPI<sub>2</sub>componds and the proof-of-principle data of the present paper will be very interesting to scientists in all areas of cell biology. In fact, the new compounds might be at least as interesting to cell biologists as they may be to people working on neurons and neurosecretory cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding point (i): we now discuss the issue that the homogeneous localization of the caged PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is actually expected because the cage makes the compound physiologically inert, preventing the interaction with proteins that usually function to generate organelle-specific phosphoinositide compositions (see also general remarks and remarks to reviewer #2 above).</p><p>Regarding point (ii): it is true that owing to the cell-wide distribution it is likely that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is also uncaged on intracellular organelles. In a different setting, this may be used to an advantage if combined with local UV illumination. Nevertheless, based on the 7 arguments we list above (general remarks), we think that the observed effects we observe on exocytosis are specific to changes in plasmalemmal PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Regarding point (iii): we have now included a cartoon where we illustrate the two distinct functions of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> we envision for Munc13-2/syt-1 vs. CAPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Given the requirement of Munc13-2 and Syt-1 for the augmenting effects of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> uncaging, our data are consistent with a function of CAPS upstream of these two factors to colocalize PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> with the fusion machinery (see also general remarks above).</p></body></sub-article></article>
