precisely coordinated remodeling of the transcriptional landscape to enable the growth and differentiation of new tissue, a process executed over multiple days and across dozens of cell types. The heterogeneity of tissues and temporally-sensitive fate decisions involved has made it difficult to articulate the gene regulatory programs enabling regeneration of individual cell types. To better understand how a regenerative program is fulfilled by neural progenitor cells (NPCs) of the spinal cord, we analyzed <italic>pax6</italic>-expressing NPCs isolated from regenerating <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> tails. By intersecting chromatin accessibility data with single-cell transcriptomics, we find that NPCs place an early priority on neuronal differentiation. Late in regeneration, the priority returns to proliferation. Our analyses identify Pbx3 and Meis1 as critical regulators of tail regeneration and axon organization. Overall, we use transcriptional regulatory dynamics to present a new model for cell fate decisions and their regulators in NPCs during regeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>neural progenitor cells</kwd><kwd>ATAC-Seq</kwd><kwd>scRNA-Seq</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic></kwd><kwd>spinal cord</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS099124</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wills</surname><given-names>Andrea Elizabeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007270</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kakebeen</surname><given-names>Anneke Dixie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Regenerating neural progenitors of the <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> tail prioritize differentiation to motor neuron types earlier than proliferation, a decision partly regulated by the transcription factors Pbx3 and Meis1.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In contrast to mammals, <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadpoles are able to undergo scarless healing and full regeneration of the limb, spinal cord, or tail after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beck et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kakebeen and Wills, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee-Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tseng and Levin, 2008</xref>). While lifelong regenerative healing is a characteristic shared by many amphibians and fish, the regenerative capacity of <italic>Xenopus</italic> declines during metamorphosis, and is lost in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Filoni and Bosco, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mitogawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Suzuki et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>Xenopus</italic> therefore represents an especially useful model for understanding the cell-intrinsic and –extrinsic properties governing regeneration.</p><p>In <italic>Xenopus</italic> as in other regenerative animals, the event of a major injury triggers a rapid transcriptional remodeling of the injured tissue. It is now well-established that some aspects of this remodeling recapitulate developmental signaling events. In particular, developmental signaling pathways such as Wnt, FGF, BMP, TGF<bold>-ß,</bold> Notch and Shh are upregulated, and are required for full regeneration of the limb, tail, and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beck et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ho and Whitman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Slack et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Taniguchi et al., 2014</xref>). Genome-wide transcriptomic studies have confirmed that numerous genes associated with embryonic development are re-expressed during regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee-Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Love et al., 2011</xref>). However, these studies have been carried out on bulk regenerating tissue, making it difficult to identify what signals or factors are required to promote regeneration in specific cell types. Recently, single-cell transcriptomic analysis (scRNA-Seq) of both the regenerating <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> tail and the regenerating axolotl limb have begun to identify the transcriptional signatures associated with distinct cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aztekin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gerber et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pelzer et al., 2020</xref>). These studies also highlighted intriguing distinctions between the models. The regenerating axolotl limb shows a transcriptional convergence between all connective tissue cell types, associated with the formation of the undifferentiated limb blastema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gerber et al., 2018</xref>), while in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> tail, cell type identities are kept clearly intact as regeneration progresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aztekin et al., 2019</xref>). While these studies substantially advance our atlas of the genes expressed by different cell types in regeneration, they do not identify the transcription factors that interpret and respond to injury cues, nor the transcriptional regulatory elements that trigger changes in expression profiles.</p><p>To address these gaps, we sought to articulate the gene regulatory network and transcriptional dynamics associated with regeneration by specifically targeting NPCs, a critical cell type for regeneration. NPCs represent the focus of some therapeutic efforts to restore human motor function following spinal cord injury in regenerative medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Khazaei et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Levi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shin et al., 2015</xref>) and much effort has been applied to defining the in vivo and in vitro programs that guide their cell fate decisions in the developing spinal cord as well as in culture. During development, neural stem cells give rise to distinct domains of lineage-restricted progenitor cells defined by their expression of specific transcription factors across the dorsal ventral axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alaynick et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lai et al., 2016</xref>). The decision to exit the cell cycle and undergo terminal neuronal differentiation is directed by extrinsic cues, particularly repression of Notch signaling, which is highly conserved across vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lara-Ramirez et al., 2019</xref>). Following amputation, the spinal cord first begins to repair by closing the open end to form the tube-like neural ampulla, a structure formed by ependymal cells. Progenitor cells then contribute to both growth and new differentiation as the newly regenerated spinal cord elongates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beck et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gaete et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stefanelli, 1951</xref>). Therefore, neural progenitors must balance their decisions between proliferating to repopulate lost tissue and differentiating to mature neurons. The global transcriptional dynamics that govern these decisions, including the transcription factors required and their target sites across the genome, remain poorly defined.</p><p>To identify gene regulatory dynamics in neural progenitors during regeneration, we analyzed the transcription and chromatin accessibility profiles of neural progenitors purified from <italic>pax6:GFP</italic> transgenic <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> tails over a regenerative timecourse. Using both ATAC-Seq and scRNA-Seq, we show that by 24 hr post amputation (hpa), <italic>pax6</italic>+ neural progenitors place a high priority on differentiation to motor and interneuron subtypes, and only later at 72hpa do they accessibilize genes associated with proliferation and self-renewal. By intersecting transcriptional and chromatin accessibility data, we identified candidate transcriptional regulators associated with both early and later changes in this neural progenitor gene expression profile. Further analysis of two of these, Pbx3 and Meis1, revealed similar loss-of-function phenotypes, including reduced tail regeneration and disorganization of regenerated neural tissues. Taken together, we present an integrated transcriptional regulatory analysis of regeneration in <italic>pax6</italic>-expressing NPCs that highlights both parallels and distinctions relative to embryonic development, and present novel candidates regulating regeneration in this critical cell type.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transgenic <italic>pax6</italic>:<italic>GFP</italic> is expressed in NPCs during regeneration</title><p>We selected the <italic>Xtr.Tg(pax6:GFP;cryga:RFP;actc1:RFP)</italic> transgenic line (hereafter abbreviated <italic>pax6:GFP)</italic> to track NPCs over the course of regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hartley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hirsch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Horb et al., 2019</xref>; 31,88). <italic>Pax6</italic> is a highly conserved paired box transcription factor essential for central nervous system development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bel-Vialar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Osumi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Walther and Gruss, 1991</xref>). Because the expression pattern of this line has primarily been characterized earlier in development, we first wanted to confirm that GFP was found in a pattern consistent with <italic>pax6</italic> expression and NPC distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ericson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hartley et al., 2001</xref>). To do so, we imaged whole mount tadpoles to identify where the <italic>pax6:GFP+</italic> cells were localized anteroposteriorly in a stage 41 tadpole, finding that <italic>pax6</italic> is expressed in the forebrain, hindbrain, eye, and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In lateral confocal images of whole-mount transgenic tails, we found that the GFP expression domain spanned the same dorsal ventral domain as the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Transverse sections of a stage 41 tadpole also revealed a broad dorsoventral <italic>pax6</italic>+ domain surrounding the central canal of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). GFP expression in transgenic tadpoles included much of the same domain as the NSC marker Sox2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Notably, both nuclear Sox2 and cytoplasmic GFP driven by <italic>pax6</italic> are localized medially around the central canal, while markers associated with differentiated neurons such as Dcx and neurofilament are largely found in the spinal cord periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Thus we concluded that we could use GFP expression to capture a large proportion of NPCs and thereby interrogate their population-level regulatory dynamics, although we can’t conclusively rule out the possibility that some NSCs are excluded from this domain, or that some differentiated neurons may be included in GFP-expressing cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Expression dynamics of pax6:GFP in the regenerating spinal cord.</italic></title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left, cartoon depiction of a NF stage 41 tadpoles with known <italic>pax6</italic>+ domains colored green.

Taking an unbiased approach, we used multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) to identify how similar or different the <italic>pax6</italic> and all-tissue libraries are overall. We found that the <italic>pax6</italic> libraries cluster away from the clustered all-tissue libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We then examined individual gene regulatory loci. The majority of peaks called were located within 500 bp of a transcription start site for both all tissue and <italic>pax6</italic> libraries, confirming that the majority of ATAC-Seq signal is concentrated in nucleosome-depleted promoters, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Both <italic>pax6</italic> and all-tissue libraries shared common peaks around a control housekeeping promoter (<italic>odc</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dhorne-Pollet et al., 2013</xref>) without any apparent significant differences in accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, left). By contrast, upstream of the <italic>pax6</italic> TSS, all <italic>pax6</italic> library timepoints share a peak that is absent in all-tissue libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, right). From this first proof-of-principle test, we concluded that ATAC-Seq libraries from sorted cells can be used to identify chromatin accessibility differences in NPCs relative to other tissues, and that ATAC-Seq of these sorted cells can be used to find tissue-specific accessible regions that are beneath the detection sensitivity of bulk analysis of all of the tissues together. We then progressed to genome-wide analysis of differences between <italic>pax6:GFP</italic>+ calls and bulk tissue.</p><p>Our next goal was to identify categories of gene regulatory regions that have increased accessibility in NPCs relative to bulk tail tissue. To this end, we interrogated the global NPC chromatin signature by compiling all <italic>pax6</italic> library peaks into one peak file and all of the all-tissue peaks into a second peak file and calling differentially accessible peaks between these two compiled files. We identified 3604 regions that were more accessible in the <italic>pax6</italic> libraries than the all-tissue libraries, which we assigned to the nearest TSS, and used the associated gene names as input for gene ontology (GO) analysis using gProfileR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Raudvere et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>). Genes with increased accessibility in <italic>pax6:GFP</italic>+ cells showed statistically significant enrichment for neural-associated terms such as ‘Neurogenesis’, ‘Nervous system development’, and ‘Neuron differentiation,’ confirming the neural progenitor identity of our <italic>pax6:GFP</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, top, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>). We visually confirmed the increased accessibility of regions calling the term ‘Neurogenesis’ with a heat map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The reverse analysis identified 5251 regions that are more accessible in all-tissue libraries than <italic>pax6</italic> libraries, which are associated with broad GO categories relating to ubiquitous cellular processes (i.e. ‘Cellular biosynthetic process’, ‘Transcription from RNA Polymerase II’, and Cellular metabolic process’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, bottom, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>).

Genes preferentially accessible at 6hpa called six families of GO terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Notably, ‘Nephron Tubule Morphogenesis’ was well represented, and included regulatory regions from <italic>foxd1</italic>, <italic>gata3</italic>, <italic>smo, sall1, osr1, pax2, stat1, hoxd11, wnt6, nog, wnt11, irx3, cited1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). In addition to patterning the nephron, the majority of these genes are expressed in neural stem cells during dorsoventral neural patterning of the spinal cord and early differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alaynick et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Delile et al., 2019</xref>). At this time in regeneration, we observe the spinal cord repairing itself by closing the neural tube and forming the neural ampulla. We have shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> that pax6:<italic>GFP</italic>+ cells populate the regenerated neural ampulla, therefore, we hypothesize that these cells represent ependymoglial cells with NSC character that have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beck et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chernoff et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McHedlishvili et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Muñoz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">O'Hara et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reimer et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We then identified regions that were most accessible at the 24hpa timepoint. This analysis recovered two main families of GO terms, the largest of which was ‘Neuron Development’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Strikingly, the majority of genes that call this GO term become more accessible from 6 to 24hpa, but lose that accessibility at 72hpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Genes with preferentially accessible regulatory regions at 24hpa include factors known to function in multiple aspects of neuronal differentiation and growth. Examples of these include neuritogenesis and growth cone formation (<italic>dclk2, rapgef2, auts2, nedd4l, unc5a</italic>), axonogenesis and axon guidance (<italic>dbn1, sema6a, fry, ptch1</italic>), neuronal migration (<italic>dclk2, rapgef2, auts2, pcdh18</italic>), and transcriptional regulation of neuron differentiation (<italic>skor2, isl1, nfatc4, vax2</italic>). The enrichment of these terms, and their specificity for functions carried out by differentiating neurons rather than proliferating progenitors, agrees well with previous published bulk RNA-Seq analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2017</xref>) showing enrichment for similar neuronal morphogenesis terms, such as axonogenesis and dendritogenesis, in the first day post amputation.</p><p>Finally, we assessed the processes being prioritized at 72hpa. This analysis resulted in five main GO families being called (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), including ‘neuronal precursor cell proliferation’. Notably, cell cycle and proliferation related terms were absent at the 6hpa and 24hpa timepoints. The regions calling this term were all more accessible at 72hpa than the 24hpa timepoint, however about half were not differentially accessible with respect to the uninjured tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>), suggesting that by 72hpa, these regions are regaining similarity to their uninjured state. Altogether, we were able to resolve processes specific to neural progenitor cell function at each timepoint. These suggest that NPCs first prioritize ependymal tube morphogenesis at 6hpa, neural differentiation at 24hpa, and cell proliferation at 72hpa.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Comparative analysis of uninjured and 24hpa tail single cell RNA-Seq data sets reveals expansion in differentiated neuronal clusters at 24hpa</title><p>Our ATAC-Seq analysis suggested that neural progenitor cells may place a high transcriptional regulatory priority on neuronal differentiation early in regeneration, at 24hpa. To determine whether this was reflected in the transcriptional profile and cell-type composition of neural cells, we used single-cell RNA-Seq to interrogate the profile of neural cell types present before and 24 hr after amputation. We sequenced the transcriptomes of individual NPCs from uninjured and regenerating tails, an analogous population to those collected for ATAC-seq. In total, we sequenced 2617 and 1,090 cells from uninjured and 24hpa tissues, respectively. Using Seurat we aligned the two data sets with their integrated analyses and used UMAP dimensional reduction to find clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becht et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>).

A total of 781 uninjured cells and 296 cells from 24hpa cells fell into neural clusters, which comprised NPC/NSCs (defined by expression of <italic>sox2</italic>), transitioning neurons (<italic>neurog1; neurod1</italic>), and differentiated neurons (<italic>elavl4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To gain the highest-possible resolution of cell types within these broad neural clusters, we subsetted neural cells, re-performed dimensionality reduction and called eight unique sub-clusters, including spinal cord progenitors, floor plate progenitors, differentiating neurons, interneurons, motor neurons, vulnerable motor neurons, motor neurons (<italic>leptin</italic>+), and dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

First, we were able to identify new candidate molecular markers for progenitors (<italic>vwcx2l.2, iqca1, daw1</italic>), floor plate progenitors (<italic>bicc, vasn</italic>), differentiating neurons (<italic>nhlh1, tmem178.2</italic>), motor neurons (<italic>prdm14, prdm1, kcnb2</italic>), leptin+ motor neurons (<italic>abcb1, asns, lepr</italic>), vulnerable motor neurons (<italic>mmp17, slc18a3, colq-like</italic>), interneurons (<italic>cnrip1, slc17a7</italic>), and dopaminergic neurons (<italic>pkd2l1, pkd1l2, slc32a1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The ‘vulnerable motor neurons’ term refers to vulnerability of specific neurons to degeneration in ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kline et al., 2017</xref>). Representative genes for each cell type were identified by using differential expression analysis between cell clusters. Second, we found that cell type identities could be clearly assigned to these clusters at 24 hr after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Unlike the connective tissues in the axolotl limb, which lose cell heterogeneity of gene expression after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gerber et al., 2018</xref>), neural cells in the 24hpa <italic>Xenopus</italic> spinal cord maintain heterogeneous gene expression.</p><p>We next used our scRNA-Seq data to interrogate the hypothesis that neural lineages put an early priority on differentiation rather than proliferation. To address this question and to identify which neuronal types, if any, are being produced, we asked how the relative quantities of cell populations change following injury. To this end, we identified what percent of the total neural population is made up of each cluster under each condition. If neural lineages prioritize differentiation early in regeneration, we would expect to see a decline in proliferating progenitor cells and an increase in one or more differentiated neuronal types. Indeed, at 24hpa, we observe a decrease in the percent of NPCs and differentiating neurons with respect to the uninjured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–G</xref>). In agreement with our GO analysis of 24hpa ATAC-Seq data, we see an expansion in differentiated neuronal clusters including interneurons, vulnerable motor neurons, and motor neurons (<italic>leptin</italic>+) at 24hpa. Overall, NSCs are reduced from 38% to 25%, differentiating neurons are reduced from 20% to 10%, and differentiated neurons increase from 42% to 65%. As previously described, we noted that motor neurons (<italic>leptin</italic>+) are virtually absent in the uninjured tail but are abundant at 24hpa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aztekin et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>These transitions in cell type composition are consistent with the hypothesis that neuronal differentiation, especially to specific motor neuron types, is prioritized early in regeneration, with a decline in the relative abundance of proliferative cells.</p><p>Our hypothesis is that neuronal differentiation is prioritized early in regeneration while proliferation is decreased. To further test this hypothesis, we asked if we could see a shift in the transcriptomically defined cell cycle state accompanying the change in cell type representation. To this end we used the Seurat cell cycle phase predictor to predict the cell cycle phase of each cell in the neural lineage. In both the uninjured tail and at 24hpa, the NPCs are primarily predicted to be in S and G2M phases, the differentiating neurons are a mix of G2M and G1 phase, and the subtypes of differentiated neurons are primarily made up of G1 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H/I</xref>). The uninjured tail neural lineage has 30% cells predicted in S phase, 16% cells predicted in G2M phase, and 54% cells predicted in G1 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H/J</xref>). This distribution shifts markedly at the 24hpa timepoint, where the S phase falls to 17%, G2M falls to 7% and G1 increases to 76% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I/K</xref>). Thus, at the 24hpa timepoint, there is a relative increase in the proportion of cells predicted to be in G1 phase and decrease in cells in G2/M/S phases. This correlates with the relative increase in differentiated neurons and decrease in spinal cord progenitors and differentiating cells and supports the hypothesis that NPCs are undergoing differentiation.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title><italic>Markers of neuronal differentiation are increased at 24hpa and proliferation increases at 72hpa.</italic></title><p>UMAP plots of expression in the neural restricted subset of scRNA-Seq for (<bold>A</bold>) <italic>l1cam</italic>, (<bold>G</bold>) <italic>uchl1</italic>, (<bold>M</bold>) <italic>nsg1</italic>, and (<bold>s</bold>) <italic>ass1</italic>.

We therefore integrated our ATAC-Seq data, scRNA-Seq data, and used bulk RNA-Seq data to predict gene regulatory networks occurring over regenerative time. We used HOMER to identify transcription factor (TF) binding sites in differentially accessible peaks associated with called GO terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>). We then used our previously published bulk-RNA-Seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2017</xref>) to confirm each HOMER-identified transcription factor and its targets were expressed at the timepoint of interest. Next we restricted our analysis to differentially accessible regions of the chromatin where TF binding sites were accompanied by differential gene expression in the single-cell RNA-Seq. Differential gene expression was performed between the uninjured and 24hpa timepoints in scRNA-Seq following parameters detailed in Materials and methods. These stringent criteria revealed two regulatory circuits spanning from 6hpa to 72hpa. One circuit predicts Meis1 as a regulatory factor that binds motifs near <italic>runx2</italic> and <italic>etv1</italic> at 24hpa, and Etv1 as a regulatory factor that binds motifs near <italic>pbx3</italic> at 24hpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Each of these four transcription factors also has numerous neuronal differentiation genes among its predicted targets.

In the posterior tail, expression of both factors is weak and diffuse immediately following injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K,L</xref>). However, by 24hpa, expression of both factors increases in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M,N</xref>). By 72hpa, expression persists more weakly in the spinal cord. These analyses therefore indicate that <italic>pbx3</italic> and <italic>meis1</italic> are expressed in the spinal cord, increase in neuronal subtypes at 24hpa, and contribute to increased promoter accessibility at their target genes at 24hpa (particularly for Meis1) and 72hpa (particularly for Pbx3), some of which are likely co-regulated by both factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Meis1 and Pbx3 are necessary for successful spinal cord and tail regeneration</title><p>We next asked whether Meis1 and Pbx3 are independently required for regeneration.

We followed up on these phenotypes by repeating the injections with a second set of morpholinos against Pbx3 and Meis1. The second set of morpholinos phenocopy the original morpholino injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>). As a further confirmation, we designed and injected CRISPR guide RNAs targeting each of these genes together with Cas9 protein at the 4 cell stage, and were able to phenocopy the morpholino effects with this strategy as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G–J</xref>).

These have been documented through genome-wide transcriptomic analyses of the entire regenerating structure, such as the <italic>Xenopus</italic> tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Love et al., 2011</xref>), spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee-Liu et al., 2014</xref>), or axolotl limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dwaraka et al., 2019</xref>). However, in bulk analyses it remains uncertain which cell types are up- or down-regulating particular genes, and increased expression in one cell type may be canceled out by decreases in another. These concerns are equally problematic in bulk-tissue analysis of gene regulatory dynamics (through methods such as ChIP-Seq or ATAC-Seq). In some cases, this problem can be addressed by explanting the tissue of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2014</xref>), but for rare cell types or morphologically complex structures this is not a tenable solution. Here we present a major advance for vertebrate regeneration by using flow-cytometry and scRNA-Seq to coordinately study chromatin accessibility and gene expression in neural progenitors during regeneration, a critical cell type for spinal cord regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fei et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gaete et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Muñoz et al., 2015</xref>). By isolating neural progenitors, we are able to identify a unique chromatin landscape for these cells, including regulatory peaks that cannot be detected in bulk tissue analysis.</p><p>It is important to note the potential limitations of our analysis as well. While our FACS approach utilizing the <italic>pax6:GFP</italic> transgenic line captures a broad domain of neural progenitor cells, we recognize that not every NPC may have been captured. For example, there may be some Sox2+ NPCs that are <italic>pax6</italic>-, and these cells may contribute to regeneration in a distinct way that we did not capture. In particular, our confocal sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) suggest that the <italic>pax6:GFP</italic>+ domain captures a large window of progenitors along the dorsoventral axis but does not capture the dorsal most Sox2+ NPCs. Future analyses using other NPC reporters, as well as domain-specific reporters for region-specific subtypes of both neural progenitors and differentiated neurons, would be necessary to fully round out the picture of what transcriptional priorities are shared among progenitor subtypes and which are region-specific. We may have also captured cells that were <italic>pax6</italic>+ and Sox2-. Specifically, we may have captured some cells that were recently <italic>pax6+</italic> neural progenitors, and are now differentiating but retain GFP protein. This hypothesis would be well informed by birthdating neurons in the transgenic line to visualize if newborn neurons retain reporter GFP; however, for this set of experiments we acknowledge this potential caveat. Finally, while we find that Sox2 and <italic>pax6:GFP</italic> colocalize closely over much of their respective domains at stage 41, the very small size and delicacy of the regeneration bud at 24hpa precluded verification that these two markers continue to colocalize in the same way during the early stages of regeneration as the neural ampulla forms. Therefore while we expect that the spatial domains of these markers continue to overlap, and our scRNA-SEQ confirms that NPCs continue to express both of these markers, there may be subtleties to their spatial dynamics that reveal principles of NPC organization in regeneration that we did not capture.</p><p>Our study identified both novel candidate markers of specific neural lineages, and potential regulatory circuits directing regenerative decisions. Many of the genes we identified as differentially expressed and with differentially accessible promoters were not previously detected in bulk RNA-Seq or microarray analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Love et al., 2011</xref>). Of these, <italic>pbx3</italic> stands out as a gene with expression that is well-restricted to the neural lineage, becomes further restricted to differentiated neurons following injury, has a differentially accessible promoter itself, and has a target motif upstream of multiple differentially-expressed neuronal genes. Nevertheless, <italic>pbx3</italic> was not detected as differentially expressed in previous analyses of regeneration, likely because of the low overall expression levels of <italic>pbx3</italic>, and because expression changes are lineage-specific. Only by combining motif prediction from ATAC-Seq and the high-resolution expression data from scRNA-Seq did we bring this transcription factor to the top of our candidate list. Similarly, <italic>meis1</italic>, which is well-known as a regulator of neural and neural crest development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Erickson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kelly et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Machon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mojsin and Stevanovic, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rataj-Baniowska et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stedman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yamada et al., 2013</xref>), has not previously been detected in differential expression analyses during <italic>Xenopus</italic> regeneration.

This is supported by the widespread accessibility enrichment of neuronal differentiation genes specifically at 24hpa, by the decline in relative proportion of neural progenitors and transitioning neurons in favor of motor neurons and interneurons, and by a reduction in the number of cells in S/G2/M phases of the cell cycle.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for neural progenitor regeneration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In normal development, neural progenitor cells make cell fate decisions to proliferate or differentiate.

We expect that the organized formation and outgrowth of neuronal structures remains important from 24 to 72hpa, as axons visibly elongate, and that <italic>pbx3</italic> and <italic>meis1</italic> are important regulators of these processes based on their target gene accessibility profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E/F</xref>). Our model agrees with numerous findings that there is little proliferation after tail amputation prior to 48hpa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Contreras et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gaete et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Love et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pelzer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tsujioka et al., 2015</xref>) and with bulk RNA-Seq analysis showing a transcriptional upregulation of axonogenesis and other neuronal differentiation genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2017</xref>). Our analysis suggests that early changes in neural cell identity and distribution, as well as the genes driving them, may represent an important early phase of regeneration that precede proliferation. In other regenerative vertebrates, specifically the anole lizards and geckos, spinal cord regeneration is incomplete; it includes formation of new axons along an ependymal cell tube, but does not include proliferation of progenitor cells to make a complete spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duffy et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tokuyama et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). An interesting future direction would be to pursue whether program supporting axonogenesis may therefore have persisted in amniote lineages, where other features of complete spinal cord regeneration have been lost.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Neural cell types preserve their identities in the regenerating <italic>Xenopus</italic> tail</title><p>The identities of specific neural cell types are readily assigned to the same clusters both before and after tail transection in <italic>Xenopus</italic>. This agrees with recent single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the regenerating <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> tail and spinal cord, in which the majority of cell types can be clearly assigned at 1, 2 and 3 days after amputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aztekin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pelzer et al., 2020</xref>). The predominant model for vertebrate regeneration remains the axolotl limb, in which the formation of a morphologically undifferentiated mesenchymal blastema has been well characterized through morphological, histological, transcriptional, and single-cell analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Currie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gerber et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McCusker et al., 2015</xref>). In the axolotl limb, scRNA-Seq shows that different connective tissue cell types lose their unique transcriptional identities early in regeneration and converge on a similar signature, as the blastema forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gerber et al., 2018</xref>). While the early <italic>Xenopus</italic> tail regenerate has also been described as a blastema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gargioli and Slack, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tsujioka et al., 2015</xref>), its parallels to the axolotl blastema have been debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mochii et al., 2007</xref>), and our study confirms that diverse cell types retain well-discriminated transcriptional signatures as regeneration proceeds. This suggests that the molecular nature of the blastema may differ substantially between axolotls and <italic>Xenopus</italic>. In other regenerative contexts such as bone regeneration of the zebrafish fin, the formation of a blastema at the tip of each bony ray has been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Knopf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Münch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sousa et al., 2011</xref>). Global transcriptional responses to injury can therefore vary among regenerative vertebrate structures, which highlights the importance of multiple models for appendage regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Pbx3 and Meis1 are required for axon organization and for tail regeneration</title><p>We identify two transcription factors, Pbx3 and Meis1, as transcriptional regulators acting upstream of neuronal differentiation genes during regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). We show that these factors are both expressed in the regenerating spinal cord, with increased expression in motor neuron subtypes during regeneration. Loss of function of either factor results in disorganized neurofilament outgrowth with a failure of successful axial tissue regeneration. These factors are predicted to bind upstream of several dozen differentially accessible neuronal differentiation factors and are thus well-placed to drive the prioritization of neuronal differentiation we observe. Loss of either factor does not result in a failure to form neurofilaments, but does result in grossly disrupted organization of neurofilaments and reduced regeneration of the tail and spinal cord. Our data therefore suggests these factors may be critical for the proper re-formation and organization of differentiated neuronal structures. We note that even though the differentially accessible targets of Pbx3 are preferentially found at 72hpa, when proliferation is increasing, many targets of Pbx3 are shared with Meis1, and Pbx3 itself increases in expression in neuronal types by 24hpa. We therefore propose that Pbx3 and Meis1 contribute to the ongoing differentiation of neuronal structures from 24hpa to 72hpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Intriguingly, loss of either Pbx3 or Meis1 results in reduced tail regeneration overall. This may be due to interactions between regenerating nerves or neuronal structures and other axial structures, as regeneration of appendages has been shown to be nerve dependent in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Farkas and Monaghan, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Pbx3 and Meis1 may work independently or as part of a complex.

Post transposition, cells were removed from 37C and DNA was purified using the Qiagen MinElute kit (Qiagen 28206). DNA was eluted in 10 uL of buffer EB. Purified DNA was then amplified using the 2xNEB PCR Master Mix (NEB M0541L), a universal forward primer, and an indexed reverse primer from the i7 Illumina series. Initial amplification as follows: 72C:5 min, 98C:30 s, then 5 cycles of 98C:10 s, 63C:30 s, 72C:1 min. 5 uL of the initial PCR product was then used for a 15 µl side qPCR reaction to determine how many more cycles to run to stop amplification prior to saturation. The side reaction was carried out as follows: 98C:30 s, then 30 cycles of 98C:10 s, 63C:30 s, 72C:1 min. The number of cycles was determined by taking the range of the starting and ending CT values and dividing that number by 4, then identifying how many cycles the sample had gone through at the derived CT value.

Your article is being evaluated by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation is being overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor.</p><p>All of the reviewers find the manuscript interesting and think that it will be potentially very useful to the community. That said, they also raise substantial concerns that will require major revisions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Kakebeen et al., is addressing a fundamental question in developmental and regenerative biology. With the realization of human therapies for nervous system regeneration after spinal cord injury, it is important to understand the strategies for regeneration that nature has already solved. The advent of new techniques such as scRNAseq and ATAC-seq have generated opportunities to study changes in cell state and type in complex cell populations, which Kakebeen et al., has made progress with here. Considering the authors are addressing a classic question in regenerative biology using the latest techniques, they’re of great value to the study. Overall, the ATACseq and scRNAseq seem robust, but there are some significant flaws in the design of the study that limit the interpretation that can be made by the readers. These problems are described below.</p><p>1) The choice of <italic>pax6:GFP</italic> as the driver instead of <italic>Sox2</italic> is a major drawback of the paper, unless major reinterpretation of the data is performed. The impression made from the Introduction and Results is that the study focuses on all NPCs. Based upon previous literature, this is likely not the case. Pax6 plays a well-established role in determining the dorsal/ventral fate of NSCs in the developing spinal cord across vertebrates, namely the pMN domain, and is expressed in a restricted intermediate dorsal/ventral zone of the vertebrate spinal cord (Pituello, 1997; Reimer et al., 2009). The image in Figure 1B needs to be of higher quality in order to determine the expression pattern of the transgene, but it looks to be and is most likely expressed in a canonical fashion in the intermediate D/V zone of the spinal cord. I would suggest a thinner cryosection and a zoom in on the spinal cord specifically. Pax6 has also been associated with controlling cell cycle exit in neural progenitor cells towards differentiation (Bel-Vialar, Medevielle, and Pituello, 2007; Osumi et al., 2008), which should be kept in mind throughout the study. Also, canonical D/V pax6 expression is maintained in mature axolotl salamander spinal cords and dorsal/ventral position of NSCs mainly remain stable after spinal cord regeneration in the axolotl (McHedlishvili et al., 2007). Considering all interpretation of the manuscript is under the assumption that all NPCs are marked and differentiation is not specific to a D/V region, the interpretation is missing a lot of likely very interesting findings on pax6 function and D/V patterning during spinal cord regeneration. As is, it is difficult to interpret exactly what the cell population the <italic>pax6:GFP</italic> cells are labeling and what they are differentiating into during regeneration (see next statement).</p><p>2) It should be explained why cre/lox lineage tracing was not used in the study. As presented, it is unclear if the cell population that is being sorted is exclusively the NSCs or does it include the neurons they differentiate into. Based upon the gene families that were identified from ATACseq including genes involved in neuritogenesis and growth cone formation, it is likely the authors also sorted differentiated neurons or cells in the process of differentiating. It is known that GFP protein can last for days long after the transgene is not expressed. Use of a <italic>Sox2</italic> Cre driver <italic>Xenopus</italic> mated with a fluorescent cre reporter would have overcome the ambiguity of the cells that are being studied and provide a clear trajectory of NSC to differentiated cell types.</p><p>3) The in situ hybridizations in Figure 5 do not support the sequencing data. At stage 41, both genes look to be expressed in all mesodermal tissue such as muscle. In subsection “Gene regulatory network prediction reveals pbx3 and meis1 as candidate</p><p>regulators of neuronal regeneration”, it states &quot;Of these, pbx3 was the most restricted to the neural lineage (Supp. 3 E/G)&quot;. This is emphasized again in the Discussion. The in situ hybridization shows pbx3 is expressed throughout the mesenchyme of the regenerating tail at 48dpa. It will be important to perform cross sections of tissues to show expression in the expected domains, which will likely be the intermediate DV regions of the spinal cord (see new interpretations of pax6 cells above). I would suggest commercially available FISH such as hybridization chain reaction (molecularinstruments.com) or RNAscope that has higher resolution in the cellular level.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Kakebeen et al., (&quot;Chromatin accessibility dynamics and single cell transcriptomics reveal new regulators of neural progenitor regeneration&quot;) investigates the transcriptional changes in neural tissue accompanying tail regeneration in <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> tadpoles. The key findings are that (1) the initial transcriptional response promotes neuronal differentiation, followed within 3 days by an increase in expression of genes associated with cell proliferation; and (2) meis1 and pbx3 emerge as important regulators of the neural regenerative response. This first finding in particular is novel and challenges the fundamental assumption that cell dedifferentiation and proliferation are the initial steps in regeneration. The novelty and potential significance of these observations, together with the overall quality of the work, merit publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Moreover, the manuscript is very clearly presented, and the logical flow of the computational analyses is easy to follow.</p><p>I have two points of concern. The first is that, while the authors claim that pbx3 is predicted to be a key transcriptional regulator of the neural regenerative response, the results in Figure 5 indicate that only a very small proportion of neural cells express pbx3. (I found Figure 5E-5F somewhat confusing, and it may be that clarification of the figure legends will address this issue). If my understanding of these results is correct, however, then I suggest the authors revise the text, since, as written, it implies that pbx3 is critical to the entire regenerative response.</p><p>The second is in regard to the morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) experiments. The authors use two different MOs for each of the two targets, in lieu of a mispair control. While the pbx3 MOs lead to quite similar results, the meis1 MOs produce somewhat distinct phenotypes (compare Figure 5 C-D, 5W-X). This may be a sample size issue, or it may arise from the apparent greater effectiveness of MO1 vs MO2. Given the ongoing discussion regarding MO use, I would like to see the authors address this point in some way, either experimentally (e.g., a western blot comparing effectiveness of the two MOs in regulating endogenous pbx3 [Abcam has an antibody that works for mammalian species and zebrafish], but other strategies would be suitable) or via discussion in the text, which might also include results of computational comparisons to identify any other predicted targets.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Kakebeen et al. analyzed chromatin accessibility and single cell transcriptomes from pax6-driven GFP positive cells during <italic>Xenopus</italic> tail regeneration.

The impression made from the Introduction and Results is that the study focuses on all NPCs. Based upon previous literature, this is likely not the case. Pax6 plays a well-established role in determining the dorsal/ventral fate of NSCs in the developing spinal cord across vertebrates, namely the pMN domain, and is expressed in a restricted intermediate dorsal/ventral zone of the vertebrate spinal cord (Pituello, 1997; Reimer et al., 2009). The image in Figure 1B needs to be of higher quality in order to determine the expression pattern of the transgene, but it looks to be and is most likely expressed in a canonical fashion in the intermediate D/V zone of the spinal cord. I would suggest a thinner cryosection and a zoom in on the spinal cord specifically. Pax6 has also been associated with controlling cell cycle exit in neural progenitor cells towards differentiation (Bel-Vialar, Medevielle, and Pituello, 2007; Osumi et al., 2008), which should be kept in mind throughout the study. Also, canonical D/V pax6 expression is maintained in mature axolotl salamander spinal cords and dorsal/ventral position of NSCs mainly remain stable after spinal cord regeneration in the axolotl (McHedlishvili et al., 2007). Considering all interpretation of the manuscript is under the assumption that all NPCs are marked and differentiation is not specific to a D/V region, the interpretation is missing a lot of likely very interesting findings on pax6 function and D/V patterning during spinal cord regeneration. As is, it is difficult to interpret exactly what the cell population the pax6:GFP cells are labeling and what they are differentiating into during regeneration (see next statement).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added new cryosections of the posterior spinal cord at stage 41 to Figure 1, which more clearly show the domain of <italic>pax6:GFP</italic> expression (Figure 1C), as well as the overlap between this domain and <italic>Sox2</italic> protein expression (Figure 1D). These have highlighted that there is broad overlap between the GFP domain (which surrounds the central canal) and the <italic>Sox2</italic> domain. We note that some GFP positive cells can be detected across the D/V axis of the spinal cord, and that while GFP expression is weaker in the dorsal-most potion of the spinal cord, there are also few Sox2<sup>+</sup> cells that we could detect in this region and at this stage. Recognizing that the overlap is imperfect, we also have taken care to note in the text (both in the results for Figure 1 and in the discussion), that we may not have included every NPC in our FACS analysis, and to more precisely state that our findings apply to pax6+ NPCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It should be explained why cre/lox lineage tracing was not used in the study. As presented, it is unclear if the cell population that is being sorted is exclusively the NSCs or does it include the neurons they differentiate into. Based upon the gene families that were identified from ATACseq including genes involved in neuritogenesis and growth cone formation, it is likely the authors also sorted differentiated neurons or cells in the process of differentiating. It is known that GFP protein can last for days long after the transgene is not expressed. Use of a Sox2 Cre driver <italic>Xenopus</italic> mated with a fluorescent cre reporter would have overcome the ambiguity of the cells that are being studied and provide a clear trajectory of NSC to differentiated cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree a <italic>Sox2</italic> Cre driver would be a powerful tool, there is not currently a line resembling this available in <italic>X. tropicalis</italic>. Given the 6-8 month generation time of <italic>X. tropicalis</italic> in our own breeding colony and the 3-month interval required between ovulations of each potential founder female, as well as the approximately $25k in sequencing costs that would be required to recapitulate the study, creating these data anew was beyond the scope of what we could take on in this study. However, we have added high-resolution cryosections comparing the <italic>pax6:GFP</italic> domain with <italic>Sox2</italic> (NSC), Dcx (neurons) and neurofilament stains to better characterize the populations labeled (Figure 1D-F). These show that cytoplasmic GFP expression is in more medial cells of the spinal cord, as are the Sox2<sup>+</sup> nuclei, while neuronal markers localize more the spinal cord periphery. We have highlighted in the Results sections that while the domain of GFP expression accords best with <italic>Sox2</italic>, not every NPC may be captured in our study, and some neurons may be have been included (Results first paragraph). The population-level conclusions in our ATAC-Seq data are not changed, especially when paired by the analysis of specific neural cell population dynamics we present through scRNA-Seq analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The in situ hybridizations in Figure 5 do not support the sequencing data. At stage 41, both genes look to be expressed in all mesodermal tissue such as muscle. In subsection “Gene regulatory network prediction reveals pbx3 and meis1 as candidate</p><p>regulators of neuronal regeneration”, it states &quot;Of these, pbx3 was the most restricted to the neural lineage (Supp. 3 E/G)&quot;. This is emphasized again in the Discussion. The in situ hybridization shows pbx3 is expressed throughout the mesenchyme of the regenerating tail at 48dpa. It will be important to perform cross sections of tissues to show expression in the expected domains, which will likely be the intermediate DV regions of the spinal cord (see new interpretations of pax6 cells above). I would suggest commercially available FISH such as hybridization chain reaction (molecularinstruments.com) or RNAscope that has higher resolution in the cellular level.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided new <italic>in situs</italic> for <italic>meis1</italic> and <italic>pbx3</italic> in the new version of the figure (now Figure 6), and in particular have included cryosections to better show the spinal cord expression pattern in the tail, which spans a broad D/V domain (Figure 6G-J). A challenge of <italic>in situs</italic> for both factors is the very low overall level of their expression (which is likely a contributing factor to why they have not previously been identified in regeneration!) We think the new sections better show their expression in the uninjured context. Expression of both factors increases following injury, and the <italic>in situs</italic> at 24hpa and 72hpa more clearly show their localization in the spinal cord (Figure 6K-P).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>I have two points of concern. The first is that, while the authors claim that pbx3 is predicted to be a key transcriptional regulator of the neural regenerative response, the results in Figure 5 indicate that only a very small proportion of neural cells express pbx3. (I found Figure 5E-5F somewhat confusing, and it may be that clarification of the figure legends will address this issue). If my understanding of these results is correct, however, then I suggest the authors revise the text, since, as written, it implies that pbx3 is critical to the entire regenerative response.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the Results section and the figure legend for Figure 5 (now Figure 6) to better clarify the expression of these factors. Indeed, it is a relatively small proportion of neural cells that contain detectable levels of transcripts for these factors (it’s worth noting here that a larger proportion of cells may have some degree of expression, as scRNA-Seq captures only a fraction of transcripts for each cell). Because <italic>pbx3</italic> and <italic>meis1</italic> are expressed at low transcriptional levels and in only a small fraction of cells, we also find it impressive that they are both critical to a more extensive regenerative response. In the discussion, we speculate that this may be tied to the phenomenon of neural dependence, which has been described previously in multiple species, in which functional nerves are required for the ability of other tissue types to regenerate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second is in regard to the morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) experiments. The authors use two different MOs for each of the two targets, in lieu of a mispair control. While the pbx3 MOs lead to quite similar results, the meis1 MOs produce somewhat distinct phenotypes (compare Figure 5 C-D, 5W-X). This may be a sample size issue, or it may arise from the apparent greater effectiveness of MO1 vs MO2. Given the ongoing discussion regarding MO use, I would like to see the authors address this point in some way, either experimentally (e.g., a western blot comparing effectiveness of the two MOs in regulating endogenous pbx3 [Abcam has an antibody that works for mammalian species and zebrafish], but other strategies would be suitable) or via discussion in the text, which might also include results of computational comparisons to identify any other predicted targets.</p></disp-quote><p>a) We chose more representative images for <italic>meis1</italic> MOs, which better show the concordance of phenotypes between the two MOs (Figure 7—figure supplement 1C/E). We also noted that no off-target binding was predicted for any of the MOs used in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>b) We have added to our morpholino experiments by designing CRISPR guides for both <italic>meis1</italic> and <italic>pbx3</italic>. These guide RNAs phenocopied the morpholino results when injected with Cas9 protein (Figure 7—figure supplement 1G-N)</p><p>c) We attempted Western blot experiments for both Meis1 and Pbx3, but unfortunately were unable to see sufficiently strong bands for either protein to evaluate the degree of knockdown. This is likely because of the low and tissue-specific expression of both factors.</p><p>d) Finally, we used stage 41 tail vein injection of vivo-MO versions of <italic>pbx3</italic> and <italic>meis1</italic> MOs to bypass early embryonic effects (new Figure 7) (see responses to reviewer 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>1) The entire study is based on the assumption that pax6 is a general marker for NPCs prior to and during regeneration, and that pax6:GFP recapitulates endogenous pax6 expression throughout the time course of regeneration.

These show that <italic>pax6:GFP</italic> labels cells in a broad D/V domain that surrounds the central canal, much like <italic>Sox2</italic>, while differentiated neuronal markers (Dcx, neurofilament) label the periphery. In recognition of the possibility that we have not captured every NSC, or may have captured some differentiated neurons, we added additional text to the Results and Discussion sections (see also response to reviewer 1).</p><p>b) Our initial imaging of the transgene was imperfect due to autofluorescence and bleed-through from the cardiac actin:RFP label; new images better show that expression is neural-specific.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Even with a full characterization of the transgene, this reviewer is always concerned about drawing conclusions based on a single genetic tool.

To support the authors' conclusion that this boost in cell proliferation is indeed happening in the spinal cord, a marker for cell proliferation should be used in the pax6:GFP expressing tadpoles following tail transection.</p></disp-quote><p>We have generated a new data figure, Figure 5, that addresses these points.</p><p>a) We addressed the question of proliferation by adding quantification of PH3-positive cells to new Figure 5 Y-AA. Because the cell density in the spinal cord is low, PH3-positive cells were rarely captured in transverse sections, and so we used high resolution imaging to capture optical longitudinal sections instead, and looked for overlap between PH3-positive cells and the GFP domain (Materials and methods reflect accordingly). This analysis showed that mitotic cells are rare at 24hpa, and far more abundant at 72hpa (see particularly quantification data in new Figure 5AA). Although we did not have good tools to directly assay migration of proliferative cells in the spinal cord, we note that proliferative cells were rare in the spinal cord rostral to the injury site at either time point.</p><p>b) We also apologize strongly for the citation error, which has been corrected.</p><p>c) To address the question of neuronal differentiation, we elected to show the expression of several markers of differentiated neurons that our single-cell RNA-Seq identified. We chose 4 markers for this analysis, which all have strong expression in the regenerating neural ampulla at 24hpa (new Figure 5E, K, Q, W).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors followed up on their SCseq findings by performing functional analyses for meis1 and pbx3.

Therefore we had two of our MO sequences, one for pbx3 and one for meis1, resynthesized as tissue-permeable vivo-MOs. We optimized a tail-vein injection strategy to deliver these at late embryo stages and/or during regeneration. Both vivo-MOs cased a failure of the ventral intersomitic axons to properly elongate (new Figure 7C,D). During regeneration, these vivo-MOs resulted in reduced and mispatterned neurofilament staining in the regenerate when assayed at 72 hpa (new Figure 7E-G). Both vivo-MOs also resulted in reduced length of the tail and spinal cord, as well as a reduction in spinal cord area in the regenerate at 72hpa (new Figure 7K, L). (Results reported in the final paragraph of the Results section). We hope the reviewer will agree that this approach clarifies that Pbx3 and Meis1 are critical for proper regeneration, independent from their early embryonic functions, which we hope to further elucidate in a later study. As noted above in the response to Figure 2, we find it remarkable that the overall regeneration of the tail is impacted by the loss of function of these more specifically-expressed transcription factors, and speculate that this may be tied to the nerve dependence of regeneration, although a full interrogation of this connection is beyond the scope of the current paper.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions:</p><p>1) Subsection “Meis1 and Pbx3 are necessary for successful spinal cord and tail</p><p>regeneration” first paragraph: please add &quot;antibody&quot; after &quot;anti-neurofilament&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Edit was made.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The addition of Sox2 antibody staining and its overlap with pax6:GFP is informative.
